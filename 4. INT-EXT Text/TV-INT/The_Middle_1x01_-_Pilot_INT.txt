                                      PILOT ON P.A. (O.S.)
                    Folks, right now we're flying over
                    the great state of Indiana, if you'd
                    like to take a look.

      Not a single person so much as GLANCES out the window.

      RESUME SCENE 

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Well, look down next time, and you'll
                    see us, down here in the middle. 
                    Our state's in the middle of the
                    country and our town's in the middle
                    of two factories..


      A MICROWAVE BEEPS.  Frankie pulls out a frozen waffle.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (calling)
                    I made breakfast!  Let's go, let's
                    go!

      Morning chaos.  Frankie, dressed for work, is doing a million
      things, opening the mail from yesterday as she haphazardly
      pulls breakfast together.                                                                                          3.

      A slightly odd 7-YEAR-OLD BOY wanders through the kitchen,
      reading a book.  His pants are wide open, but he doesn't
      notice.  

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    That's Brick.  My husband and I read
                    in a magazine kids go farther in
                    life if they have interesting names. 
                    Turns out Brick's a cool name if
                    you're Paul Newman in Cat on a Hot
                    Tin Roof.  But if you're a weird
                      seven-year-old named Brick, it's
                    just an invitation for kids to throw
                    you through a window.

      Frankie zips up Brick's pants, hands him a waffle in a paper
      towel.

                                      BRICK
                    You know you're my hero, right Mom? 

                                      FRANKIE
                    That's sweet, honey.  Eat your waffle.

                                      BRICK
                          (taking a bite)
                    It's still frozen.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Then lick it.  It'll last longer.


      Frankie pounds on the bedroom door.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Elvis!  Breakfast!

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Elvis -- After Costello, not Presley -- 
                    My oldest -- used to be a straight A
                    student, varsity baseball...

      INSERT - STILLS of the smiling, wholesome boy engaged in
      various school activities.  

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But he'd been in a funk since this
                    summer when a teammate of his --
                    Dumb Darren -- you'll get it in a
                    minute -- thought it'd be cool to
                    play chicken with a cement truck.


      ELVIS comes out of his room, looking like the lead in a rat-
      pack movie... suit, skinny tie...

                                      ELVIS
                    Relax, baby.  It's cool.

      Frankie rolls her eyes, looks at a piece of mail in her hand.

                                      FRANKIE
                    My new driver's license.  'Bout time.

      She opens the envelope and looks at it, stunned -- shows it
      to Elvis.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey.  Is this what I look like?

      Elvis shrugs, yeah, and continues down the hallway.


      Frankie runs in, looks in the mirror... compares what she
      sees to the picture.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (under her breath)
                    Oh my God.  When did this happen?

      She fishes through the dresser drawer, pulls out a SHARPIE
      PEN, starts coloring her grey hairs with it.  Her husband,
      MIKE, 39, upstanding, Midwestern, but honest to the point of
      annoyance sometimes, watches her in the mirror.

                                    MIKE
                    You missed a spot.                                                                                        5.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (shows picture)
                    Mike.  Look at this.  It's been seven
                    years since I got my last license
                    picture taken.  All this time I
                    thought I looked basically the same --
                    you know, same hair, same basic
                    features.  But look at this one,
                    compared to my old one.  You see
                    that?

      CLOSE ON

      The two licenses side by side... one hopeful and smiling...
      the other, well... haggard.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                      Something's different.  It's in the
                    eyes.  I think what is missing...
                    what is it exactly?  Oh, right.  I
                    know what's missing -- it's hope.

                                    MIKE
                    Well, sure.  Back then you were all
                    young and shiny, wondering what your
                    life was gonna be and now, well...
                    now you know.

      She takes this in.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Does it ever bum you out?  You know,
                    that I'm not all young and shiny
                    anymore?  That my body's starting
                    to, you know... go?

                                    MIKE
                          (shrugs)
                    Yeah.  Sure, it's a huge bummer. 
                    But what are ya gonna do?

      Frankie swats him on the arm.  He laughs.

                                    SUE (O.S.)
                    Mo-om! 

      SUE, 14, unremarkable in her averageness, comes in carrying
      a pair of destroyed leg warmers.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Sue -- why aren't you dressed?

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    You heard right.  "Sue."  Our success
                    names?  Only got two out of three. 
                    But it was a promise Mike had made
                    to his grandma on her deathbed.                                                                                        6.

      FLASHBACK -- THE DEATHBED

      Mike's unbelievably gnarled GRANDMA reaches out and GRABS
      them with her bony fingers.

                                      GRANDMA
                          (barely a whisper)
                    Sue.

      And she dies.

      RESUME SCENE

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, Sue was living up to
                    the curse of her average name.

                                    SUE
                    The washer ate my leg warmers.  I
                    need 'em 'cause... guess what?  I'm
                    trying out for Show Choir this week!

      FREEZE on Frankie and Mike's look of dread.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    See that expression?  That is not an
                      expression parents should have on
                    their faces when their daughter tells
                    them she's trying out for something. 
                    But see, Sue had a long history of
                    things she tried out for... 

      FLASHBACKS -- QUICK CUTS

      - Sue trying out for swim team.  She swims a few strokes,
      then stops to wipe her eyes, swims a few more strokes, stops
      to wipe her eyes...

      - Sue trying to be elected for student council.  She speaks
      so softly and weakly, nobody can hear a word.

      - Sue trying out for gymnastics.  She jumps over a pommel
      horse and lands flat on her back, unconscious.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    If only she'd been named Cassandra
                    like I wanted.

      RESUME SCENE

      UNFREEZE Frankie and Mike who instantly plaster smiles on
      their faces.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Show choir?  Super.  That ought to
                    be fun to try out for.                                                                                          7.

                                    SUE
                    I wish you would have told me about
                    the washer.  My leg warmers are
                    ruined.  

                                      FRANKIE
                    Mike, I thought you were going to
                    fix that thing.

                                    MIKE
                    It's unfixable.  
                          (with a grin)
                    Just like you, Frankie.  Used to be
                    all shiny and new and now the old
                    girl's just worn out.

      CLOSE ON FRANKIE, looking in the mirror.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    He thought he was being cute, but
                    that drivers license thing had hit
                    me like a ton of bricks.  I looked
                    like I'd been hit by a ton of bricks. 
                    But who or what had done this to me?


      Frankie crosses through, EYEING THEM ALL with suspicion.

                                      ELVIS (O.S.)
                    Hey, Mom -- this waffle's still froz --

                                      FRANKIE
                    Lick it.


      Mike sits behind a desk pushing papers.  A sign behind him
      reads "NUMBER OF DAYS WITHOUT A WORK-RELATED INJURY: 0"


      The place hasn't changed decor since the 60's.  Brown
      paneling, paintings of ducks and geese on the walls.  Frankie
      and the SALESMEN are opening their monthly paychecks.  PETE,
      40's, THE KING OF SALES, a paunchy Midwesterner, opens his
      and smiles widely.

                                    PETE
                          (feigning modesty)
                    Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  What a month,
                    huh?

      But Frankie, distracted, is looking at her paycheck in
      disbelief.  It's so low.


      Guns, animal heads, Hoosier basketball posters stare at
      Frankie from all sides.  MR.  EHLERS, 60'S, brush-cut, a
      good ol' boy looks at her check, slides it across the desk
      back to her.

                                    MR. EHLERS
                    Ain't nothing wrong with the check,
                    Frances.  That there is your base
                    salary.  And that's what it's gonna be
                    until you sell a car and get a
                      commission.  One week left in the month. 
                    You sell a car, or we may have to...
                      reevaluate. 

                                      FRANKIE
                    Well, you know, sales is a new skill
                    I'm learning, and I have come real close.                                                                                        9.

                                    MR. EHLERS
                          (re: head on wall)
                    See that moose up there?  He came real
                    close to not being hit by a bullet. 
                    You see what I'm saying?

                                      FRANKIE
                    Yes, I --

                                    MR. EHLERS
                          (shaking his head)
                    I don't get it.  All the articles
                    I've read say women want to buy cars
                    from other women.  That's why I went
                    against all judgment and hired one. 
                    You have the opportunity here to carry
                    a torch for all ladykind, or burn the
                    whole deal down.  It's up to you.

      Frankie can't believe this guy, but knows she has to be civil.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Wow.  Lotta responsibility.  I'm
                    kinda like the Rosa Parks of Ehlers
                    Ford, huh?

                                    MR. EHLERS
                    Rosa Parks.  Don't even get me started
                    on her. 
                          (then)
                    And by the way, you ever get your
                    new driver's license?  We've got to
                    post them and that old one didn't
                    look a thing like you.

      Frankie reluctantly shows him the new one.

                                    MR. EHLERS (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah.  Now that's you.


      Frankie, feeling the pressure, is reeling in a potential car-
      buyer, MR. YAMAMOTO.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Now, you're gonna want to get this
                    car by the end of the month, because,
                    and I'm not supposed to even tell
                    you this...  after the first the
                    price is gonna go way up.  On account
                    of the rising rubber prices overseas. 
                    Now I'll just get the keys and what
                    say we take your new car here on a
                    test drive?

      Frankie crosses to the back to get the key, hears the aging
      P.A. system.                                                                                         10.

                                    P.A. (O.S.)
                    Frankie, you have a call on line one. 
                    Your son's school is on line one.

                                      FRANKIE
                    No, no, no... not now, not now.

      She picks up the wall phone.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    This is Frankie.  Is everything okay?


                                    MIKE
                          (into phone)
                    Dammit.  Well, you said you were
                    picking him up.

                                      FRANKIE
                    No, Mike, you said you were --


      Pete, seeing Mr. Yamamoto all alone, moves in for the kill. 
      Through the window, we see Frankie notice.  She starts
      knocking on the glass, wildly gesticulating, no, no!  She
      shoots Pete a stern mom look that makes him step back.


      Frankie and Mr. Yamamoto are on the test drive.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Sorry about the little delay. 
                      Everything's fine.  Anyway, take a
                    right up here... you see how smooth
                    it takes the turns?  This model's
                    won awards for handling.  Now, you're
                    gonna go all the way down to the
                    next street and take a quick left --
                    if you're not sure if you can afford
                    to purchase the vehicle at this time,
                    we do have many great leasing plans
                      available... get in the right lane
                    aaaand -- Pull over right here!
                          (leaning out window)
                    Get in!  Get in!                                                                                        11.

      And Brick scrambles into the back seat with his backpack. 
      As they pull away from the school, Mr. Yamamoto is startled,
      but Frankie makes like this is nothing unusual.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Brick, honey?  How do you like those
                    seats?

                                      BRICK
                    They're amazing.  They also come
                    with optional leather trim and
                    Preferred Suede inserts.

      She and Brick look at Mr. Yamamoto, sellin' it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Frankie and Brick sit staring out the window drinking out of
      Ford mugs, as in the foreground, Mr. Yamamoto PEELS OUT in
      his own car.  Brick puts his hand on Frankie's knee.

                                      BRICK
                    At least you're still my hero.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Yeah, thanks.


      Frankie and Brick come in, DUMP a bunch of McDonald's on the
      table.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (calling)
                    I made dinner!

      The rest of the family ambles in.  Elvis tries to grab his
      food and take it to his room.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, Dino!  Where do you think you're
                    going?

                                      FRANKIE
                    We may be coming home late all the
                    time, but we are a family, and we
                    are eating together as a family!

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      The entire family is lined up on the couch, eating their
      McDonald's on TV trays and watching Dancing With the Stars.                                                                                          12.

      They all eat silently, but when the commercial comes on,
      Frankie grabs the remote and mutes.

                                      FRANKIE
                      Commercial!  Okay, quick let's hear
                    about everybody's day.

                                    SUE
                    Well... I'm trying to decide what
                    number I should do for my show choir
                    audition.  I'm between --

      The whole family shoots each other the familiar LOOK OF DREAD.  

                                    SUE (CONT'D)
                          (noticing)
                    What?

                                      ELVIS
                    Does it really matter what song you
                    pick?  There's no way you're gonna
                    make it.

                                    SUE
                    Mom!

                                      FRANKIE
                          (glaring at Elvis)
                    Your brother just means you should
                    choose whatever song you like.

                                      BRICK
                    You have a meeting with my teacher
                    Monday.

                                      FRANKIE
                    What?

                                      BRICK
                    It's imperative that you both be
                    there she says.  
                          (whispering the word
                          to himself)
                      Imperative.

                                    MIKE
                    Who's he whispering to?  Why does he
                    do that?
                          (to Brick)
                    I told you to knock that off.

                                      BRICK
                    I like it.  It soothes me.

                                      FRANKIE
                    What kind of teacher meeting?  We
                    never got any note.                                                                                          13.

                                    MIKE
                    If it was important they'd have sent
                    us a note.

      Brick spits out a chewed up wad of paper he hadn't been aware
      he was chewing, gives it to them.  This kind of thing happens.

                                    SUE
                    You are so weird.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (reading it)
                    Great.  It's Monday.  I gotta work
                    Monday.

                                    MIKE
                    I can't get off either.  Let's just
                    call Mrs. Whatserface and tell her
                    we need to reschedule.

                                      FRANKIE
                    It's late.  We have no way of getting
                    in touch with her now.

                                      BRICK
                    Sorry.
                          (whispering to himself)
                    Sorry.
                          (to Mike, re:
                            whispering)
                    Sorry.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (kissing his head)
                    It's okay, we'll figure it out. 
                    Elvis?  How was your day?

                                      ELVIS
                    Well, it was -- 

                                    SUE
                    Next commercial!  Next commercial!

      Frankie quickly UNMUTES... the family instantly turns their
      attention back to Dancing With the Stars, and we...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Mike's got his head in the washing machine, trying to fix
      it.  Frankie sits on the dryer handing him tools.

                                      FRANKIE
                    I am so hot for you when you fix stuff.  

                                    MIKE
                    I'm not just man-candy you know.  I
                    have a brain, too.                                                                                          14.


                                      FRANKIE
                    Ooh. Candy.
                          (rifling through
                            cabinets)
                    I think I hid some in here from
                    Halloween when I told the kids it'd
                    rot their teeth.

      She finds it, tosses some to Mike, who's feeling under the
      washer.

                                    MIKE
                    Uh-oh, didn't Brick lose a hamster a
                    while back?  False alarm, just lint. 
                          (then)
                    Frankie, I don't think I can fix
                    this thing.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Well, look on the bright side, if
                    you get a raise or I sell a car we
                    can just barely not afford to get a
                    new one.

      They laugh.  Sue appears in the doorway in her pajamas.

                                    SUE
                    Are you guys disappointed in me? 
                    You know, that I never make anything?

                                    MIKE
                          (utterly without sarcasm)
                    Sure I'm disappointed, honey.  This
                    is the twelfth thing you're trying
                    out for.  I'm beginning to wonder if
                    it's you, if it's me.  Something I
                    did...?

      Frankie shoots him a look that says maybe this isn't the
      best way to handle this.

                                    SUE
                    I'm thinking maybe I won't try out
                    for show choir... if you don't think
                    I should.

      Frankie and Mike share a look.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Of course she shouldn't.  I mean,
                    show choir in Indiana is huge.  Next
                    to basketball, its combination of
                    singing and dazzling Broadway-caliber
                      choreography is the most cutthroat
                      competition around.

      QUICK CUTS of STOCK FOOTAGE OF different Indiana show choirs
      singing and dancing to such classics as "Mr.  Bojangles,"                                                                                         15.

      "We are Family"... "Aquarius." (Think theme park -- flipped
      hair, sequins... too much makeup)

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I didn't want to see her get hurt
                    again. 

      CLOSE ON Sue's oh so average self, absently picking at her
      braces.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But then I looked at her face, and I
                    thought about my driver's license,
                    and how you really only even have
                    hope 'til you're thirty.  What had
                    happened to me would happen to Sue
                    one day, but I was damned if I was
                    gonna rush it.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (deep breath)
                    Go for it.  

                                    SUE
                    You really think so?  
                          (then)
                    Dad?

                                    MIKE
                    This could be your year.

      She hugs them both, runs out.  As soon as she's out of
      earshot:

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Here we go again. 
                          (shaking his head)
                    You know, everyone's always saying
                      sticktuitiveness is a virtue.  But
                    maybe the real virtue's knowing when
                    to cut bait.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Well, maybe this time'll be different.  

                                    SUE (O.S.)
                          (singing weakly and
                            off-key)
                    "This is the dawning of the Age of
                    Aquarius, the age of Aquariu-us..."

      Mike sticks his head back in the washing machine as the
      painful singing continues.

                                      FRANKIE
                    You got room in there for one more?

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        16.

                                        ACT TWO


      The family's filing out, but Frankie kneels in her own private
      prayer.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Dear Lord, I know in your infinite
                    wisdom, there was a reason Sue didn't
                    make swim team, or band, or 4-H, or
                    art club... which frankly seemed
                    weird because everybody gets in to
                    art club.  But please, please let
                    her make show choir.  Thank you.

      She starts to get up, then:

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and please let the washing machine
                    hang on a little longer.

      She starts to get up again, then:

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and -- No, you know what, I've
                    got a bunch of stuff, but I'm just
                    gonna stick with those two for now. 
                    Amen.

      And she gets up and continues down the aisle.


      The entire family sits staring in front of the TV with plates
      in their laps, watching Desperate Housewives.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Frankie and Mike sit at a little table with Brick's teacher,
      MRS. RETTIG, a giant woman in a sweater with applique
      scarecrows on it.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    I'd gotten an hour off work for
                    Brick's teacher meeting by telling
                    Mr. Ehlers I had "woman problems." 
                    Not the most creative in my arsenal,
                    but in a pinch you can't beat the
                    classics.

                                    MRS. RETTIG
                          (delicately))
                    Brick... is a very "quirky" child. 
                    Maybe... clinically quirky, even.

      Frankie and Mike just look at her.

                                      FRANKIE
                    We have no idea what you mean.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    We knew exactly what she meant.

      QUICK CUTS

      A series of Brick's odd behaviors

      - Brick talks close and loud into A KID'S face.  The kid's
      recoiling.

      - Brick walks to the bathroom pulling down his pants before
      he gets there, as KIDS snicker.                                                                                        18.

      - A group of KIDS focused on MRS. RETTIG talking, as Brick
      faces the opposite way, reading the school supply catalogue.

      RESUME SCENE

                                    MRS. RETTIG
                    He's a very bright boy, reads
                      everything he can get his hands on,
                    but the other kids don't really know
                    how to relate to him.  He gets this
                    look a lot.

      She cocks her head to the side, perplexed.

      QUICK CUTS

      One after another, different kids look INTO CAMERA, head
      cocked, perplexed.

                                    MRS. RETTIG (CONT'D)
                    He doesn't seem to mind, but I feel
                    Brick could benefit from a series of
                    more formal tests... to see if we
                    can help him... integrate.  Our "S
                    is for Special" Success Team is here
                    as a resource --

                                      FRANKIE
                    Yeah, okay.  You know, Brick may not
                    be like everybody else, but he's
                    funny and sweet and probably a genius
                    who's gonna cure diseases or invent
                    a new kind of wrench or something
                    and just because he's not fitting
                    into some cookie cutter mold doesn't
                    mean something's the matter with him
                    that needs fixing.  Our oldest son
                    had a completely pointed head until
                    he was six -- 

                                    MIKE
                          (nodding)
                    Like a candy corn.

                                      FRANKIE
                    And sure people stared at us in
                    WalMart, but you know what we did? 
                    We knit him a hat, let it be, and it
                    flattened out all on it's own.

      All three hundred pounds of Mrs. Rettig is staring.

                                    MIKE
                    I think what we're trying to say is
                    thanks for your concern, but our
                    Brick doesn't need any special
                    anything.  He's fine.                                                                                        19.


      Frankie and Mike are on their way out.  They walk past the
        "gymeteria," look in.

      THEIR POV

      Lunchtime chaos.  Brick sits all alone, his back to everyone,
      eating a sandwich.  They go over and Mike physically TURNS
      BRICK AROUND so he's at least facing other kids.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey buddy, don't you want to play
                    with some of those boys?  Looks like
                    they're having fun.

                                      BRICK
                            (nonchalant)
                    No thanks.  I have my backpack to
                    keep me company. 

      They see his backpack is indeed propped up across from him. 
      They share a look -- Ouch.  

                                    MIKE
                          (sotto)
                    So how much we talking here for this
                    testing?

                                      FRANKIE
                    More than the commission on a
                      hatchback, but hopefully not as much
                    as a SUV.


      QUICK CUTS 

      Frankie urgently trying to sell a car day after day, her
      enthusiasm waning with each effort.

                                      FRANKIE MONDAY
                    Hi!  I'm Frankie --  

                                      FRANKIE TUESDAY
                    What'll it take to put you in this
                    car today?

                                      FRANKIE WEDNESDAY
                    How can I put you in this car today?

                                      FRANKIE THURSDAY
                    I'd like to put you in this car today.

                                      FRANKIE FRIDAY
                    ... You feel like getting in this
                    car today?                                                                                        20.

      ANGLE TO REVEAL Frankie is now talking to a somewhat frumpy
      woman in her 40s, GAIL.

                                    GAIL
                    Oh, well, I don't know --

                                      FRANKIE
                    You know what?  Forget it.  You're
                    either gonna buy a car or you're not
                    and me hounding you isn't gonna make
                    one hell of a difference.  Just flag
                    me down if you have a question, okay?

      Frankie starts to walk away.

                                    GAIL
                    Actually, I am interested in this
                    car.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Oh yeah?

                                    GAIL
                    Yeah, mine keeps breaking down.  But
                    I was just wondering if a convertible
                    is too wild for me?

                                      FRANKIE
                    Are you kidding?  Wild on the outside,
                    but dependable on the inside.  See,
                    this has a V-8 --

                                    P.A. (O.S.)
                    Frankie.  Call on line one.

                                      FRANKIE
                    -- engine.  You're not going to be
                    spending time --

                                    P.A. (O.S.)
                    It's your husband.  

                                      FRANKIE
                    -- in the shop with --

                                    P.A. (O.S.)
                    He sounds mad.

                                    GAIL
                    Do you need to take that?  I can wait.

                                      FRANKIE
                    You sure?  I'm sorry.

      Frankie marches over to the wall phone.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    What?                                                                                        21.

                                    MIKE (O.S.)
                    You gotta pick up Brick.

                                      FRANKIE
                    No.  Today is definitely your day. 
                    Remember, I wrote it on your hand.

                                    MIKE (O.S.)
                          (annoyed)
                    I know that, but I'm in the
                      principal's office right now.  Elvis'
                      principal.  And no, he's not hurt...
                    yet.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (glancing at Gail)
                    Oh, man.  I just... I can't leave
                    right this second.  Tell Brick to
                    stay put and I'll get there as soon
                    as I can.
                          (to Gail, hanging up)
                    Sorry.

      Frankie notices the King of Sales circling nearby.

                                    GAIL
                    Look, I can always come back another
                    day.  I'll wait for you.
                          (with a smile)
                    I'm a mom too.  I know what it's
                    like.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Ohhh, thank you.

      She hugs her, takes off, and we:


      Frankie enters, with Brick in tow.  Mike is in the process
      of laying into Elvis.

                                    MIKE
                    What the hell's the matter with you? 
                    You're dressing like a moron, you
                    gave up baseball -- and probably a
                      scholarship -- and now this?!

                                      FRANKIE
                    What'd he do?


      Elvis is crouched on the bathroom floor, running a floating
      craps game for money.                                                                                        22.

      RESUME SCENE

                                    MIKE
                    Oh, I didn't even tell you the best
                    part.  He missed a test while doing it!  
                          (to Elvis)
                    You think you're getting into a
                    college this way?  Huh?  Do ya?

                                      ELVIS
                    I don't care.

                                    MIKE
                    Fine.  You like gambling?  You like
                    broads?  Here's your punishment -- You're
                    spending every day after school playing
                    canasta with your great aunts Ginny and
                    Edie.  For a month.  Got it, Dino?

                                      ELVIS
                    You know why I dress like this? 
                    'Cause the Rat Pack knew how to live! 
                    What do you want me to do -- live my
                    life in the same boring way you two
                    do, then get hit by a cement truck?! 
                    I don't want to live my life like
                    that!  I don't want to be you!

      And Elvis storms to his room.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (yelling after)
                    Yeah?  Well, I don't want to be me
                    either!

      Elvis' door SLAMS.  A beat.  

                                    MIKE
                          (shaking his head)
                    Damn it.  And he's the one we don't
                    need to worry about.  

      Frankie puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                      BRICK
                    Mom, you're my superhero.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (preoccupied, forgot
                          he was there)
                    Okay, that's sweet, honey,  but we're
                    kinda --

                                      BRICK
                    You'll need a costume.
                          (then whispering)
                    Costume.                                                                                        23.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Huh?

                                      BRICK
                    I'm doing a book report on Superwoman. 
                    It's a comic serio-novel from Harcourt
                    Press, Copyright 2001 and you have
                    to come dressed up like Superwoman
                    so I can show and tell you as part
                    of my project.

                                      FRANKIE
                    And when all is this report supposed
                    to take place?

                                      BRICK
                    Sometime Monday, I think.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Dammit, Brick, you can't do this
                    anymore!  You have to tell me these
                    things earlier!

                                      BRICK
                    I did!  I've been telling you all
                    week you're my superhero!  Didn't
                    you listen?!

      Brick bursts into tears and runs out to the backyard.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Brick, I didn't mean it!  Don't cry -- 
                    Brick!

                                    MIKE
                    Let him be.

      She sits down next to Mike.  They both feel like crap.

                                      FRANKIE
                    You know what?  I don't need a fancy
                    house, or a good car, or professional
                    hair color... but I pride myself on
                    the fact that I think I'm a pretty
                    good mom.  But lately... I don't
                    know.  And if I'm not at least a
                    good mom... then my driver's license
                    picture is right.  There is no hope.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, I don't wanna hear that.  You
                    are a great mom.  Sure, Brick's weird,
                    Sue has no recognizable talent and
                    Elvis is flushing his future down
                    the toilet.  But that's not our fault.                                                                                        24.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Then whose fault is it?

                                    MIKE
                    Our parents and their lousy genes.

      Frankie laughs despite herself. Just then, Sue bursts in the
      front door, full of excitement.

                                    SUE
                    I did it!  I made Show Choir!

      Mike and Frankie stare, shocked and skeptical.

                                      FRANKIE
                    You did?

      FREEZE ON THEIR INCREDULOUS EXPRESSIONS.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Again.  The faces?  Not good faces
                    for a parent to make.

      UNFREEZE.

                                    SUE
                    Yes!  And they already rotated me in
                    and I've got to learn everything
                    super quick for our first competition
                    on Friday.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (hugging her)
                    Well, God, Sue... this is huge!

                                    MIKE
                    C'mere girl.  I am proud of you.

                                    SUE
                    Thanks, Dad.  I better get my homework
                    done 'cause I am going to so busy!

      Sue floats to her room.  When they hear her door close, Mike
      and Frankie look at each other in amazed disbelief -- break
      into a happy parent dance.

                                    MIKE
                          (chanting)
                    Who's awesome?

                                      FRANKIE
                    We're awesome!  Yeah, yeah, we're
                    awesome!

      They're feeling pretty good about themselves.  In their
      exuberance, Mike lifts Frankie up on top of the washing
      machine, just as it kicks into shaking mode.                                                                                        25.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Oooh... who needs a new washer.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    And right then and there I felt the
                    presence of God.  Maybe this was the
                    ray of hope we were waiting for. 
                    Finally we were turning a corner.


      SPOTLIGHT ON a slightly made-up MALE CHOIR DIRECTOR.

                                      CHOIR DIRECTOR
                          (into mic)
                    And now ladies and gentlemen... from
                    Jasper County High School, under the
                    direction of Roger Stagge... the
                    Jasper Swingsations!

      Lots of applause and cheers especially from Frankie and Mike
      who are looking pretty darn proud.  Elvis looks like he's
      being held prisoner and Brick's reading a book... 

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                      I couldn't believe Sue had made it. 
                    I mean, this was the closest thing to
                    glamour you find in Jasper, Indiana.

      ANGLE ON the JASPER SWINGSATIONS taking the stage.  Overly
      made-up blondes with flipped hair in Lawrence Welk-ish sparkly
      dresses and boys who don't yet realize they're gay in silky
      red shirts and jazz pants dance on while singing the swinging
      classic, "Ballin' the Jack".

                                      JASPER SWINGSATIONS
                    "First you put your two knees close
                    up tight; Then you sway it to the
                    left and you sway it to the right..."

      Frankie scans the stage, then concerned, whispers to Mike.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Do you see Sue?

      Mike scans the stage.                                                                                        26.

      PAN ACROSS the line of singing and dancing girls.  None of
      them Sue.

                                    MIKE
                    No.  Where the hell is she?

      ANGLE ON the stage as just then, CREW MEMBERS dressed in
      black appear on the side of the risers to hand out bowler
      hats to the performers.  And there in the darkness is Sue.  

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                          (realizing)
                    ... She's on the crew?

                                      ELVIS
                    Great.  The only thing more
                      embarrassing than show choir is being
                    on the crew for show choir. 

                                      FRANKIE
                    You're dressed like Dean Martin and
                    gambling in the john so I think you've
                    lost the right to talk about embarrassing!

      ON STAGE a GIRL begins her solo.  A big-haired SHOW MOM leans
      over and whispers to Frankie.

                                      BIG-HAIRED SHOW MOM
                    That's my Brittany.  Where's yours?

                                      FRANKIE
                          (vaguely indicating
                          no one in particular)
                    She's that one.

                                      BIG-HAIRED SHOW MOM
                    Which one?

                                      FRANKIE
                          (same motion)
                    Over there.

                                      BIG-HAIRED SHOW MOM
                    Where?

                                      FRANKIE
                    She's in the wings, holding the stool,
                    okay?!

                                      BIG-HAIRED SHOW MOM
                    Oh.

      Frankie turns back to Mike.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Why didn't she tell us she was only
                    on the crew?                                                                                        27.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't know.  She does look really
                    happy though.

      Frankie looks.

      ANGLE ON Sue.  She does look happy -- she's smiling while
      she finishes collecting the hats.  As the show choir "takes
      it down" and launches into their schmaltzy sign-language
      version of "Where is Love?"  Sue runs out alone and places
      stools on the stage.  Seeing Sue so excited does something
      to Mike.  He nudges the big-haired mom.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Hey.  That's my daughter.  That's my
                    daughter right there!  
                          (jumping to his feet
                          and applauding)
                    Go Sue!

      Frankie stands and joins him.  They're hooting and hollering,
      nudging Elvis and Brick to join in.  Everyone around them is
      giving them strange looks, but they don't care.  This is
      Sue's moment, and dammit they're going to give it to her.

      ANGLE ON the stage, where Sue hears them.  She looks at them
      from the stage, and smiles proudly -- it's a sweet moment. 
      Until the girls who are performing back up to sit on the
      stools only to realize too late (thanks to Sue being
      distracted) that THE STOOLS ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

      One girl FALLS HARD ON HER ASS... the other tries to save
      herself by GRABBING A NEARBY GIRL... they BOTH GO DOWN, which
      starts a CHAIN REACTION, all the Swingsations going down in
      a tangle of red shirts and dresses.

      Frankie and Mike cringe in horror.


      The family rides home from the concert in silence.  Sue glares
      at Frankie, as only a teenager can.

                                    SUE
                    This is all your fault!

      And on Frankie's reaction, we...

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        28.

                                      ACT THREE


      Frankie sits up in bed and looks at her reflection in the
      mirror across the room.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    No wonder my face looks the way it
                    does.  The Swingsation disaster had
                    gotten Sue kicked off crew and sent
                    us right back into the dumper. Our
                    good times had lasted one week.

      She FLOPS back down into the bed.  Suddenly, Brick's there
      poking her.  

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    So when Brick said it was the day of
                    his book report, I'd had it.  I did
                    what any self-respecting parent would
                    do... 

      She throws back the covers.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I put on my Spanx and went.

      VARIOUS SHOTS OF Frankie trying to squeeze into her Spanx.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    What could I do?  He's my kid... his
                    best friend is a backpack.  I couldn't
                    undo the twenty-seven hours he'd
                    spent in the birth canal, but I could
                    do this.


      The kids sit on the carpet listening to Mrs. Rettig, who now
      wears a sweater with applique apples on it.

                                    MRS. RETTIG
                    ...Now the rainforest is made up of
                    three levels -- the canopy --

      Frankie, dressed as Superwoman, walks in.  The kids and
      teacher turn and stare at her surprised.

                                    MRS. RETTIG (CONT'D)
                    Oh.  That's next Monday.

      The kids start to snicker and laugh.  Frankie, feeling
      horrible for Brick, frantically tries to save the situation.                                                                                        29.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (powerful Superwoman
                            voice)
                    I command you all to stop laughing!

      A beat as they all look at her, then start laughing harder
      than ever.  

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Brick --

                                      BRICK
                    Just go, Mom!  You're embarrassing
                    me.


      Frankie trudges down the hallway, deflated.  Underneath her
      costume, her Spanx suddenly roll down to her hips, causing
      an unflattering bulge.  At least no one noticed -- no one
      but the cute male gym teacher walking toward her. Great. 
      She tries to tug them up when her phone rings.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?

                                    MR. EHLERS (O.S.)
                    Frankie?  Ehlers here.  A woman named
                    Gail Spreen is here to buy a car and
                    is requesting you.  I told her Pete
                    could --

                                      FRANKIE
                          (panicked)
                    No!  That's my customer!  Don't let
                    her move!  I'll be right there!

      She runs out the door, pulling up her tights.


      Frankie, now in a dress, is in the passenger seat taking
      Gail for a test drive.  Desperate to sell the car, she's
      letting the stress get to her, and it shows.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (manic)
                    -- and the braking system.  Did I
                    forget about the brake system?  I
                    can't forget the brake system.  It
                    has twin-piston front calipers which
                    means these are the best brakes the
                    Mustang has ever had --

                                    GAIL
                          (gently)
                    Frankie.  Are you okay?  You seem a
                      little...stressed.                                                                                        30.


                                      FRANKIE
                          (stressed)
                    What?  No, I'm fine.  I'm perfect. 
                    Where was I?  Air bags!  How could I
                    forget air bags?

                                    GAIL
                    You know, I'm a mom too.  I know
                    what it's like to balance work and
                    kids.  I've got three.

                                      FRANKIE
                    I've got three too.

                                    GAIL
                    Isn't it hard?

      Frankie looks at her.  She can't help herself, but under the
      exhaustion, this moment of kindness is more than she can
      take and she starts to cry.

                                      FRANKIE
                    So hard!  I feel like I'm spread so
                    thin I can't do anything right.

                                    GAIL
                    I know.  Some days I swear I just
                    feel like getting in the car and
                    driving and driving and never coming
                    back.  You ever feel like that?

                                      FRANKIE
                    Only every day.

      They smile at each other a conspiratorial smile.


                                      FRANKIE
                          (laughing)
                    Hey, you want to see something?  You
                    want to see what I did for my kid's
                    book report?

      She unbuttons her dress to reveal the Superwoman costume
      underneath.                                                                                        31.

                                    GAIL
                    Oh my God!

                                      FRANKIE
                          (laughing)
                    And then it wasn't even the right day!

      Gail laughs.  Frankie feels amazing.  She whips off the dress,
      stands in the car and waves it in the air.  The wind pulls
      it from her hand -- and it flies away!  Frankie's surprised,
      but then laughs and continues to feel the wind in her hair,
      her cape billowing behind her.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, baby!

      BUMP!

                                    GAIL
                    What was that?

                                      FRANKIE
                    I don't know.  Did we hit something?

      Gail stops the car.

                                    GAIL
                    Is there something wrong with this
                    car?  Maybe you better check.

                                      FRANKIE
                          (climbing out)
                    I'm sure it's fine.

      She gets on her knees on the road and crouches down to peer
      under the car.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't see anything --

      But before she can finish, the car SCREECHES AWAY, Gail behind
      the wheel stealing it!

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey!

                                    GAIL
                          (yelling back)
                    Sorry!  I've got three kids in jail!

                                      FRANKIE
                    Wha --?
                          (calling)
                    You'll never get away with this!  I
                    have your license back at the office!
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        32.

                                      FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                          (then realizing)
                    I bet that's not even her real
                    license.  The picture was too good.

      Frankie stands in the middle of the cornfields with nothing
      but her Superwoman costume, stunned.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


                                    MIKE
                    Wanna grab some dinner?

      Frankie nods.  They ride quietly for a beat.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Tomorrow I'd have to deal with the
                    stolen car, and getting Sue back on 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        33.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    crew.  But right then... I just wanted
                    potato skins.

      Frankie looks at her family.

                                      FRANKIE
                    I love you guys, you know.

                                    SUE
                    We know, Mom.

      A beat.  Elvis looks up, their eyes meet in the rear view
      mirror.  He gives a little nod.  She accepts.  Brick just
      reads his book.  Frankie looks at Mike. 

                                      FRANKIE
                    Hey.  How come you never tell me you
                    love me?

                                    MIKE
                    I told you I loved you the day I
                    married you.  If anything had changed,
                    I'd have let you know.

      He puts his hand on Frankie's knee, gives it a squeeze. 
      Frankie smiles.  Good enough.
