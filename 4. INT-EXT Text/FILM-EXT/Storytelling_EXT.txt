It is bright and sunny.
Marcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to
console.
VI
Marcus, wait up!
Marcus stops.
MARCUS
What do you want?
VI
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
MARCUS
What the fuck are you talking
about? What's OK?
VI
(beat)
You know he hated my story also.
MARCUS
Your story was terrible!
He moves on, she keeps up with him.
VI
Marcus...You'll write something
better next time!
MARCUS
Patronizing fuck! If you had just
been honest with me in the first
place I wouldn't have read it. I
knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I
believed you!
VI
That's not fair! I was honest!
Just because I wasn't sucking up
like 	that bitch Catherine.
MARCUS
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice
your opinion in there when it
mattered.
VI
I admit it - I was scared! I was
shocked, in fact , by what he
said. And he's so...convincing.
I'm sorry if I let you down, but
really, I still say he's just
one opinion. I don't even like his
books that much. They're all so
aggressively confrontational. I
don't care if he's won the
Pulitzer Prize.
Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.
MARCUS
You just want to fuck him. Like
Catherine and every other white
cunt on campus.
He leaves her.
Students hang around outside. Vi goes inside.
Mr Scott and Vi walk together in silence.
Lights are out.
It is bright and shiny.
MR. DEMARCO (V.O.)
Do you have any hobbies?
The sprinkler system is still on.
A red sports car drives up front. Esposito, Brady's buddy, drops off
Brady and Cheryl, Brady's cheerleader girlfriend.
A cleaning woman walks along the sidewalk on her way to the bus stop.
BRADY
I'll talk to you later, man!
ESPOSITO
Yo, dude!
CHERYL
Thanks, Esposito!
The lights are on.
TOBY (V.O.)
You see, we're trying to do a film
on suburban lifestyles...
It is bright and sunny.
Toby and Mike are interviewing Brady and Cheryl in the driveway. Off to
the side, Mikey tries hypnotizing a cat.
TOBY
So are you surprised that Scooby
took the SATs after all?
BRADY
Not really. He's kind of a wuss.
TOBY
OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were
you surprised?
CHERYL
I dunno. Whatever.
TOBY
Hmm.
BRADY
Hey, how come you drive such a
shitty car?
CHERYL
Yeah.
TOBY
(joins their laughter)
I don't know...That's interesting,
though. A cool car. Is that
something that's real important to
you, Brady?
BRADY
Yeah.
CHERYL
Uh duh.
While Stanley goes down on Scooby, the camera pans away from Scooby to
reveal Marty and Fern being burned at the stake in the front yarn,
writhing and screaming in agony.
MARTY
I'm so sorry! I should never have
made you take the SATs!
The camera then pans to reveal Conan O'Brien approaching.
CONAN
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
SCOOBY
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you
doing here?
CONAN
I'm looking for a last-minute
guest for my show. Any
suggestions?
SCOOBY
I'll be your guest!
CONAN
Really? Well, all right! Let's
take a look at the television and
see how we look.
The camera pans to reveal a TV standing on the lawn.
SCOOBY
Cool!
Conan turns on the TV and we move inside it to see Conan and Scooby
sharing some talk-show patter and repartee.
CONAN
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
SCOOBY
Thank you.
CONAN
Nice to have you here.
SCOOBY
Great to be here.
CONAN
And thank you for dressing up for
us. This is very classy. Tell us.
What kind of professional plans do
you have? What's in your future?
SCOOBY
Well, I was thinking...I might
work for you.
CONAN
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to
do for me? What's your idea?
SCOOBY
Be your sidekick, you know, and
maybe eventually become a TV talk-
show host.
CONAN
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at
sidekick eight seconds ago, then
TV talk-show host. You'll be a
Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Audience laughter.
CONAN
Let's see what they think of the
first idea. I'm curious
what the audience thinks. Folks,
what do you think: should Scooby
be my new sidekick?
Audience cheers.
CONAN
Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!
Bigger round of applause.
A football scrimmage is in progress. A play ends, and the Coach comes
on to the field, barking:
COACH
Esposito, What the fuck do you
think you're doing? You're
tackling like a bitch
on my football team, son! You
gotta bend your ass over and hit
somebody! You understand me?
ESPOSITO
Yes, sir!
COACH
You understand me?
ESPOSITO
Yes, sir!
COACH
Then do it!...Livingston! That's
the way to hit that hole, son!
Brady waves a Cheryl in the stands.
COACH
We're gonna become a football team
today, guys! Let's move the ball!
Move! Move! Move! I wanna see you
hit those holes! Defense, fill
those goddam gaps! Let's go, guys!
Let's do it!...
On the next play Brady runs to catch a pass, but is moved down by
Esposito
shouting, 'KILL HIM!!!'
Cheryl jumps up, alarmed.
O.S. cheerleaders finish their 'Go Bucks!' cheer, but Brady doesn't
rise.
A couple of maids are walking by with white babies in strollers.
Scooby watches Toby and Mike as they try fixing their jammed camera.
MIKE
Damn, Toby
This thing won't open
again.
TOBY
Let me try it, let me try it.
(takes camera from Mike)
It's um
The button is just stuck.
SCOOBY
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering
Is
the documentary almost finished?
TOBY
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
SCOOBY
Can I see what you have so far?
TOBY
Sure
um
yeah, as soon as I have a
screening I'll let you know.
SCOOBY
Thanks man.
Consuelo exits the house and trudges towards the bus stop, carrying all
her belongings. Other cleaning women are waiting for the bus as well.
Scooby drives his Mom's shiny new SUV to New York.
Scooby pulls into a spot.
Scooby hurries outside only to find his car stolen.
Marty talks to Toby poolside as he prepares a barbecue.
MARTY
I think Scooby's like a lot of
kids. He just hit a
a speed bump.
Now he's gonna find his way, his
path is gonna be cleared, and I
think he's gonna continue his
education at a good college. And
everybody else is gonna be happy.
TOBY (O.S.)
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a
bit fearful that Scooby will be
confronted with hollow values and
systemic conformism?
Pause.
MARTY
I don't know why this is so hard
for you to comprehend. I had a
terrific time in college. I've got
a terrific job, a comfortable
salary, terrific wife, three
terrific kids
and every year I
give to the alumni fund. Now why
are you trying to make college out
to be a bad thing, a negative
experience? You were unhappy?
Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop
trying to impose your misery on
others by going around saying,
'Life is bad, life is horrible.'
Life is tough on you? Well, boo
hoo!
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE
...laughing.
Scooby talks to Toby in the Backyard, Marty seen in the distant
background.
SCOOBY
...Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a
goofball. I just have to pretend
to go along with his ideas. 'Cause
he really doesn't get it: like I
could be the next Oprah, for all
he knows, but he's never even seen
the show.
ANGLE ON SCOOBY
...watching himself on screen
ON VIDEO: NEW ANGLE ON SCOOBY
...as he continues talking to Toby.
TOBY (O.S.)
What is most important to you?
SCOOBY
I dunno. I'd like to be good at
something. It doesn't have to be
TV. I mean, it could be
movies...Anything. I'd be willing
to direct.
The audience laughs.
SCOOBY
But I'd like to be, you
know...famous. Not necessarily a
superstar, just famous. Be
recognized. Get fan Mail.
Things...
ON VIDEO: TIGHTER ON SCOOBY
...still talking to Toby.
TOBY (O.S.)
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how
you want to be a TV talk-show host
and all, like Conan O'Brien, but
did you know even he went to
college?
SCOOBY
He did?
TOBY (O.S.)
Yeah. He went to Harward.
SCOOBY
(beat)
Oh.
ANGLE ON SCOOBY
...watching the film and listening to the audience. The laughter is out
of control. He is devastated.
Consuelo approaches the house stealthily.
ANGLE ON FINGERS
...opening the back of the house;
stuffing towels under bedroom doors;
turning on the kitchen stove's gas;
switching on the main gas valve in the boiler room.
Consuelo flees.
A very long pause.
FADE TO BLACK.
Scooby gets off the bus with a few cleaning women. He walks homewards.
Scooby sees reporters, policemen, firemen, ambulances, gas company
vehicles, and neighbors surrounding his house.
Toby and Mike suddenly appear with their camera trained on him.
ON VIDEO
TOBY (O.S.)
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so
sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
SCOOBY
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
