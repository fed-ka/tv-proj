		Ladies and gentlemen, good
		citizens of Metropolis, let us
		all welcome Superman to our fair
		city!.
			(applause)
		He came to us a stranger, but his
		good deeds have not gone
		unnoticed.  As last year's
		recipient of the Key To The City,
		I an honored to pass it on to our
		newfound friend.

	The Deputy Mayor puts the Key around Superman's neck and the	(X)
	crowd erupts in APPLAUSE.  All encourage a speech from him and
	Superman shyly steps up to the microphone.

	Photographers, Jimmy included, rush the stage to get a picture.
	A blast of flash bulbs invades from every angle.

		No. The airport, Asabi.  I'm in

	Lois is still trying to get Superman's attention, but to no

10	AS THE MOB CROWDS THE STAGE	10

	Superman slips away, turns a corner.  A beat later he hears 	
	something... something disturbing ... something coming after
	him.  He ducks behind the nearest door, walks inside an
	abandoned storefront, but seconds later the door bursts open
	behind him.  He turns, his eyes wide with fear.  He looks up
	for an exit, but the ceiling is low and there are no windows.
	The "thing" is getting closer now.  What could it be?  What
	could scare Superman?  An alien from another planet?  A pre-
	historic monster from another era?  A terrorist with a rocket
	launcher?  Nope.  It's the...

	passes by Clark, then swivels on her heel, sits on his lap, and
	kisses him full on the mouth.  When she finishes...

				HELENE
		To be perfectly honest, we don't

		For the past several years he's

		So... you and your husband were

		No, not really.  I mean, we never

		We've been married twenty-seven

	Helene has said this by way of explanation.

				LOIS
		What happened the night he left?

		Well, he hadn't touched his
		dinner so I came down looking for
		him.  He wasn't here, but I saw
		that door over there suddenly
		open.

	The fashionable, high-priced jewelry salon has several

	closing time; the clock on the wall reads 5:45. The rain is
	coming down hard outside and we can hear distant THUNDER.

	Suddenly, the FRONT DOOR OPENS BY ITSELF. Then, a GUN APPEARS,
	FLOATING IN MID-AIR, AND A DEEP VOICE:

				INVISIBLE VOICE (BARNES)
		Okay, everybody, down on the

	Salespeople and customers exchange astonished glances. The
	voice is now harsher, screams its order...

		You! Lady! I said get down!

	A Young Woman, holding the hand of her Toddler Son, is roughly
	pushed to the floor by an invisible force.  She starts to shake
	and cry, clutching the Toddler to her tightly.  The other
	customers, just as terrified, quickly hit the ground as well.
	We now watch as the GLASS ENCLOSED CASES ARE SMASHED BY THE
	BUTT OF THE GUN, and the GOLD JEWELRY FLOATS IN MID-AIR AND

	shroud of cloth that reflects the overhead light strangely.
	Clark pockets it.

				HELENE
		A few hours after the news vans

				LOIS
		Has your husband ever been

				HELENE
		You think it was Alan?  Never.
		He wouldn't hurt a fly.  Really.
		If there was a fly in the

		Uh, well...

				LOIS
		I mean, in order to let someone

		So, as soon as you reveal

	The expressions on our people are mixed, but generally,
	miserable. Cat stands, hands on hips, miffed.  Lois, looking
	at Superman looking at his future date, is inconsolable.
	Luthor, insanely jealous, covers wi. his most charming persona
	as he strolls up to Lois, takes and kisses her hand.

				LUTHOR
		A pleasure to see you again,

	Clark wakes with a start, TEN INCHES OFF HIS FUTON BED. He
	DROPS DOWN like a stone. He sits up, breathing hard, unable to
	shake the nightmare, finally begins to calm as we...

					WIPE TO:


64	INT. LOIS' APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT	64

	in the light of a THUNDER CRACK we see Lois sleeping soundly,
	her arms wrapped around a pillow.  A beat later she wakes with
	a start when she hears someone KNOCKING on her front door.  She
	sits up, looks at the time, shakes her head.  The KNOCKING
	continues.  Lois throws the covers off, grabs a robe, puts it
	over her pajamas and exits the bedroom.


65	INT. LOIS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS	65

	Lois walks into the living room.

				LOIS
		All right, already! I'm coming.
			(ear to the door)
		Who is it?

	No answer. Lois, immediately suspicious, stands quietly by the
	door.  The knocking has ceased.  She waits a moment before
	putting the chain on and opening the door a crack.

66	INT. LOIS' HALLWAY OUTSIDE HER APARTMENT - HER P.O.V.	66

	Nobody there.


67	INT. LOIS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME	67

	Lois now removes the chain, opens the door wide, steps into the
	hallway.  Not a sign, a package, a note, nothing.  She shrugs,
	walks back inside, shuts the door.  Lois goes into the kitchen,
	opens the refrigerator door, takes out a bottle of milk.

				INVISIBLE VOICE (MORRIS)
		Lois Lane?

	Lois whirls toward the sound of the man's voice, grabs for a
	knife from her utensil jar.

				LOIS
		Who's there?  I've got a...
			(now seeing it's not a
			 knife but a spatula)
		... weapon.

		Jimmy... where are you?  If this
		is your idea of a joke...

		It's no joke. It's just me...

68	INT. LOIS LANE'S APARTMENT --LATE NIGHT	68

	The storm, for the moment, has eased. Lois, still in her robe	(X)
	and pj's, and Clark Fit facing ALAN MORRIS, who quietly tries
	to explain.

				ALAN MORRIS
		I was the invisible Robin Hood,
		but I'm not the one doing all
		these bad things. There's
		another invisible man out there!

	Lois and Clark exchange looks.  Lois leans in to him.

				LOIS
		Alan, let's start at the
		beginning. Why?

				ALAN MORRIS
		It's very simple, Ms. Lane. I
		became invisible to become
		visible again.

				LOIS
		I'm not following.

				ALAN MORRIS
		Well, at some point, I don't know
		when exactly, years ago, I
		just... disappeared. I went to
		work every morning, did the same
		thing. I drifted apart from my
		friends.  Helene and I stopped
		talking. I guess, she lost
		interest in me.  I became so
		invisible in my own life, that I
		decided to do it for real. I
		started experimenting.

				CLARK
		Where did you get the idea for
		the suit?

				ALAN MORRIS
		From a florescent light bulb.
		A florescent light bulb turns
		invisible light into visible
		light. I reversed the process.
		It took me fifteen years to build
		a working suit.

	Alan lifts the thin, shiny, metallic suit beside him.  He hands
	it to Lois, who studies it carefully, holds it up.

				LOIS
		How come I can see it?

				ALAN MORRIS
		Because it hasn't been activated.
		There are switches in the
		interior lining.
			(beat)
		Go ahead.  Try it on.

	Lois, still skeptical, puts on the hood but leaves the
	faceplate open.  Morris presses the activation switch.  A
	second later her head disappears.  ALL WE SEE ARE TWO EYES
	STARING BACK AT US.

				LOIS
		I knew it wouldn't work.

	Clark smiles, turns back to Alan as Lois removes the hood.

				ALAN MORRIS
		Somebody must have stolen my
		other suits.  I made several back-	(X)
		ups.

				LOIS
		Someone did break into your
		basement.

				ALAN MORRIS
			(suddenly concerned)
		Helene?

				LOIS
		Don't worry.  She's fine.

	Alan emits a noticeable sigh of relief, then...

				ALAN MORRIS
		Will you help me stop whoever's
		doing this?

				CLARK
		It's not going to be easy.
		Invisibility is an incredible
		advantage.

	Alan nods.  Lois walks over to the window, shakes her head.

		Superman? on I don't think
		so.
			(beat)
		Alan, I think you'd better come

		thing is resolved.

	Lois walks then to the door.

				LOIS
		I'll be over in the morning.

	Clark and Alan step into the hallway.  Clark turns back to say
	goodbye, notices that Lois' robe has come undone, and now,
	clearly visible for the first time, are her pajamas.  They're
	red, yellow and blue, with, you guessed it, the familiar "S" on
	the front.  Clark shakes his head.

				CLARK
		Lois.  Not you, too.

	Lois looks down at her pajamas, quickly re-fastens her robe,
	shoves Clark out the door.

					CUT TO:


69	INT. CLARK KENT'S LOFT - NIGHT	69

	Clark's loft is sparsely furnished, but the book shelves are
	filled and the artifacts on the walls give the place an
	international flavor.  Clark puts a blanket and pillow down on
	his futon-sofa.  Alan sits on it.

				CLARK
		I hope you'll be comfortable
		here.

				ALAN MORRIS
		Thanks.  This'll be fine.

	Clark walks into the sleeping area of his loft, divided only by
	an ancient Japanese screen, then returns carrying a fresh
	shirt.  He removes the one he's wearing, starts to put on the
	new one.  Alan shyly notices the super-build of his host.

		You don't have any idea what it's

	Clark takes a moment before responding.

		You'd be surprised, Alan.  I'll bet

	A Man, the same man that we saw watching Mrs. Morris on TV, 
	and still wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a trench coat, stands in 
	the shadow of a lamp post, under the pouring rain.  As he steps
	into the light, he stands right beside a Wanted poster on the 
	lamp post, with his likeness on it.  The man is HENRY BARNES.

				CLARK
		Mom, I know it's for a good

	A visible Lois and Alan now stand before a visible Barnes and

	Barnes nods and his gang begins to exit the vault room.  When 
	they've gone, Barnes begins to close the door, turns to smile at 
	Lois.

				HENRY BARNES (CONT'D)
		By the way, did you know this room is

	Lois bangs on the door, screams, looks around for another exit --
	there is none. Alan, Lois, and the two guards sit close
	together.  Lois tries to muster a valiant smile to keep all of
	their spirits up, but the air is already getting thin. 
	Disconsolate, Lois utters her earlier words with complete
	disgust.

		'Danger is my business.'

98	EXT. FORT METROPOLIS - SAME TIME	98

	Detective Burke, the Metropolis Police and their equivalent-to-
	SWAT-team have surrounded the massive old building perimeter.
	The fort door opens.  The police are at the ready, but do not
	see the ARMY OF INVISIBLE MEN who come out.  An over-anxious
	SWAT team member FIRES.

				BURKE
		Hold your fire! They may have
		hostages.

	But, it's too late. The invisible gang starts firing back.
	Burke and his squad are at a terrible loss, being shot at, but
	unable to return the fire.  Then, from above, a rain of a
	finely-ground, powdery substance begins to fall over the whole
	area.

	As the powder coats him, he becomes visible: the suit glows

	Superman stands there, emptying the last of a pile of sacks

	Lois, Alan and the Guards are gasping for air.  They can't make

				LOIS
		Superman... where are you?

	Just then, Superman crashes through the concrete wall to the
	vault room.  Suddenly Lois is in superman's arms.  The police
	are right behind, taking out the injured guards and Alan.


103   EXT. FORT METROPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER	103

	Superman, carrying Lois, exits the building just as Henry

		I can't.
