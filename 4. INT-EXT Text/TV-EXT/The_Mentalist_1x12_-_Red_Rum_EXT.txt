      TIGHT ON A CROW -- it swivels to stare at us.

      The crow is perched on a TV aerial on a roof in old fashioned 
      blue-collar Boonville, California.  A church spire in the 
      middle distance.  Trees, rolling hills.     

      Cody Elkins' MISSING PERSON FLYER is nailed to every 
      telephone pole on the street.  We hold a beat on Cody's face: 
      an All-American, freckle-faced sixteen-year-old posed for a 
      school photo. 

      Along with a couple local PD cruisers, two CBI vehicles are 
      parked curbside.  JANE and LISBON have just arrived.  RIGSBY 
      and VAN PELT are there to give them the rundown as they walk 
      down the street... 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Kid's name is Cody Elkins.  Sixteen 
                    years old.  Reported missing two 
                    days ago.  Turned serious enough to 
                    call us when the local police found 
                    this, two streets away in the 
                    gutter.  

      He holds up a baggy containing a boy's sneaker, close to box 
      fresh except for a big red-brown stain. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    It's the kid's shoe, his blood 
                    type.  We're waiting on the DNA, 
                    but we figure we got an abduction, 
                    and potential homicide, which makes 
                    it a CBI case.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    The parents are Michael and Janice, 
                    both clean.  Another son named 
                    Brad, fourteen.  They run the 
                    flower store here.  Cho's with them 
                    now.

      Van Pelt points out a FLOWER AND GIFT STORE -- a converted 
      gas station just down the street.  We see CHO with MICHAEL 
      and JANICE ELKINS inside.

      JANE'S POV:  He notes THREE LONG-HAIRED LITTLE KIDS -- eight, 
      nine and ten-years-old, all in black like hard-core skaters.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        1A.

      They're standing on the other side of the street staring at 
      the flower store, two bikes lying beside them.  














































                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        2.

      They look oddly sinister.  As Lisbon and Rigsby turn to walk 
      into the Elkins' store, Jane hangs back.  

                                  JANE
                    I'll wait out here.  

      Lisbon shrugs, used to his mercurial ways.  She and Van Pelt 
      and Rigsby enter the store.

      Jane very casually picks up a billiard ball size rock off the 
      ground and strolls across the street, angling  toward the 
      three kids.  As soon as they show signs of moving off at his 
      approach, Jane stops.  He shows them the rock in his hand.  
      Throws it high up in the air.  The kids follow the rock's 
      flight up and down.  Jane catches it without looking.  Does 
      it again, higher this time.  And again, only this time, the 
      rock doesn't come down (because he dropped it in his pocket 
      and mimed throwing it), and by the time the kids look back at 
      Jane, puzzled, he's standing right next to them.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hi.  

      They make a half-hearted attempt to go for their bikes, but 
      Jane is already there.  Holding one of the two bikes by the 
      handlebars.  It's a pink girl's BMX bike.  Complete with 
      tasseled grips.  

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, nice bike. 

      The kids are well aware of the shameful appearance of the 
      bike and aggrieved by Jane drawing attention to it.  The 
      eldest of them tries to take back the bike.

                                  KID #1
                    Yeah.  Ha ha.  Give it.

      Jane doesn't give it.

                                  JANE
                    A boy's got to be anxious to get 
                    somewhere to ride a bike like this.  

                                  KID #1
                    Huh?

                                  JANE
                    You didn't ride a pink bike through 
                    town to come look at a store.  What 
                    did you come to see? 

      All three kids sense this conversation is not going well for 
      them and the younger two back away slightly.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        3.

                                  CLYDE (KID #1)
                    Give it!

                                  JANE
                    Where's Cody Elkins? 

      Quick anxious glances between the younger two children tell 
      Jane and us that they know something.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I know that you know where he is.  

                                  KID #2
                    Let's go, Clyde!

                                  JANE 
                    You don't need to tell me out loud.  
                    Just look in his direction.

      The youngest of the kids, just for an instant, looks past the 
      flower shop. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (pointing)
                    That way?

      Clyde looks daggers at the little kid...

                                  CLYDE
                      Samatterwityou?

      ...Which confirms the hint.  Jane's POV:  Looking across the 
      street, to the trees seen from a distance, behind the flower 
      shop.  Which takes on a slightly sinister vibe.  A MOB OF 
      CROWS circle in the sky above treetops a quarter mile away.  

                                  JANE 
                    Thanks.

      Jane hands the bike back to the oldest kid, who replies by 
      giving him the horned devil sign with his left hand, and 
      muttering a curse under his breath.  Then the three children 
      speed away toward town, the youngest standing with easy 
      aplomb on the extended axle rods of the non-pink bike.  Jane 
      watches them go as Lisbon approaches.

                                  LISBON
                    We're bringing the Elkins back to 
                    their house.  

      In the BG, Van Pelt and Rigsby EXIT the flower shop.  Cho 
      escorts Michael and Janice Elkins to the CBI vehicle.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        4.

      Lisbon gestures to the kids, disappearing on their bikes.

                    What was that about?

                                  JANE
                    I have a pretty good idea where 
                    Cody Elkins is.

                                  LISBON
                    Sharing is good.

      JANE'S POV: A copse of trees, the tops of which peek out over 
      the rooftops at the end of the street.  Crows circling.

      As Jane leads Lisbon, Van Pelt and Rigsby through the 
      trees...

                                  LISBON
                    What makes you think he's here?

                    There's pine trees all over around 
                    here.

      Jane stops, looks up. 

                                  JANE
                    But these trees have crows.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    So?

                                  JANE
                    Crows are carrion birds.  They eat 
                    dead things.

      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and Van Pelt move through the trees, 
      searching, finally coming upon a dappled sunlit grove.  They 
      all look down at the dead body of CODY ELKINS.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ah jeez...

      Cody's lying on the ground at the foot of a tree as if posed 
      in a coffin, his hands crossed over his chest.

      FADE IN:


      While Van Pelt watches a pair of CORONER'S MEN put the body 
      on a gurney, Rigsby addresses a posse of UNIFORM COPS as they 
      systematically search the area for clues.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Number one, we're looking for a 
                    murder weapon, but anything you 
                    find, anything at all, bag it and 
                    tag it.

      The dead boy's arm hangs over the side of the gurney.         
      Van Pelt gently takes the boy's hand, and places his arm 
      gently across his chest. 


      As Lisbon, Cho and Jane exit the Elkins house, Lisbon is on

      An ordinary little ranch house.  

      Lisbon, Cho and Jane go to the front door.  No bell.  A 
      goat's head door knocker.

                    Pretty much. 

      With that, Lisbon KNOCKS.  No answer.  She looks down.  The 
      patio slab is adorned with a pentacle inside a circle.  They 
      are standing in its center.  She gestures to it.

                                  LISBON
                    Another bad sign.

      JANE'S POV:  the three long-haired Kids from the teaser are 
      standing on the other side of the road watching them.      
      Jane pretends not to see them, and turns to Cho and Lisbon, 
      and talks as if they were stalking deer.

                                  JANE
                    Don't look at them now, but I think 
                    those kids may know where Tamzin 
                    Dove is.  

                                  LISBON
                    What kids?

      Jane looks.  They've vanished.  There's no sign of them. 

                                  JANE
                    Damn.

                                  LISBON 
                    Same kids you saw at the Elkins?

                    Yes.

                                  COACH
                    Yeah.  Right here.  Nine A.M.    
                    For some serious fumble prevention 
                    reps.  He never showed. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    We heard you and he had serious 
                    words Friday night.

                                  COACH
                    Yeah.  We did.  Cody had a shameful 
                    game.  Zero TDs, two fumbles, five 
                    blown routes, and a personal foul 
                    for fifteen yard penalty.  He let 
                    himself down and he let his team 
                    down.  Been his m.o. lately.  
                    That's why we were meeting Saturday 
                    morning.  Get him back on track.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Shameful?  That's kind of harsh,

                    freakin' clue how it is between a

                    I doubt it.

                    We looked into your history, Mr. 
                    Dieter.  Five years ago, you lost a 
                    high school coaching job in Oregon, 
                    for inappropriate physical contact 
                    with students.

                    You make that sound like I'm a sex 
                    molester or something.  I smacked a 
                    couple kids needed their attitudes 
                    adjusted and their pantywaist 
                    parents made an issue of it.

                                  COACH
                    There was no charges filed.

                                  VAN PELT

      Jane gestures for Cho and Lisbon to enter.  Lisbon does.  Cho

      Tamzin moulds a rough little paper man out of old newspapers

                    Killing spells are secret.  But 
                    this is a public binding spell that

      SHE LIGHTS THE PAPER DOLL ON FIRE with a candle, and as it

                    your magical powers along with a 
                    blunt instrument.  In which case 
                    you're as unmagically guilty as

                    If a friend of mine had done this,

                    police right to me with the 
                    pentacle and fire.  Cody's murder 
                    was staged to look like Wicca.  Any 
                    fool in this town would think of 
                    it.  It's obvious misdirection.  
                    There's a witch in town.  Duh.

                    Exactly.  It's perfect.

                    she wants the attention.  Quicker 
                    and more efficient if we ignore 
                    her, and let her come to us.

                                  JANE
                    That's very astute psychology, 
                    Lisbon.  I'm impressed.

      Lisbon lightly smacks him backhanded for his patronizing 
      manner.  Cho does the same thing, harder for his own 
      reasons...

                                  CHO 
                    Why'd you give her my name?
                    She said I was going to kneel 
                    before the Lord of Beasts.  What 
                    does that even mean?

      Jane realizes Cho's serious.

                                  JANE 
                    Come on, you're not telling me you 
                    believe she's a real witch?

                                  CHO 
                    No, of course not.  But I mean,   
                    if dark forces did exist, stands to 
                    reason there could be people who 
                    control them for their own ends.

                                  JANE 
                    They're called investment bankers, 
                    and they don't live around here.  
                    There's no such thing as witches. 

                                  CHO
                    Easy for you to say.  A weird woman 
                    in black didn't burn you in effigy 
                    and bind you to her power.

      They get into the car...



      As the CBI vehicle drives down the street, past the flower 
      shop, we PRELAP:

                                  CHO (O.S.)

                    That's scary.

                    her first sleepaway camp.  

                                  CHO
                    You had to be there.

                                  RIGSBY
                      Seriously, don't sweat it.  We had 
                    a witch at my college.  It's not a 
                    satanic cult.  They're nerds in 
                    cloaks.  

                                  CHO
                    There he is.

      Cho's pointing out the window at DANIEL BROWN, (16) exiting 
      school.  A backpack hangs off his shoulder.

      Rigsby and Cho get out of the car, come up on Daniel.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Daniel Brown.

      As Rigsby and Cho flash their BADGES...

                                  CHO
                    CBI.  We've got some questions 
                    about Cody Elkins.

      But Daniel suddenly does an about-face and in true form, 
      Daniel dodges both Rigsby and Cho, as if he's making his way 
      down the field, runs back toward the street.  

      Rigsby and Cho TAKE OFF after him, giving chase down the road 
      when a PANEL TRUCK approaches AT SPEED.  The truck brakes 
      hard, and swerves to a stop, narrowly missing Cho, forcing 
      him to jump out of the way. 

      Rigsby tackles Daniel Brown down to the neighbor's lawn.   
      Kneeling, Cho starts to help Rigsby cuff him.

      The audience sees before Cho and Rigsby do that the panel 
      truck -- large in BG -- has A PAINTED LION ALONG THE SIDE, 
      WEARING A CROWN -- and a caption that reads: KINGSLY CARPET 
      CLEANERS.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why'd you run, Daniel?

                                  DANNO
                    Let me go.  Let me go!

      Cho stops dead and stares at the lion.

      Cho's pointing at the truck.

      Cho gazes at the lion in something like awe.

      Jane and Cho walking toward the Elkins house. 

                                  CHO
                    You have to admit it's uncanny.  
                    The Lord of the Beasts?

      They go to the Elkins' front door.  

                                  JANE
                    Life is a million to one.  The 
                    universe is one big coincidence.

      Jane RINGS the DOORBELL.


      Where he finds Brad crouched in a WOODEN PLAYHOUSE that's 
      long since gotten too small for him.  Jane crouches down to 
      say hello.

      an interior wall of the playhouse.)

                    flocking around, for what?  Running 
                    and jumping and catching things.

      The Elkins' car pulls over at the bankside.  We now reveal
