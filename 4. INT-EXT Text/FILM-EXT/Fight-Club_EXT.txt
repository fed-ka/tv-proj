Jack heads for the front door.
Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.
He
walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.
JACK (V.O.)
Every evening I died and every
evening I was born again.
Resurrected.
CUT BACK TO:
Marla walks out,
The support group's dispersing.
Jack
exits amongst them.
He spots Marla walking away.
JACK (V.O.)
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I
couldn't cry.
So, once again, I
could not sleep.
Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.
He walks away.
Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.
JACK
We'll split up the week.
You can
have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
MARLA
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking
doesn't go over at all.
JACK
I think testicular cancer should be
no contest.
MARLA
Well, technically, I have more of a
right to be there than you.
You
still have your balls.
JACK
You're kidding.
MARLA
I don't know -- am I?
Jack follow Marla into...
Jack follows, bewildered.
JACK
You... left half your clothes.
HONK!
Jack starts.
Marla's led him into the street with
traffic barreling down.
Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
BLARING.
Jack dashes, following...
Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...
JACK
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
numbers?
MARLA
Should we?
JACK
In case we want to switch nights.
MARLA
I suppose.
Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
back, hands it to her.
She takes the pen, grabs his hand
and writes her number on his palm.
She walks into the
street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.
She turns,
holds up the card.
MARLA
It doesn't have your name.
Who are
you?
Cornelius?
Mr. Taylor?
Dr.
Zaius?
Any of the stupid names you
give each night?
Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.
A BUS
moves into view, obscuring her.
JACK (V.O.)
This is how I met Marla Singer.
The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.
The SUN SETS behind.
A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.
SECURITY PERSONNEL
keep their distance.
KABOOM!
The suitcase explodes.
Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
Cabbie money.
The taxi pulls away.
Jack starts toward the
building.
He pushes through the fray of people, into the...
Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.
His feet CRUNCH glass.
JACK (V.O.)
How embarrassing.
DOORMAN
Do you have somebody you can call?
Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.
He
reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.
CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE
Hissing.
JACK (V.O.)
The police would later tell me that
the pilot light might have gone
out... letting out just a little bit
of gas.
Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.
The Doorman follows, watching him.
DOORMAN
Lots of young people try to impress
the world and buy too many things.
Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.
He looks at
Marla's number a long moment.
CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM
The SOUND of the HISS...
JACK (V.O.)
The gas could have slowly filled the
condo.
Seventeen-hundred square feet
with high ceilings, for days and days.
Jack replaces the receiver.
He pockets Marla's number, digs
out a small FILOFAX.
He flips through the pages for phone
numbers and addresses.
Most of the pages are blank.
DOORMAN
Many young people feel trapped and
desperate.
INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR
JACK (V.O.)
Then, the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on...
Click.
KABOOM!
SCREEN GOES WHITE.
Jack looks at the Doorman.
Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
the Filofax.
Jack catches it.
DOORMAN
If you don't know what you want, you
end up with a lot you don't.
The Doorman walks away.
Jack stares at Tyler's card.
JACK (V.O.)
If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
you why I called him.
Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.
It
RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.
Jack sighs and hangs up the
phone.
A moment, then the phone RINGS.
JACK
Hello?
TYLER'S VOICE
Who's this?
JACK
Tyler?
TYLER'S VOICE
Who's this?
JACK
Uh... I'm sorry.
We met on the
plane.
We had the same briefcase.
I'm... you know, the clever guy.
TYLER'S VOICE
Oh, yeah.
JACK
I just called a second ago.
There
was no answer.
I'm at a payphone.
TYLER'S VOICE
I star-sixty-nined you.
I never pick
up my phone.
What's up?
JACK
Well... let me see... here's the
thing...
A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.
Tyler and Jack come out the back door.
JACK
I don't know about this.
TYLER
I don't know, either.
I want to find
out.
I've never been hit, have you?
JACK
No.
That's a good thing, isn't it?
TYLER
I don't want to die without any
scars.
How much can you really know
about yourself if you've never been
in a fight?
Come on... you're the
only person I've ever asked.
JACK
Me?
Jack stares at him.
TYLER
Why not you?
I'm letting you go
first.
Do it.
JACK
This is crazy.
TYLER
Alright, go crazy.
Let 'er rip.
JACK
Where do you want it?
In the face?
TYLER
Surprise me.
Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.
JACK
Shit.
Sorry.
That didn't count.
TYLER
Like hell.
That counted.
Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.
Jack
falls back against a car.
His eyes tear up.
TYLER
How do you feel?
JACK
Strange.
TYLER
But a good strange.
JACK
Is it?
TYLER
We've crossed the threshold.
You
want to call it off?
JACK
Call what off?
TYLER
The fight.
JACK
What fight?
TYLER
This fight, pussy.
Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
Tyler's ear.
Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.
Tyler and
Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.
They breathe heavier,
drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.
Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
on the nearby freeway.
Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
induced serenity.
They look at each other, laugh.
Look away.
TYLER
If you could fight anyone... one on
one, whoever you wanted, who would
you fight?
JACK
Anyone?
TYLER
Anyone.
Jack thinks.
JACK
My boss, probably.
(pause)
Who would you fight?
TYLER
My dad.
No question.
A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.
JACK
Oh, yeah.
(nodding)
I didn't know my dad.
Well, I knew
him, till I was six.
He went and
married another woman, had more kids.
Every six years or so he'd do it
again -- new city, new family.
TYLER
He was setting up franchises.
My
father never went to college, so it
was really important that I go.
JACK
I know that.
TYLER
After I graduated, I called him long
distance and asked, "Now what?"
He
said, "Get a job."
When I turned
twenty-five, I called him and asked,
"Now what?"
He said, "I don't know.
Get married."
JACK
Same here.
TYLER
A generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman is the
answer we really need.
Another pause.
Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.
JACK
We should do this again sometime.
Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.
A street sign: "PAPER STREET."
A PAPER MILL stis on one
side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.
The rest of the
land is grass and weeds.
It's a grand, old three-story,
long abandoned.
Tyler leads Jack toward it.
JACK
Where's your car?
TYLER
What car?
JACK (V.O.)
I don't know how Tyler found the
house, but he'd been there for half
a year.
All the tavern's lights are off.
Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
FIVE GUYS stand around watching.
Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.
JACK (V.O.)
At night, Tyler and I were alone for
half a mile in every direction.
All the lights are off.
TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
and Tyler, who FIGHT.
THREE CARS are parked in the lot.
All the lights are off.
Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.
The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
than before.
In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.
JACK (V.O.)
I should have been haggling with my
insurance company.
I should have
been looking for a new condo...
Jack walks along.
He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
coffee and sodas.
Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.
JACK (V.O.)
.... I should have been upset about
my nice, neat, flaming little shit.
Jack's face shows no reaction.
He continues to walk.
JACK (V.O.)
But I wasn't.
All the lights are off.
No one around, but there are at
least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.
JACK (V.O.)
... we were finding something out: we
were finding out, more and more, that
we were not alone.
Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
directions.
CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
lot.
YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...
Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.
JACK (V.O.)
A guy came to fight club for the
first time, his ass was a wad of
cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he
was carved out of wood.
JACK
If you could fight any celebrity?
TYLER
Alive or dead?
JACK
Doesn't matter.
TYLER
Hemingway.
You?
JACK
Shatner.
William Shatner.
They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
cigarettes, getting on board...
Jack walks toward the HOUSE.
JACK (V.O.)
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,
go live in a dilapidated house in the
toxic waste part of town...
Tyler stands inside the fence.
Jack's atop the fence,
struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.
He wobbles, gets over,
snags his shirt.
Jack falls, RIPPPPP.
Tyler helps.
FOOTSTEPS.
A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.
Tyler pulls Jack behind a
DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.
A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.
He walks away.
MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.
Tyler
eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.
TYLER
The best fat for making soap --
because the salt balance is just
right -- comes form human bodies...
Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.
JACK
What is this place?
TYLER
A liposuction clinic.
From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.
TYLER
Paydirt.
From society's richest
asses and thighs.
TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
BAGS of fat.
One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
the chain-link fench.
Jack slips and slides.
Tyler laughs.
Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.
Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES
from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."
Jack emerges from the lobby.
He looks up at Marla's window,
watches her silhouette.
He walks away, right into -- Big
BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.
BOB
Cornelius!
How are you?
JACK
Bob.
I'm okay.
How are you?
BOB
Better than I've ever been in my life.
JACK
Really?
Great.
Still "Remaining Men
Together?"
An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.
BOB
No.
I found something new.
JACK
Really, what's that?
BOB
(quietly)
The first rule is... you aren't
supposed to talk about it...
JACK
Oh.
BOB
And the second rule about it is...
you're not supposed to talk about it.
And the third rule...
JACK
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
BOB
You are?!
JACK
Look at my face.
Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.
BOB
That's a fucking great, man!
Fucking
great! Congratulations.
JACK
Yeah, both of us.
BOB
You know about the guy who invented
it? I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly, he was born in a mental
institution.
They say he only sleeps
one hour a night.
You know about
this guy?
Tyler Durden?
Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
of these guys before - it's a new chapter.
Jack and Bob
Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.
They both grin
with religious serenity.
Bob hugs Jack.
BOB
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a
sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.
JACK
You're welcome.
JACK (V.O.)
Fight club -- this was mine and
Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.
Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.
The Yuppie falls.
JACK (V.O.)
Not as easy as it sounds.
People'll
do just about anything to avoid a
fight.
The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...
YUPPIE
Hey!
Wha... What the hell... what
are you doing?!
Who are you?!!
The Yuppie backs away.
Ricky follows...
YUPPIE
Get away from me!
Keep away!
NO... !
Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.
The Yuppie struggles spastically.
YUPPIE
Who are you!?
Why are you attacking
me... ?!
Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.
A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the
sidewalk.
As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.
FIRST MAN
Hey... hey...
SECOND MAN
Watch out, jackass!
These men continue on their way.
The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
looks down, stunned.
SEMINARIAN
You... you did that on purpose!
The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.
The Seminarian grabs
the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.
The Mechanic
shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
The Mechanic purposely takes it.
The Seminarian starts to
run away.
The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
Seminarian in the back of the neck.
They fight.
Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which
reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO
FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY."
Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work
together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from
the ground.
They reverse it, then replace it.
MOMENTS LATER
Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.
JACK
There's fight club in Delaware City.
TYLER
I heard.
Local 15, Monday nights.
As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against
front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...
JACK
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
And, Bob said he was at fight club in
Newcastle last week.
TYLER
Newcastle?
Did you start that one?
JACK
I thought you did.
In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --
front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.
The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital
SATELLITE DISH.
The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,
climbing to a neighboring rooftop.
They come upon another
DISH.
The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...
The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,
stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.
Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...
HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.
Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the
convenience store.
Jack wears a BACKPACK.
TYLER
Let me have that a minute...
Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.
JACK
What are we doing?
TYLER
Homework assignment.
JACK
What is it?
Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.
TYLER
Human Sacrifice.
Jack turns white, staring at the gun.
The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out
at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.
Jack follows,
freaked.
Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.
JACK (V.O.)
On a long enough time line, the
survival rate for everyone drops to
zero.
CLERK
Please... don't...
TYLER
Give me your wallet.
The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
snatches it.
Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.
TYLER
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
apartment A.
A small, cramped
basement apartment.
RAYMOND
How'd you know?
TYLER
They give basement apartments letters
instead of numbers.
Raymond, you're
going to die.
Tyler rummages through the wallet.
TYLER
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
RAYMOND
Yesssss...
TYLER
Your mom and dad will have to call
kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
your dental records, because there
won't be much left of your face.
RAYMOND
Please, God, no...
Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.
JACK
Tyler...
TYLER
An expired community college student
ID card.
What did you used to study,
Raymond K. Hessel?
RAYMOND
S-S-Stuff.
TYLER
"Stuff."
Were the mid-terms hard?
Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.
TYLER
I asked you what you studied.
JACK
Tell him!
RAYMOND
Biology, mostly.
TYLER
Why?
RAYMOND
I... I don't know...
TYLER
What did you want to be, Raymond K.
Hessel?
Raymond weeps and says nothing.
Tyler COCKS the gun.
Raymond GASPS.
TYLER
The question, Raymond, was "what did
you want to be?"
A beat.
JACK
Answer him!
RAYMOND
A veterinarian!
TYLER
Animals.
RAYMOND
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
TYLER
Stuff.
That means you have to get
more schooling.
RAYMOND
Too much school.
Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.
TYLER
Would you rather be dead?
RAYMOND
No, please, no, God, no!
Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.
RAYMOND
NOOOOO!
Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.
TYLER
I'm keeping your license.
I know
where you live.
I'm going to check
on you.
If you aren't back in school
and on your way to being a
veterinarian in six weeks, you will
be dead.
Get the hell out of here.
Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.
Jack
and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.
JACK
I feel sick.
TYLER
Imagine how he feels.
Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
CLICK.
Empty.
JACK
I don't care, that was horrible.
Tyler walks away.
TYLER
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.
Jack watches Tyler go.
TYLER
His breakfast will taste better than
any meal he has ever eaten.
Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.
He finally
turns back, following after Tyler.
Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.
VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it
across rocks and dirt.
He stops a moment, rake on his
shoulder, staring off.
Then, back to work...
TYLER
(muttering quietly)
... You are not how much money you
have in the bank.
You are not the
shoes you wear.
Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of
the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...
TYLER
You are not the contents of your
wallet...
Jack gets off the bus.
As the bus pulls away, we see it
dropped Jack off right in front of the house.
Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
ENTRANCE.
Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.
Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.
RAINING.
Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
A idling car HONKS.
Tyler leads Jack toward it.
A bruised-
faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.
VALET
There you are, Mr. Durden.
Airport
parking, long term.
JACK
(motions to car)
After you, Mr. Durden...
TYLER
No... after you.
Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.
It has two
bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."
Tyler crawls from the passenger side.
He walks around...
opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
mud.
Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
window.
Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.
TYLER
We just had a near-life experience.
Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
unsure.
Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.
JACK
Uh, look.
You're too... young to...
train here.
You should probably be
on you way.
No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.
Jack goes
back inside.
Tyler closes the door.
Ricky remains at attention.
Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.
JACK
Are you deaf?!
I told you to leave!
You will never get inside this house!
Ricky's still there.
Tyler comes out, friendly.
TYLER
Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.
It's not the end
of the world.
Just go away.
You're
trespassing and I will call the
police.
Nothing personal.
Ricky, same spot.
Jack bursts outside with the broom again.
JACK
You're never getting through this
door, you stupid little weasel!
Look
at me when I talk to you... !
He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.
JACK
What is your major malfunction!?
Ricky's there.
Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.
Tyler steps out.
Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.
To all the
following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --
TYLER
You have two black shirts?
Two pair
black trousers?
One pair black
boots?
Two pair black socks?
One
black coat?
Three hundred dollars
personal burial money?
Go inside.
Ricky goes in.
Tyler turns to Bob.
TYLER
You're too old.
Sorry.
And, you're
too fat.
Nice seeing you.
Bob looks genuinely hurt.
He picks up his mattress and
starts away.
Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.
Jack
follows Bob...
JACK
Bob... Bob, wait...
(leading Bob back)
Let me explain this to you...
CRICKETS CHIRP.
Bob stands at at rigid attention.
Jack looks out the window.
Bob stands motionless.
There's
another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.
Ricky comes
out the front door with the BROOM...
RICKY
(to Bob)
You're too fucking old, fatty!
We
don't want your kind here!
(to short guy)
You're too short.
Go away, stumpy!
Go back to the circus!
Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.
JACK (V.O.)
So it went...
Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
square of backyard.
They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
with shovels, rakes, etc.
They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.
JACK (V.O.)
Tyler built his army.
IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...
Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.
In the BACKGROUND, a
Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.
It's a
ritual; no words.
Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.
JACK (V.O.)
I'm all alone.
I Am Jack's Broken
Heart.
Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.
A
Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.
JACK
Get away from me!
MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
Who are all these people?
Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.
JACK
The Paper Street Soap Company.
MARLA
Can I come in?
JACK
He's not here.
MARLA
What?
JACK
He's not here!
Tyler's not here
anymore!
He's gone away!
Marla stares at Jack, miserable.
A tear runs down her
cheek.
She turns and walks away.
Jack watches her go.
There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
Jack heads to the back door...
A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.
MECHANIC (V.O.)
We were supposed to kill two birds
with one stone:
A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.
It ROLLS...
MECHANIC (V.O.)
A piece of corporate art...
The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and
causing windows to explode...
MECHANIC (V.O.)
... and trash a trendy coffee bar.
Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...
BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the
front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...
DECIMATING coffee push-pats...
Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their
handiwork.
They split up, running O.S.
MECHANIC (V.O.)
We had it all worked out, man.
It
went smooth... until...
HARSH VOICE
Police!
Freeze!
O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.
Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...
JACK (V.O.)
In every city, I branched out from
the airport to downtown, bar-
hopping...
Jack steps off the sidewalk, hailing a TAXI...
The alleyway's deserted.
Jack heaft to rusty CELLAR DOORS.
He opens the doors, looks around, heads down stairs...
JACK (V.O.)
I was living in a state of perpetual
deja vu.
Jack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla.
JACK
He's not here!
Tyler's not here
anymore!
He's gone away!
A TAXI halts.
Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.
JACK
Wait here.
Jack's TAXI halts.
Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...
JACK
Marla!
Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.
Jack follows,
hugging the files to his chest, catching up.
JACK
Marla...
MARLA
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom.
I thought they
were going to break my arm.
JACK
I'm sorry, I...
MARLA
The were burning their fingertips
with lye.
The stink was unbelievable.
JACK
Marla... I need to talk to you.
It's
going to take a tremendous act of
faith on your part for you to hear me
out.
MARLA
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Marla heads into a DINER.
Jack follows...
JACK
-- A little more faith than that.
Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...
JACK
I can't explain.
You wouldn't
believe me anyway.
I'm trying to
protect you...
Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
past.
Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,
MARLA
Let go of me!
JACK
Do this for me, Marla.
Do this for
me, if you never do anything else...
Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.
MARLA
Leave me alone!
I don't ever want to
see you again!
JACK
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
never have to see me again.
(digs in his pocket)
Here... here...
He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.
JACK
Take this money, get on this bus...
(pointing to bus)
Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
bother you again, if that's what you
want.
Please...
Marla looks at Jack, numb.
MARLA
Tyler...
JACK
I'm begging you.
Get on the bus.
Get on the bus.
Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.
As
they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...
MARLA
Why are you doing this?
JACK
I can't let myself see where you're
going.
Go wherever it takes you,
remember... keep away from major
cities...
Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
last look at Jack.
MARLA
(holds up the money)
I'm not paying this back.
I consider
it "asshole tax."
JACK
Yes, fine.
Just, get on.
Stay away
a couple of weeks, at least.
Jack's still covering his eyes.
Marla gets on the bus.
MARLA
Tyler...
Jack finally looks to her.
MARLA
You are the worst thing that ever
happened to me.
DOORS HISS SHUT.
The BUS LEAVES, heading away.
Jack seems
relieved.
Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...
Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.
Jack SPRINTS after the bus...
The bus speeds away.
Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.
Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.
JACK
Son of a bitch!
Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
DOOR.
He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.
Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
looking like a complete madman.
Cars almost hit him.
Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."
Jack tries the door.
Locked.
He lifts a cast iron bench,
runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.
The bench
immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...
