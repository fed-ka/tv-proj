                        Maybe we can chop a few feet off
                        the bottom.

                        You stick to Christmas dinner and
                        let me handle the ambiance.

                        I need some egg nog.

                        Sounds good.

          They drop the tree and head for the kitchen.



          Bruce heads straight for the fridge and throws it open. 
            Something stops him in his tracks...

          sitting in a large roasting pan.

                        That sounds appetizing.

          Johnny heads for the door.

                        me and I was spending another
                          Christmas by myself.  Then I

          She holds out the bottle in one hand and the chop-socky
          DVDs in the other.  Johnny musters a weak, supportive
          smile.  Alex instantly realizes her mistake.

                        you?  This is so embarrassing.

          tight-tight on the frozen kiss.

          Johnny cautiously opens one eye to look at the source of
          the voice.  What he sees makes him break the kiss.

          Alex looks around and sees a sign with the name of the
          store, "BIG PETE'S GAME WORLD" -- as the vision ends.

          Johnny at the sales counter.  The Slacker Clerk, from the*
          vision earlier, looks up from his gamer magazine.*

          She's looking at the various gaming swag, until she locks
          in on...


          A SANTA DISPLAY

            A life-sized smiling face of Santa hangs on the wall. *
          She seems weirdly drawn to it, as she steps closer...*


          ALEX POV - PLASTIC SANTA FACE

          The SHOT PUSHES SLOWLY IN TIGHT on the face, as we HEAR...

                        me!


          ALEX

          Stunned by the sudden plea, she turns to look outside.


          HER POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW

          As we/she realizes where the cries for help are coming
          from.  The "Santa" is now surrounded by the three boys,
          swinging his bag at them.  The OLDEST BOY, a street-wise
            twelve-year-old, gets clocked with the bag, but manages
          to grab it and wrestles with the old guy.


          JOHNNY MEANWHILE

          The Slacker Clerk returns, handing him the video game.

          Sarah is up on a ladder, putting ornaments on the tree,
          while Walt and J.J. string Christmas lights.

                                        J.J.
                        So, is this psychic lady Johnny's

                        Well, there isn't any missing
                        person reports matching your guy's
                          description.  You said he has a
                        history of violent behavior?

                        In a vision, I saw him running
                        away from the police.

                        That would qualify.  I'll get his
                        prints off a glass.  If he's got

          Johnny leads Alex and "Santa" into the store.  He finds

                        That's right.  Listen, I was
                        wondering, have you ever see them
                        before?  Maybe hanging around*
                          outside?*

                        bought something.

          Alex follows Johnny out of earshot of the clerk, then
          pulls him aside, whispering.

          in the tradition of "Shaft".  He looks pissed, staring
          down Young "Santa".  Johnny and Alex are caught between

          then finally finds it -- "Santa's" bag.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I figured you'd come back.

          The kid spins around, to find Johnny standing behind him.

                        I just want to talk.

                        Where are my brothers?

                                        JOHNNY

                        What do you want?

                        Where's your father, Matthew?

          The kid looks down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm just trying to help you and
                        your brothers.

          Matthew, exhausted, sits down on the broken couch.  He
          suddenly seems like a boy, instead of a tough street kid.

                                        MATTHEW
                        Mom and dad were gonna get
                          divorced.  One night, she woke us
                        up and told us to stuff all our
                        clothes into some garbage bags. 
                        She said we were leaving, that my
                        dad didn't want us anymore.  We
                        didn't even get to say good-bye.   
                                (beat)
                        After she died, they were going
                        to split us up.  So we took off. 
                        All we had was this picture.

          Matthew pulls the worn snapshot of a dad and three small
          boys out of his back pocket.  The picture was obviously
          taken when the boys were very young.

          When Johnny touches the picture, we hear a DZ WHOOSH, but
          don't see the vision. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How about we give Santa back his
                        bag and go have some dinner?  You
                        ever had Turducken?



          Alex is asleep in the chair, bathed in the blue light
          from the TV in the otherwise dark room.  As we watch her,
          the sounds of voices become audible.

                        lying to you?

          A change in the pitch of the male voice wakes Alex and
          she sits up, looking at the television.


          ON THE SCREEN - A MOVIE - CIRCA 1980'S

          Looking over the shoulder of the man, his face obscured,
          as the woman stares into his eyes.

          ALEX

          Suddenly figures out what's different about the voice. 
          Now there's two male voices, speaking in unison.

          She turns to look at "Santa" who is still sitting next to
          her, no longer channel surfing, but watching this movie,
            repeating the man's dialog word for word.

                                        "SANTA" AND MALE VOICE
                        It's going to be different this
                        time.  Don't you see that?  I
                        love you.  I love you more than
                        I've ever loved anyone. 

          Alex looks from "Santa" to the television, where she sees
          a close-up of the Woman, listening to the Man's words.

                                        FEMALE VOICE
                        We can't go on pretending none of
                        this has happened.

          Just as it would be natural to cut to the Man's close-up,
          the VIEW SHIFTS AWAY FROM THE TV TO A TIGHT VIEW OF ALEX

                          memorabilia at a retirement home
                        around the corner.  I felt a little
                        dizzy and then I... I must have
                        hit my head, because the next
                        thing I know I was fighting with
                        those kids on the sidewalk.

          Alex reaches down and picks up a hat, the same Sinatra-
          cool hat from the movie.  She hands it to Johnny,

                          Michael, Matthew and Mitchell!

          The brothers seem stunned by the gesture.

                        For us?

          The brothers all step up to get their gifts.

                        Where did those presents come
                        from?

                                        SARAH
                        They were J.J.'s.  When he found
                        out the boys weren't getting
                          anything, he asked me to put their
                        names on a few his own.

          Johnny looks over at J.J., who seems to be enjoying the
          moment more than anyone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's quite a kid we got.

                        Right here!

          J.J. steps to where Santa is standing.  He hands him a
          present, and J.J. rips the paper off.

                        Ratchet Deadlocked!!  Exactly
                        what I wanted.

          Johnny seems quietly confused.

          They kiss, as Bruce appears from the kitchen.  He appears
          exhausted, with cooking powder all over his face.

          He heads toward the front door.  After a BEAT, J.J. returns
          with Reverend Purdy behind him.

                        who was looking for the O'Leary
                          brothers.  You wouldn't happen to

          Mickey, Mitchell, and Matthew exchange looks, like they
          might be ready to bolt.

          A MAN enters the room, mid-forties -- a kind face with a
          touch of sadness.

                        Dad?  Is that you?

          The boys all jump up from their seats and rush into the
          man's arms.

                        okay, we had some good times. 
                        But I always wondered what it
                        would be like to have a big family,
                        people who cared about each other
