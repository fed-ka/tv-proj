ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK
A BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows
and throws open the shutters with a bang.
Sunlight pours
in.
He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,
and runs his hand through his hair.
FATHER
(with a smile)
... Come on, time to get up,
Jacques!
JACQUES rubs his eyes.
His father walks over to a pile of
blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.
He
gives the pile a kick.
FATHER
(screaming at the
top of his lungs)
Louis, wake up!
He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl
of soup for Jacques.
A fifty year old man pokes his head
out from under the pile of blankets.
It's UNCLE LOUIS,
who is having a very hard time, waking up.
BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING
They keep up the rhythm.
Sitting on a rock at a distance,
ENZO watches them.
UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.
UNCLE LOUIS
Why don't you ask me?
JACQUES
What?
UNCLE LOUIS
Where I saw the mermaids?!
Why
don't you ever ask any question?
I'm always the one asking the
question!
We're sitting here like
two stones and I'm taking to myself.
Ask me something, Goddamnit!
JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping
and almost serenely asks him:
JACQUES
(in a completely
flat tone)
Why did my mother leave?
UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.
A beat.
UNCLE LOUIS
(ill at ease)
Come on now, pump!
UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER
He is walking with difficulty at the bottom.
His bag is
full of sponges.
He seems to be having trouble breathing.
RESTAURANT - DAY
ALFREDO skips in.
He is panting, covered in sweat.
His
panic is palpable.
The whole room watches him approach a
long table where a large family is having a birthday party
for a very old lady.
He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can
get the words out.
Then leans over and whispers in the
ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull,
wearing little round glasses.
The man listens, then stiffens.
TRAIN - DAY
Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window,
JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of
romantic fragility.
She is dressed simply but warmly.
She looks through the window; all she sees is white.
It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this
trip.
Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book,
she calls upon an old Peruvian.
JOHANA
(in Spanish)
Is this the Lago del Demonio?
(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio)
... Huacracocha?
The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation.
JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.
JOHANA
Gracias.
OLD MAN
You welcome.
SNOWMOBILE - DAY
FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile,
jumps in and turns the ignition on.
JOHANA takes her hat,
scarf and gloves off.
FRANK glances over at her, he is
both amused and charmed.
JOHANA
Don't you have a heater?
FRANK
(hitting at the
dashboard)
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first
trip to Peru?
JOHANA
Does anybody live to make a second?
FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over
to check it, his eyes off the road.
JOHANA
(a little worried)
Forget about the heater!
QUONSET HUT
JOHANA happily takes her gloves off.
FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room.
It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern
equipment.
A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a
long wooden dock.
Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot
drinks.
JOHANA drops into a chair.
FRANK
A drink to warm up?
JOHANA
Yes, thank you.
Intravenous if
possible.
FRANK
(pulling out a flask)
Tea... or whiskey?
JOHANA
... both.
Did I just see a man in a
red suit and goggles?
FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.
FRANK
... right.
(calling out)
Dr. Lawrence?
The insurance man...
uh... The insurance person is here!
LAWRENCE
It's about time!
FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.
She warms her
hands on the cup.
She asks blankly.
JOHANA
Would it be out of place to ask what
he's doing?
FRANK
Who?
JOHANA
The guy in the Halloween suit!
LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room.
He walks straight over to the bay window.
LAWRENCE
Did you have a nice trip?
We were
getting restless, it's been three
weeks since the accident.
JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at
something in the distance.
CABIN - DAWN
JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.
She's wearing a
big sweater and a wool hat.
She is not sleeping.
Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and
walks over to the frozen window.
JACQUES and FRANK are
loading their luggage onto the snowmobile.
Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.
Unseen,
JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.
JACQUES senses
something:
he turns around toward the cabin and smiles,
waving his hand at JOHANA.
She hides behind the curtain
and shyly waves back.
JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the
frame.
We are left with an endless array of snow-caped
mountains.
DISSOLVE TO:
- TAXI
From behind all his bags, JACQUES obsessively stares at
the sea.
The driver smiles.
DRIVER
It's beautiful, isn't it?
JACQUES smiles.
DRIVER
We had some bad wind this week.
The
"Mistral"!!
"Peuchere"!
There
isn't one olive left on its tree.
It suddenly left us this morning...
I sure won't be the one to call it
back.
HALLWAY - DAY
JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.
Catches her breath
and gets out her keys.
She tries one in the top lock.
It
doesn't work.
She tries harder.
There's a woman's voice
yelling angrily from inside the apartment.
SALLY (O.S.)
I changed the lock you son of a
bitch!
JOHANA
... Sally?
The door opens.
SALLY
You're back!
Hello.
We were
burgled.
JOHANA
Again?
SALLY
They got the new T.V.
JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment.
SALLY
... And the new stereo.
JOHANA
I hope they remembered to take the
microwave this time?
SALLY
Yep.
How was your trip...?
Help me
clean up, okay?
JOHANA
You called the police?
SALLY
They're going to send detectives.
When they get around to it.
JOHANA
(shrugging)
So what, all they ever want is your
phone number anyway.
JOHANA goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs.
After a beat...
SALLY
Well?
JOHANA
What?
SALLY
How was your trip?
JOHANA
(flatly)
Nice... Very interesting... Great!
(doubtfully)
... I guess.
SALLY
(ironically)
Okay... Who'd you meet?
JOHANA opens her handbag, takes out the strip of
electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her.
SALLY
A cardiogram...?
You met a doctor!
Congratulations, you're in the
chips...
(an afterthought)
Unless they have socialized medicine
in Peru.
Do they?
JOHANA
(indicating paper)
It's his heartbeat.
SALLY
Oh Jesus...!
I'll make some coffee.
(starts toward
kitchen)
They left the stove.
TIME DISSOLVE:
APARTMENT - LATER
The living room is almost completely put back together...
SALLY is replacing books in the bookcase, JOHANA is using
a carpet sweeper, and talking away.
JOHANA
(nonstop)
6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't
be sure, you know the flippers, they
add height or they take it away, or
something.
Anyway short dark hair...
Not punk or anything, just short.
And the cutest smile.
He wasn't
smiling at me, I don't think -- just
smiling.
And he thought he saw me in
the lake.
I mean that was a figure
of speech... They're so romantic,
the French.
SALLY
(bored, half asleep)
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
JOHANA
(annoyed)
Haven't you been listening?
SALLY opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside.
SALLY
... Since eight o'clock last
night...!
You're in love.
JOHANA
Don't be a jerk.
(emphatically)
There's no such thing as love at
first sight.
DISSOLVE TO:
UNDERWATER - SWIMMING POOL
JACQUES is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic
swimming pool.
He wears a monofin, his head and chest are
wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside
the pool.
A man's feet are seen walking over to the side of the
pool.
JACQUES is swimming laps, arching his body like a dolphin.
As he approaches one end of the pool, he sees a coin
slowly falling in front of him.
JACQUES picks it up and
looks at it:
it's an old Greek coin.
JACQUES smiles and swims to the surface.
DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA
She is seated across the desk from him.
He's reading
through her report.
Behind him, outside the large plate
glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold
suspended far above the city.
They eat lunch.
JOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY
reads.
He looks up.
DUFFY
(indicating report)
This is good work... unfortunately
it's incomplete.
(he glances at the
window)
Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors
above the street.
JOHANA
(absently)
What kind?
DUFFY
Johana, am I boring you?
JOHANA
Sorry.
Of course not, definitely
not... well, maybe a little.
What
did you say?
DUFFY
I said that the file is incomplete.
See if you can get through to this
Lawrence character and have him send
the Peruvian registration for his
missing truck... and don't let him
tell you it was in the glove
compartment.
JOHANA
Right Chief!
She starts out of the office.
DUFFY
(to her back)
Did the driver really freeze?
JOHANA
Like a popsicle.
They're keeping
him on a stick until spring.
DUFFY
My God!
I'm glad I didn't go.
JOHANA
(under her breath,
leaving)
... So am I.
QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY
Doctor LAWRENCE covers one ear with his hand as he yells
into the phone.
LAWRENCE
(screaming)
... I said, all the truck papers are
in the glove compartment!
JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN
JOHANA sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the
telephone.
Her colleague looks over at her and smiles.
JOHANA
(with a sigh)
Okay, listen, just get the custom's
office to send me a copy as fast as
possible.
We can't send you new
equipment until our file is
complete.
Okay?
QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY
LAWRENCE
Okay, okay.
You'll have it by the
end of the week, how's that?
JOHANA (V.O.)
You've made me a happy insurance
person.
LAWRENCE
Then, goodbye.
He is just about to hang up.
JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN
JOHANA jumps up.
JOHANA
Wait!
Professor...?
LAWRENCE (V.O.)
... Yes?
JOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk,
embarrassed by the presence of her colleague.
JOHANA
(as softly as
possible)
You don't know how I could reach
that diver of yours... Mayol... We
need some additional information...
I mean, we have a few questions to
ask him.
QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY
LAWRENCE
The last thing I heard, he was off
to Taormina for the world diving
championships.
That's Taormina, in
Sicily!
DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY
JOHANA dashes in without knocking.
JOHANA
Listen, I just found out we've got
real problems in Sicily!
DUFFY
(alarmed)
What d'you mean?
JOHANA
(improvising)
The mafia!
La Cosa Nostra!
Coppola!
De Niro...!
I knew it!
I
knew we shouldn't have written that
policy!!
DUFFY
(pale)
What's happened??
JOHANA
The documents are forged.
DUFFY
No!
JOHANA
Yes!
The notary is a phony.
He has
the same signature as the
contractor!
DUFFY
(outraged)
It can't be true!
JOHANA
(fast talking)
We have to send somebody over there
immediately!
If we prove the
forgery we can cancel the policy.
We'll be off the hook.
There's a
flight to Rome in two hours and from
there its just a short hop to
Sicily.
DUFFY
(reaching for phone)
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able
to...
JOHANA
(interrupting)
I tried him, he can't go.
His son
is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow...
I'll go, boss.
DUFFY
I thought it was Spanish that you
spoke?
JOHANA
(after a beat)
Italian is practically the same
thing.
HOTEL - DAY
The tiny FIAT clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the
hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo.
Parks its
frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road.
ENZO, followed by ROBERTO, get out of his car, like a king
descending from his carriage.
On the way, he stops and
kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand?
The hotel's
CONTESSA.
ENZO tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to
complain.
ENZO
(to doorman)
Be careful with that car, it's a new
paint job.
ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.
ENZO
(yelling across the
lobby)
Giacomino!
My friend!
My brother!
ENZO and JACQUES.
The two men kiss each other on both
cheeks, pound each others back.
They are both moved.
ENZO
(looking at him)
So you finally decided to join us?
You did the right thing!
ENZO
(to the desk clerk)
Hey Paolo!
Come stai?
Get my key!
(to Jacques,
gesturing over his
shoulder)
You remember my little brother
Roberto?
Roberto (26) nods to JACQUES who shakes his hand.
JACQUES
I remember.
Hi Roberto!
ENZO
What room have you got?
JACQUES
I don't have one.
ENZO
You don't have a room?
(at the top of his
lungs)
Paolo?
What did I just hear?
I
personally called you to reserve a
room for my good friend Jacques
Mayol and you treat him like a
stranger?!
JACQUES
(embarrassed)
It's okay, Enzo.
I'll go somewhere
else.
ENZO
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very
special friend, but he happens to be
one of the best divers in the world!
And you're throwing him out!
Are
you crazy, or what?
Stupido!
JACQUES
(really embarrassed
now)
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
ENZO looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile.
He hands him his own keys.
ENZO
Take mine.
I'll take the Countess'
suite.
She told me she was leaving
for the cemetery... She'll be more
comfortable there.
PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.
ENZO glances at
JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.
He throws
his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a
real smile.
ENZO
(sincerely)
I'm glad you're here.
ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT
They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the
full-length mirrors.
He's wearing an evening shirt and a
tuxedo of ENZO'S.
The collar is too big, the sleeves
hangover his hands.
He looks at himself dubiously in the
mirror.
ENZO
Roberto!
The bow-tie!
ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around
JACQUES' collar.
ENZO
(taking a few steps
back)
Very good.
JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.
ROBERTO
What about the shoes?
ENZO
Very chic.
(hesitates)
Anyway, you don't have anything
else, do you?
JACQUES
No.
ENZO
Then, it's very chic.
Avanti!
BAR - NIGHT
JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.
The whiskeys
have gone to their heads.
ENZO walks over to them.
ENZO
A new world record!
That's great!
It gives me something to beat
tomorrow!
(to Johana)
You ever been to Tahiti?
JOHANA
No.
ENZO
I'll take you there.
We'll live in
the sun.
You'll cook fresh fish and
we'll make love under the coconut
trees.
JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.
JOHANA
You forgot the Hula!
ENZO
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
JOHANA
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.
(to Jacques)
Jacques, would you do a native dance
for me?
JACQUES
I don't know how... Excuse me.
JACQUES leaves the bar.
JOHANA watches him go.
ENZO
notices her way of watching him.
He's a little jealous.
ENZO
He looks strange, doesn't he?
Like
a baby that just learned to walk.
JOHANA
Have you known him long?
ENZO
Forever.
We used to live on the
same island in Greece, when we were
kids.
JOHANA
What was he like, when he was little?
ENZO
Little.
Very little.
And skinny,
very skinny too.
That is compared
to me.
JOHANA
(amused)
I get it, Enzo you were a superior
child.
ENZO
Exactly!
What is it Johana?
You're
so crazy about him, you don't see
the truth?!
She doesn't answer.
ENZO
Forget it, don't think of Jacques as
a human being.
He's from another
world.
She smiles.
JOHANA
And just where are you from?
ENZO
Italy!
HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at
full speed.
ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.
Both men
keep throwing up water.
JACQUES'S ROOM - NIGHT
The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed.
JOHANA very worried, follows them.
JOHANA
Take it easy...
PARAMEDIC
Don't worry, he's empty now.
He
needs sleep, that's all.
The two men leave the room.
JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES'
shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down.
JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night.
He
sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a
moving boat.
JACQUES
Who won?
JOHANA turns around, furious.
JOHANA
Won what?
The Ass Hole Award?
Well, let me tell you, it's a tie!
She walks over to the bed.
JOHANA
Acting like a pair of two year olds!
You could have died in that damn
pool!
JACQUES
Please move slowly, you're rocking
the boat.
JOHANA
(smiling)
Lucky I was there to save you.
JACQUES
(seeing her wet
dress)
You jumped in?
JOHANA
Only to help the medics, I assure
you.
JACQUES
My wallet.
JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair.
She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the
jacket pockets.
JOHANA
It's still here.
She tries to wipe it.
JACQUES
No.
I want to show you.
Is it
ruined?
JOHANA
Well, water isn't exactly the best
thing for pictures... Not even for
pictures of dolphins...
JACQUES
Give it to me.
JOHANA hands him the photograph.
He stares at it, looking
very sad.
Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.
JACQUES
(on the verge of
tears)
My real family...
(he looks at the
picture and cries)
What kind of man has such a family?
She takes the picture out of his hands.
He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying
with him.
She sits next to him and strokes his hair.
JACQUES
I'm sick of never feeling at home
anywhere.
JOHANA takes him in her arms.
He breaks down.
YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY
A medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.
ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.
The doctor puts a
blood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.
He listens with his stethoscope.
DOCTOR
Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but
I cannot allow you to dive in such
an advanced state of exhaustion.
ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,
lifts him in the air.
ENZO
(outraged)
What do you know about the sea?
Huh?
Nothing!
So you just put your
tubes and tin cans away.
The sea is
mine!
I know when she is ready for
me and when she isn't.
And today,
she is ready.
Understand?
DOCTOR
You dive at your own risk.
You're
been warned.
ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.
ENZO
Brave.
HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY
He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.
He
looks around the room, trying to get his bearings.
JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.
On the wall
behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.
She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.
JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA
sleeping.
He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.
She wakes up, starts out of the chair.
She grabs the
blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on
the floor.
It's one of his.
JOHANA
You scared me!
JACQUES picks up the book.
JOHANA smiles.
JOHANA
Just checking up on your family.
(then embarrassed)
I guess I was drunker than I thought
and the idea of going back to my
hotel in a wet dress... Well...
JACQUES
I'm glad you stayed.
Thank you.
JOHANA
(getting up)
I'd better get back now.
JACQUES
You... You wouldn't want to spend
the day with me?
She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.
JACQUES
(self conscious)
... No?
JOHANA
No?
Huh?
(she says "No" as if
she had asked the
question)
Yes, of course!!
HALL - HOTEL - DAY
JACQUES and JOHANA are walking across the corridor.
ENZO walks up to them, followed by his tribe.
Everybody
is congratulating him.
ROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.
ENZO
smiles as he talks back to them.
He sees JACQUES.
ENZO
(screaming)
Ah!
Jacques!
ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders.
JACQUES and JOHANA are
completely soaked.
ENZO
Don't be sad, I only took back what
was mine.
He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.
ENZO
Here, it's a present.
JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other.
JACQUES has won
his bet.
JACQUES
(touched)
... Thank you.
ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.
ENZO
(to Johana)
Tonight we're having a little party
among ourselves.
8 o'clock in my
suite?
JOHANA
Okay.
ENZO walks off then turns back toward them.
He whispers
in JACQUES' ear.
ENZO
Tell me... Can you explain why you
are soaking wet?
A beat.
JOHANA
... We're in training.
ENZO walks off.
HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of
one of the hotel rooms.
One of them holds a medal in his
hand, a glass of champagne in the other.
NOVELLI
(through the door)
Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be
reasonable.
Everyone is waiting for
him upstairs.
The photographers are
there, the press...
ROBERTO (O.S.)
He can't, he's indisposed.
NOVELLI
(trying to keep his
calm)
Shall we call a doctor?
ROBERTO
No, it's okay.
Mamma is going to
try something.
JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall
and stop in front of the same door.
NOVELLI
Mr. Mayol, help us.
He refuses to
receive his medal and everybody is
waiting for him up there.
We
already have problems with the press
because of the danger, and if we
don't even have the divers help...!
JACQUES
(dubious)
... I'll do my best.
NOVELLI
That's very kind of you.
JACQUES knocks on the door.
JACQUES
It's Jacques... Mayol!
A beat.
Then ENZO opens the door himself.
ENZO
Jacques!
My friend!
Come on in!
The officials look at each other baffled.
NOVELLI
Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to
impress upon you the importance of
your attending the Award Ceremony...
For the press...
ENZO
(loosing his temper)
I think my brother told you I was
indisposed, that should do it, no?
I'm allowed to be indisposed, right?
So, you just tell the press that the
"big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by
his inspiring descent to 324 feet,
will not be able to receive this
trinket because he is...
He looks inquisitively at the three men.
ENZO looses his
temper.
ENZO
Because he is?!
ONE OF THE THREE MEN
... Indisposed.
ENZO
(smiling)
Brave!
He slams the door in their face.
HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT
JACQUES
Tell me, why don't you go and get
your medal?
ENZO
Because pasta should be eaten "Al
Dente".
So the trinket will just
have to wait a bit.
ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.
Inside his room is
absolute chaos:
dancing, singing, eating.
Wet suits hung
out to dry everywhere.
MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up
mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the
middle of the room.
A lot of smoke... steam... color...
noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.
JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner
of the room.
JACQUES walks over and sits down at her
side.
ENZO
(to Mamma)
Mamma!
La pasta?!
MAMMA MOLINARI
Arrivo!
Arrivo!
She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the
cheese.
ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's
hands and starts playing.
ENZO
... It's easy.
You go down.
You
come up.
(to Johana)
... Right, Johana?
JOHANA
(smiling)
Congratulations, Enzo.
ENZO
Don't you agree, Jacques?
JACQUES
... You always were the best.
ENZO laughs then sees his mother.
ENZO
Ah!
La pasta!
ENZO starts singing in Italian.
MAMMA MOLINARI serves the
pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese
on the plates.
She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta,
enough for three giants.
MAMMA MOLINARI
(with a smile)
Buon appetito, Signorina!
JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.
JACQUES
has walked up to ENZO.
He doesn't dare ask his question.
ENZO
(smiling)
What's the matter?
You still have a
bunch of things to ask me?
You want
to know the price of tea in China of
how we landed on the moon?
Is that
it?
ENZO laughs.
JACQUES is serious.
JACQUES
No, I have to ask you a favor...
(a beat)
You're the only one who'll
understand.
ENZO
(seriously)
... I'm listening.
CORRIDOR - NIGHT
MAMMA MOLINARI
Tutto va bene?
The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their
knees.
Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod
enthusiastically.
NOVELLI
(mouth full)
Gracie mille, chignora.
MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.
FIAT - NIGHT
JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.
ENZO crammed
in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a
stretcher which takes up all the space.
They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party.
ENZO
(leaning forward)
Hey!
Will you slow down!
When did
you learn how to drive?
JACQUES
Driving isn't the problem, it's
remembering the right road.
JACQUES runs a red light.
ENZO
And the lights!
Running lights,
stealing stretchers...!
You'll have
us in jail.
JOHANA
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT
It's a very narrow street.
The car moves down it quickly.
JACQUES drives.
The back seat is now occupied by the
dolphin.
Its nose and tail protruding through the
windows.
JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the
dolphin with a watering can.
BOAT - DAY - LATER
On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.
JACQUES comes out
of his room.
He's dressed to dive.
He ignores everyone
as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.
He
seems to be in another world.
All sounds coming to him
are drowned out.
TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL
ENZO
Congratulations Jacques!
It's
wonderful!
Wonderful!
He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big
hug.
ENZO
I'm happy for you!
He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.
ENZO
(to Jacques)
Here...
(to Johana)
Here...
JACQUES
What is it?
ENZO
Little presents, nothing much... I
knew it, I just knew it!
Look here!
He holds up his arm:
he is wearing two watches.
ENZO
Roberto's watch!
I won it!
He bet
that you couldn't beat me!
JACQUES opens his present.
It's a little ceramic dolphin.
ENZO
You still collect them?
JACQUES
Yes.
ENZO
You don't have that one, do you?
JACQUES
No.
Thank you.
It's really
beautiful.
ENZO
Oh it's nothing.
I knew it.
I told
Roberto "He's very good that little
Frenchman, very good".
I lost my
title but I won a watch!
JOHANA has opened her package.
It's a big plate with a
text engraved on it.
JOHANA
Is it a poem?
ENZO
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti
"Frutti del mare".
(to Jacques)
You see I was right in getting you
out here.
You're a world champion,
my friend!
JACQUES has opened the last small package.
It's a
measuring tape.
He looks at it without understanding.
ENZO explains:
ENZO
It's a measuring tape.
He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.
ENZO
You see this is your record, three
feet more than mine!
Looking at it
from here, it doesn't look like
much, does it?
JACQUES looks at him without saying a word.
ENZO hands him the measuring tape.
ENZO
Keep your little measuring tape, my
friend, it will be a nice souvenir
when I beat you next.
ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.
ELEVATOR ASCENDING - JACQUES - JOHANA
They're locked in a long kiss.
He untucks the bottom of
her shirt and slides his hands under it.
HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - TWILIGHT
They're in bed, making love in their fashion.
Moonlight
shines in the silver sea.
In the background are the
lights of the bay of TAORMINA.
LATER
JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.
They are both asleep.
Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his
recurrent dream.
He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.
She sleeps
peacefully like a baby.
Quietly, gently, he eases out of
bed and walks to the open window.
He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.
Then in the
distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the
water, once, twice, a third time.
JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down
next to JOHANA.
She is still sound asleep.
JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep.
JACQUES' absence wakes her.
JOHANA
Jacques?
She gets up and walks over to the balcony.
She doesn't
see anything.
TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
The train station faces the sea.
JACQUES and JOHANA are
standing on the platform, amid others.
In the distance we
hear the rumble and whistle of a train.
JOHANA gets on the train.
The station master blows his
whistle.
JACQUES
Will... will we see each other
again?
JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.
JOHANA
Take good care of yourself, Jacques.
The train starts pulling out of the station.
JACQUES
Where can I call you?
Johana, tell
me where can I call you?
JOHANA doesn't answer.
JACQUES stands helplessly in the
station, his eyes filled with tears.
ENZO'S ROOM - DAY
ENZO opens the door of his suite.
His hair is messed up,
he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top
of a diving suit.
JACQUES
Can I come in?
ENZO
No problem, I enjoy talking in my
sleep.
ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed.
He's lying on his stomach.
JACQUES walks in and lets
himself drop in a chair.
ENZO
Wake me up at 11:00.
ENZO closes his eyes.
JACQUES looks over at the clock, it
says 11:25.
JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares
blankly out of the window.
ENZO
(opening one eye)
Hmmm!
Something wrong?
JACQUES doesn't answer.
ENZO
Is it the girl?
JACQUES stares out the window.
ENZO
Did she leave?
No answer.
ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.
ENZO
Hey!
I'm going to take care of you!
I've got this job, on an oil rig, no
sweat!
I'm taking you along... Come
on!
Get your bags packed!
You're
coming with me, I tell you!
He pats him on the back.
ENZO
We'll make a great team, the two of
us.
You'll see!
DIVING CAPSULE - DAY
The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its
descent through a trap door in the deck.
It plunges into
the sea.
The three men in the capsule are:
JACQUES, ENZO and the
tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER, who is much too
professional for ENZO'S tastes.
ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER
concentrates on the control console.
He runs through a
checklist of systems.
JACQUES responds with a "check" as
he verifies each one.
ENZO is already bored and fed up by
the procedures.
JACQUES is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.
ENZO
(suddenly)
You still thinking about her?
JACQUES doesn't answer.
ENZO goes on.
ENZO
Don't think about her anymore!
Let
me tell you, you're just making
yourself unhappy!
There are so many
women in the world!
He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and
stares at NOIREUTER.
ENZO
Plenty of women everywhere right?
NOIREUTER
(coldly)
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
ENZO
It isn't lit yet.
NOIREUTER
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes
on board!
ENZO
Listen we're not supposed to piss
either but that doesn't stop you
from carrying "it" on board?!
NOIREUTER
(stubborn)
The rules are the rules.
ENZO
(checking out this
creature)
... What's your name again?
NOIREUTER
Noireuter.
ENZO
And where did you say you were from?
NOIREUTER
I didn't say...
(contemptuous)
Brussels!
ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly.
The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.
DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
A technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a
video screen.
The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder.
TECHNICIAN
They're at 450 feet.
DIVING CAPSULE - DAY
ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through
the porthole.
ENZO
... I was seventeen, I loved her so
much I tried to die for her.
Two
years later I couldn't even remember
her name!
Let me tell you, time
erases everything!
JACQUES
I don't want to erase anything.
ENZO
You'd rather think about it and make
yourself miserable?
JACQUES
(after thinking about
it)
... Yes.
ENZO
(smiles)
I give you this.
You're stubborn...
Dumb, but stubborn.
JACQUES
(taking it as a
compliment)
Thank you.
CAPSULE - DAY
The technician fiddles with a few knobs.
TECHNICIAN
Minus 800 feet.
End of descent.
DIVING CAPSULE
The diving capsule ends its descent.
The COMMANDER turns
to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole.
NOIREUTER
(with a Mickey Mouse
voice)
You have enough air for 15 minutes.
ENZO bursts out laughing.
ENZO
(with Donald Ducks
voice)
What's with the voice?
NOIREUTER
It's nothing.
It's just the helium,
because of the air pressure.
ENZO
(worried)
And... does the voice come back?
NOIREUTER
For others, yes... For you, who
knows?
ENZO
(still a little
worried, to Jacques)
Try speaking to me?
JACQUES
(with Daffy Ducks
voice)
I don't find this funny.
We were
having a serious conversation.
ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.
They keep these same
voice till the end of the scene.
ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.
ENZO
(to Jacques)
Here, give me your finger.
ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own.
Then NOIREUTER blows up.
NOIREUTER
(in a panic)
Is that alcohol?
Are you out of
your mind?
Alcohol is strictly
forbidden.
ENZO
(loosing his temper)
Hey!
D'you have any other
complaints?
Just make a list and
we'll stick it on the porthole!
Okay?
ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.
ENZO
Go on, suck your finger.
JACQUES hesitates.
ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks
his own finger.
NOIREUTER is petrified.
NOIREUTER
Are you crazy?
At this pressure?
JACQUES
It's very deep down here.
ENZO
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be
seeing mermaids everywhere!
JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.
ENZO smiles.
The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.
ENZO
(to Jacques)
A thousand commanders and we get a
Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.
UNDERWATER
ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first.
He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.
JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in
them.
They are both hilariously drunk.
DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM
The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control
room speakers.
He flips a communication switch.
SUPERINTENDENT
Can you hear me?
What's going on?
(to the technician)
Are you sure you're on the right
channel?
The technician nods back to him.
UNDERWATER
The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed
to be working on.
They have their arms around each other
and are dancing.
NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole.
He shakes
his head in complete disbelief.
CONTROL ROOM
We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese
waltz.
SUPERINTENDENT
If those guys are playing a radio
down there they'd just better watch
out!!
JOHANA'S APARTMENT
SALLY is talking away, pointing around the apartment.
SALLY
... And if we repaint the walls,
we'll need new curtains, you put the
painters on you Visa and I'll do the
curtains on American Express... for
the couch there's Bloomingdales...
or are you still over your limit?
JOHANA
(flatly)
Way past it.
SALLY
Does that have a hidden meaning?
JOHANA
No.
I'm just depressed.
SALLY
You look it too.
You haven't been
working out, you haven't been taking
your vitamins!
You haven't been
drinking your herbs, you haven't
been...
JOHANA
(stopping her)
I know, I know!
I'm a terrible
person...
(after a beat)
It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
SALLY
What is it honey... the frenchy?
JOHANA
(tentatively)
Do you think I should have stayed?
Don't you think maybe I should have
stayed?
I've been a jerk, right?
(then, emphatically)
I should have stayed!
I was
supposed to be in love... I was in
love!
I am in love, why did I act
like a bitch?
He went swimming.
All the man did was go swimming!
I
must be crazy.
It was too good to
be true.
SALLY
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and
see a doctor, will ya?
DOCTOR'S OFFICE - JOHANA - DAY
The doctor enters with a folder, speaks to JOHANA
DOCTOR
Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going
to do the trick this time.
JOHANA
(worried)
It's serious, right?
DOCTOR
I think so.
You're pregnant...
Congratulations!
If that's in
order?
JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.
JOHANA
It's in order!
Thank you.
Thank
you.
DOCTOR
I don't think it's me you have to
thank.
DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY
DUFFY is at his desk.
His lunch is spread out in front of
him.
Outside the window, the window-washers are eating
their lunch too.
JOHANA hurries in.
DUFFY
Good afternoon.
JOHANA
(agitated)
I came to make a clean breast of
everything... the whole business.
DUFFY
(bluffing, with his
mouth full of
sandwich)
Yes.
Of course.
Very wise.
JOHANA
(in a rush)
Remember when I went to Italy and
canceled the policy on the new
stadium.
Well, we weren't being
cheated by the Mafia or anybody
except maybe by me...
(she sees the window-
washers)
... Do they come for lunch everyday?
I really went on my own business, to
see a man that I happen to be in
love with... and I'm glad I did it,
but I'm sorry about the policy and
I'll be happy to make up the money
the company didn't get... of course
just now I don't have...
(she checks a note
she's holding)
One million, four hundred and ten
thousand dollars.
But if you were
to dock my salary, say, twenty
dollars a week, in a few hundred
years we'd be even... and I think
this is where you fire me?
DUFFY
(swallowing sandwich)
You're right.
You're fired.
JOHANA
Will that interfere with my getting
maternity leave?
I'm pregnant.
DUFFY
The Italian, I presume?
JOHANA
No.
He's French, he was just in
Italy for the competition.
DUFFY
(smiling)
He seems to have won it.
JOHANA
Yes, isn't it wonderful?
I'm so
happy.
I'll bet I'm the happiest
pregnant fired person in the world!
She starts to leave... calls out to the window-washers.
JOHANA
Bon appetit and Adieu!
JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
JOHANA stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan
apartment.
Hesitant, she walks around her telephone.
Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book
and dials the number.
JACQUES (V.O.)
Hello?
JOHANA
It's me... Johana.
JACQUES' APARTMENT
JACQUES is on the telephone, in front of a little window
overlooking the sea.
He is very glad to hear her voice.
JACQUES
How are you?
JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
JOHANA
I got fired.
JACQUES (V.O.)
... That's funny... I had this job
with Enzo... we got fired too.
JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER
JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay
window.
Day is dawning.
JOHANA
(looking out at the
skyline)
It's getting light out.
JACQUES (V.O.)
Here, it's getting dark.
JOHANA smiles.
She stretches, lies down on the carpeted
floor.
JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of
conversation.
JACQUES
I've been thinking about you a lot,
you know...
JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.
JOHANA
So have I.
(a beat)
... Hello?
JACQUES
I'm still here.
JOHANA
Well, then, talk to me some more.
JACQUES
... It's hard you know.
You're so
far away and I don't know what else
to say.
JOHANA
Then, tell me a story.
JACQUES
Uh... Ah!
A story?
He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet
dangling in mid air.
He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.
JACQUES
Do you know how it is?
(starting again)
Do you know what you're supposed to
do to meet a mermaid?
JOHANA
(with a smile)
No... tell me.
JACQUES
You go down to the bottom of the
sea, where the water isn't even blue
anymore, where the sky is only a
memory... and you float there,
quietly, quietly and stay there...
and you decide that you will die for
them... Only then do they start
coming out.
They come and greet you
and they judge the love you have for
them... If it's sincere.
If it's
pure... They will be with you and
take you away forever.
JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to
sleep.
JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES
The sun hits the roof tops.
The sea is sparkling.
The phone rings on the window sill.
JACQUES answers.
JACQUES
Hello?
JOHANA (V.O.)
It's me again.
JACQUES smiles.
JOHANA
(after a silence)
I'm being a pain, huh?
JACQUES
... Not at all.
JOHANA (V.O.)
You sure?
JACQUES
(smiling)
Absolutely positive.
JOHANA (V.O.)
Okay.
In that case... I'm at the
airport in Nice.
JACQUES doesn't know what to say.
He looks around him,
can't figure out what to do.
JACQUES
(lost)
Okay... huh, I'll be right over.
AIRPORT - DAY
JOHANA is standing in front of the airport.
JACQUES sees her.
They smile shyly at each other.
HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight
coming through cracks in the shutters.
JACQUES and JOHANA
are making love.
JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body
covered in sweat.
The rumpled sheets and the movements of
their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.
ALL SOUNDS
are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are
underwater...
ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.
Both of them act
like people who have never felt anything like this before.
A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.
An
increasing freedom.
All the muscles of their bodies
stretch to their limits.
JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.
His
image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into
unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of
someone melting, the screen is now totally blue.
A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.
From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts
TOWARD the CAMERA.
It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of
the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming
out of a dive.
He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the
CAMERA...
Until his head almost touches the lens...
A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of
JOHANA.
He looks down at her, speechless.
JOHANA
(a little frightened)
Are you okay?
After a long beat.
JACQUES
... I think I love you.
APARTMENT BUILDING - ANTIBES - DAY
JACQUES and JOHANA step out of the elevator of a 19th
century building.
JACQUES is carrying her suitcases.
JOHANA
Why did you take me to the hotel, if
you live here.
JACQUES
You'll understand.
JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the
door.
JOHANA
(surprised)
Someone in there?
JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's
carrying.
They enter a huge, very old apartment filled
with models and paintings of boats.
JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.
BATHROOM - ON UNCLE LOUIS (SORT OF)
It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom.
The centerpiece is a
deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet.
There's a
rippling shadow of a body under the bath water.
JOHANA gasps.
JACQUES
Don't be afraid.
It's my Uncle...
Louis.
He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube.
UNCLE
LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it.
LOUIS'
head pops out of the water, furious.
UNCLE LOUIS
Assassin!
JACQUES
(loud, as if speaking
to a deaf man)
Uncle Louis, this is my friend
Johana.
UNCLE LOUIS
Did you buy the cassettes?
The
Wagner, the Berlioz?
JACQUES
I brought Johana to meet you.
UNCLE LOUIS
Are you crazy?
I have no use for a
woman!
Since my accident.
JACQUES
No, no.
Johana is visiting me.
JOHANA
(tentatively)
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
(she looks to
Jacques)
JACQUES
(whispering to
Johana)
Uncle Louis.
He's a 75 year old
amazing guy, isn't he?
JOHANA
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle
Louis.
UNCLE LOUIS
(to Johana)
Did you bring the cassettes, the
Wagner, the Berlioz?
(pointing to Jacques)
This idiot never listens to anything
I say.
Sometimes I wonder if he
isn't deaf.
LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe.
Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the
bathtub.
We see that they're connected to small
underwater speakers.
As they surface, incredibly LOUD
MUSIC BLASTS:
the finale of the "1812 Overture",
(trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) The sound fills the
room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.
DINING ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - LOUIS - LATER
The three of them are at the table.
There are a few
scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth.
Incredibly LOUD SYMPHONIC MUSIC is PLAYING.
LOUIS is as
deaf as a fence post.
Everyone has to scream over the music.
UNCLE LOUIS
Where are you from, Henrietta?
JACQUES
(correcting him)
Johana... New York.
UNCLE LOUIS
What kind of name is that?
To be
named after a city?
JACQUES
(smiling)
He doesn't hear too well.
JOHANA
(yelling)
I said I was from New York.
UNCLE LOUIS
(yelling at Jacques)
That explains it!
The best lays are
from New York!
JACQUES
Uncle Louis!
UNCLE LOUIS
No, no.
It's true.
When I was in
New York, oh boy!
(to Johana)
Before my accident, you understand?
(then back to
Jacques)
JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.
JACQUES
(impatient)
Uncle Louis!
Johana is my friend.
She's come to stay with me for a
while.
UNCLE LOUIS
Good.
That way I'll see more of
you... Where are you going to stay?
JACQUES
Well... here.
UNCLE LOUIS
(outraged)
In my apartment?
JACQUES
(with a sigh)
It's my apartment.
UNCLE LOUIS
(jumping up)
Liar!
Thief!
Torturer!
When you
were an orphan I nursed you at my
breast.
JACQUES
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
UNCLE LOUIS
I'm going to put a lock on the
telephone.
(them calming down,
to Johana)
Did you bring the cassettes?
BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA
JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room
with a bed in it.
JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze.
JACQUES
(solicitously)
You think it'll be all right?
You'll be comfortable here?
JOHANA
(catching her breath)
It's going to be... interesting.
LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY
Loud classical music booms from the stereo.
The noise
pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs.
UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody.
ENZO
He's really going totally deaf!
UNCLE LOUIS
I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my
boy!
You take care of your eyes,
I'll take care of my ears!
ENZO
(laughing)
I'm sorry Uncle Louis.
UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.
UNCLE LOUIS
Come on, drink up, my boy!
It might
just save us from your bullshit.
The bottle is empty.
UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen.
JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell
which has been ringing.
JACQUES opens the apartment door:
it's Professor LAWRENCE.
Suit and tie and carrying a
bottle.
JACQUES
I'm glad you could come.
I want you
to meet Enzo.
ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.
LAWRENCE
(with a smile)
So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?
ENZO
(with an even bigger
smile)
In the flesh.
I have that honor!
BATHROOM - NIGHT
JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting
down the blaring music.
The paint is peeling off the
ceiling.
BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make-
up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror.
BONITA
You're going to live here
permanently?
JOHANA
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me
fix up the place a little.
JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on
her make-up like a professional.
BONITA
(wistfully)
He's shy, not like Enzo.
JOHANA
Yes.
Not like Enzo.
BONITA
(putting on
eyelashes)
I think, he's really nice... He's a
funny guy... sometimes even very
moving.
JOHANA
(after a long
silence)
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
JOHANA.
BONITA
Are you going to keep it?
JOHANA
Yes.
BONITA
Does he know?
JOHANA
No.
BONITA
(thinking)
Maybe you should talk to him about
it.
JOHANA
I can't... I just don't know how
to...
BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look.
JOHANA goes on.
JOHANA
I was thinking of something kinda
stupid last night.
You know those
women in the greek mythology that
made love with the Gods.
Take Leda
for example, sleeping with Jupiter,
who came to earth as a swan... Well,
can you imagine Leda announcing to
her swan "You're going to be a
father, my little chick-a-dee"?
BONITA
(starts laughing)
But your man isn't quite a God!
JOHANA
(smiles)
Probably not, but I still don't have
the nerve to tell him.
BONITA
Well, you're going to have to tell
him, sometime!
Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.
She changes the subject.
JOHANA
And you...?
Do you love Enzo?
BONITA
(earnestly)
Very much, I think.
(a beat)
But, there's going to be a problem.
JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.
She throws it
away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES
approaching.
JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.
He
seems bitter.
JOHANA
Well, how was it?
In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the
catalog.
JACQUES
(sadly)
Enzo had a bad day.
JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of
the baby magazine.
JOHANA
(tense)
And you?
JACQUES
I didn't dive.
JOHANA
(she takes the
magazine)
You'll try again tomorrow?
JACQUES
I don't know... it didn't feel
right.
I'm going to bed.
I'm tired.
He goes away.
JOHANA
You forgot your magazine!
He hasn't heard.
JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the
bed.
JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two
together.
JACQUES
What?
JOHANA
... Nothing.
DISSOLVE TO:
JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY
JOHANA opens the apartment door.
BONITA is standing
there, a suitcase in one hand.
BONITA
I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.
They kiss each other goodbye.
JOHANA is very uncomfortable.
JOHANA
You're leaving?
BONITA
Yes...
(she hands her a
note)
Could you please give this to Enzo.
JOHANA
Of course.
BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.
BONITA
It's no use... Just tell him I said
goodbye... And give him a kiss for
me, Okay?
The two women hug again.
JOHANA
(sorry)
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged
so easily.
BONITA
I don't have the strength to fight
off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to
spend their whole life waiting at
the end of a pier.
BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.
BONITA
Did you tell him?
JOHANA
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right
moment.
BONITA
... You take care of yourself,
Johana.
BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.
BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT
They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep.
The only light in the room comes from the open windows.
He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her
adoringly.
He slips off the chain with the gold coin.
Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over
her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it
rest there.
She opens her eyes and looks at him,
wondering if he senses something.
JOHANA
(softly)
What are you doing?
JACQUES
I'm putting you on the coin... Your
essence... That way you'll always be
with me when I dive.
She smiles, closes her eyes.
He swings the coin over her
face gently, some kind of private ceremony.
She looks
just a little intimidated.
The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.
She
hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin
slide into it.
HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
Through the open windows we can see parts of the village
where JACQUES grew up.
He's staring out the window, lost
in his own thoughts.
JACQUES
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up.
He walks to
her.
JACQUES
What's wrong?
JOHANA
It's nothing.
Just the long trip.
I'm a little jet-lagged.
JACQUES
You want to lie down for a while?
JOHANA
No, I'll be fine.
Can you just hand
me a glass of water?
While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the
view.
COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS
LAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.
There's a stack of graph
paper on a cabin table.
LAWRENCE
... When I analyzed the data from
Mayol's last dive, it became
apparent...
(taps the graph
paper)
... At the depths these men are
diving, it is a physiological
impossibility that they can retain
enough oxygen in their blood to make
it back to the surface.
It's a
function of how long it takes to get
to the bottom, orient themselves and
to return... To attempt to break
Mayol's record is simple suicide.
(to Novelli)
For the last time.
I'm telling you
cancel the competition.
NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform
where ENZO is concentrating.
MEDIC
Molinari's a seventeen time world
champion.
Do you want to tell him
he can't dive.
LAWRENCE doesn't answer.
NOVELLI is thinking.
NOVELLI
Get Mayol in here.
JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT
JACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.
JOHANA sits at his feet.
LAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.
He takes a pill
from a bottle and gives it to him.
LAWRENCE
Take this.
Have a good sleep.
JACQUES swallows the pills.
JOHANA walks over from the
balcony.
LAWRENCE
Sweet dreams.
LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.
He goes out of the room.
JACQUES
(tenderly to Johana,
who had started to
leave the room)
Kiss me.
JOHANA bends over and kisses him.
JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.
JOHANA
Sleep now.
We'll talk later.
JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.
JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT
JACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the
sheets.
He turns off the light by the bed.
HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA
They've moved from the bar to the table.
There is uneaten
food in front of them.
A third place is set.
JOHANA looks at the wall clock.
JOHANA
I'll go see how he's doing.
LAWRENCE
Let him sleep.
JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES
JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.
He
is breathing loudly, as if tired out.
From his POV the
room becomes very dark and blue.
The noise is unbearable.
The ceiling turns into water.
JACQUES' eyes are wide open.
His face is sweating.
The
water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he
is swallowed by it.
As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.
The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of
muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.
They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.
Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.
He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.
We see a sonar
picture.
It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later.
The dolphin comes up like a rocket,
gulps air and goes back down.
The sonar image appears again.
Finally, the dolphin,
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly
like a war plane.
He manages to break the group in two,
then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.
He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.
He
goes full power.
The fish he is after are even more
divided.
There is only one left, totally lost and in a
panic.
The exhausted fish is swallowed.
The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface
in slow motion.
Images becomes pale and bright.
He screams inhumanly.
Image is white, black, silence.
HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES
JOHANA opens the shutters.
The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and
glasses, lamps and vases.
The windows are blown out.
JACQUES is lying in bed.
There is a thin trickle of blood
coming from his nose and ears.
JOHANA
(in a panic)
Jacques... Are you alright?
