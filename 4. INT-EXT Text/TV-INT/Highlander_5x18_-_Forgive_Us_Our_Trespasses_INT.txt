      The hottest spot in town, peopled with the eclectic mix that
      makes a Paris club tops... models, artists, and the midnight
      crowd.  AMANDA, dressed sexilly in black, fits right in,
      she's moving through the crowd, bopping to the beat as she
      heads for the bar.

      A YOUNG GUY with an interesting haircut dances up to her,
      sashays suggestively -- wanna dance?  She looks him over.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe later.

      She moves on.  Then: the BUZZ.  Another Immortal.  Amanda
      checks out the crowd, and her eyes fix on...

      STEVEN KEANE

      who's definitely looking her way.

      This guy's hip, but not punk, dressed with flash and
        imagination.  An earring glints in one ear.  And his eyes
      glint as they settle on Amanda.

                                      KEANE
                          (as he approaches)

                          (as a joke)
                    You come here often?

                                      KEANE
                    I may have to start.
                          (off her smile)
                    Actually, I own the place.  Just
                    bought it.

                    Really?
                            (appraising)
                    New decor, better band, less water
                    in the drinks -- you've made quite
                    an investment here.

                                      KEANE
                          (off the crowd)
                    It seems to be paying off.

                                      AMANDA
                    Flavor of the month.

                    We'll see what kind of staying power
                    you have.

      Keane looks in her eyes and plays the moment.

                                      KEANE
                    I plan on making a lasting impression.

      Amanda returns his smile.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's optimistic of you.

      She likes this guy's style -- not to mention his obvious
      bankroll.  She leads him off the dance floor, to a quieter
      corner.

                                      KEANE

      MacLeod enters the darkened church.  Sees no one at first.

                    Amanda?

      She steps out of the shadows near the altar.  She looks a
      little shaky.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry...
                          (as Keane steps out
                            behind her)
                    I didn't have a choice.

                                      KEANE
                    I asked her to call you.

      MacLeod reads the dark look on Keane's face, understands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And now I'm here.

                    Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.

                    I know who you are.  I've hunted you
                    for more than 200 years.

      Steven Keane is shaking with fury as he pushes MacLeod:

                                      KEANE
                    Do you remember how many men you
                    murdered?  How I many lives you
                      destroyed?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes.

                                      KEANE
                    That's all you have to say?

                                      MACLEOD
                    What else is there?

                                      KEANE

                          (a look at AMANDA)
                    That gives you time to say your
                    goodbyes.

      He pulls open the door to leave, stops for one last word:

                                      KEANE
                    If you run, I ll find you.

      As Keane exits, to his departing back:

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't run.

      He looks after Keane grimly; Amanda watches him nervously.


      MacLeod is sleeping fitfully, tossing and turning.  Beside
      him, Amanda lies wakeful, watching him with worried eyes.

      We PUSH IN on MacLeod's face, hearing the SOUNDS of his dream:
      Swords CLASHING, men SHOUTING.

      NOTE: The following clips should be PROCESSED for nightmare
      effect -- distorted sound, stretched images.  Scenes from
      MacLeod's early life in Scotland are mixed with scenes from
      his post-Culloden rage, images and sounds overlapping.

      (SCENE 10606 FROM "FAMILY TREE")

      MacLeod's father comforts his dying son.

                    MacLeod.

      (SCENE 40131 FROM  HOMELAND")

      MacLeod calls out as he enters the hut:

                                      MACLEOD
                    Father?

      Inside, Mary MacLeod sits by her husband's body.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Father...


      Amanda reaches to tuck the covers over MacLeod.  As her hand
      brushes his shoulder, he comes suddenly awake, his eyes wide,
      and grabs her arm hard, defensively.  His free hand goes to
      his waist as though to pull a dagger.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod!

      He comes completely awake and realizes what he's doing. 

                                      AMANDA
                          (a slight quaver)
                    It's just me.

      He releases her, settles back, still shaky.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry, I just.... I was dreaming.

                                      AMANDA
                    You want to tell me about it?

      MacLeod just shakes his head.  Tousled and vulnerable, he
      looks like a scared child.

      Amanda wraps the blanket around him and snuggles down beside
      him, cradling him in her arms.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  I'm here.

      He nods tightly, his eyes still far away.  As he puts an arm
      around her and tries to settle back into the bed, we PUSH IN
      on his wide, stress-filled eyes, and we HEAR what he's hearing --
      the CLASHING of sword on sword, the SHOUTS of dying men...
      and the SCREAM of Rosemont's son.

      And off his haunted face....

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      A fifth-floor atelier with high ceilings and garret windows. 
      The open space is furnished eclectically, ultra modern mixed
      with ancient, all surrounding a comfy couch.  The only light
      in the room is moonlight through the tall windows, and the
      blue glow of a computer left running on an enormous desk
      littered with books and papers.

      Under the windows, an uncomplicated bed; and in it, a sleeping
      figure.  METHOS.

      The BUZZ hits and he rolls over even as he comes awake,
      slipping out of bed in a single graceful move, taking up his
      sword from its place nearby.

      He moves away from the windows, picking the best spot for a
      confrontation.

      There's suddenly loud POUNDING on the door and he turns that
      way, sword ready, as --

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    Methos!  Methos, open the damn door,
                    it's me!

      With a long suffering sigh, Methos lowers his sword and opens
      the door.

                    not sure they heard you in
                      Philadelphia.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry.  It's an emergency.

      She pushes the door open and comes in.

                                      METHOS
                    It's a good way to lose your head,
                    is what it is.

                    grouch?

      She reacts to the sight of him, standing there in nothing
      but his underwear, sword in hand.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Did I... interrupt something?
                          (off his empty bed)
                    A really good dream, maybe?

      Methos hasn't got the energy to spar with her.

                                      METHOS
                    Amanda... It's four in the morning. 
                    I wasn't exactly expecting company.
                          (a sigh)
                    Give me a minute.


      Methos, now dressed, and Amanda sit at the table with cups
      of coffee.  She's explained the situation to him.

                                      AMANDA
                    Do you know anything about this Steven
                    Keane guy?

                    Never met him.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe you could talk to MacLeod. 
                    Convince him Keane is wrong about
                    him.

      Methos gives her a startled look.

                                      METHOS
                    You want me to talk to MacLeod...
                    and tell him to stop worrying, he's
                    not a bad guy?
                          (off her nod)
                    Trust me, Amanda, that is not going
                    to work.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, we have to do something!
                          (earnest)
                    I've never seen him like this.  He's
                    really shook up.  You know how guilt-
                    ridden he can be.

                                      METHOS
                    And makes all of us.

                                      AMANDA
                    If he goes up againt Keane thinking
                    he deserves to lose, he'll lose.
                          (she can hardly say
                          it)
                    He'll die, Methos.

      And off Methos' reaction --


      A comfortable, wood-paneled room, lined with books and
        manuscripts.  SEAN BURNS sits listening behind his desk as
      Keane, haggard and travel-weary, paces around the room.

                                      KEANE
                    I've tracked him for thirty years,
                    Sean.  To Russia, to Constantinople,
                    across North Africa, even as far as
                    China.  But I'm always a day behind,
                    a week behind, a month behind.  A
                    year ago his ship went down off
                    Shanghai; since then, nothing.  I'm
                    beginning to think I'll never catch
                    up with him.

                                    SEAN
                    Maybe it's for the best, my friend.

                    What do you mean?
                          (intense)
                    I swore on Richard Dunbar's body
                    that I would find the man who killed
                    him.  I swore to his wife and children
                    that I wouldn't rest until MacLeod
                    was dead.

                                    SEAN
                    And for thirty years you've thought
                    of nothing else.
                          (beat, quiet)
                    Thirty years that might have been
                    spent helping Dunbar's family.  Thirty
                    years of your life, wasted.
                          (beat)
                    It's long enough, Steven.  Let it
                    go.

                                      KEANE
                    How can I?  How can I, when that
                    murderer is out there?

                                    SEAN
                    You're so certain you have to kill
                    him.
                          (beat)
                    What do you know about Duncan MacLeod,
                    Steven?
                          (off Keane's look)
                    Do you know why he left Europe?  Why
                    he went East?

                                      KEANE
                    Does it matter?

                                    SEAN
                      Everything matters.

                                      KEANE

                    In every century I've lived, there's
                    been a war the kings and generals

                    And there ve been men like you,
                    Dunbar, and MacLeod, fighting on one
                    side or another, always believing in
                    their hearts that theirs was the
                    side God was on.

                                      STEVEN
                    You don't have to lecture me.

                                    SEAN
                    I'm not finished.
                          (beat)
                    Until one day they look around.  And
                    they're sick and they want to wretch
                    for the pain of it.  And they ride  -
                    ride until they can't ride anymore,
                    hoping they'll find something
                    different across the steppes, or
                    across the Atlantic.  Hoping, praying
                    they won't have to keep killing.

      He rises and comes to Keane, takes him by the shoulders.

                                    SEAN
                    And one day, Steven, that day will
                    come for you.

                    I pray no one haunts your steps.

                    Let MacLeod be.  Let the war be
                    over... for both of you.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod enters with the Inspector and a couple of Uniformed
      Cops.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about telling me what this is
                    about, Inspector?

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    We received an anonymous tip.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And do you always send five men and
                    two patrol cars out on anonymous
                    tip?

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I like to be thorough.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    The caller was very persuasive.  And
                    very specific.
                          (gesturing to the bed)
                    With your permission?

      MacLeod shrugs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do I have a choice?

      The Inspector nods to one of the Uniforms, who tosses aside
      the bedclothes and shifts the mattress to reveal

      A NECKLACE

      of diamonds and pearls.

      THE INSPECTOR

      lifts the necklace with a pen and drops it into an evidence
      baggie.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I expect you'll tell me you've never
                    seen this before.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (resigned)
                    How about we skip that part and you
                    go ahead and tell me where you think
                    I got it.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    It belongs to a collection of pieces
                    that were stolen from the Countess
                    Pekowsky three years ago.  The
                      collection was valued at something
                    over three million dollars.  This
                    necklace alone is worth $750,000.
                          (beat)
                    You're under arrest, Mr. MacLeod.

      And, as the Uniform snaps the cuffs on MacLeod --


      Where Amanda sits on the other side of the bulletproof
      Plexiglas divider from MacLeod.  There's a guard just out of
      earshot of their intense whispers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, this is amazing, even for
                    you.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know, that necklace would bring
                    half a million, even hot.
                          (with a smile)
                    But you're worth it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is not funny!

                                      AMANDA
                    No, it's not funny, it's deadly
                    serious.
                          (beat)
                    You're safe in here.  With your
                    squeaky clean record, you'll get a
                    couple, three years, tops for the
                    Pekowsky job.

                    Who knows?  Two, three years, anything
                    can happen.  Maybe we'll get lucky
                    and someone'll whack him before you
                    get out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dammit, Amanda, you can't do this.

      MacLeod slams the table.

                                      AMANDA
                    Look, I know you're upset now, but
                    you'll thank me later.
                          (making light)
                      I couldn't let you just get killed.

                    Amanda, listen to me.  I want you to
                    get me out of here.  Whatever it
                    takes, you do it.

                    Nope, I've invested a lot of time in
                    you, MacLeod.  I want to keep you
                    around.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (intense)

                    I don't think so... The guy's good. 
                    If you had it together, I'd say six
                    to five on you, but in your present
                    state...

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

      The Guard looks over at MacLeod's shout; MacLeod schools his
      voice back down to a low growl.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I have to have this fight.  It's the
                    only way to settle this.
                          (not amused)

                    You can try busting out, but then
                    you'll be a wanted man.  Probably
                    have to leave France.  Either way,
                    you're out of Keane's reach for a
                    while.

      She stands with a satisfied smile.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry, I'll visit you every.day.

      She turns with a little wave and is out the door.

      MacLeod stares after her for a beat, something brewing in
      his mind.  Then he turns to the hovering Guard.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I need to see the Inspector.


      Keane waits, alert, sword in hand.  He gets the BUZZ.

                                      KEANE
                    There you are.

      He stands ready by the door.

      It opens, and Keane grabs the man who comes through, yanks
      him inside, throws him against the wall, his sword going to
      his throat.

      It's METHOS.

                                      METHOS
                          (Not.)
                    Sorry.

      Keane backs off, but not much -- still holding Methos hard
      against the wall.

                                      KEANE
                    Where's MacLeod?

                                      METHOS
                    I thought he'd be here.
                          (re Keane's sword)
                    You mind?
                          (off Keane's hesitation)
                    Or were you planning to use it?

                                      KEANE
                    What makes you think I won't?

                                      METHOS
                    Call me a student of human nature.

                                      KEANE
                          (pressing the blade)
                    Tell me where to find MacLeod.

                                      METHOS
                          (simple)
                    No.

      There's a beat, their eyes locked.  Then Keane, with a
      frustrated snarl, shoves Methos away and storms out.

      Methos blows a sigh of relief, glad he was right about Keane.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    I love good guys.


      MacLeod sits at a conference table.  The Inspector paces in
      front of him.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    You're trying to tell me that a single
                    woman was responsible for the Pekowsky
                    job, and the break in at the Musee
                    D'Orsay, and that little business at

                    Yes.

                    Some of these cases have been open
                    for five or six years.  Imagine the
                    reaction when you solve them all in
                    one day.

      There's a beat as the Inspector considers MacLeod.  He looks
      back evenly, a master's poker face in place.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      Amanda paces furiously.  Methos watches her with detached
      amusement, pouring out a couple drinks.

                                      AMANDA
                    That son-of-a-bitch! That double-
                    dealing swine!
                          (beat)
                    How could he do this to me?  There's
                    cops all over my house, he even gave
                    up my secret stash of rainy-day
                    jewels.
                          (off Methos' look)
                    Well, one of them.

                                      METHOS
                    Honestly, Amanda, what did you expect? 
                    You framed him and got him sent to
                    prison.  Did you think he'd just sit
                    still for that?

      He holds out a glass.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Have a drink.  You'll feel better.

      She ignores it.

                                      AMANDA
                    Ratted out by my own friend.

                                      METHOS
                    Correct me if I misunderstood you,
                    but wasn't that after you framed
                    him?

                                      AMANDA
                    I save his life.  And he turns on
                    me!

                                      METHOS
                    I know the feeling.

                                      AMANDA
                          (with emotion)
                    I was trying to help him.  I didn't
                    care how mad he got at me, as long
                    as it kept him alive.

      Her voice catches on her very real worry.  Methos reacts,
      puts down his glass and moves to her.

                                      METHOS
                    I know.
                          (small comfort)
                    Look, you did what you could.  We
                    both did.  Now it's up to him.
                          (beat)
                    MacLeod's lived this long.  That's
                    not luck.

                                      AMANDA
                    But it's not all skill, either.
                          (beat)
                    He's fought guys older than him,
                    maybe even guys better than him, and
                    won.  Because he never gives up, not
                    when he thinks he's right.

                                      METHOS
                          (a wry smile)
                    And it can be damned annoying, let
                    me tell you.

                                      AMANDA
                    But not this time.  This time his
                    heart's not in it.
                          (beat, with real fear)
                    What if he doesn't win?  What if he
                    doesn't come back?

      As Methos awkwardly moves to comfort her --


      MacLeod sits pensively, his thoughts with Darius.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know what happens to us when
                    we die, Darius.  I don't know if
                    maybe you're still here somewhere,
                    listening to me.
                          (beat)
                    I hope you are.

      There's no response from the quiet church, but MacLeod finds
      the strength to continue:

                                      MACLEOD
                    I can't tell you the number of times
                    I've wished you were here so I could
                    talk to you.  There are so many things
                    I didn't ask you.

                          (beat)
                    What happened to you, Darius?  Did
                    you wake up one morning and decide
                    you were sick of the death and the
                    blood and the sounds of men dying?

      There's a long silence as MacLeod gathers his thoughts into
      words, then:

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    He's a good man.  I don't want to
                    kill him.
                          (beat)
                    All he's done is judge me.  Like
                    I've judged others.
                          (emotional)
                    I'm so tired of killing.  I'm so
                    tired of deciding who to kill.

      He looks up at the altar, at the cross.


      The night is still young, the place isn't crowded yet.  Keane
      and Amanda are at his table in a quiet corner.

                                      KEANE
                    If you've come to talk about MacLeod
                    you're wasting your breath.

                                      AMANDA
                    Humor me.

                    Look, Steven, I don't know you.  But
                    I know MacLeod.  I know he's a guy
                    who doesn't make promises he can't
                    keep.  Who carries a grudge a long

                    Maybe.  'Cause that's the kind of
                    mistake you make when you think it
                    matters who lives and who dies.

                    I've been around a lot longer than
                    either of you, and I can tell you,
                    it isn't going to make one bit of
                      difference to the big bad world
                    whether you kill him or he kills
                    you.
                          (beat)
                    But it makes a difference to me.  It
                    makes a difference to a lot of people
                    who care about MacLeod.  Why don't
                    you try thinking about them?

                    Because that doesn't matter.

                                      AMANDA
                    Listen to yourself.  Isn't that what
                    MacLeod was thinking when he went
                    after your friend -- that his idea
                    of justice was more important than
                    the people he was hurting?

      Whatever answer Keane is about to make is interrupted as the
      both get the BUZZ.

      MACLEOD

      enters the club and heads for them.  Keane rises, leans down
      to Amanda.

                                      KEANE
                          (with surprising
                            sincerity)

                    When you are.
                          (to Amanda)
                    You keep out of it.

      Amanda is about to object.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I mean it.

      She nods, tears welling, says nothing.  Keane sees it, has a
      moment of sympathy.

                          (to MacLeod)
                    On the roof.  Five minutes.

      He nods to Amanda, turns and heads out.  MacLeod turns to
      Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (without anger)
                    This has to happen.

      She's done arguing.  Knows she can't convince him.  Instead,
      she moves into his arms, holds on tight.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know.

      She steps back, meets his eyes.  Forcing her voice steady:

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Okay, MacLeod, you listen to me. 
                    You're going up there, it's not about
                    Culloden, it's not about the Earl of
                    Rosemont, you forget about all of
                    that.
                          (through tears)
                    You just think about coming back,
                    okay?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a wry smile)
                    With my shield, or on it.

      Not exactly the answer she was looking for, but she'll take
      it.

      He kisses her gently and heads out.


      MacLeod, Amanda and Methos having a drink together.  The
      atmosphere relaxed and comfortable -- a new understanding
      has been reached.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You were really afraid I'd lose.

      Methos looks over with a wry half-smile.

                                      METHOS
                    And you weren't?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.
                          (beat)
                    I knew Keane was good.
                          (to Amanda)
                    And I know you think I wanted him to
                    win.  But it wasn't that.
                            (thoughtful)
                    I had to fight the best fight of my
                    life, knowing he'd do the same....
                    and trust the fates to decide the
                    winner.

      Amanda looks at him, not quite getting it.  Methos does,
      though.

                                      METHOS
                    Trial by combat.  A bit outdated,
                    but it has its place.
                          (a satisfied nod)
                    Whoever survives is proved right in
                    the eyes of the law.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something like that.

                                      AMANDA
                    But you let Keane live, too.  So
                    then who's right?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I never said it was simple.

                                      METHOS
                      Redemption never is.

      MacLeod nods in Methos' direction.

                                      AMANDA
                    And what if he comes after you again?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He won't.

                                      AMANDA
                    How do you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because I wouldn't.

                                      AMANDA
                    He's not you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And he's not that different.

      MacLeod shoots a look at Methos, measuring, before continuing:

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    None of us are.  We all make
                      mistakes... and we all have mistakes
                    to forgive.

      Methos meets his eyes, lifts his glass in silent
      acknowledgment of the unspoken message.

      MacLeod returns the toast.

      The moment between the two men is broken as Amanda puts her
      glass down and stands.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, time to hit the road.  It seems
                    there's this Inspector who is
                      determined to throw my cute little
                    butt in jail.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (amused)
                    Sorry about that.

                                      AMANDA
                          (light)
                    You're forgiven.

      She leans in to kiss him.

                                      METHOS
                    I think that's my cue.

      He drains his glass, grab's his coat, and heads for the door
      as Amanda starts moving MacLeod toward the bed.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
