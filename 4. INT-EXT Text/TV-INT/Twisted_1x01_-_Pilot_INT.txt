      A much less innocent Jo BOLTS AWAKE in bed, terrified.     

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Jo!  Breakfast is ready!

      She s sixteen now, with a small, metal STUD in her nose and 
        experimental purple streaks running through her messy, light-
      brown hair.  There s a hardness to her, but beneath that 
      rough edge, there s a plain, unassuming prettiness, as well 
      as a carefully concealed vulnerability.  She sits in bed, 
      catching her breath... bracing herself for the day to come.   

                                  NEWS ANCHOR VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                    Ryder s return to Green Grove High 
                    has been met with controversy...


      Jo, now dressed in baggy jeans and a loose, grey sweatshirt, 
      eats breakfast with KYLE (forties), her sturdy, handsome 
      father/town sheriff.  He watches her push her eggs around on 
      the plate distractedly, eyes locked on the LOCAL NEWS:    

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                    He was released yesterday from the 
                    Juvenile Detention Facility that s 
                    held him for five years, since he 
                    strangled his aunt, author Judith 
                    Ryder, while she baby-sat for him 
                    and two friends... 

      ANGLE ON TESS, Jo s gentle, naturally beautiful artist mom 
      (forties), cleaning dishes as she stares at the TV, uneasily.                                                                                            3.


                                  TESS
                    Can we turn that off now, please?    

                                  JO
                    This is my new reality.  I might as 
                    well get used to it.  

                                  TESS
                    I know, sweetie.  I just think 
                    you ll feel less tense if you try 
                    not to focus on it so much. 

                                  JO
                    I ll feel less tense once I see the 
                    lunatic freak and tell him I hate 
                    his guts.    

      Tess and Kyle exchange concerned looks.  Tess sits down at 
      the table across from Jo, blocking her view of the TV.    

                                  TESS
                    Jo, your dad and I have been 
                    talking, and... well...

                                  KYLE
                    We think you should start seeing 
                    Dr. Shin again.  

                                  JO
                    No.  Hell no.  That guy smelled 
                    like cat food.

                                  KYLE
                    Which is why we can afford him.  

                                  TESS
                    This is a lot to handle...

                                  JO
                    Mom, I m fine. 

                                  KYLE
                    You just said you wanted to yell at 
                      a confessed, unrepentant murderer.  

                                  TESS
                    Kyle.  Unrepentant murderer?  

                                  KYLE
                    I m just stating a fact, hon.   

                                  TESS
                    I know that, dear... but no one 
                    knows why Danny did what he did.                                                                                      4.


                                  KYLE
                    Yeah, because he wouldn t explain 
                    it to me.

                                  TESS
                    He was a scared little kid.  So 
                    now, what?  He should be condemned 
                    for the rest of his life?  

                                  KYLE
                    I never said that.  I just want our 
                    daughter to be safe.     

                                  TESS
                    And that s not what I want?   

      They stare each other down, tensely.  Jo observes them.

                                  JO
                          (wryly)
                    Wow.  Maybe you two are the ones 
                    who should go see Dr. Shin. 

                                  TESS
                    This isn t about us.  You need to 
                    talk to someone. 
                          (then, cautiously)
                    How about Lacey?  Have you tried 
                    reaching out to her?   

                                  JO
                    Uh, no.  Why would I do that?  

                                  TESS
                    This is something only the two of 
                    you have in common. 

                                  JO
                    We have nothing in common.  

      Jo s eyes wander back to the TV, as the ANCHOR recalls the 
      tragedy that s befallen the Ryder family since Danny s crime.  
      He talks over FOOTAGE of a Coast Guard ocean search: 

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    It was just five months ago that 
                    Ryder s father, real estate 
                    developer Martin Ryder, fell off a 
                    company yacht while intoxicated.  
                    His body was never recovered...

      The news then abruptly CUTS TO FOOTAGE of a BMW pulling into 
      a driveway outside of a big Colonial three-storey house.                                                                                        5.


      A swarm of REPORTERS rush the car, as a harried KAREN RYDER 
      (late forties), botoxed and dressed in her designer best, 
      steps out of the driver s side, pushing past the MOB.      

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    Widowed Karen Ryder returned home 
                    last night with her son...

                                  KYLE
                    Karen never changes.  Always ready 
                    for her close-up.  

      Tess stares at the TV.  Unlike Kyle, she looks sympathetic as 
      she watches Karen struggle to reach her front door.  

      Suddenly, the CAMERA jerks away from Karen to a SECOND PERSON 
      emerging from the car, barely visible amongst the MOB.  Jo 
      tenses: It must be him.  She leans toward the TV, struggling 
      to catch a glimpse of Danny, but she can t get a good look.  

      She shoots her parents a reassuring smile, then turns back to 
      the TV, anxiously: What will it be like facing him again? 

        ESTABLISHING - THE TOWN OF GREEN GROVE

      A picturesque small town nestled in the FORESTS of upstate 
      New York.  It runs the socioeconomic spectrum with everything 
      from towering, baroque HOUSES to quaint, one-storey COTTAGES 
      lining the residential streets.  A hilly MAIN STREET packed 
      with shops, bars and restaurants winds through the 
      classically Americana town center.       


      Kyle and Jo pull up outside the school, taking in the CHAOS.   

                                  KYLE
                    You gonna be okay?

                                  JO
                    Sure.  I ve gotten pretty good at 
                    ignoring reporters. 

                                  KYLE
                    I m not talking about reporters.
                          (then, concerned)
                    I hope you weren t serious about 
                      confronting him.                                                                                      6.


                                  JO
                    It s not like I can just pretend he 
                    isn t here. 

                                  KYLE
                    That s exactly what you should do.     

      Beat.  Jo stares out her window at the frantic activity. 

                                  JO
                    I can t believe he came back.  I 
                    just wanted to get through the next 
                    three years and get the hell out of 
                    here, and now... it s like, 
                    suddenly I m eleven again. 

      Kyle sighs, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.  

                                  KYLE
                    Call me if you need me, okay?  I 
                    can be back here in five minutes. 

                                  JO
                    Tone it down, dad.  He s not gonna 
                    come at me with a battle axe. 

      She kisses him goodbye, takes a deep breath, and gets out of 
      the car.  Off Kyle, watching his baby enter the fray. 


      Lacey walks the hall with her best friends, gorgeous, 
      energetic, outgoing REGINA, and petite, acerbic, tough-as-
      nails SARITA.  Regina smiles down at her I-PHONE.     

                                  REGINA
                    Ooh, look, Lace.  Your  socio  line 
                    is trending on Twitter. 

                                  LACEY
                    Good.  Maybe he ll get the hint and 
                    stay away from me. 

                                  SARITA
                    He better.  He ll wanna run crying 
                    back to his padded cell if he tries 
                    to mess with our girl. 

                                  LACEY
                    Okay, let s maybe focus on not 
                    pissing off the psychotic killer. 

                                  SARITA
                    Whatever, he doesn t scare me.  I m 
                    a fourth German.          

                                  REGINA
                    And you know I ve been really mean 
                    since I went off carbs.  We have 
                    your back, Lace.         

      Lacey smiles, grateful for her supportive besties.  ARCHIE, 
      her hot, athletic boyfriend, strides up, nuzzling her ear. 

                                  ARCHIE
                    Saw you on the news.  You re sexy 
                    when you re all traumatized.  

                                  LACEY
                          (sarcastic but playful)
                    Aww, thanks Arch.  I m glad my 
                    scarred psyche turns you on.    

                                  ARCHIE
                    Don t stress out.  Fifty bucks says 
                    the freak transfers out once he 
                    realizes everyone here hates him.                                                                                       9.


                                  LACEY
                    I still can t believe they let him 
                    back in.   Fully reformed  my ass. 

                                  SARITA
                    Yeah, like he d really admit during 
                      a psychological profile that he 
                    wants to drown puppies. 

                                  ARCHIE
                    Come on now, let s be fair... the 
                    guy s a strangler, not a drowner.    

                                  REGINA
                    I heard Danny s mom had to seduce 
                    Principal Mirel to get him back in.  
                    Like, a full-on, shut the blinds, 
                    clear the desk office hook-up.       

                                  LACEY
                    Okay, that s disturbing.  Why would 
                    she do that?  This school isn t 
                    even that good. 

                                  SARITA
                    Weird, freaky people do weird, 
                    freaky things.  
                          (then, noticing someone)
                    Speaking of weird and freaky...

      REVERSE ON Jo, walking toward them.  She hurries past Lacey 
      and her friends, approaching her locker and opening it.  

                                  REGINA
                    Her hair makes me sad. 

                                  SARITA
                    I can t believe you used to be such 
                    good friends with her, Lace.  What 
                    did you two even talk about? 

                                  LACEY
                    Yeah, like I even remember.  

      She s trying to act blase, but there s a tinge of regret in 
      Lacey s tone.  Archie kisses her goodbye. 

                                  ARCHIE
                    Gotta run, Mr. Kane is a lateness 
                    Nazi.  See you at lunch.

      He leaves.  Lacey watches Jo, sorting through her locker.  
      Regina and Sarita walk off to go greet some FRIENDS, as Lacey 
      peels away from them, cautiously approaching Jo.                                                                                     10.


                                  LACEY
                    Hey.  How you holding up?

      Jo reacts, surprised that Lacey s actually talking to her.   

                                  JO
                    Okay, I guess.  You?

                                  LACEY
                    Okay.  My mom s pissing me off.  
                    Danny coming back is the perfect 
                    excuse for her to bulldoze her way 
                    into my life, you know?     

                                  JO
                    Yeah.  My parents are trying to 
                    force me back into therapy.   

                                  LACEY
                    Yikes.  That s a bummer.
                          (then)
                    Have you... started having those 
                    dreams again?

                                  JO
                          (guarded)
                    No.  Not really. 

                                  LACEY
                    I have.  He s always squeezing that 
                    yellow jump rope... like it s a 
                    part of him, or something. 

                                  JO
                    Red.
                          (off her look)
                    It was a red jump rope.  I think. 

      They share a brief moment of connection, before Jo breaks it, 
      turning back to her locker.  Lacey watches her, conflicted.   

                                  LACEY
                    Look, I know you probably won t 
                    even care, and it s not your scene, 
                    but me and my friends are having 
                    this party tonight...

      Jo perks up, caught off guard by this social invite, 
      especially from Lacey.  But she quickly swallows her eager 
      excitement, turning back to Lacey with casual disinterest. 

                                  JO
                    On a school night.  You crazy kids.                                                                                     11.


                                  LACEY
                    Yeah, well... Regina s parents are 
                    out of town, so we thought we d 
                    throw a little  Michael Myers goes 
                    to our school now, let s blow off 
                    some steam  kind of shindig...
                          (off Jo s apparent lack of 
                            interest)
                    Pretty much everyone s coming, 
                    so... whatever, I don t care.  If 
                    you wanna come, you can.        

      Jo deflates, hurt by what she now assumes is a pity invite.

                                  JO
                    Don t do me any favors.   

                                  LACEY
                    That s not what I...

                                  JO
                    It s not like I lie around wishing 
                    I could party with your lame, 
                      superficial friends, anyway.  

                                  LACEY
                          (turning cold)
                    Fine.  Then don t come. 

      Tense beat.  Jo looks like she regrets her harsh reaction, 
      but she doesn t say anything.  They just stand there 
      awkwardly, the wall back up between them.  Suddenly, the hall 
      goes SILENT.  Jo and Lacey turn around, REACTING TO:  

      DANNY has arrived.  He stands in the middle of the hall, 
      emanating a brash, sexy charisma, his eyes lit from within 
      with a magnetic glow.  The air around him almost seems to 
      buzz.  STUDENTS gape at him, hateful, fearful, fascinated... 
      some even lustful.  Danny takes in the stares, coolly and 
      confidently scanning the room, locking eyes with people, 
      seemingly un-intimidated... unwilling to back down.

      ANGLE ON Sarita and Regina, as Sarita leans in, whispering:  

                                  SARITA
                    Paging Dr. Lecter.  Your spawn is 
                    loose on aisle four.

                                  REGINA
                    I d let him loose on my aisle.  Who 
                    knew socio had sex appeal.

      BACK TO Danny, as he notices Lacey and Jo.  He starts to make 
      his way toward them, every eye in the hallway following him.                                                                                      12.


      Jo and Lacey watch him approach, frozen in place.  When he 
      finally reaches them, there s a tense SILENCE... until he 
      breaks into a playful, charming, boy-next-door GRIN:  

                                  DANNY
                    Boo!
                          (off their horror, quickly 
                            backpedaling)
                    Kidding.  Sorry.  So, uh... how are 
                    you guys?   

      They continue to stare at him, too startled to respond.  They 
      get a reprieve when PRINCIPAL MARK MIREL (forties), polished 
      with a hint of sleazy, walks up.  

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                    Mr. Ryder.  Come with me please. 

      Danny flashes them one more quick, friendly smile, before 
      turning and walking off with the principal.  

      CLOSE ON Danny s FACE as he walks away, his confident smile 
      dissolving into a nervous, worried expression: Coming back 
      here is gonna be much harder than he thought.  

      CLOSE ON Jo and Lacey, watching him walk away, both reeling 
      from their first Danny encounter in five years...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    13.


                                        ACT TWO


      Danny and his mother KAREN sit opposite Principal Mirel. 

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                      Academically, I think you ll be 
                    fine.  I see you passed all your 
                    entrance exams with flying colors.   

                                  KAREN
                    I m extremely proud of him. 

                                  DANNY
                          (to Mirel, pleasantly)
                    I had plenty of time to prepare.  
                    Five years of non-stop study hall.  

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                    Yes, yes... that s certainly true. 
                          (awkward beat)
                    Socially, however... well, this 
                    isn t going to be easy.  Even my 
                    faculty is a little skittish. 

                                  KAREN
                    My Danny s a very social boy.  Once 
                    everyone gets used to having him 
                    back, things will begin to return 
                    to normal.  Right, sweetheart?      

                                  DANNY
                          (tightly)
                    Right, mother.  I m sure you ll be 
                    running the PTA again by Spring.    

                                  KAREN
                    That s not what I meant.  
                          (turning back to Mirel)
                    I ve lived in this town, in the 
                    same house, for goodness sake, my 
                    entire life.  As has Danny.  I just 
                    think that s worth the struggle.     

                                  DANNY
                    Yes.  So many happy memories here. 

                                  KAREN
                          (smiling tensely)
                    Let s talk about this later. 

      SILENCE.  The decision to stay in Green Grove is clearly a 
      major source of tension between them.  Mirel forces a smile.                                                                                       14.


                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                    Well, Danny, as I always like to 
                    say, the things that test us during 
                      adolescence turn us into the adults 
                    that we were always meant to be.     

      Danny stares at him.  He smiles to mask his annoyance.  

                                  DANNY
                    That s very wise, Principal Mirel. 

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                    And hey, it doesn t hurt to have 
                    such a beautiful, supportive mother 
                    guiding you.  Am I right?  

                                  KAREN
                    Oh, Mark.  Stop it. 

      They share a flirty laugh.  Danny subtly rolls his eyes.   


      Jo finishes gathering books from her locker, when she turns 
      to see Danny approaching.  She tenses, quickly shutting her 
      locker.  But before she can get away, he s reached her. 

                                  DANNY
                    Hey.  Sorry I had to run off 
                    before.  I had to meet with the 
                    principal to discuss my 
                       adjustment.   And yes, it was as 
                    painful as it sounds. 

      SILENCE.  Danny clocks the tension, struggling to maintain 
      his charming, easygoing smile.  Jo stares at him, coldly.  

                                  JO
                    I have to get to class.  So.       

                                  DANNY
                    Oh, okay.  Sure.   
                          (then quickly, re: her 
                            locker)
                    This yours?  
                          (smiling, playfully)
                    Any pictures of me in there?

      Jo maintains her icy glare.  Danny smiles, weakly.     

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Sorry, I m a little nervous.  Can t 
                    we just... chat?  Just for a couple 
                    minutes?                                                                                     15.


                                  JO
                    Chat?  You wanna chat?  Fine... 
                    let s chat.  What should we chat 
                    about first?  I know: How about my 
                    lost childhood?  Ooh, or my journey 
                    into the wacky, delightful world of 
                      post-traumatic stress!  

                                  DANNY
                    I m sure it s been rough.  I can t 
                    even begin to imagine...

                                  JO
                    No, you can t.  You weren t here. 

                                  DANNY
                    I tried to stay in touch at first.  
                    Didn t you get any of my letters?   

                                  JO
                    Yeah.  They burned great.  

      Danny takes in her pain and anger.  She starts to walk away, 
      but he blocks her, looking down at her, almost pleadingly:   

                                  DANNY
                    Jo, please.  It s me.  I m still 
                    the same boy you grew up with. 

                                  JO
                    The boy I grew up with wouldn t 
                    have hurt a fly. 

                                  DANNY
                    Look, it s not as if I just... I 
                    had a reason, okay?  

                                  JO
                    What, the little voices in your 
                    head tell you to do it? 

                                  DANNY
                    I m not some psycho.  Come on, Jo, 
                    you know me.  Better than anyone.   

      Beat.  Jo studies him, skeptically.    

                                  JO
                    I know you were never a big Aunt 
                    Judith fan.  So, what?  She do 
                    something to you?  Say something?   
                          (off his reluctance)
                    If you had an actual reason, why 
                    didn t you tell it to the police?                                                                                     16.


                                  DANNY
                          (sad, haunted)
                      Because... I couldn t.  I still 
                    can t.  I can t tell anyone that.  
                    Ever. 

      Jo takes this in, confused, uneasy... and maybe even a little 
      intrigued.  The bell RINGS, signaling the start of class.   

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Can you at least just show me how 
                    to get to my next class?  This 
                    place is like a giant maze. 

      He hands her his SCHEDULE.  Her face goes pale. 

                                  JO
                      Psychology with Mrs. Fisk.  That s 
                    my next class, too. 

                                  DANNY
                    Oh.  Well.  Lead the way then. 

      Off Jo, heading to Psych with her potentially psychopathic 
      former best friend.  So much for avoiding him.


      Eccentric, charismatic ROWENA FISK (forties) weaves through 
      the room, leading her CLASS-- including Jo, Danny, and 
      Lacey s boyfriend ARCHIE-- in a discussion of memory. 

                                  MRS. FISK
                    Semantic refers to stored facts and 
                    episodic to sequences of memories, 
                    but what is the deeper difference? 

      SILENCE.  Fisk scans her distracted class, realizing they re 
      all nervously eyeing one person.  She faces Danny.    

                                  MRS. FISK (CONT D)
                    Danny Ryder.  

                                  DANNY
                    Yes, uh... ma am?  Sorry, I m not 
                    caught up on all the reading. 

                                  MRS. FISK
                    I m sure you re not.  You ve been 
                    in my class ten minutes, and you 
                    already appear to be the most 
                      interesting thing about it.                                                                                      17.


                                  ARCHIE
                    Sorry, Mrs. Fisk.  None of us have 
                    seen a real psycho up close before. 

      Tense beat.  Jo observes Danny s reaction, but he takes the 
      moment in stride, calmly glancing at a grinning Archie.  Fisk 
      ignores Archie, staring intently at Danny.          

                                  MRS. FISK
                    Your nickname on Twitter is  the 
                    socio,  correct, Mr. Ryder? 

                                  DANNY
                          (covering his hurt)
                    Is it?  Huh.  I guess I should get 
                    into this whole Twitter thing.  

                                  MRS. FISK
                    Oh, you should, it s a delightful 
                    waste of time... and since, as you 
                    all know, I m such a huge champion 
                    of wasted class time, I guess we 
                    have no choice but to switch gears 
                    and discuss what s on everyone s 
                    minds.  So!  What is the definition 
                    of a  socio,  or its more common 
                      scientific synonym, socio-path?  

                                  ARCHIE
                    A person who wakes up every morning 
                    in a pool of someone else s blood?

      A few people CHUCKLE.  Archie shoots Danny another malevolent 
      smirk, but Danny ignores him, maintaining a stoic expression. 

                                  MRS. FISK
                    Actually, no... the majority of 
                      sociopaths do not have violent 
                    urges.  Anyone else?  

                                  JO
                      A sociopath has no conscience.  No 
                    guilt or remorse.  No ability to 
                    feel empathy for other people.   

      Jo glances at a surprised Danny.  She quickly looks away.   

                                  MRS. FISK
                    Good, Jo.  Who else has a...

                                  JO
                    Mrs. Fisk?  How can you... tell?  
                    If someone s a sociopath.  I mean, 
                    you can t read a person s mind.                                                                                     18.


                                  MRS. FISK
                    True, the human mind is essentially 
                      unknowable.  And while sociopaths 
                    may lack human emotions... they re 
                    damn clever at mimicking them.  

      The class studies Danny with anxious, suspicious faces.  An 
        increasingly isolated Danny can only smile, weakly: Could 
      this get any worse?  Only Jo watches him uncertainly, wishing 
      she could read his mind: Is he a sociopath, or isn t he?

                                  LACEY (PRE-LAP)
                    Please tell me you don t actually 
                    wanna have sex with a killer.  


      STUDENTS mingle between classes.  Lacey, Regina and Sarita 
      hold court at a prime table in the center of the room. 

                                  REGINA
                    I m sorry, I know you re still all 
                      traumatized, but he was only eleven 
                    when he did that.  I mean, nothing 
                    really counts before you re like, 
                    thirteen or fourteen.  I did ballet 
                    when I was eleven, but that doesn t 
                    make me a ballet dancer.  Although 
                    I did look great in that tutu.     

                                  LACEY
                    Are these words really coming out 
                    of your mouth right now?  

                                  SARITA
                    Chill, Lace.  She s all talk.  

                                  REGINA
                    Um, excuse me?

                                  SARITA
                          (teasingly)
                    Oh, come on.  If you actually 
                    hooked up with a fraction of the 
                    guys you thought were hot, you d be 
                    in the slut section of the Guinness 
                    Book of World Records by now.   

      Regina glares at her, annoyed.  They notice people whispering 
      and gossiping, and turn to see: 

      Danny has walked in.  He heads toward the VENDING MACHINE, 
      ignoring the whispering and staring.  Regina turns back to 
      Lacey and Sarita with a determined look.                                                                                        19.


                                  REGINA
                    All talk, huh? 
                          (then, calling out to him)
                    Socio!  Come over here!

      A mortified Lacey covers her face.  The whole room REACTS, 
      shocked that a popular girl has engaged with the socio.  
      Danny pauses, then tentatively approaches Regina, smiling.   

                                  DANNY
                    I m not sure I should start 
                      responding to that nickname...
                          (noticing Lacey)
                    Lacey.  I ve been looking all over 
                    for you. 

      Lacey doesn t respond.  Regina jumps up to greet him. 

                                  REGINA
                    I m Regina, Lacey s BFF, but we re 
                    more like sisters.  Right, Lace?

                                  LACEY
                    Right, Reg.  Will you girls excuse 
                    me?  I have Bio in ten.  

      She gathers her stuff and leaves, avoiding eye contact with 
      Danny.  He watches her walk away, sad and disappointed.   

                                  REGINA
                    She s super sensitive, but she ll 
                    come around.  Everyone will.  This 
                    school is actually very friendly.

                                  DANNY
                    Clearly.  I feel like I m in an 
                    episode of Glee, and everyone s 
                    about to break into song. 

                                  REGINA 
                    They let you watch Glee in prison?!

                                  DANNY
                    It was part of our punishment.

      Regina giggles.  Danny briefly locks eyes with Sarita, who 
      stares up at him with a dark, hateful intensity.      

                                  REGINA
                    So listen, I m throwing a little 
                    party at my house tonight.  You in?   

                                  SARITA
                    Regina.  What are you doing?                                                                                     20.


                                  REGINA
                          (to Danny, flirtatious)
                    Ignore Sarita, she s frigid.  So?  
                    What do you say?   

      Danny considers, smiling... when suddenly, he notices the RED-
      AND-GOLD NECKLACE Regina has on.  His face shifts to serious.     

                                  DANNY
                    Where did you get that necklace?

                                  REGINA
                    I don t know, I think it was a 
                    gift.  Why?  You like it?

      Danny doesn t respond, staring at the necklace, lost in an 
      odd, distracted daze.  Sarita observes him uneasily.  After a 
      few seconds, he snaps out of it, forcing a weak smile.

                                  DANNY
                    Thanks for the invite.  I ll try to 
                    stop by.

      With that, he turns and walks away.  Sarita stares at Regina.  

                                  SARITA
                    Are you high on hormones? 

                                  REGINA
                          (ribbing her, playfully)
                    I hope he s that intense in bed.


      Tess hands Karen a coffee and sits across from her on the 
      couch.  They sip their coffees.  The SILENCE grows awkward. 

                                  KAREN
                    I love what you ve done with this 
                    room.  Very... minimalist chic.                                                                                     21.


                                  TESS
                    Oh, well... thanks.
                          (then, sadly)
                    Karen, I m so sorry about Martin.  
                    I can t even begin to imagine what 
                    you ve been going through.  

                                  KAREN
                          (restrained but emotional)
                    Yes.  It has been difficult.

                                  TESS
                    I wanted to call, but, you know...

                                  KAREN
                    Your flowers were lovely, Tess.

      Another SILENCE.  Tess breaks it this time, forcing a smile. 

                                  TESS
                    Congrats on Danny s return.  You 
                    must be thrilled to have him home. 

                                  KAREN
                    Actually, that s why I m here.  I 
                    wanted to invite you and your 
                    family over for dinner this Friday. 

      Tess visibly tenses.  Karen notices, but she forges ahead:  

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    I thought it might be nice for 
                    Danny and Jo to start to get to 
                    know each other again.  She is his 
                    best friend...

                                  TESS
                    Was.
                          (then, quickly)
                    I don t think now is a good time. 

                                  KAREN
                      I understand your reluctance, I 
                    really do.  But Danny s a good boy, 
                    and he s facing a very difficult 
                      transition.  Jo embodies Green 
                    Grove for him.  I just think if 
                    they had a chance to...

                                  TESS
                    Karen, I m sorry.  It s just not a 
                    good idea right now.  

      Karen s face hardens... any warmth instantly dissipates.                                                                                       22.


                                  KAREN
                    Fine.

                                  TESS
                    But please, if you ever want to 
                    grab lunch or something... if you 
                    need someone to talk to...

                                  KAREN
                          (smiling ruefully)
                    Spare me your pity, Tess.  I ll be 
                    just fine.

      And with that, she stands and walks out.  A sad, guilty Tess 
      exhales heavily, watching her go.


      Jo and Rico sit at a booth, working on a problem set, physics 
      TEXTBOOKS open.  Jo looks like her mind is elsewhere.   

                                  RICO
                    So then, if we multiply that by the 
                    rate of acceleration, we get... 
                          (off Jo s distraction)
                    Someone who s apparently okay with 
                    an A minus on this problem set.  

                                  JO
                    What could he have meant?   

                                  RICO
                    Are you still thinking about your 
                    crazy psycho murderer friend? 

                                  JO
                    No.  And he s not my friend.  It s 
                    just... let s say you killed your 
                    aunt, but you believed you had a 
                    reason for doing it.  Wouldn t you 
                    wanna explain it to people?  Or, at 
                    least, tell it to the police?  

                                  RICO
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Uh, I don t know.  I like my aunt.  
                    She buys me presents and makes 
                    yummy apple cinnamon pancakes.  Why 
                    are you obsessing about this?   

                                  JO
                    When he said he couldn t tell, it 
                    was like he was... sad, or scared, 
                    or something.  It was so weird.                                                                                     23.


                                  RICO
                    Maybe it was just an act.  Maybe 
                    there is no reason.  Maybe he 
                    invented the whole reason thing 
                    just to make you feel bad for him.    

      Jo considers this theory.  She looks uncertain.    

                                  JO
                    You re right.  I m sure you re 
                    right.  He was just trying to 
                      manipulate me.       

                                  RICO
                    Exactly.  Now, as our generation 
                    might say, let s quit this here 
                      chillaxing and get all up in this 
                    dope problem set. 
                          (off her baffled look)
                       Chillaxing  is an artificial word 
                    combining  chill  with  relax ...

                                  JO
                          (amused)
                    Yeah, I got it.  Please never do 
                    that again.   
                          (forcing herself to focus)
                    Okay... where were we?  Mass times 
                      acceleration...

      ANGLE ON the ENTRANCE, as Danny walks in and approaches the 
      COUNTER.  SAM, a grizzled employee, tenses when he sees him.  

                                  DANNY
                    Sam!  Wow, you haven t aged a day.  
                    You have work done?  Chemical peel?  
                    Cheek implants?   
                          (off Sam s icy silence)
                    Skipping the banter today, I see.  
                    Can I get a piece of that best-on-
                      the-planet key lime pie?   

                                  SAM
                    You re making the other customers 
                      uncomfortable. 

      Danny turns to see ANXIOUS CUSTOMERS starting to recognize 
      him.  He turns back to Sam, forcing a friendly smile.  

                                  DANNY
                    I guess I ll have that pie to go.

      Sam goes to get the pie.  Danny sits at the counter, defeated 
      and isolated.  Suddenly, his eyes light up as he notices:                                                                                      24.


      ANGLE ON the BOOTH: Rico looks up and sees Danny.   

                                  RICO
                    Okay, Jo, whatever you do... don t 
                    turn around and then look up. 

      Jo turns and looks up at: Danny.  He smiles tentatively, 
      tossing her a quick wave.  She whips her head back around. 

                                  JO
                    Any chance he didn t see me? 

      Danny pays for his PIE.  He starts to leave, then stops.  He 
      considers, before slowly turning and approaching their booth.

                                  DANNY
                    Hey.  You re still a regular here, 
                    I see. 

                                  JO
                    Yup.  A fact you obviously didn t 
                    forget. 

                                  DANNY
                    I promise I m not stalking you. 
                          (holding up the to-go bag)
                    I came for the pie.  

      Jo tries to ignore him, looking down at her textbook.  Danny 
      absorbs her continued coldness.  He turns to Rico, smiling.     

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Danny Ryder.  Nice to meet you. 

                                  RICO
                          (quickly, nervously)
                    Hi, I m Rico, I m extraordinarily 
                      uncomfortable right now.  

                                  DANNY
                          (grinning)
                    Hey, you and me both, Rico. 

      Sam approaches them, staring pointedly at Danny.    

                                  SAM
                    People are starting to leave. 

      ANGLE ON the ENTRANCE, as anxious customers migrate out. 

      BACK TO THE BOOTH: Danny nods at Sam, relenting.  He glances 
      at Jo, and she quickly looks away... but beneath her 
      coldness, there s conflicted emotion.  Danny catches it.  He 
      leans in toward her, boldly.                                                                                      25.


                                  DANNY
                    If I had my choice, wanna know 
                    where I d be right now?  Anywhere 
                    in the entire world but here.  But 
                    it s not my choice, it s my mom s 
                    choice... so here I am.     

                                  JO
                    Okay.  Fine.  Am I supposed to feel 
                    bad for you?

                                  DANNY
                    No.  You have every reason to hate 
                    me.  I guess somehow I still 
                    thought you d be the one person 
                    who d give me half a chance. 

      Jo holds his look, trying to maintain her steely resolve. 
      Danny notices Sam s increasingly hostile glare.  He shoots Jo 
      one more pointed look, then turns and walks out with his head 
      held high, ignoring the stares of the other customers. 

      Rico exhales, relieved. 

                                  RICO
                    Wow.  I feel like I just lived 
                    through a Hitchcock movie.    

      Jo ignores him, turning to watch Danny disappear out the 
      front entrance, a glint of sympathy flashing across her eyes.  


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    26.


                                      ACT THREE


      An uneasy Kyle watches Tess work on a PAINTING. 

                                  TESS
                    I know.  It s a miracle.  

                                  KYLE
                    Uh-huh... who s she going with?  

                                  TESS
                    She didn t say.  A school friend? 

                                  KYLE
                    Who?  Rico?  Yeah, that one s a 
                    real social butterfly. 
                          (off her look)
                    I just think the timing is... odd.  
                    The day Danny gets back, she goes 
                    to her first high school party?                                                                                     29.


                                  TESS
                    Will you please stop being such a 
                    paranoid cop.  You heard her, she 
                     hates his guts.   Besides, she 
                    told me she barely saw him today.  
                          (tentative beat)
                    Speaking of which... Karen Ryder 
                    stopped by to see me.  She invited 
                    all of us over for dinner.

                                  KYLE
                    Oh God.  You didn t...

                                  TESS
                    Calm down, I said no.  

                                  KYLE
                    Good.  I can t believe she even 
                    asked.  Was she on drugs? 

                                  TESS
                    Stop it.  Show some sympathy.  She 
                    must be having a hard time. 

                                  KYLE
                    Okay, defending the kid was one 
                    thing, but Karen Ryder?  Really?  
                    After everything she said to you?  
                      Everything she did... 

                                  TESS
                    Her son had just killed her sister-
                    in-law, Kyle, she wasn t in the 
                    best emotional place.  Besides, I 
                    said some awful things to her, too.
                          (then, guiltily)
                    I told her she was a bad mother. 

                                  KYLE
                    She provoked you.  What she was 
                    asking of us was insane.  

                                  TESS
                    Was it?  All she wanted was for Jo 
                    to be a character witness at 
                    Danny s sentencing.  Maybe we 
                    should ve just let her...

                                  KYLE
                    No, absolutely not.  We did the 
                    right thing for our daughter.  

                                  TESS
                    I wonder if Jo would agree.                                                                                       30.


                                  KYLE
                    Of course she would.   

      Off an anxious Tess, hoping that s true...


      CLOSE ON an anxious Jo (now wearing a cuter outfit-- jeans 
      that fit and a yellow sweater), as she and Danny venture into 
      the loud, jam-packed party.  TEENS dance in a sweaty THRONG 
      to Lady Gaga s  Born This Way.   They gradually stop as they 
      notice the two unexpected interlopers. 

      ANGLE ON Archie and a few of his athletic MALE FRIENDS across 
      the room, glaring at Danny with threatening expressions.  

      ANGLE ON the ADJACENT ROOM, where Sarita stands with Lacey 
      and a few other POPULAR GIRLS.  Sarita nudges Lacey.

                                  SARITA
                    Look what the crazy dragged in.

      Lacey reacts, stunned to see Jo and Danny arriving together.   

      BACK TO the FRONT HALL, as the music CUTS OUT.  The TEENS 
      drift away from them.  Jo exhales.  Danny smiles. 

                                  DANNY
                    Don t take it personally.  That 
                    may ve been more about me than you. 

                                  JO
                    You re very perceptive. 

                                  DANNY
                    You can ditch me now, by the way, I 
                    won t be hurt.  Go, drink.  Mingle. 

      Jo nods, but remains frozen in place.  She catches Danny 
      observing her, grinning.  She turns defensive.  

                                  JO
                    I don t drink. 

                                  DANNY
                    Okay.  That s cool.  This is your 
                    first high school party, isn t it?  
                          (off her silence)
                    What a coincidence!  Mine, too. 

      Jo shoots him an amused eye roll.  

                                  JO
                    Cute.                                                                                        31.


                                  DANNY
                    I thought so.  Want some advice, 
                    one party virgin to another?  I d 
                    try a bit harder to hide some of 
                    that fear.  People can smell it.    

                                  JO
                    What, you learn that in prison?

                                  DANNY
                    Juvi, actually, but yeah... not the 
                    most welcoming crowd.  I had to 
                    learn fast that if you act like you 
                    belong, people will assume you do.  

      Jo softens a little, absorbing all that Danny s had to face 
      the past five years... before quickly hardening again.   

                                  JO
                    Yeah, well... I m not interested in 
                    belonging with these people.  

                                  DANNY
                    Then why d you come here? 

                                  JO
                          (pointedly)
                    Hey, gotta tell my grand-kids I did 
                    something stupid in high school. 

                                  DANNY
                    Good point.  And God forbid they 
                    think you weren t the most popular 
                    girl in the class.   
                          (then, noticing someone)
                    Speaking of...

      REVERSE ON Lacey in the next room, laughing with her friends.  
      She catches Danny shooting her a friendly wave.  She ignores 
      him and locks eyes with Jo, who also waves at her, weakly.  
      An uncomfortable Lacey waves back, then returns to her group.    

      Danny watches Jo, who s sadly watching Lacey.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    So... what happened with you two? 

                                  JO
                    I don t know.  I guess we outgrew 
                    each other.  Or, she outgrew me. 
                          (off his sympathetic look)
                    Hey, being friend-less has its 
                    perks.  I won t be one of those 
                    lame-o s weeping at graduation.                                                                                     32.


                                  DANNY
                    You and that Rico guy seem chummy.

                                  JO
                    I think he just wants to keep me 
                    close so I don t sneak past him for 
                      Valedictorian.

                                  DANNY
                    That s how it always starts.

      Jo laughs.  It s an unexpectedly nice bonding moment. 

      ANGLE ON the LIVING ROOM: Lacey watches Danny and Jo have 
      their nice moment.  She s not sure what to make of it. 

      BACK TO the HALL: A tipsy Regina skips over to Danny. 

                                  REGINA
                    Socio!  You came... !
                          (smiling tensely at Jo)
                    ... And look who you brought!

                                  JO
                    Lacey invited me, actually. 

                                  REGINA
                    Oh.  Okay.  Well, I m... so glad 
                    you made it, yay!  Come on, I ll 
                    introduce you to people.  

      Regina drags Jo away.  Danny turns back to Lacey, laughing in 
      her group.  Off Danny, gathering his courage...


      The DANCING TEENS have regrouped here.  Regina leads Jo in, 
      before turning and sizing her up with a competitive grin.

                                  REGINA
                    So!  What s up with you and Danny? 

                                  JO
                    Up?  There s nothing up. 

                                  REGINA
                    Don t play dumb with me.  You want 
                    him, don t you?  

                                  JO
                    Uh, no.  Do you want him, Regina?                                                                                     33.


                                  REGINA
                    Uh, yeah, I m not blind.  I m open 
                    to sharing though.  I ve never had 
                      a threesome before...

                                  JO
                          (horrified)
                    That s okay!  He s all yours.  

                                  REGINA
                    Aw, Jo!  You re so cool.  Everyone 
                    is so wrong about you.  

      Jo reacts, vaguely insulted.  She studies Regina, curiously.

                                  JO
                    So, you re really not worried about 
                    getting too close to him, huh?  

                                  REGINA
                    We ll use protection.

                                  JO
                    That s not... I meant, because of 
                    his past.  You know, that whole 
                    murdered his aunt,  socio  thing?      

                                  REGINA
                    I guess I believe in my nation s 
                    criminal justice system.  Besides, 
                    he s here and he s clearly not 
                    going anywhere.  What are we all 
                    gonna do, hate him forever?     

      This lands for Jo.  A TEEN passes by with a TRAY OF SHOTS.  
      Regina grabs one and smiles at Jo, holding it up for a toast.  
      Jo takes in this gesture of friendship from popular Regina.  
      She grabs a shot.  They CLINK and drink, and Jo immediately 
      starts hacking and coughing.  Regina watches her, giggling.     


      Lacey and Sarita are pouring themselves fresh drinks, when 
      Danny suddenly walks up to Lacey with a confident grin.   

                                  DANNY
                    One gin-and-tonic, bartender.  Easy 
                    on the gin, heavy on the tonic.  My 
                    tolerance isn t what it used to be.

      Lacey stares up at him dismissively, then immediately looks 
      back down to finish pouring her drink.  A protective Sarita 
      takes a couple menacing steps toward him.                                                                                       34.


                                  SARITA
                    Hey, creep.  You trying to add 
                     stalker  to your criminal record? 

                                  DANNY
                          (beat, smiling)
                    Sarita, right?  I remember you now.  
                    You were the one with that facial 
                    hair problem in fifth grade.   

      Sarita s tough exterior wavers: This is clearly a troubled 
      period in her adolescence, one she prefers not to remember.    

                                  SARITA
                    I think you re mistaken.  Freak.   

                                  DANNY
                    No... it was definitely you.  You 
                    had to leave school for a week to 
                    have an electrolysis procedure only 
                    approved in Germany or something.  
                          (then, studying her face)
                    Looks like it worked okay.  I can 
                    still see the faint outline of a 
                    mustache.  But nothing too bad. 

      Sarita storms away, furious.  Lacey glares at him.  

                                  LACEY
                    I see you re winning over the 
                    student body, one charming remark 
                    at a time.  Great strategy. 

                                  DANNY
                    It got you to say something to me.   

      Danny flashes a roguish grin, but Lacey remains ice-cold.

                                  LACEY
                    Congrats.  What an accomplishment.

                                  DANNY
                    Wow, two something s.  I m on a 
                    roll.  

      This time, she cracks a slight smile.  Danny looks pleased. 

      ACROSS THE ROOM: Archie laughs and drinks with a bunch of his 
      GUY FRIENDS... until he notices Lacey and Danny talking.  His 
      smile vanishes.  He quickly makes his way toward them.    

      BACK TO Danny and Lacey.  She still has her guard up, but 
      she s loosened up enough to be a little playful with him.                                                                                       35.


                                  LACEY
                    I see you got Jo to follow you 
                    around like a puppy dog again in 
                    under a day.  Impressive.

                                  DANNY
                    Puppy dog?  Wow.  That s harsh.

                                  LACEY
                    Didn t you hear?  I m a bitch now. 

      Danny smiles.  But his smile quickly fades when Archie walks 
      up, kissing Lacey and wrapping an arm around her. 

                                  ARCHIE
                    Hi, babe.  Oh, psycho boy!  Hey, 
                    buddy.  Good to see you again. 

                                  LACEY
                    You two ve met?

                                  ARCHIE
                    We have Psych together.  Spent the 
                    whole period debating whether this 
                    nut-bag is a sociopath or not.  You 
                    know, Lace, because of your 
                    nickname for him... the socio.

      Danny looks at Lacey, surprised and hurt that she was the one 
      who stuck him with that dark label.  Lacey s face reddens, 
        embarrassed, while Archie just stares Danny down with an 
      arrogant smirk.  Danny smiles at Lacey, rescuing the moment:  

                                  DANNY
                    Hey, don t worry about it.  I think 
                    it s kind of a catchy. 

      Lacey responds with an appreciative smile, quickly dropping 
      it when she notices Archie watching her, tensely.  He 
      squeezes her tighter.  Danny observes them, amused.    

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Anyway... I should find Jo before 
                    she starts having actual fun.  Good 
                    to see you Lacey.  Archie. 

      He turns and leaves.  Archie smiles at Lacey, exhaling.

                                  ARCHIE
                    You re welcome.

                                  LACEY
                    For what?  Embarrassing me?  Or 
                    holding me like a possession?                                                                                    36.


                                  ARCHIE
                    I was rescuing you!  The guy had 
                    you cornered.   

                                  LACEY
                    I can handle him, okay?

      She walks off to go greet some friends.  Archie chugs his 
      drink, threatened and emasculated. 


      A tipsy Jo weaves through the CROWD, sipping alcohol from a 
      SHOT GLASS.  She bumps into a grumpy Sarita. 

                                  SARITA
                    Hey!  Watch where you re swinging 
                    those fat meaty ape arms. 

                                  JO
                    Okay, my arms are not fat.  Yes, 
                    they re disproportionate to the 
                    rest of my body at the moment in a 
                    somewhat simian-like way, but the 
                    Internet says that s normal. 

      A darkly amused Sarita takes in Jo s drunkenness.  

                                  SARITA
                    Wow.  Someone s having some fun.  

                                  JO
                    I am having fun, and I wanna have 
                    even more fun, so... deal with it. 

      Jo finishes her shot.  Sarita eyes her, a predator eyeing its 
      prey.  SCOTT, a blandly hot jock (one of Archie s athlete 
      friends from before) stumbles past them.  Sarita grabs him. 

                                  SARITA
                    Scott, meet Jo.  She wants to have 
                    more fun.  Take your shirt off.

      Scott shrugs, pulling off his SHIRT in one quick motion.  
      Nearby PARTYGOERS cheer his abs.  Jo reacts, horrified.

                                  JO
                    You know, I think I m actually 
                    having the appropriate level of 
                    fun.  You can get dressed now.  

      Sarita grabs a SHOT off a passing tray.  She hands it to Jo.                                                                                    37.


                                  SARITA
                          (like a drill sergeant)
                    Pour this on him and lick it off.

                                  JO
                    Off of him?!  Uh, I don t think...

                                  SARITA
                    Do it, do it, do it...

                                  PARTYGOERS
                    Do it!  Do it!  Do it... !

      Jo sighs, giving in to the crowd.  She takes a deep breath, 
      pours the shot on Scott s TORSO, and then licks it up from 
      his stomach to his chest.  The crowd CHEERS. 


      Danny pushes his way through the mob, searching for Jo.  He 
      runs into Regina, who immediately throws herself at him.

                                  REGINA
                    So-ci-o!  There you are.  There s 
                    something I wanna show you.  
                          (leaning in, whispering)
                    Wanna hint?  It s my bed.

                                  DANNY
                    Um, not now... have you seen Jo?

                                  JO (O.S.)
                    Wait, stop!  Get the hell off me!

      Danny rushes toward the sound of Jo s distressed voice-- 


      He shoves his way through the CROWD, coming upon Scott and 
      Sarita, trying to force Jo to take her shirt off.  

                                  SARITA
                    Come on, Jo.  Tit for tit.  That s 
                    Green Grove High law.

                                  JO
                    Well, it s a dumb, gross law. 

                                  SCOTT
                    It s not a dumb law!  We need laws 
                    to create order.  Without order, 
                    we re in chaos. 

      Danny steps in, inserting himself between Scott and Jo.                                                                                     38.


                                  DANNY
                    Hey, looks like someone was paying 
                    attention in Poli-sci. 

      Jo reacts, surprised and moved to find Danny coming to back 
      her up... like an actual friend.  

                                  SCOTT
                    Mind your own business, freak.

                                  DANNY
                     Freak ?  Really?  That s so... 
                    generic.  That the best you can do?   

                                  SCOTT
                    How about Rope Boy?

      Danny tenses.  The crowd CHEERS Scott s boldness, egging him 
      on.  Sarita enjoys the spectacle, while Jo watches nervously 
      as the situation begins to spiral out of control.  PARTYGOERS 
      from other rooms, including Regina, Lacey, and Archie, push 
      in to watch the mounting confrontation.  

                                  DANNY
                    Okay, that was more pointed.  But 
                    why don t we just settle down...  

      Suddenly, Scott SHOVES Danny, hard.  The crowd GASPS.  

                                  JO
                    Stop!  Leave him alone!

      Scott grabs Danny s shirt and pulls him in, winding up to 
      punch him.  But before he can, Danny quickly leans in and 
      whispers in Scott s ear:

                                  DANNY
                    Back off.  I ve killed before, and 
                    I can do it again.  It ll be fun.  

      Startled, Scott FREEZES.  He lets go of Danny and backs away, 
      turning and bolting out of the room.  Danny watches him go 
      with an innocent, non-threatening expression.   

      SILENCE.  Partygoers exchange baffled looks: What just 
      happened?  Danny collects himself, grabs Jo s hand, and leads 
      her out the front door.  Regina watches, jealous and pissed. 

      Off Lacey, impressed by Danny s gallantry, and maybe even a 
      little wistful watching her two childhood best friends walk 
      away from the party together. 


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    39.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Kyle and Tess pull open the door, shocked to find Danny 
      standing on their stoop, propping up their drunk daughter. 

                                  JO
                    Mom!  Dad!  You came!  Welcome!

      Danny passes Jo off to Kyle, who guides her into a chair.  

                                  KYLE
                          (furious, to Tess)
                    Some friend from school, huh? 

                                  TESS
                    Just stay calm.    
                          (off his lack of calm)
                    Fine, or don t.  I m gonna go get 
                    Jo some water.                                                                                      40.


      She disappears into the kitchen.  An intimidating Kyle faces 
      Danny on the stoop.  Danny smiles up at him, nervously.  

                                  DANNY
                    Sheriff.  Good to see you again. 
                          (off his anger)
                    Don t be too hard on her, sir.  
                    This is what you do in High School, 
                    right?  Go to parties?  Get drunk?

                                  KYLE
                    And how would you know?  You read 
                    about that in the prison library?

                                  DANNY
                    Juvi, actually.  Sir. 

      They stare each other down.  Tess returns with water for Jo.

                                  JO
                          (energized and babbling)
                    Mom, the party was awesome.  This 
                    dude was like,  take your shirt 
                    off, I wanna lick you  and Danny 
                    was all,  get away from her, you 
                    suck  and then the dude was all, 
                     blah, I m gonna push you now.   
                    And Regina and I totally bonded.  
                    She was like,  I want Danny,  and I 
                    said,  you can have him,  and she 
                    was all,  I ll pass him to you 
                    after, sharing is caring! 

      A horrified Kyle and Tess turn and stare at Danny. 

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah, I should probably...

      Kyle SLAMS the door in his face.  He and Tess watch Jo gulp 
      her water.  They share a look, relieved she s home safe, but 
      troubled by her sudden re-connection with Danny. 


      Lacey drives Danny home.  They enter the more affluent side 
      of town, passing an increasingly impressive series of HOUSES.  
      Lacey talks on her phone, speaking into a HEADSET. 

                                  LACEY
                    Yeah, Arch, I m just gonna take 
                    Pepto and go to bed... I ll call 
                    you tomorrow... me, too... bye.

      She hangs up.  Danny smiles at her.                                                                                     41.


                                  DANNY
                    Stomach ache, huh?

                                  LACEY
                    Archie wouldn t have understood.  

                                  DANNY
                      Understood what, exactly? 

                                  LACEY
                    Maybe I didn t wanna leave Jo alone 
                    on a dark road with an ex-convict.    

                                  DANNY
                    Well, whatever your reason, thank 
                    you.  You saved me at least an hour 
                    of tedious drunk walking. 

                                  LACEY
                    Don t mention it.
                          (then, pointedly)
                      Seriously, to anyone.  Ever. 

                                  DANNY
                    Got it.  Oh, stop up here, mine is 
                    the house at the end of the...

                                  LACEY
                      I remember.

      Danny nods, flustered: Of course she does.  She pulls up 
      outside a big, dark HOUSE at the end of the block: Danny s 
      house, the scene of the crime.  She stares up at it, 
        anxiously... then exhales, refusing to let the fear in.

                                  DANNY
                    So... wanna come in and hang out?  

      Lacey gapes at him.  She laughs.  Danny smiles, weakly.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Or not.  I just thought it d be 
                    nice to catch up.  We haven t had a 
                    chance to talk since I got back. 

                                  LACEY
                    Okay, you realize that s 
                      intentional, right? 

      Lacey laughs again.  There s a long SILENCE.  Her eyes dart 
      over to Danny, quickly looking away: A part of her does want 
      to go hang out with him... to get to know this person she 
      once knew so well.  Danny can tell that she s conflicted.                                                                                         42.


                                  DANNY
                    I have Cool Ranch Doritos.  Your 
                    favorite.  

                                  LACEY
                    How do you remember that? 

                                  DANNY
                    You used to inhale them by the 
                    bucket.  You don t forget a mental 
                    image that traumatizing.

      She slaps him on the arm.  Danny blocks her, laughing. 


      Danny and Lacey sit on the floor, eating Doritos. 

                                  LACEY
                    I can t believe I m here right now.  
                    I must be completely crazy.

                                  DANNY
                    I don t think you re crazy.  

                                  LACEY
                    You wouldn t.  Crazy is relative.
                          (mouth full of Doritos)
                    Oh, so good right now.  I haven t 
                    eaten these in years. 

                                  DANNY
                    Me neither.  Remember when we dared 
                    Jo to eat a bag of every flavor? 

                                  LACEY
                    Uh-huh.  She made it to Spicy Nacho 
                    before she vomited all over my 
                    dad s favorite New York Yankees 
                    throw rug.  He never got over that. 

      Danny grabs the bag, takes a handful. 

                                  DANNY
                    Poor Jo.  

                                  LACEY
                    Why?  My dad blamed me, not her. 

                                  DANNY
                    I mean now.  She s having a hard 
                    time in high school.  Unlike you.  

      Lacey rolls her eyes, swiping the Doritos back.                                                                                       43.


                                  LACEY
                    Okay, what did she say?  That I 
                    ditched her?  Abandoned her? 

                                  DANNY
                    Of course not. 
                          (then, fishing for info)
                    Why?  That s not what happened?

      Beat.  Lacey s smile fades.  She turns defensive.  

                                  LACEY
                    Do you think it was easy, being the 
                    best friends of the child murderer? 

                                  DANNY
                          (softening, guilty)
                    No.  No, I m sure it wasn t...

                                  LACEY
                    Yeah.  It wasn t.  Forget the fact 
                    that you turned our childhoods into 
                    Children of the Corn.  We were both 
                      ostracized, associated with the 
                    psycho freak.  Middle School is 
                    rough enough without all that crap, 
                    so excuse me for doing everything I 
                    had to do to survive... to move on. 

                                  DANNY
                    You re right.  And I m sorry.  I 
                    never meant to hurt you and Jo.

      Lacey studies him.  She pauses, then abruptly blurts out:

                                  LACEY
                    You sure meant to hurt someone. 

      Danny reacts, thrown by her directness.  Lacey looks like she 
      wishes she hadn t said that, but she pushes her fear away. 

                                  LACEY (CONT D)
                    Do you... regret it?

                                  DANNY
                    The past is in the past.
                          (considering, sadly)
                    I wish I hadn t affected other 
                    people s lives.  That I do regret. 

      Lacey doesn t say anything.  Danny takes back the Doritos.    

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Wanna know what I really regret?                                                                                    44.


                                  LACEY
                    Not if it s creepy.  

                                  DANNY
                    I regret not growing up with you 
                    and Jo.  Ruining what we had.
                          (smiling, softly)
                    We had some fun, didn t we?

      A flash of wistfulness crosses Lacey s face.  She suppresses 
      it, but not before Danny notices.  He leans in closer. 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    I miss it.
                          (eyes locked on her)
                    I think you miss it, too. 

      Lacey stares back at him, steadily.  Then, she leans in, too. 

                                  LACEY
                    I thought the past was in the past?

                                  DANNY
                    Touche. 

      Their faces almost touch.  There s a long, tense SILENCE, 
      which turns into a charged, intimate, slightly sexual moment.  
      It s unexpected, new... exciting.  Their faces linger an inch 
      apart: Are they about to kiss?  But instead, Lacey grabs the 
      Doritos out of his hand, before retreating, leaning back. 

                                  LACEY
                    Quit hogging the Cool Ranch. 

      Danny smiles.  Lacey smiles back, taking a big bite of chips.


      Lacey lies asleep on the floor, arms wrapped around the bag 
      of DORITOS.  Danny grabs a BLANKET and drapes it over her, 
      sweetly.  His cell phone BUZZES.  He pulls it out and reads:

      A TEXT MESSAGE: Hey, hot stuff.  It s Regina.  Party s over.  
      Wanna come back for an after party of two? 

      Danny rolls his eyes.  He quickly types back: Thanks, but 
      I ll pass.  How d you get my number?

      Beat.  Then, another TEXT: Whatev, got it from someone.  
      Please come over?!  Socio + me = yes please!

      Danny cringes, embarrassed by the way she s throwing herself 
      at him.  He TEXTS back: No thanks.  Not tonight.                                                                                     45.


      Danny hopes that did it.  But as he puts his phone away, 
      another TEXT pops up-- with a much less playful tone: Come 
      over now.  We have to talk.  I know why you killed your aunt.

      Off a stunned Danny, staring at his phone, as we SMASH TO:


      Lacey opens her eyes.  She reacts to the DORITOS still in her 
      arms, disgusted.  She sits up, noticing Danny, lying asleep 
      on the floor beside her.  She covers her face with her hands, 
      horrified that she spent the night.  She quickly leaps up, 
      grabs her PURSE, and tip-toes out of the room...


      Lacey rushes down the stairs, as we REVERSE ON:

      Karen, exiting the KITCHEN, wearing a bathrobe.  She STOPS 
      SHORT when she sees Lacey bolting out the front door.

      Karen reacts, surprised.  She looks up the stairs at Danny s 
      bedroom, smiling hopefully to herself: Could this sleepover 
      be a sign that their lives are starting to return to normal?  


      Jo wakes up, emitting a low, hungover MOAN.  She grabs her 
      water and CHUGS it.  She puts the glass down.  She smiles, 
      recalling the events of last night. 

      She drags herself out of bed and goes to her CLOSET.  She 
      sorts through BOXES, finally pulling out:

      A FRAMED PHOTO of herself, Lacey and Danny as kids, around 
      age ten or eleven.  They re laughing together, happily.  

      Jo wipes the dust off, placing it on her bedside table.  She 
      looks at it, confused, uncertain... and maybe a little happy? 


      A plump, middle-aged MAID enters, taking in the post-party 
      MESS.  She angrily mumbles to herself in SPANISH as she makes 
      her way into the room... when suddenly, she TRIPS over 
      something.  She turns, looks down, and starts to SCREAM.

      REVERSE ON Regina, sprawled out on the floor on her back, 
      head bloody, face white, eyes wide open.  She s dead.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    46.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Jo approaches the house.  Halfway up the path, she pauses, 
      gripped by the same fear that Lacey experienced.  She pushes 
      past it, striding up to the porch and ringing the BELL.  

      Danny opens the door in boxers and a t-shirt, surprised and 
      pleased to find Jo smiling up at him, nervously.  

                                  JO
                    Hey.  Sorry, did I wake you? 

                                  DANNY
                    No, no, I was already up.

                                  JO
                    Oh, okay.  Good.  I just wanted to 
                    thank you for getting me home last 
                    night.  And for standing up for me 
                    to that wannabe rapist jock prick. 

                                  DANNY
                    I think that may actually be his 
                    full legal name. 

      He smiles, motioning for her to come in.  She steps inside. 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    So.  How s the punishment?  Daddy 
                    Dearest didn t seem too pleased 
                    when I brought you home. 

                                  JO
                    We ll see.  He d already gone into 
                    work when I woke up, and my mom was 
                    still asleep when I left.  

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe they ll go easy on you.  
                    First time offense. 

      Jo smiles grimly, doubtful.  Karen passes through.  She 
      notices Jo and reacts, pulling her into a big hug. 

                                  KAREN
                    Jo!  Look at you, you re so big... 
                    not in a fat way, just in a grown 
                    up way.  It s so good to see you.  

                                  JO
                    Good to see you too, Mrs. Ryder.                                                                                    47.


      Karen flashes her son an amused, knowing smile.  

                                  KAREN
                    Well, well, sweetheart... two days 
                    back and you ve certainly had your 
                    share of female visitors.

      Danny responds with a frosty glare, but Karen just laughs, 
      walking off into the kitchen.  Jo looks at Danny, intrigued.  

                                  JO
                    Visitors?  As in, plural?

                                  DANNY
                    As in two.  Lacey ended up sleeping 
                    over last night.

                                  JO
                    Oh!  Wow... you guys didn t... ?

                                  DANNY
                    No, we just talked and fell asleep.   
                    But let s keep it on the DL, okay?  
                    I bet that guy she s dating would 
                    love nothing more than to take it 
                    the wrong way.  

                                  JO
                    My lips are sealed.

      They share a conspiratorial smile.  Suddenly, they hear Karen 
      SCREAM OUT:

                                  KAREN (O.S.)
                    Danny!  Jo!  Get in here!

      They look at each other and rush into the kitchen--


      They enter to find a stunned Karen staring at the TV:

                                  NEWS ANCHOR
                      A housekeeper discovered Green 
                    Grove High sophomore Regina Crane 
                    beaten to death in her home this 
                    morning at around six-thirty AM...

      TIGHT ON Danny s FACE: Shocked, worried, and slightly pale. 

      The ANCHOR continues talking, as embarrassing PHOTOS of a 
      goofy, preening, partying Regina-- clearly culled hastily 
      from her Facebook page-- FLASH across the screen:                                                                                     48.


                                  NEWS ANCHOR (CONT D)
                    Crane was a beloved leader in the 
                    Green Grove High community.  She 
                    was a star on the Cheerleading 
                    Squad, and was voted Homecoming 
                    Queen last year as a freshman...

      A stunned Jo glances at Danny, studying his reaction.  She 
      locks eyes with Karen, also watching him.  They both quickly 
      look away, scared and confused, but both contemplating the 
      same unsettling possibility: Could he have done it again? 


      Last night s party has become a CRIME SCENE, swarming with 
      PARAMEDICS and COPS.  Kyle pulls the sheet off Regina s BODY: 
      There are big purple BRUISES on her head where something 
      appears to have smashed against it.  SANDY (thirties), his 
      strong, attractive female deputy, approaches him.  

                                  SANDY
                    We reached the parents on vacation 
                    in Florida.  They re coming back on 
                    the next flight out. 

      Kyle nods, dazed.  Sandy crouches down beside him. 

                                  SANDY (CONT D)
                    Sorry, boss.  She a friend of Jo s?

                                  KYLE
                    No, but Jo was here.  I m never 
                    letting her go to a party again.  

                                  SANDY
                    Sure.  That doesn t sound like an 
                      overreaction at all.

      Kyle responds with a sharp grin.  These two have a good 
      rapport, and a smooth, effective working relationship. 

                                  SANDY (CONT D)
                    No signs of breaking and entering.  
                    We know who else was at that party?

                                  KYLE
                    Every teen in Green Grove, from the 
                    way the neighbors described it.  It 
                    quieted down at two, and Bobby 
                    estimates time of death at around 
                    three or four.  Which could mean...

                                  SANDY
                    Someone never left.                                                                                     49.


                                  KYLE
                    Or someone came back.  

      Beat.  They re both clearly thinking the same thing.

                                  SANDY
                    And what about Green Grove s most 
                    famous teenage ex-con?  He part of 
                    that  most  you mentioned?  

      Kyle nods, unsettled. 

                                  KYLE
                    Let s not jump to any conclusions. 

                                  SANDY
                    Okay.  But two days after he comes 
                    back, we get our first murder since 
                    he went all  Good Son  on his aunt?  

      Kyle doesn t respond.  He stands and starts to pace. 

                                  KYLE
                    Anything missing?

                                  SANDY
                    The housekeeper says Regina usually 
                    wears a red-and-gold necklace.  
                    I ve got officers searching her 
                    bedroom, but apparently she never 
                    took the thing off. 

                                  KYLE
                    What about her cell phone?

                                  SANDY
                    Also gone.  Unless she s the only 
                      Homecoming queen in the world who 
                    doesn t have one. 

                                  KYLE
                    Contact her service provider.  Get 
                    the records for every text, voice-
                    mail and incoming call in the last 
                      twenty-four hours.  If she knew her 
                    killer, then they probably had some 
                    sort of communication. 

      Sandy rushes off.  Kyle watches BOBBY THE CORONER put Regina 
      in a BODY BAG and zip it up.  Off Kyle, stressed, troubled.                                                                                      50.



      Lacey sits with Archie, Sarita, and Scott, each heartbroken 
      and devastated by the sudden loss of Regina.  Lacey and 
      Sarita hold onto each other closely, still in shock.  

                                  LACEY
                    It s so weird.  I feel like she s 
                    gonna come bouncing in any second.   

                                  SARITA
                    Yeah, all excited over some dumb 
                    Internet quiz about  matching with 
                    your celebrity hair twin.      
                          (smiling, emotional)
                    God, she was such an idiot. 

                                  ARCHIE
                    I told her... I begged her not to 
                    throw herself at that lunatic.  

                                  SARITA
                    We all tried to warn her, Arch.  

                                  SCOTT
                    I even offered to bang her, if she 
                    was just itching to get banged.  
                          (sighing, sadly)
                    If only she d listened. 

                                  LACEY
                    Are we sure it was Danny?  We all 
                    saw him leave the party...

                                  ARCHIE
                    He wouldn t do it in front of us. 

                                  SARITA
                    Yeah, he s psychotic, not retarded.

      Lacey doesn t reply.  She won t mention her sleepover with 
      Danny, but it s enough to make her wonder about his guilt.  
      Archie watches her, unhappy to see her so conflicted.    

                                  ARCHIE
                    Scott, tell Lacey what Danny 
                    whispered to you. 

                                  SCOTT
                    He said if I didn t back off, he d 
                    kill me.  And that he d enjoy it.  
                    Just like he did last time.

      Lacey reacts, unsettled.                                                                                      52.


                                  ARCHIE
                    So, Lace?  Still think the little 
                    creep is innocent?

      Off Lacey, upset and confused... not sure what to think. 


      Principal Mirel stands at a podium, facing the bleachers 
      packed with STUDENTS.  The FACULTY -- including psychology 
      teacher Rowena Fisk -- sit flanking him on either side.

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL
                    Regina was a loving, energetic, 
                    positive force in our community...

      ANGLE ON Lacey in the BLEACHERS, lost in a sad daze.  She s 
      seated beside Archie and Sarita, who both glare down at:  

      Danny, sitting with Jo and Rico.  Danny catches Archie and 
      Sarita s GLARES.  He notices other GLARES, from all sides. 

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL (CONT D)
                    ... Now, we must come together in 
                    our grief and support each other.  
                    It s what Regina would ve wanted... 

      An emotional and angry Sarita locks eyes with Danny, mouthing 
      the word  socio  at him.  Other STUDENTS do the same... a few 
      even HISS it at him.  Jo reacts to the nasty hissing.

                                  PRINCIPAL MIREL (CONT D)
                          (noticing the hissing)
                    I urge you to keep in mind that the 
                    police have not named a suspect, so 
                    please stop spreading unfounded 
                      accusations against your peers...   

      The HISSING continues to build and build.  An increasingly 
      sympathetic Jo watches a stoic Danny try to withstand it.     

      Suddenly, the doors BURST OPEN.  Kyle and two other COPS 
      stride in.  They spot Danny, and make a beeline for him. 

                                  KYLE
                    Danny Ryder.  Come with us, please.  
                    We need to ask you a few questions. 

      Danny nods, miserably, as the entire room ERUPTS in shocked 
      whispering.  A stunned Jo leans in toward Kyle, pleading: 

                                  JO
                    Dad, come on... not here.  Not in 
                    front of everyone like this.                                                                                    53.


                                  KYLE
                    I m sorry, honey.  Danny, let s go. 

      As Danny starts to get up, Jo quickly turns and locks eyes 
      with Lacey, who immediately looks away.  After a conflicted 
      beat, Jo impulsively jumps up, facing the other students:  

                                  JO
                    HEY!  Listen!  I know that we re 
                    all scared...

      SUDDEN SILENCE.  The entire school stares down at Jo, 
      startled by her outburst.  She takes in all the eyes focused 
      on her, pushing past a brief moment of doubt and nerves: 

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    We re scared... and we re sad, and 
                    we re angry, and it s easy to focus 
                    all of that on the one obvious 
                    person.  But is that really fair?     

      Danny reacts, moved by her defense.  Archie and Sarita glare 
      at her with dismissive contempt.  But Lacey listens closely. 

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    I don t know if Danny did this or 
                    not... I don t have the answers... 
                    but do you?  Do any of us?  I mean, 
                    it s not like he s under arrest.  
                          (to Kyle, pointedly)
                    Right?   

      She locks eyes with her dad.  He doesn t respond, but he 
      seems unhappy and worried by his daughter s defense of Danny. 

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Please, just... give him a chance.  
                    Don t ostracize him even more. 

      ANGRY, SKEPTICAL FACES glare down at her: She isn t winning 
      many hearts and minds.  Rico looks on proudly, impressed by 
      her guts.  Jo sits back down, defeated.  Danny smiles at her. 

                                  DANNY
                    Well... this should do wonders for 
                    our social lives, huh?    

      He gives her a grateful arm squeeze, before standing and 
      walking out with Kyle and the cops.  Off Jo, watching as he s 
      led out like a criminal in front of the entire school.  


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    54.


                                        ACT SIX


      STUDENTS file out of the gymnasium, abuzz over Danny s big 
      public  arrest.   Jo grabs Lacey and pulls her aside. 

                                  JO
                    I know you agree with me.  I saw 
                    your face while I was talking.    

                                  LACEY
                    Okay, that wasn t my agreement 
                    face, it was my what-the-hell-is-
                      she-thinking face.   

                                  JO
                    Look, what if someone else did have 
                    a reason to kill Regina?  Wouldn t 
                    the day Danny got back be the 
                    perfect time to do it?  Think about 
                    it... he s the instant suspect.  
                          (off Lacey s skepticism)
                    I know that sounds... I just feel 
                    like someone has to give him the 
                    benefit of the doubt.  Right?  
                    Someone has to try and believe him.     

                                  LACEY
                          (incredulous)
                    And that someone has to be you?

                                  JO
                    No.  Us.  Who else will it be? 
                          (beat, then)
                    I know about last night. 

      Lacey tenses.  

                                  LACEY
                    Nothing happened. 
                          (then, desperately)
                    Please.  Don t tell anyone. 

                                  JO
                    I won t, because you need to tell 
                    everyone.  If you say you were with 
                    him, people will believe you.

                                  LACEY
                    I was asleep!  I have no idea what 
                    he did or didn t do last night.  
                    All I know is the best friend I ve 
                    ever had is dead.                                                                                    55.


      Jo flinches a little, stung.  There s a loaded SILENCE, as 
      they both contemplate their own lost best friendship.  

                                  JO
                    I know.  And I m so sorry.  But 
                    Danny was trying to start over.  
                    Why would he do this?  

                                  LACEY
                    Why d he do it before?
                          (off Jo s sad silence)
                    Just trust the police, okay?  Trust 
                    your dad.  If Danny s innocent, 
                    they ll figure it out.  And stop 
                    defending him.  You re only making 
                    things worse for yourself here.  

                                  JO
                    You haven t changed.  All you care 
                    about is what other people think of 
                    you.  After the way you cut us both 
                    loose five years ago, I shouldn t 
                    be surprised you d do it again. 

      Jo walks away, angrily.  Off a guilty but defiant Lacey... 


      Kyle sits perched on his desk, staring down a weary Danny. 

                                  DANNY
                    I swear.  I got the text, turned 
                    off my phone, and went to bed...

                                  KYLE
                    And you didn t wanna go talk to 
                    her?  Find out what she meant?

                                  DANNY
                    I knew what she meant.  She wanted 
                    to get me into bed.  

                                  KYLE
                    And you didn t go?  A sixteen-year-
                    old boy who just got out of juvi?  
                    Those hormones must be raging. 

                                  DANNY
                    I guess I m saving myself for 
                    someone special. 

      Kyle reacts: Is he talking about Jo?  He takes a breath and 
      composes himself, then leans in, forcing a kind smile.                                                                                      56.


                                  KYLE
                    Danny, the people in this town 
                    don t care about the truth.  All 
                    they want is your head on a stick.  
                    But me?  I m open to hearing your 
                    side of the story.  So, just tell 
                    me: What really happened?   

                                  DANNY
                          (getting frustrated)
                    Nothing happened.  I didn t leave 
                    my room after twelve-thirty. 

                                  KYLE
                    Okay.  Fine.  Can anyone vouch for 
                    that? 

      Danny pauses, reluctant to use Lacey as his alibi.  Kyle 
      studies him.  Sandy opens the door and sticks her head in.

                                  SANDY
                    Karen Ryder and her lawyers are 
                    here. 

      Kyle nods, not surprised.  He turns back to Danny. 

                                  KYLE
                    Looks like we ll have to finish 
                    this up another time. 

                                  DANNY
                    Sure.  Anything I can do to help.    

      Danny shoots him a cooperative smile, before standing and 
      walking out.  Kyle watches him go, more suspicious than ever.   


      Tess watches Kyle and Jo face-off, angrily. 

                                  KYLE
                    I m asking you not to hang out 
                    anymore with a serial killer.  Most 
                      sixteen-year-olds would kill for 
                    that kind of hands-on parenting.

                                  JO
                    Serial killer?  Whatever happened 
                    to innocent until proven guilty?  
                    Or did Green Grove secede from the 
                    Union without me realizing it?    

                                  KYLE
                    Honey, please... trust me.   My 
                    gut s telling me Danny did this.  

                                  JO
                    Yeah, well my gut s telling me he 
                    didn t.  

      Jo walks out.  Kyle watches her go, heavy with concern.                                                                                     61.


                                  TESS
                    I know you re trying to protect 
                    her.  But we can t tell her who to 
                    be friends with. 

                                  KYLE
                    I ll remind you that you said that 
                    when we re identifying her at the 
                    morgue.

      He storms away, leaving Tess alone, sadly contemplating this 
      burgeoning rift in her family.   


      Danny flips through an old PHOTO ALBUM, stopping on: 

      A PORTRAIT of HIMSELF, around ten, sitting with a stiff, 
      impressive man in a dark suit-- his father, MARTIN RYDER.

      Karen sticks her head in, lightly knocking on the open door.      

                                  KAREN
                    Can I come in? 

      Danny looks up at her.  He nods.  She sits down beside him on 
      the bed.  She notices the photo, flashing a wistful smile.    

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    I had to bribe you both to sit for 
                    this photo.  Remember what I bought 
                    you? 

                                  DANNY
                    The new Power Rangers mega-mission 
                    helmet.
                          (grinning)
                    And how d you bribe dad? 

      Awkward beat.

                                  KAREN
                    I, uh... I don t remember. 
                          (then, firmly)
                    Danny, I want to talk about what 
                    happened at the police station. 

      Danny ignores her.  He stands up and walks across the room. 

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    All I want to do is help you...                                                                                    62.


                                  DANNY
                          (turning on her, sharply)
                    Help me?  Is that why you brought 
                    me back to a town where everyone 
                    thinks I m the teenage Ted Bundy?  

                                  KAREN
                    This is our home.  It s where your 
                    father and I raised you.  
                          (holding back emotion)
                    It s where we were a family.      

                                  DANNY
                    No, it s where you were top of the 
                      small-town pyramid.  The most 
                    popular mom in the neighborhood.    

      Karen stares up at him.  She exhales, guilty and exhausted.  

                                  KAREN
                    We couldn t sell it. 
                          (off Danny s confusion)
                    We couldn t even get people to come 
                    to the open house.  We kept 
                    lowering the price, but...  

                                  DANNY
                    I never even knew you put it on the 
                    market.  

                                  KAREN
                    We didn t want to burden you.   
                          (then, floodgates opening)
                    We still thought about leaving 
                    here.  But then your father s 
                    drinking got worse, and he gambled 
                    on some bad investments, and, 
                    well... suddenly, we didn t have as 
                    many options.  It wasn t until 
                    after his accident that I found out 
                    how bad it really was.

                                  DANNY
                    Are you saying we re... broke? 

                                  KAREN
                    We ll be okay.  We have enough to 
                    live on.  But the majority of the 
                    money is tied up in this house.  

      Danny processes his parents  struggles, stunned and guilty.  
      Karen walks over to him, placing a maternal hand on his face.                                                                                      63.


                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    I love you, Danny.  I just want you 
                    to be happy.  And if that means we 
                    have to pick up and leave and start 
                    over somewhere new, then that s 
                    what we ll do.  We ll make it work.  

                                  DANNY
                    I haven t brushed up on my criminal 
                    law lately, but I think fleeing 
                    town might make me look guilty.

                                  KAREN
                    I don t care how it looks.  
                          (then, almost hopefully)
                    I know you re not guilty. 

                                  DANNY
                          (moved)
                    Thanks, mother.  And we don t have 
                    to leave.  Once they find the real 
                    killer, all this will blow over 
                    anyway.  Right?        

      They smile at each other-- it s a rare glimpse of the bond 
      underneath all the emotional baggage.  

                                  KAREN
                    Get some rest.  You ve had a long 
                    day.  We ll talk more tomorrow.   

      She kisses him and walks toward the door, turning around to 
      give him one more loving smile.  Danny smiles back.  After 
      she leaves, his smile vanishes.  He sits back down on the bed 
      and picks up the PHOTO ALBUM.  He starts flipping through it 
      again, stopping when he gets to:      

      An OLDER PICTURE of a very young DANNY, sitting on the lap of 
      a sour-looking WOMAN in her late thirties.  A CAPTION reads: 
       Danny and his Aunt Judith at his fourth birthday party.  

      TIGHTER ON the PHOTO: Around AUNT JUDITH s neck hangs a 
      NECKLACE-- the exact same RED-AND-GOLD NECKLACE that Regina 
      was wearing.  The one that s now missing. 

      Danny stares at the photo.  He reaches under his mattress, 
      pulling out the missing necklace.  He weaves it through his 
      fingers, eyeing it with an unreadable gaze, as we:

      CUT TO BLACK
