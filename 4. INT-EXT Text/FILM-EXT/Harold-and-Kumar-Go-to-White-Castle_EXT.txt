BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.
BILLY
Wow!
I can't believe how easy that was!
J.D.
Dude, how do you think I get all my shit
done? I'm telling you -- those Asian
guys love crunching numbers. You
probably just made his weekend.
The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.

Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
car zooms out of the parking lot.
QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold
standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off.
He looks at the stack of papers they gave him...

Harold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot...
HAROLD
Yes!
Right in front...
Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND.
The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a
KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof.
Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.
HAROLD
(frustrated, to himself)
Those assholes.
The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud
mouth), puts down his window...
COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK
FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold.
COLE

Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He

Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he
sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of
Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators.
HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl.
Harold takes a deep breath...
HAROLD
Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.

Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and

KUMAR
There used to be a White Castle right in

BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE

Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here.
Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.

Please tell me there's another White
Castle in town.

Nope.

Do I look like the type of guy who would
be unsure about something like this?
HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.
KUMAR

It's a non-issue.

I've been an employee here for three
years now, and if there's one thing I've
learned, it's that when you're craving
White Castle, the burgers here simply
won't cut it.
(in his own little world)
In fact, just thinking about those tender
little White Castle burgers and those
grilled onions makes me want to burn this
place to the ground and re-build a White
Castle in its place.

If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
the trip.
KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.
HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important
moment for the guys...
KUMAR

You can always do your work in the car.
HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.
HAROLD

HIPPIE ASSHOLE
Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up?
KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief...
KUMAR
Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime
of your finest herb.
The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A
GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck...
KUMAR
Oh my dear sweet lord...
Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his
hand away...

Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops,
bro!
The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE
I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel
like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
it. That's cool with me. I can find lots
of people who want to get high. I can
smoke it myself, man.
KUMAR
Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are
you?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE
One who understands the concept of supply
and demand, dude.
Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a
couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes
out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE
(laughing like a prick)
Dumbass.
Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,

take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making
their deal.
CHRISTY
Hey, you guys about to smoke?
KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.
They're
both floored by their hotness.

Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming

KUMAR gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He
walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards
until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS
PEEING ON THE BUSH..
KUMAR
Oh yes!
Yes, that's nice.

KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF
NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants
and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The
Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that
Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
seconds, until he can't take it anymore...
KUMAR
Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask
you...why are you peeing here?
CREEPY GUY
What do you mean?
KUMAR
Why did you decide to piss here right
next to me? Why not that bush over there?
CREEPY GUY
Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
on. Why'd you choose this bush?
KUMAR
Nobody was here when I chose this bush.
CREEPY GUY
(getting heated)
So you can pee here and nobody else can,
is that it?
KUMAR
I was just saying....
CREEPY GUY
Is this like your special bush or
something?
KUMAR
No, I just...

You know what? Forget about it. I'm not
in the mood to get stabbed right now.
The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy
Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.

Hey, hands down! No sudden moves!
Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with
Palumbo improvising little responses.
KUMAR
Let me guess. You were probably the big
asshole in your high school, right?
You'd pick on guys like us every day.
But then graduation came, and we went to
college and you went nowhere, so you
thought, "How can I still give them shit?
I know! I'll become a cop!" Well,
congratulations. Your dream's come true.
Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to
Palumbo.
KUMAR
(to Officer Palumbo)
Hey, while you're at it, why don't you
write him up another ticket? Or better
yet, arrest him. Lock him up!
With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees
Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends
up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!
HAROLD

HAROLD and KUMAR have stopped running.
They start catching

HAROLD
Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking

KUMAR
Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as
good if you weren't there.

Dude, look at this. It's like we went
from being broke to being millionaires.

HAROLD
What was that?

Just a coyote. Don't worry.

HAROLD
Aren't people supposed to be scared of

KUMAR
That's only because they sound scary. In
one on one combat, either one of us can
take a coyote down.
SUDDENLY, A CHEETAH JUMPS OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND LETS OUT
A MONSTROUS ROAR!
KUMAR (CONT'D)
Now cheetahs, they're another story.
The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
HAROLD
We're gonna die.
KUMAR
Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to
eating zebras and shit. They're not
known for eating humans.
WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS
OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING.
HAROLD
We're gonna die.
KUMAR
Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign.
But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll
probably leave us alone.
HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins
walking directly over to HAROLD...
HAROLD
(whispering)
This isn't working.
KUMAR
Shhh.
Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON
WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA.
HAROLD
(eyes closed, screaming)
HE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME!
HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS.
Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH.

THE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD.
HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY

KUMAR

I thought I told you not to take that
jerky!
HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins
licking Harold's face in friendship.
HAROLD
He likes me.
Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...
KUMAR
Dude, I think I have an idea.
HAROLD
What is it?
KUMAR

Are we really gonna
ride this cheetah?
KUMAR
Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on
the planet. It's as good as a car.
Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.
HAROLD
This is either a really smart move, or by
far the stupidest thing we've ever done.
HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.
Kumar puts the

SENSE, WE SEE THE CHEETAH ZOOMING PAST STREETS AND FORESTS.
HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN AS IT RACES ACROSS
A MAJOR HIGHWAY...
HAROLD
Dude, am I just really high or is this is
actually working?!
KUMAR
Both!
HAROLD

Along the way, they run by...
The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with
each other, in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY
gives Harold the same scary look from before....
FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a
wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out
a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with.
KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while
getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly
gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male
Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy.
Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill,
UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger
from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed
each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into

Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE
FRENCH FRIES FROM THE BRANCH AND FEEDS THEM TO HAROLD.
COLE (O.S.)
Wow, you guys are really extreme...
HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM...
COLE
...extremely gay that is.
SUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD
STARTS GUSHING OUT. HE FALLS OFF THE KAYAK, INTO THE WATER.
HAROLD is shocked. He turns around and sees MARIA, HOLDING A
CROSSBOW. She smiles at him. HE THEN JUMPS ON TOP OF HER
AND THEY BEGIN MAKING LOVE ON TOP OF THE BURGERS...
MARIA
Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God-- you
have the biggest dick of all time! It's
so long! And wide, for that matter!
Suddenly, Harold turns and sees the BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
lying down near them. He is staring at them, with no
expression on his face, with his hand down his pants--
rubbing his penis furiously. Harold is disturbed.
MARIA
Don't worry about him...
MARIA rolls over so SHE'S ON TOP OF HAROLD. SHE STARTS

HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he
sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.
HAROLD
What happened to the cheetah?
KUMAR
It ran away. But forget about that. I
have some bad news and some worse news.
HAROLD

Tell me the worse news first.
KUMAR
I checked out some road signs. The
cheetah took us in the wrong direction.
HAROLD
That sucks.
What's the bad news?
KUMAR
Your laptop is completely destroyed.
Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,
broken in pieces.
HAROLD

KUMAR
It smashed against a tree when you fell
off the cheetah.
HAROLD

sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five
cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down...

Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of
donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."

Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads

far more than that.
KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The
scene is very picturesque...
KUMAR
Our parents came to this country,
escaping persecution, poverty, and
hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very,
very hungry. And they wanted to live in
a land that treated them as equals. A
land where their kids could study and get
into good colleges. A land filled with
hamburger stands. And not just one type
of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with
different sizes, toppings, and
condiments. That land was America.
THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...
KUMAR
(turning to Rold)
You think this is just about the burgers?
No. This is about achieving what our
parents set out for. This is about the
pursuit of happiness. This is about the
American dream.
KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

And so we've reached this point. The
point which all men eventually have to
face. The point of no return.
