      The ramshackle dive.  Sparsely populated.  We re on BOYD 
      CROWDER, posted up in a corner of the bar --

      When DEWEY CROWE slides up beside Boyd.  To the BARTENDER:

                                  DEWEY (O.C.)
                    Bourbon.  You can keep the ice.
                          (then, to Boyd)
                    Hey Boyd.  You mind?

      Boyd, eyes glazed, takes in Dewey.

                                  BOYD
                    Not at all, Dewey.

                                  DEWEY
                    Surprised to see you here.  Thought 
                    you d given up these poisons.

                                  BOYD
                    I had.  But things have changed 
                    quite a bit since last we spoke.

                                  DEWEY
                    You mean, when you had your gun 
                    pointed at me?

                                  BOYD
                    The irony in that, of course, is 
                    that me pointing my gun at you is 
                    the only reason you re alive today.

                                  DEWEY
                    Yeah, heard you had some trouble 
                    out there.

                                  BOYD
                    More than some.

      The Bartender comes back, sets down Dewey s Bourbon.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Three twenty-five.

      Dewey reaches into his pockets, fumbles a mess of CHANGE onto 
      the BAR.  Counts it as Boyd and the Bartender stare.  Dewey 
      finishes counting.  Looks up at the disapproving Bartender.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    2.

                                  DEWEY
                    It s currency ain t it?

      The Bartender gathers the change, heads off.  Boyd just 
      stares, amused by Dewey.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    What?

      Boyd just shakes his head, as an attractive working girl 
      named ELLEN MAY walks up to Dewey, slides a hand across his 
      back.

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    Dewey Crowe.  How re you this fine 
                      afternoon?

                                  DEWEY
                    I m good, Ellen May.  And you?

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    I dunno.  You tell me...

                                  DEWEY
                          (then)
                    Afraid I don t have nothing for you 
                    right this second,  but I ll be 
                    back real soon, and I m gonna be 
                    flush.

                                  ELLEN MAY
                          (same old story)
                    You ever get it together, you know 
                    where to find me.

      And Ellen May saunters off.  Dewey watches her go, 
      practically licking his lips.

                                  BOYD
                    Be happy to help you out, if you 
                    like.

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t need your charity, Boyd.  I 
                    got things lined up.

                                  BOYD
                    I m certain that you do.

                                  DEWEY
                    What, you don t believe me?
                          (then, sotto)
                    You heard of them Oxy busses?

                    back with a shipment of pills?
                          (Boyd nods)
                    Well I just happen to be getting on 
                    one of them tonight.  Gonna nab me 
                    a sweet little pay day.

                                  BOYD
                    That s very enterprising of you.

                                  DEWEY
                    Damn straight.  Come back in here, 
                    get me some of Ellen May and every 
                    other piece of ass in this joint.

      Dewey slams his drink.

                                  BOYD
                    Whatever puts a smile on your face, 
                    Dewey.

                                  DEWEY
                          (rises, then)
                    You know Boyd, for a guy who s 
                      supposedly changed, you sound an 
                    awful lot like you always did.

      And with that, Dewey Crowe is up and gone.


      An old school, out of the way kind of place.  On stage, Dave 
      Alvin is just about finished setting up.

      Amidst all this, we find RAYLAN and WINONA, at a table, 
      drinking beer.

                                  WINONA
                    I m so glad we did this.  Can t 
                    remember the last time I saw live 
                    music.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    What are we doing, Winona?

                                  WINONA
                    You mean right now?
                          (unsure)
                    Having a beer, about to see Dave 
                    Alvin?

                      Lexington.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, and that s my point.

                                  WINONA
                    What s your point?

                                  RAYLAN
                    If he were playing in Lexington, 
                    would we have gone to see him?
                          (then, elaborating)
                    We drive to the middle of nowhere 
                    anytime we wanna go out in public.
                    Lie to our friends.  We ve eaten so 
                    many meals in bed I m starting to 
                    feel like the grandparents in Willy 
                    Wonka.

                                  WINONA
                    I thought we were being discreet.

                                  RAYLAN
                    When Gary didn t know about us I 
                      understood that.

                                  WINONA
                    Just because Gary knows, doesn t 
                    mean the whole world s got to.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I just don t see why--

                                  WINONA
                    Because I m still married, Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So what if you weren t?

                                  WINONA
                    That s a longer conversation.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I want to be with you, Winona.  And 
                    I don t care who knows it.

                                  WINONA
                          (then)
                    Do you know how people are going to 
                    look at me when I tell them I m 
                    divorcing husband number two to go 
                    back to husband number one?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    4A.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That depends: will they know which 
                    husband I was?

                                  WINONA
                    Like I m somewhere between pathetic 
                    and delusional.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I was joking.

                                  WINONA
                    I wasn t.

      Then, on stage, the band finished tuning up.

                                  DAVE ALVIN
                    How s everyone doing tonight?

      A general hum of energy rises amongst the audience.

                                  DAVE ALVIN (CONT D)
                    I d like to start with something I 
                    just recently wrote.  Hope you 
                    enjoy it.

      Then, the MUSIC STARTS.  It should be the end of the 
        conversation... but it won t be.  A few beats, and then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    Does this mean you re not planning 
                    on divorcing Gary?

                                  WINONA
                    Can we talk about this later?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (no)
                    Because if you re not, then I 
                    really don t know what the hell 
                    we re doing--

                                  WINONA
                    Maybe I wouldn t be so hesitant to 
                    tell the world and divorce Gary if 
                      I actually felt like you and I 
                    could be a happy couple.

      And there it is.  This just sits there, then:

                                  RAYLAN
                    I can t believe you just said that.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    4B.

                    I m sorry, it s just... tonight was 
                    supposed to be fun, you know?  This 
                    was supposed to be fun.

      Winona turns away from Raylan, then sees something, she 
      shakes her head, cannot believe this is happening.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Tim s here.

                    Tim Gutterson, your fellow Marshal?  
                    He s at the bar.

      Raylan now turns, and sure enough --

      There s TIM.  Waiting for a beer alongside a guy named BEN, 
      20s, handsome, solemn.  It appears Tim hasn t seen Raylan and 
      Winona yet, and they both realize that.

                        RAYLANWINONA
      Let s invite him over--Let s get out of here--

      A beat.

                        RAYLANWINONA
      Are you serious--You can t be serious--

      A beat.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Were you listening to a single word 
                    I just said?

                                  RAYLAN
                    The band just started!

      Winona checks to make sure Tim still hasn t seen them, which 
      he apparently hasn t.  Then:

                                  WINONA
                    Either give me your keys or leave 
                    with me now.

      Raylan considers, then moves to leave the booth, as does 
      Winona.  Off these two, slipping out, Dave Alvin still 
      rocking on, Tim Gutterson apparently never seeing them.


      Moving down the aisle, past TIRED PASSENGERS, greasy and 
      unkept... they ve been on this bus a few days and it d be 
      great if we could sense that.  Then, towards the BACK of the 
      bus we find Dewey, who despite the mood around him, is 
      anxious and fidgety, and then we re --  

      At the front of the bus.  Where the DRIVER sees that they re 
      approaching a CLOSED OFF BRIDGE.  Slows, then STOPS.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    5A.

      On BOBBY, 30s, napping, seated right behind the driver.  Upon 
      realizing they re stopped he STIRS, gets to his feet, 
      addressing the driver:

                                  BOBBY
                    Why are we stopped?

      The driver just nods, to indicate what Bobby has seen as he s 
      asked the question... namely, the DETOUR.  Shit...

      ON DEWEY

      Who s out of his seat, moving towards the front with urgency.

      Bobby, turning back to his seat, blocks him.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                    Go back to your seat.

                                  DEWEY
                    Come on Bobby, I gotta drain it.

                                  BOBBY
                    Hold it.

                                  DEWEY
                    I been holding it!

      As Bobby reaches below his seat, extracts a SHOTGUN.

                                  BOBBY
                    Sit.  Now.

      Dewey sits.  Passengers are stirring, wondering why they re 
      stopped.

                                  DRIVER
                    You want me to back it up?

      But Bobby doesn t answer, as he scours the horizon --

      ON DEWEY, returning to his seat, tense --

      As a PASSENGER named ELROD (30s, thick, bumbling) rises from 
      his SEAT, pulls a GUN, steps into the AISLE and AIMS --

      As BOBBY catches a GLIMPSE of ELROD in the REARVIEW MIRROR, 
      HITS THE DECK --

      As ELROD FIRES, missing Bobby and putting a BULLET through 
      the FRONT WINDSHIELD --

      As all the passengers PANIC, GET LOW IN THEIR SEATS --

      BOBBY, in the STAIR WELL, FIRES back at Elrod, who DIVES INTO 
      A SEAT, the BLAST BLOWING OUT A WINDOW --

      ELROD takes aim over a SEAT BACK and FIRES at Bobby, missing 
      him, the BULLETS SHATTERING the DOOR S GLASS --

      As DEWEY, crouched and huddled, watches all this happen --

      As BOBBY tries to get a line on Elrod, about to SHOOT HIS 
      FEET, when he s SHOT FROM BEHIND, his BRAINS splattering 
      across the BUS S FLOOR and onto the DRIVER S PANTS.

      ELROD now rises, cautiously moves towards Bobby.

                                  ELROD
                          (to passengers)
                    You all stay down and quiet!

      Elrod goes to the door, sees Bobby, clearly DEAD.  He then 
      looks up and through the BROKEN GLASS PANEL sees the 
        Construction Worker whose name is actually CUTTER (20s, mean, 
      scarred) approaching, holding a RIFLE.

      Elrod tries to OPEN THE DOOR USING THE LEVER, but he can t as 
      it s blocked by Bobby s DEAD BODY.

                                  ELROD (CONT D)
                      Goddammit.

      CUTTER, almost amused, LIGHTS UP A CIGARETTE.

                          (to the driver)
                    Move him.

                                  DRIVER
                    I got a bad back.

                                  ELROD
                    Lift with your legs.

      As the Driver awkwardly drags BOBBY S BODY out of the way --

      ON DEWEY

      peering over his seat, trying to get a look --

      ON THE DRIVER

      Finished moving Bobby.  Stumbles back into his seat.  As 
      Elrod steps forward and opens the door.

      Cutter steps aboard the bus.  He and Elrod take in BOBBY.

                                  CUTTER
                    You wanna grab the junk?  Or were 
                    you thinking we d stay awhile?

      ELROD reaches beneath Bobby s SEAT, extracts a GYM BAG --

      ON DEWEY

      now getting a good look at CUTTER.  And on Dewey s face is a 
      strange recognition: he knows this asshole...

      ON ELROD

      who opens the GYM BAG, peers inside --

      INSERT: The bag is full of PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES --

      Cutter takes a peek as well.  His face lights up.

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    Looks like Christmas come early.

      But we go off of DEWEY, staring at them, his wheels spinning, 
      having to piss the last thing on his mind...

                                        ACT ONE


      Art is finishing up with Raylan and Tim.

                                  ART
                    Thought you d both want to know, 
                    the AUSA is gonna say the shooting 
                    of Jess Timmons was good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No surprise there.  He had a gun to 
                    her pregnant belly.

                                  ART
                          (to Tim)
                    It was a hell of a shot.  You 
                    consider what would ve happened if 
                    you d missed?

                                  TIM
                    I can t carry a tune or shoot a 
                      basketball, and my handwriting is 
                      borderline illegible.  But I don t 
                    miss.

                                  ART
                          (then)
                    Alright, that ll do it.

      Raylan and Tim get up to leave.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Raylan?  Stay a minute would you?

      Tim and Raylan exchange a nod.  Tim goes.  Beat, then:

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Do I need to be concerned?

                                  RAYLAN
                    About what?

      Art kind of nods, towards Tim and the door.  Raylan realizes 
      what he s hinting at.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Oh, Christ.  He saw us, didn t he?
                          (then)
                    Listen, it s not a big deal.  Just 
                    two people, having a beer, seeing 
                    some music.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    9.

                          (Raylan nods, then)

                    Wait, what... what re you talking

                    I m asking if I need to be 
                    concerned about Tim.  He just shot 
                    a man.  You ve shot men.  He seems 
                      a little... off.  And you re always 
                    a little off, so I m asking you.

                    Don t think you re getting off the 
                    hook.  Two people, out having 
                    beers, seeing music...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Let s forget it.

                                  ART
                    So, what?  You were out with 
                    someone and Tim happened to be 
                    there too?

                                  RAYLAN

                    Goodbye, Art.

      Raylan turns to leave.  But Art grabs his coat, says:

                                  ART
                    I ll walk with you.  Something else 
                    you should hear.

      As Art and Raylan exit his office into --


      And continue the walk and talk...

                                  ART
                    Got a call right before you came in 
                    from Tom Bergen, State Trooper down 
                    in Harlan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sure.  Helped us out on the Jimmy 
                    Earl Dean thing.

                                  ART
                    Well, one of his Troopers came 
                    across an abandoned church bus out 
                    on Glen Hollow Road.  Lone 
                    remaining passenger had a hole in 
                    his head the size of a .38 caliber 
                    bullet.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll be sure to steer clear of that 
                    church.

                                  ART
                    Shouldn t be a problem: apparently 
                    the  church  doesn t exist.  Bus 
                    was stolen.  And they found a 
                    receipt on the floor from a 
                      convenience store in Jacksonville, 
                    Florida.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    They think it was an Oxy run?

                                  ART
                          (yup)
                    Probably on the return leg when it 
                    was hit by another set of 
                      criminals.

                    God dammit.

                                  ART
                    You think it was him?

                    Thought you said he was playing it 
                    straight.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Wouldn t be the first time he said 
                    one thing and did another.  I ll 
                    call when I get down there.

      Raylan moves to leave.  Then, Art gets it:

                                  ART
                    Holy shit.  I just got it...

                    Winona.  You were out with Winona.

      Raylan stops, busted.  Art starts laughing.

                    And I thought sleeping with a

                    And I d love to tell you, but my 
                    presence is needed down in Harlan.

      A shithole in the middle of nowhere (*could be a trailer). 
      Cutter is emptying the pills from the INDIVIDUAL PRESCRIPTION 
      CONTAINERS into a single LARGE ZIPLOC BAG.  Elrod is watching 
      ANGEL THE DOG happily lick his own crotch.

                                  CUTTER
                    We got the pills, he don t.

      Cutter ANSWERS THE PHONE.  (*PRODUCTION NOTE: WE DO NOT HEAR 
      THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE)

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    Hey...
                          (then)
                    We gotta talk.  There s a lot here. 
                    Much more than you said.
                          (then)

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    We think 50 is fair.
                          (then)
                    Think about it.  We could keep the 
                    pills, sell  em ourselves, make 20 
                    times that.

      But then Cutter swallows, as he s threatened brutally by the 
      voice on the other end.  Elrod shrugs -- what the fuck did I 
      just tell you?

                                  CUTTER (CONT D)
                    Alright, see you then.

      Cutter hangs up.  A beat.

                                  ELROD
                    What d he say?

                                  CUTTER
                    We could sell  em ourselves, but we 
                    should do it in another country, 
                    cause he d devote everything he 
                    could to finding and killing us.

      Including the HUNTING RIFLES on the far wall, and beside 
      them, a MOUNTED DISPLAY OF STETSON HATS --

      He looks for just another moment, when Dewey Crowe has what

      It s dark, blinds drawn, just a hint of daylight poking 
      through.  Elrod and Cutter.  PILLS spread out on the table, 
      the two of them partying, having a good ol  time.

      Elrod has crushed up a pill.  Is calling to the DOG:

                                  ELROD
                    Angel baby, you come on over here.

                    Elrod, you feed any of that shit to 
                    my dog we re gonna have a problem.

      Elrod s considering whether or not to keep going, when --

      DEWEY COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, wearing his best 
       Raylan Costume  - jeans, boots, hat pulled down low - and 
      brandishing a REVOLVER.  He KILLS THE LIGHTS, YELLS:

                                  DEWEY

      And Dewey, comic as we ve seen him, in this moment Dewey s 
      pretty fucking scary.

      Cutter and Elrod, off guard and afraid, have their hands in 
      the air, and do begin to get down on the ground --

      As the DOG SCURRIES BENEATH THE TABLE --

      As Dewey, FIRES A FEW TIMES, managing to TAKE OUT the LAMP at 
      the far end of the TRAILER --

      Dewey walks up to Cutter, who s trying to look over his 
      shoulder, HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH THE GUN.

      Elrod and Cutter, high on Oxy and pretty well terrified, stay 
      face down on the floor, hands behind their head.

      The DOG COWERING, STILL SCARED --

      As Dewey FRISKS each of them.  Finds a HANDGUN on Elrod, puts 
      it into his WAISTBAND.

      But Dewey FIRES A SHOT through the WINDOW, causing both MEN

      Cutter shoots Elrod a harsh gaze.

                    last mistake you ever make.

      As Dewey goes to the microwave, we re suddenly --

      ON A REVERSE POV with STEVIE, 20s, scared, hiding in the back 
      room.  She PEEKS around the door frame, watches Dewey go to 
      the kitchen.  And though the LIGHT shining in the KITCHEN 
      WINDOW she gets a look at him, especially the top of his NECK 
      TATTOO.  This clearly strikes her as odd, but she stays quiet 
      and still, and then we re --

      BACK WITH DEWEY, removing the PILLS from the microwave.  
      Paydirt.

                                  CUTTER
                    You have any idea who you re 
                    stealing from right now asshole?

                                  DEWEY
                    Hmm, well, let me see... is he a 
                    Federal Marshal, like I am?
                          (then)
                    Then I don t give a shit!

                    You watch your back.  We ll see you 
                    again.

      Dewey now walks up to Cutter, KICKS HIM HARD right in the 
      gut.

                                  DEWEY
                    I see you either of you again, I m 
                    gonna put a hole through you.
                          (then, can t resist)
                    If I was you boys, I d give up this 
                    Oxy bullshit, go back to poaching 
                    gators, safer.

      And as Cutter and Elrod make eye contact, not sure what the 
      fuck just happened, Dewey hustles out of the trailer.

                    I had nothing to do with that bus 
                    being robbed.

                    Okay.  I believe you.

                    But that doesn t mean you don t

                    And what if I did?  Would I be 
                    obligated to tell you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No.  You could always lie.

                      informers?  Is that what you want?

      Raylan s PHONE RINGS.  Raylan checks it.  Looks back to Boyd.

      Through the door comes Dewey.  Still on a rush from having 
      pulled off the job.  He immediately sees Ellen May.  Goes 
      right at her.

                                  DEWEY
                    Ellen May.  Why don t you grab a 
                    friend and let s all head out back, 
                    have us some fun.

                                  ELLEN MAY
                    You for real?

      Dewey produces a COUPLE PILLS from his pocket, hands them 
      over.  Ellen May examines them, then, delighted:

                                  ELLEN MAY (CONT D)

                    Oh.  I m good either way.

      And Ellen May, smile on her face, walks off.  Dewey then 
      spots Boyd at the bar.  Goes to him.  Sits.  Boyd s already 
      seen Dewey, knows exactly what this is.

      Boyd takes him in, can t believe his stupidity.  The 
      Bartender walks up.

      Boyd finishes his drink.  Stands.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Givens.

      And we begin to INTERCUT WITH --


      Boyd, phone to his ear, as conflicted as we ve ever seen him.

                                  BOYD
                          (then)
                    I was wondering Raylan, if back 
                    when we were digging coal together, 
                    you had any inkling of the man I 
                    might someday become?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Seems back then, neither of us knew 
                    what kind of man we d be.  But I 
                    certainly never thought we d end up 
                    on opposite sides of loaded guns.

                                  BOYD
                    I never thought I d make a phone 
                    call like this.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you re going to tell me about 
                    Dewey, I already know.

                                  BOYD
                          (then)
                    He s at Audry s, doling out Oxy 
                    like it s candy, no sense of 
                      discretion that boy, not one bit.

                    Thank you, Boyd.

      One of the trailer s out back of Audry s.  In it, we find 
      ELLEN and and the other girl, each down to bra and underwear, 
      high as hell.  Also there is Dewey, King for a Day, wearing 
      underwear, boots, gator necklace and Stetson Hat.  Ellen May 
      and the other girl KISS.

                                  DEWEY
                    That is just about the best thing I 
                    ever laid eyes on.

                    Dewey Crowe.

                                  DEWEY

                    good times from here on in.  Now 
                    why don t you two kiss a little 
                    more so I can watch.

      Dewey is so excited he s about to burst.  As Ellen May and 
      the Girl go to kiss each other, when suddenly --

      A POUNDING ON THE DOOR.  WTF?

      And there s RAYLAN.  Taking in the scene before him.

                    I always figured you for a special 
                    kind of idiot, Dewey Crowe.  But 
                    what you have done in the past 12 
                    hours is light years ahead of any 
                    stupidity even I thought you were 
                    capable of.

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t know what you mean.

      Raylan now holds up a bag of PILLS.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You left these in your trunk.

      Tosses him the bag.  Dewey catches it.  Stunned.

                    planning on telling me right after 
                    you finished up here, that it?

                                  DEWEY

      Dewey now approaches Raylan, who inches back, extremely 
      uncomfortable being this close to an almost naked Dewey.

      Dewey holds up FIVE FINGERS.

                    Dewey, I heard within five minutes 
                    you were handing out pills.  How

                          (then)
                    Clothes.  Now.

      As Dewey realizes it s over, he grudgingly begins to put his 
      clothes on.  Raylan goes to the trailer door, just to make 
      sure they re in the clear.  So far so good.

                    ride in the first place?

      Dewey eyes the girls.  Raylan gets it.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    If you re worried about looking 
                    like less than a man, I think that

                    You deal with anyone above him?

      Dewey just shakes his head.  Raylan s considering this, as 
      from the doorway he sees --





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    39.

      Elrod and Cutter walking around the side of Audry s back up 
      towards the trailer.  And they do not look happy --

      ON RAYLAN.  Shit.  He pulls his BADGE, and from the doorway:

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Boys, U.S. Marshal!  I m gonna ask 
                    you to stop right there and put 
                    your hands where I can see  em.

                                  CUTTER
                    We ain t falling for that shit 
                    again.

      As Elrod and Cutter both PULL GUNS and START SHOOTING --

      As RAYLAN PULLS HIS GUN, FIRING BACK, as he FALLS INTO THE 
      TRAILER and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT --

                                  RAYLAN
                    Down!

      As EVERYONE HITS THE DECK, BULLETS RIP THROUGH THE TRAILER 
      ALL AROUND THEM.  Raylan raises himself up to the WINDOW, 
      BREAKS IT, THEN FIRES A FEW SHOTS OFF --

      Which send Elrod and Cutter running for COVER --


                                  END OF ACT THREE    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    40.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Raylan reloads, looks at Dewey.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well you wanted to be Raylan 
                    Givens, here s your chance: go get 
                     em.

      On Dewey, not sure whether or not Raylan is serious.  Raylan 
      peeks out the window, sees --

      Elrod and Cutter trying to ADVANCE on the trailer.  Raylan 
      FIRES, sending them both SCRAMBLING back to their COVER.

      Raylan considers, then, YELLING OUT THE SHOT-OUT WINDOW: 
        (*Throughout this, we will continue to CUT BACK AND FORTH 
      between Raylan and Cutter and Elrod.)

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Would you both stop shooting long 
                    enough so s I can have a word with 
                    you?
                          (then)
                    By now I m sure you ve figured out 
                    it wasn t Raylan Givens that robbed 
                    you.  But the person who did do it 
                    is in here with me right now, as 
                    are the pills that he took from 
                    you. That s the bad news.  But the 
                    worse news is that I actually am 
                    Raylan Givens, so right now you re 
                    trying to kill a US Marshal, which 
                    no jury is going to take kindly to.

      Elrod and Cutter both take this in.  Shit.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now, I know you want your pills and 
                    the guy who took  em, and to be 
                    honest I m tempted to give him to 
                    you.  But unfortunately I can t, so 
                    I can only offer you a deal: put 
                    down your guns and let me take you 
                    in.  Then, you give me some idea of 
                    who recruited you to rob that Oxy 
                    shipment in the first place, and I 
                    can promise that the D.A. will go 
                    easier on you for killing Bobby.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    41.

                    Or you can keep shooting, and in 
                    two minutes when the cavalry 
                    arrives you ll either be killed, or 
                    arrested and offered a deal much 
                    less sweet than what I m offering.

      Off RAYLAN, who knows if they re not shooting, he must be 
      reaching them --

      ON ELROD AND CUTTER.  Considering it.

                                  CUTTER
                    You wanna be a snitch?

                                  ELROD
                    I don t wanna be dead.

      Then, DOYLE appears behind them both, gun held high.

                                  DOYLE
                    Either of you move I ll kill you.
                          (then)
                    Put the guns down, hands where I 
                    can see  em.

      Off Cutter and Elrod, knowing they re fucked --

      TO RAYLAN, who peeks out, sees Doyle.  Gets to his feet --

      TO DOYLE, speaking quietly with Elrod and Cutter.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    You two get one shot at this: tell 
                    me who hired you to hit that bus.

                                  CUTTER
                    You honestly don t know?
                          (then)
                    It was your brother, Dickie.

                                  DOYLE
                    Yeah, that s what I thought.

      Off Doyle, considering this, we go to --

      RAYLAN, struggling to get a good look at what s going on out 
      there.  Then he HEARS:

                                  DOYLE  (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    Don t do it!

      Followed closely by FOUR GUNSHOTS.  Raylan busts out the 
      TRAILER DOOR --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    42.

      CONTINUED: (2)1919

      Sees Doyle moving to the BODIES, KICKING their guns away, 
      watching coldly as Cutter and Elrod take their last breaths.

      Raylan moves to them, gun still drawn.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    Must a thought I was kidding when I 
                    told them to put down their guns.

      As Raylan goes from Elrod to Cutter, both of them already 
      DEAD and GONE.  Doyle holsters his weapon and moves away, 
      already pulling out his phone to call this in.  Off Raylan, 
      staring at these bodies, and then Doyle, on his phone...

      OMITTED2020


      Coover and Dickie are sitting on the couch.  Coover takes a 
      bong rip.  Holds it.  Then, coughs mightily.  Dickie looks 
      over from the t.v., shaking his head.

                                  DICKIE
                    All that you smoke and you still 
                    just can t help yourself, huh?

                                  COOVER
                    I m under some serious stress here.  
                    Don t know why you re so calm.

    A beat.  Then, Dickie s PHONE RINGS.  He checks it.  Looks to 
      Coover, a little confused.

                                  COOVER (CONT D)
                    Who is it?

                    Cutter.

                                  COOVER
                    But... the news said Cutter was 
                    dead...

      Dickie gives Coover a look, answers the call:

                                  DICKIE
                    Yeah?

                                  VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                    Is this the dumbest piece of cat 
                    shit on the face of the Earth?

      As Doyle now takes the phone and THROWS IT at Dickie and 
      Coover.  It misses them, SHATTERING against the wall.

                        COOVERDICKIE
      Jesus Christ--Damnit, Doyle--

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    Both of you, outside, now.

                                  COOVER
                    What?  Why--

                                  DOYLE
                    Cause it smells like pot and piss 
                    in here, that s why.

      Doyle goes.  A beat, then Dickie and Coover follow --


      Boyd, posted up at the bar in Cumberland where he had a drink 
      with Raylan in 202.  It s late morning, very quiet, almost no 
      one else in the place.  Boyd has come straight from his shift 
      and he s drunk, conflicted, tightly wound when --

      Coming at him from down the bar is Kyle.  Pruitt and Marcus 
      sit a few seats away.  Boyd can t believe it.

                                  KYLE
                    Well whatta you know?  Boyd 
                    Crowder.  Fancy that.

                                  BOYD
                          (almost to himself)
                    I wonder what a man must do to have 
                    a quiet drink in these parts.

      Kyle extracts FIVE DOLLARS, slides it to the Bartender.

                                  KYLE
                    Bourbon, please.

                                  BOYD
                    I thought I d made it fairly clear 
                    that I prefer to drink alone.

                                  KYLE
                    You did.  And I respect that, I do.  
                    But I have something to offer you, 
                    was hoping maybe we could help each 
                    other out.

      The Bartender comes by, sets Kyle s drink down.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                      I probably should have just come 
                    clean at the mine, but the truth is 
                    I know who you are Boyd, and I 
                    admire all that you done.
                          (then)
                    I mean, Crowder s Commandos?  Shit 
                    brother, you re a local legend.  
                    Killing Jews like you was in a

                                  BOYD
                    I never killed any Jews, Kyle.  In 
                    fact, I don t believe I ve ever met 
                    a Jew in my life.

      Boyd finishes his drink.  Begins to leave cash.

                                  KYLE
                    All I m trying to say is I 
                      understand all that you done.  You 
                    had a vision.  Well, I have a 
                    vision too, Boyd.  You and me, 
                    we re the same--

      But now Boyd is up from his seat.  Kyle quickly moves to 
      block his path.  A beat.

                                  BOYD
                    You know nothing about me, or why 
                    I ve done the things that I have.

                                  KYLE
                    Ain t nothing to be ashamed of 
                    Boyd.  I killed people, too.  I ve 
                    lost friends, just like you did out 
                    in those woods.  But that 
                      sacrifice, it s necessary.  Men 
                    like you and me understand that.
























                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    48.

      And Boyd, now he pushes past Kyle, towards the door.  Kyle 
      follows Boyd, as do Pruitt and Marcus from the mine.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Oh come on, Crowder...

      As Boyd exits the bar, all three men are not far behind him --


      As Boyd starts the ignition.  Just as Kyle reaches the truck, 
      and REACHES across Boyd to TURN OFF THE IGNITION.

                                  KYLE
                    Hear me out, just two more minutes, 
                    that s all I m asking--

      And in this moment all the anger Boyd s been ignoring, all 
      the pain that has been roiling down deep inside, finally 
      BOILS OVER.  He GRABS Kyle around the NECK with one arm, as 
      he throws the TRUCK INTO REVERSE WITH THE OTHER --

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna talk some more, Kyle?  
                    Fine, you come on with me, we ll 
                    have us some one-on-one time.

      And Boyd quickly BACKS UP, then throws the car into DRIVE, 
      and PULLS OUT ONTO THE ROAD.














                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    49.

      Kyle is pissed off and scared, trying with all his might to 
      shake loose.  His friends try to grab him, but Kyle s quickly 
      out of reach, as he SCRAMBLES TO KEEP UP WITH THE 
        ACCELERATING TRUCK.

                                  KYLE
                    Oh, shit!

      But Boyd is holding tight; there s no shaking loose.

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna hear about my past?  How 
                    I blew shit up, killed people, got 
                    people killed?  That what you re 
                      interested in?

      And now they re out on the open road --

      The SPEEDOMETER AT 25 MILES AN HOUR --

      A FIRE IN BOYD S EYES --

                                  KYLE
                    Stop the car, Boyd!

      As Kyle s FEET BEGIN TO DRAG, and now he s gone from trying 
      to wriggle free to trying to HOLD ON with all his might.

      But Boyd s not stopping.  In fact, he continues to SPEED UP --

      THE SPEEDOMETER now CROSSING 30, to 35 --

                                  BOYD
                    Or, maybe you d like to talk about 
                    God.  About religion, that it?

                                  KYLE
                    Jesus Christ, Boyd--


                                  BOYD
                    You want to talk about Jesus?  You 
                    want to meet him, maybe?
                          (then)
                        WHHHHHEEEEEEEHHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!

      And Boyd, unleashing this YELL, all his fires burning, the 
      SPEEDOMETER at 40, RELEASES KYLE --

      Who GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE PAVEMENT, HEAD OVER HEELS, the 
      kind of fall that could kill a man.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    50.

      CONTINUED: (2)2424

      ON BOYD, as the truck moves down the road, his adrenaline 
      pumping, his eyes still wild with the thrill of the moment.

      But a few beats and Boyd s breathing slows.  His smile fades.  
      He STOPS THE TRUCK.  Cranes out the window, where he sees --

      KYLE, lying motionless on the road --

      ON BOYD, taking in what he just did.  He then turns the 
      wheel, starts to go back to help Kyle, when --

      KYLE MOVES.  Slowly and painfully, but he s moving.  Manages 
      to sit up, holding his arm, banged up but alive.  Not too far  
      away, Pruitt and Marcus are jogging up the road towards him --

      ON BOYD, who reconsiders, straightens out the wheel, and 
      continues on down the empty road.
