      FADE IN:

      HIGH ABOVE an exclusive enclave known as --

       THE GATES  - MORNING

      Yes, as the name implies, the community is  gated,  but if 
      you re thinking cookie-cutter homes clustered outside Vegas, 
      you ve got the wrong place.

      No, the setting into which we descend is in a class of its 
      own. Nearly 750 stately homes.  Manicured lots.  And given 
      the private mountain location, truly a place in which just 
      about anyone would kill to live.  And rumor has it, on 
      occasion, they have.  But certainly not CLAIRE RADCLIFF.  In 
      fact, the mid-thirties woman we find clipping ROSES outside a 
      tastefully sized --

      TUDOR HOME

      -- is the model  Gates  citizen.  Wealthy, but not 
      ostentatious.  Private, but not exclusive.  And above all, 
      committed to family, which for Claire, means doing everything 
      within her power to nurture and protect her only child, seven-
      year-old EMILY, the one we find toying with her skateboard, 
      awaiting carpool.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Honey.  No skateboarding without 
                    your helmet.

      Emily gives her mother a defiant look, but there s a certain 
      quality to Claire s gaze that makes her rarely, if ever, have 
      to repeat herself.          

      Instead, Emily kicks the skateboard up the hill toward the 
      garage.  CAMERA tracks along as it rolls to a stop, but then, 
      after a brief pause, reverse direction, and ever so slowly, 
      start back down the incline.  

      At the same time, just up the --

      STREET 

      -- a RANGE ROVER gains speed as it rounds the bend.

      DRIVEWAY

      Noticing the errant skateboard, Emily takes off in pursuit.

      INTERCUT:                                                                                      2.


      INT. RANGE ROVER

      MARK WOODBURY, more cocky than handsome, but plenty of both, 
      talks on the phone via BLUETOOTH.  

                                  WOODBURY
                    Hey, it s me, I m leaving now... 
                    No, two hours at the most. 

      DRIVEWAY 

      Emily gains on the skateboard.

      YARD 

      Hearing the patter of her daughter s feet, Claire looks up, 
      sees the chase, which is no real cause for alarm until she 
      spots the fast approaching RANGE ROVER.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Emily!

      DRIVEWAY 

      Over the increasing RATTLE of the rolling skateboard, Emily 
      fails to hear her mother s call.

      Claire takes off in pursuit.

                                  CLAIRE
                    EMILY!!

      INT. RANGE ROVER 

      Woodbury continues, oblivious to the scene unfolding before 
      him.

                                  WOODBURY
                    You kidding me?  My sister has 
                    three kids.  It was two days of 
                    hell...

      DRIVEWAY

      Hurrying down the driveway, Claire screams to Emily, to the 
      car, to anyone --

                                  CLAIRE
                    STOP!!  STOP!!

      Nearing the street, Emily finally glances back, sees her 
      panicked mother.  But in that confused moment before she can 
      react, Emily reaches the end of the driveway.                                                                                      3.


      INT. RANGE ROVER  

      Through the windshield, we see the skateboard shoot out 
      between two BRICK COLUMNS.  And then, following just behind, 
      Emily, terror sweeping over her face as she sees the 
      approaching truck.  She stops in the street, frozen.  

      And as the car hastens toward a brutal collision, Woodbury 
      suddenly spots her, SWERVES SHARPLY to the right.

      Barely clearing Emily, the SUV crashes hard into one of the 
      BRICK COLUMNS.  Claire reaches the --

      STREET 

      -- a moment later, snatches Emily up in her arms.

                                  EMILY
                          (scared, confused)
                    I m sorry, mommy.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s okay, baby.  Everything s 
                    okay.

      Approaching the wrecked Range Rover, Claire finds the dazed 
      driver, a hand to his forehead.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Are you alright?

                                  WOODBURY
                    Yeah, I think so...

      However, upon lowering his hand, Woodbury finds it dripping 
      with blood.

                                  WOODBURY (CONT D)
                    Or... maybe not.

      As though in shock, Claire is staring at the blood soaked 
      hand when Emily s carpool pulls up behind her.  CONCERNED 
      MOTHER leans toward the passenger window.

                                  CONCERNED MOTHER
                    Claire?  What happened?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (snapping out of it)
                    Um, it s fine.  Everything s fine, 
                    but I think I may have to drop off 
                    Emily later.                                                                                      4.


                                  EMILY
                    No, mommy, I want to go now.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You sure?  I can take you.

      Emily shakes her head.  Automatic door slides open.  Claire 
      buckles Emily in, gives her a kiss, and after watching them 
      drive off, turns her attention back to Woodbury.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    We should get you inside.

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

      Top of the line fixtures.  ANTIQUE PLATES perfectly lit atop 
      the shelves.

      At the table, we find Woodbury, a towel to his head, but 
      certainly well enough to admire the ass on Claire as she 
      reaches for the FIRST AID KIT.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    I should probably call your sister, 
                    have her come down.

                                  WOODBURY
                    Bad idea.  She faints at the sight 
                    of blood.

      Claire approaches, pulls a chair close.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Well is there anyone else I should 
                    notify?  Wife?  Girlfriend?

                                  WOODBURY
                    Neither lately.  In fact, I think 
                    this may be the closest I ve been 
                    to a woman all year.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (holds his gaze a moment)
                    Well, I m sure it s just a matter 
                    of time. 

                                  WOODBURY
                          (fishing)
                    Hope so.  I m not sure how much 
                    longer I can wait.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (eyes him a beat)
                    Yes, well... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    I m afraid you ll have to wait a 
                    bit longer because I am married.

      Woodbury smiles slightly as she dabs the wound with a COTTON 
      BALL.

      Finishing with the wound, Claire pulls away, looks down at 
      the blood stained cotton ball.  In her eyes, we see her 
      struggling against temptation.  Then --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Unless, of course, you re okay with 
                    the fact that my husband just 
                    happens to be... out of town.

      Woodbury eyes her, trying to get a read.

                                  WOODBURY
                    For how long?

      Claire leans back, eyes him seductively. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Long enough.

      Talk about Desperate Fucking Housewives.  Woodbury stares, 
      disbelieving, then leans forward, their faces inches apart.  
      But just before their lips meet, Claire stands abruptly, 
      walks a few steps across the kitchen, and hops up on to the 
      counter beside the sink.  Clearing the space beside her, she 
      moves the STOPPER over the drain.  Then, looking back at 
      Woodbury, she parts her legs.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    I kinda have a thing... for 
                    kitchens.

      As of now, so does Woodbury.  Stepping over to join her, he 
      runs his hands up her thighs.  Staring back at him, ravenous, 
      Claire grabs him by the hair, pulls his lips to her neck.  
      Ecstasy pours over her face, her eyes closing.  Her lips 
      part, ever so slightly, pleasure escaping.  A little more, 
      and we catch a glimpse of something else, something 
      different.  Not sure, we wait.  And then, with the coming of 
    a deep, rapturous sigh, Claire suddenly tears into Woodbury s 
      neck, latching on like a fighting dog.  He squirms violently, 
      doing everything he can to break free, but at this point, 
      it s no use.  No escaping now.  And as the life finally 
      drains from his body, Claire releases, leaning his limp 
      corpse over the sink.  And off warm, fresh BLOOD pooling over 
      clean white PORCELAIN, we --

                                        ACT ONE

      Open CLOSE ON thick IRON-FORGED LETTERS spelling  THE GATES.    
      Then, as the two words slowly part before us, we PULL BACK to 
      reveal --

      EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE -  THE GATES  - DAY

      -- a well-travelled FORD EXPLORER just outside the entrance.

      INT. FORD EXPLORER

      It may be just an entrance, but to NICK and SARAH MONOHAN, 
      both born and raised on the south side of Chicago, it has the 
      desired effect.

                                  SARAH
                    Pretty intimidating gate.

                                  NICK
                    I think that s the point.

      Leaning up between the seats, we meet ten-year-old DANA 
      MONOHAN.  Known to dive with passion into what ever piques 
      her interest, she has been studying  The Gates  obsessively 
      for the past month.  Reading from the BROCHURE --

                                  DANA
                    The developer, Frank Buckley, said 
                    no expense would be spared when it 
                    comes to security.  He had these 
                    gates hand forged in England.  
                    Sixteen feet tall. Eleven tons of 
                    steel. They ve never been breached.

        Fifteen-year-old CHARLIE MONOHAN casts a curious glance at 
      his sister.  Usually the smartest guy in the room, but from 
      streets where that s not necessarily a good thing, Charlie 
      has yet to find his place in the world.  But he s pretty damn 
      sure it s not  The Gates. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    What about people trying to get 
                    out?

                                  SARAH
                    Open mind, Charlie.

      Charlie smiles slightly as the Explorer pulls forward to the -

      SECURITY KIOSK

      - where EDDIE, finally making an earnest effort at a career, 
      steps out to greet them.                                                                                        7.


                                  EDDIE
                    Welcome to The Gates.  Name please.

                                  NICK
                    Nick Monohan.

                                  EDDIE
                    Oh... Chief.  Yeah, we ve been 
                    expecting you.
                          (pulls out an envelope)
                    Here s your welcome packet, 
                      directions to the house, keys, and 
                    I m Eddie, security, Main Gate.

                                  NICK
                    Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yes sir.

                                  NICK
                    This is my ID.  For future 
                      reference, you might want to see 
                    that before handing over keys to a 
                    house.

                                  SARAH
                          (leaning over)
                    Hi.  I m Sarah, and what my husband 
                    meant to say is...  thank you. 
                          (off Nick, pulling away)
                    It s okay for the Chief of Police 
                    to be liked.

      EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

         Larchmont -like shopping district. Quaint stores and cafes 
      lining the street.  As the Explorer passes through --  

                                  SARAH
                    I didn t know they had all these 
                    cute little shops.

      INT. FORD EXPLORER - CONTINUOUS

                                  DANA
                    It s more than a place to live, 
                    mom.
                          (off Sarah s look)
                    What?  That s their slogan.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      8.


      A MOVER wheeling a LOADED DOLLY out the back of a MOVING 
      TRUCK.  Reaching the street, he turns toward a beautifully 
      proportioned, impeccably crafted --

      MISSION STYLE HOME

      -- as the Monohan clan climbs from their Explorer, awestruck.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You sure this is it?

      Not convinced himself, Nick looks at the KEY in his hand.

      INT. HOUSE

      CLOSE ON the massive carved wood door as the LOCK TURNS.  
      Door opens, and in step the Monahans.  REVERSE TO a 
        spectacular, two story --

      FOYER

      -- wrapped by a winding staircase.  Hand painted tile.  
        Wrought-iron railing.  It s far beyond what they ever 
      imagined.  After a beat, Dana bolts for the stairs.

                                  DANA
                    First dibs on rooms!!

      Charlie takes off after her, gaining up the stairs.  Nick and 
      Sarah watch, amused as they split at the top of the stairs, 
      each taking a different direction.

      Sarah and Nick walk down the hall to reveal a --

      KITCHEN/GREAT ROOM

      -- bigger than their last apartment.  Highest end appliances.  
      Plasma over the fireplace.  And visible through the french 
      doors, a sparkling pool.  As Sarah stares, disbelieving, Nick 
      sees unexpected tears well in her eyes.

                                  NICK
                    Hey... We made it.  It s gonna be 
                    okay.

      Sarah turns and nods, hopeful.  They come together in an 
      embrace, and then kiss, growing more and more passionate 
      until Dana comes racing through, screaming like the little 
      girl she rarely is.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    How  bout we check out our bedroom.

      And off Sarah s knowing smile --                                                                                      9.


      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - MORNING

      Beams of rising sun creep down the east side of the house.

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

      But little light in here.  In fact, BLACK OUT SHADES allow 
      barely enough to see CLAIRE in the shower, aggressively 
      scrubbing from her face any remaining  scent .

      INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

      Still nearly dark, a succession of TIGHT SHOTS as Claire 
      hurriedly spreads LOTION over her entire body, head to toe. 
      Then, pulling on a SHORT ROBE, she opens the door to the --

      MASTER BEDROOM: to reveal beams of SUNLIGHT angling in 
      through the windows.  Keeping up the quick pace, Claire is 
      heading across the room toward the closet when her exposed 
      legs pass through DIRECT SUNLIGHT.

      A painful SCREAM as she collapses to the ground.  Examining 
      her leg, finds a small BURN on her CALF.  Damn.  Missed a 
      spot.  She takes a moment,  surveys her options.  BEAMS of 
      SUNLIGHT to her left... and right.

      Looking over the foot of the bed, she spots shade, and more 
      LOTION on the bedside table.  Climbing over, she quickly 
      applies more to her legs.  Then, gathering courage, she 
      slides to the edge of the bed, and as though testing hot 
      water,  dips  each leg, one by one, into the light.  Safe.

      EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

      From a sign reading: THE GATES PREPARATORY SCHOOL, we PAN to 
      reveal a bucolic campus nestled in the heart of this gated 
      community.  In the line of approaching, high end, cars, we 
      find the Monohan s Ford Explorer.

      INT. FORD EXPLORER - SAME

      Nick, Charlie and Dana take in the setting.

                                  NICK
                    How bad could it be?  No graffiti.  
                    No metal detectors...

                                  DANA
                    Whatever.  It sends more kids to 
                    the Ivy League than any school in 
                    the state.
                          (hoping out)
                    See ya, dad.                                                                                    10.


      With considerably less enthusiasm, Charlie opens the door.  
      We can feel Nick s guilt as he watches his son walk away. 

      EXT. SCHOOL - BREEZEWAY - MINUTES LATER

      Amidst STUDENTS pouring into the school, we find Charlie at a 
      vending machine.  He drops some coins, presses a button.  
      Nothing.  Presses again.  No luck.

      Just then, among a few GIRLS passing by, we see ANDIE BATES, 
      mixed race, exotic, and somehow even more intelligent than 
      she is beautiful.

                                  ANDIE
                    Forget everything but O.J.  
                          (then, with a smile)
                    All part of the vast conspiracy to 
                    keep us healthy.

      Charlie acknowledges the tip with a nod, and then watches her 
      go. Maybe this place won t be so bad after all.

      EXT. THE GATES - POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

      From a beautifully landscaped, Mission-style bungalow, we 
      crane down to a parking space, clearly marked: Nick Monohan, 
      Chief of Police, as Nick pulls in.

      INT. PRECINCT

      Nick enters, looks around.  No hustle.  No bustle.  No hand 
      cuffed perps lining the walls.  Just two COPS, their backs to 
      the door, using the latest computer software to create a 
      fictional COMPOSITE SKETCH.  

      And at the far end of the room, another COP flipping through 
    a MAGAZINE while  monitoring  a huge bank of VIDEO SECURITY 
      FEEDS.

      Finally, one of the cops, MARCUS JORDAN, mid-twenties, eager, 
      sometimes too much so, shoots to his feet. 

                                  MARCUS
                    Uh, good morning, sir, I mean, 
                    Chief.  Marcus Jordan.

      The  cat  to Marcus   dog,  LEIGH TURNER, (25), sexy and 
      cool, has a more laid back approach.

                                  LEIGH
                    Hey, how are you?  I m Leigh.

      Nick shakes hands, takes another look around.                                                                                    11.


                                  NICK
                    Good to meet you. So... where s 
                    everyone else?

                                  MARCUS
                    Old Chief liked to start just a few 
                    of us in the morning.

                                  NICK
                    And the old Chief is...?

                                  LEIGH
                    Retired.  In Mexico.  

                                  NICK
                    Couldn t handle the fast pace? 

      Leigh smiles.  Touche.  Marcus jumps in --

                                  MARCUS
                    Well, a turf war did erupt 
                    yesterday over on Barksdale.

                                  NICK
                          (perking up)
                    Really?  Over what?

                                  MARCUS
                    Turf.  As in grass.  The Claytons 
                    installed artificial, say it s more 
                      environmentally responsible.  
                    Neighbors claim it violates the 
                      landscaping code.

                                  LEIGH
                    Also from last night, we lost 
                    picture on three security cameras 
                    in Sector Four.  Maintenance is 
                    looking into it, but this many in 
                    the same sector, probably 
                      vandalism.

                                  NICK
                      Vandalism.  In The Gates.

                                  LEIGH
                    It s what rich kids do for fun.

                                  MARCUS
                    Before the cameras went down, they 
                    did pick up something of interest --

                                  LEIGH
                    -- but not really that interesting.                                                                                    12.


                                  MARCUS
                          (throws Leigh a look)
                    If you ll follow me, sir.

      Marcus leads Nick and Leigh to the -- 

      SECURITY MONITORS

      -- takes a seat at the high tech console, and with the turn 
      of a dial runs FOOTAGE of the car accident at the Radcliff s.

                                  NICK
                    The driver okay?

                                  LEIGH
                    He s fine.  Walked away.

                                  MARCUS
                    We can t really say for sure.  We 
                    saw him walk into the Radcliff 
                    house, but this camera went down 
                    before he came out.

                                  LEIGH
                    But the car is registered to a 
                    guest, a Mark Woodbury from Santa 
                    Barbara, and it s gone.

                                  MARCUS
                    However, there s no record of it 
                    leaving The Gates.

                                  NICK
                    Okay, okay... first thing we need 
                    to do is call Santa Barbara Police 
                    and see if they can track this guy 
                    down. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A FINGER pressing a doorbell.  PAN to reveal Claire Radcliff 
      waiting outside the --

      MONOHAN FRONT DOOR 

      -- the DISH of LASAGNA in hand.  After a moment, Sarah 
      answers the door.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Please tell me you eat carbs.                                                                                     13.


      INT. MONOHAN KITCHEN - LATER

      Pushing boxes aside, Sarah makes room for Claire at the 
      island. 

                                  SARAH
                    I m sorry about the mess.  I had no 
                    idea our tiny apartment could hold 
                    this much stuff.  Coffee?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Tea s fine.  Whatever you ve got.

                                  SARAH
                          (digging through a box)
                    I think I have some in here...

                                  CLAIRE
                    You know what?  Don t worry about 
                    it.

                                  SARAH
                    No, it s one of these.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really, water would be great.  But 
                    if you do like tea, go see Peg at 
                    The Tea Pot.  She s got something 
                    for everything...

      Sarah finds a CERAMIC CANISTER, but as she pulls it from the 
      box, it slips from her hand, CRASHES to the floor.  She puts 
      her hands on the counter, takes a breath.

                                  SARAH
                    What about... stress?

      Feeling for her, Claire reaches across, puts a warm, 
      comforting hand over Sarah s.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Look, sometimes a big change can be 
                      overwhelming.  But trust me, Peg  
                    can make it easier.  Tell her I 
                    sent you.
                          (then, looking around)
                    So, is your husband in one of these 
                    boxes?

                                  SARAH
                          (smiles)
                    He left early for work, you know, 
                    first day.                                                                                    14.


                                  CLAIRE
                    Well, I do hope there s enough to 
                    keep him busy.  Didn t I read he 
                    was a Sergeant in Chicago?

                                  SARAH
                    Yes, Sergeant-Detective, homicide.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Homicide.  Really.

                                  SARAH
                    I know it s gonna be an adjustment, 
                    but I m hoping this place will slow 
                    him down a bit.  He has a tendency 
                    to get pretty caught up in it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I imagine all good detectives have 
                    at least some of that.

                                  SARAH
                    Well unfortunately, he s got a lot.

      And off Claire forcing a smile --

      INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

      As a TEACHER leads a discussion of Flannery O Connor, we find 
      Charlie a few rows back.  He tries to pay attention, but 
      finds himself focusing on Andie (vending machine girl.)

                                    TEACHER
                    -- but did anyone notice a unifying 
                    theme to these stories?

      BRETT CREZSKI raises a hand.  Well liked, blond haired, blue 
      eyed, and in case he wasn t All-American enough... add star 
      linebacker for the football team.

                                  BRETT
                    Well, for one thing, the hero 
                    character is usually handicapped, 
                    or disfigured in some way.

                                  ANDIE
                    I think what O Connor is saying is 
                    that what we see on the surface is 
                    not who we are.

                                  BRETT
                    Exactly.  It s what s beneath the 
                      deformity.  The rest doesn t 
                    matter.                                                                                    15.


                                    CHARLIE
                    I...think there might be more to 
                    it.

                                  BRETT
                    Excuse me? 

                                    CHARLIE
                    You guys have talked about how 
                    O Connor had Lupus, right?

                                  ANDIE
                    I don t know that I d call Lupus a 
                      deformity.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Maybe not, but it is Latin for 
                     wolf  because as it attacked 
                    healthy cells, the skin and muscles 
                    in the face would thin, making the 
                    victims look more like... an 
                    animal.  So while some readers 
                    might think she was trying to say 
                      appearance doesn t matter, the fact 
                    that it was consistent throughout 
                    her work might indicate that at 
                    least to her, it mattered very 
                    much.

      Andie, intrigued now, acknowledges his point with a nod.  
      Touche.  Brett, on the other hand, seems far less impressed.

      INT. HALLWAY - LATER

      Charlie is at his locker when he sees Brett and Andie walking 
      his way holding hands. He shakes his head; of course she s 
      taken.

      Then, as they pass, Brett is suddenly BUMPED HARD by LUKAS 
      FORD, a surfer dude with a who-gives-a-fuck attitude that 
      often leads to trouble.

                                  LUKAS
                    My bad, Romeo.

      Instinctively, Brett takes a step in his direction.  Lukas 
      takes note as Andie reaches out, grabs Brett s hand.

                                  LUKAS (CONT D)
                    How sweet.  Juliet to the rescue. 
                          (at Brett, with a smile)
                    You remember how that story ends?

      Brett stares.  Will he take the bait?  Then --                                                                                    16.


                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Creski!

      Not this time.  Looking down the hall, Brett sees the 
      FOOTBALL COACH surrounded by more PLAYERS.

                                  COACH
                    Scouting report.  Hustle up.

      And after one last look at Lukas, Brett heads off.

      INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LATER

      Charlie is sitting alone in the crowded cafeteria when Andie 
      approaches, takes a seat opposite, studies him for a beat. 

                                  ANDIE
                    So you re a pretty smart guy.

      Charlie searches the room for the linebacker boyfriend.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sorry, I was just trying to make a 
                    point.

                                  ANDIE
                    It s okay.  Is that something you 
                    enjoy?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Enjoy?

                                  ANDIE
                    Take delight or pleasure in.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I know what enjoy means.

                                  ANDIE
                    So you can answer the question.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m not really sure what the 
                    question is.

                                  ANDIE
                    Do you enjoy argument?  Making your 
                    point?  

                                    CHARLIE
                      Apparently, not as much as you.                                                                                    17.


                                  ANDIE
                    You evade well.  You d be good on 
                    cross exam.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Am I on trial?

                                  ANDIE
                    You could be.  Mock Trial.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You mean, like debate?

                                  ANDIE
                    No, I mean like Mock Trial.  You 
                    should join.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Why?

                                  ANDIE
                    Because you re new, you don t know 
                    anybody and... you could help us 
                    get to State.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Do you even want to know my --

                                  ANDIE
                    -- Charlie, from Chicago.  I m 
                    Andie, from Seattle.  Exiled to The 
                    Gates last year.

      Charlie stares, trying hard not to be intrigued.  But then --

                                    CHARLIE
                     Exiled?  

                                  ANDIE
                    Yeah... after my mom died, dad 
                    somehow thought it d be best if I 
                    were raised in captivity. 

      His interest piqued, Charlie would love this conversation to 
      continue but Andie sees Brett enter.  She stands.

                                  ANDIE (CONT'D)
                    So one more thing.  All members 
                    need to help with the booth.
                          (off his look)
                    For the fair, Friday night.  We ll 
                    be by the football field after 
                    school.  See ya.                                                                                    18.


      Charlie watches as Andie peels away, intercepts Brett.

                                  BRETT
                    What was that about?

                                  ANDIE
                    Mock trial.  I want him to join.

                                  BRETT
                    Uh-huh.  You know he s into you, 
                    right?

                                  ANDIE
                    What?  Shut up.

                                  BRETT
                    I know the look.  I had it six 
                    months ago.

                                  ANDIE
                    And you still do.

      Andie smiles, gives him a quick kiss and walks off.  And 
      after one last glance at Charlie, Brett follows.

      INT. PRECINCT - DAY

      Amidst the dozen or so COPS now filling the precinct, we find 
      Marcus on the phone, diligently taking notes.

                                  MARCUS
                    And when was it filed? Okay, let me 
                    talk to my Chief, check it out on 
                    our end, and we ll get back to you.

      Hanging up, Marcus sees Nick enter the bullpen.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Chief, I just got off with Santa 
                    Barbara police.  A missing persons 
                    report has been filed for the 
                    driver of that Range Rover, Mark 
                    Woodbury.

                                  NICK
                    Really?  Alright, let s go talk to 
                    the Radcliffs.

      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - DAY

      An immaculate, late model Mercedes pulls into the driveway.                                                                                    19.


      INT. MERCEDES 

      DYLAN RADCLIFF, handsome, even keeled, presses a button on 
      his visor, waits for the garage door to open... but it 
      doesn t.  That s odd.  Parking the car where it is, he climbs 
      out, grabs his suitcase from the back.

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - WINE CELLAR - SAME

      PANNING ACROSS row after row of VINTAGE WINE, we arrive on 
      Claire, popping the cork on a BOTTLE of MOUTON ROTHSCHILD, 
      then pouring it down the drain of a small sink. 

      Much more valuable to her is the BLOOD she then pours from a 
      GLASS CARAFE.  She s about to start filling the bottle when 
      she HEARS the front door CLOSE.  That is enough to startle 
      her, but panic sets in when she HEARS -- 

                                  DYLAN (O.S.)
                    Claire?

      INT. KITCHEN - SAME

      He picks up a stack of mail, is sorting through it when 
      suddenly, Claire leaps onto his back, plants her lips on his 
      neck, but leaves it at that... a kiss.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What are you doing home so early?

                                  DYLAN
                    Because the one part of being a CEO 
                    that I have not mastered is... 
                    golf.  And, I missed you... way too 
                    much.

      As he goes to kiss her, Claire turns her cheek, goes straight 
      for the hug, holds him tight.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I missed you too.  I hate being 
                    here without you, Dylan.

                                  DYLAN
                    It s okay.  I m back.

      Claire crosses to the counter, pours a glass of WHITE WINE. 
      She takes a sip, hands him the glass.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    Hey, did something happen to the 
                    garage door?  It won t open.                                                                                    20.


                                  CLAIRE
                    It won t?

                                  DYLAN
                    Maybe it s my remote.

      Connoisseur that he is, Dylan holds the wine to his nose, 
      inhales deeply... then eyes the glass, curious.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What s wrong?  It tasted fine.

      Dylan looks around the kitchen, searching for the scent... 
      lands on Claire.  She forces a smile, tries to remain calm.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Here, let me grab another bottle.

      But before she even takes a step, Dylan grabs Claire by the 
      neck, and in one quick, violent motion, slams her to the 
      wall.  Moving his face to within inches of hers, he parts her 
      lips with his finger, pries open her jaw, and inhales deeply.

                                  DYLAN
                    Where is it?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Dylan, I don t know what --

                                  DYLAN
                    -- WHERE IS IT?

                                  CLAIRE
                    In the basement.

      If looks could kill, Dylan s would come close, but not 
      before... DING DONG!   They both turn toward the door.

      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - SAME

      Nick is standing with Marcus when Dylan s voice is heard.

                                  DYLAN (O.S.)
                    May I help you?

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, it s Chief Monohan. I m here 
                    about the accident.

      And off Nick and Marcus, no idea what awaits them, we --


                                      END ACT ONE                                                                                    21.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Sitting opposite Claire and Dylan, Nick questions while 
      Marcus takes notes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- even though I didn t think it 
                    required stitches, I said he should 
                      definitely stop by the hospital.  

                                  NICK
                    Which hospital did you suggest?

                                  CLAIRE
                    County General, but he said he had 
                    to get back for a meeting.

                                  NICK
                    Did he happen to mention who he was 
                    meeting with?  What it was about?

                                  CLAIRE
                    No, I m afraid not.

                                  NICK
                    Did he say what he does for a 
                    living?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Well, he might have, I just...

                                  DYLAN
                    You know, I hate to even suggest 
                    the possibility, but if the guy had 
                      a concussion, he could have passed 
                    out, or something.

                                  NICK
                          (beat, studies Dylan)
                    Yeah, I guess that s possible.  Are 
                    you doctor?

                                  DYLAN
                    No.  But I ve got plenty working 
                    for me, I run a bio-tech company.

                                  NICK
                    Well, ninety-nine times out of a 
                    hundred, these missing persons turn 
                    up just fine, so...
                          (stands)
                    Thank you both for your time.                                                                                    22.


      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

      As Nick and Marcus approach the car --

                                  MARCUS
                    I ll type up a witness report, and 
                    find out what the guy does for a 
                    living.

      Nick, preoccupied, doesn t respond.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Sir?

                                  NICK
                    Did you notice what the husband 
                    did?

                                  MARCUS
                          (fishing for the answer)
                    Ummmm...

                                  NICK
                    He presented a scenario for the 
                    guy s disappearance.  

                                  MARCUS
                    Maybe he was trying to be helpful.

                                  NICK
                    Or maybe he didn t like where we 
                    were headed.

                                  MARCUS
                    So you think we re onto something?

      Arriving at the car, Nick looks back at the house and nods.

                                  NICK
                    Yeah.  Something.

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

      Standing by the edge of the window, Dylan watches the car 
      pull away, then, with a disapproving look at his wife, we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      A BODY SPILLING ON TO THE --                                                                                    23.


      BASEMENT 

      -- floor.  Dylan pulls it away from the fridge, shuts the 
      door.  He stares at the body, disappointed, then turns to 
      Claire.

                                  DYLAN
                    We had an agreement.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Dylan, I know...

                                  DYLAN
                    Then you know what would happen to 
                    Emily if we have to leave The 
                    Gates.  Adopted little girls don t 
                    survive out there, not among our 
                    kind.

                                  CLAIRE 
                          (ashamed)
                    I m sorry.

      EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

      A few BAGS in hand, Sarah is walking when she sees --

      THE ART OF TEA

      She stops, thinks.  Should I? 

      INT. ART OF TEA - MOMENTS LATER

      Quaint and simple, Sarah enters to find several PATRONS, all 
      women, in line at the register.  She browses, peering into 
      baskets, dozens of them, filled TEA LEAVES.  One batch, with 
      its deep shade of YELLOW, catches her attention.

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                      Wolfsbane...

      A bit startled, Claire turns to find a strikingly beautiful 
      WOMAN standing beside her.

                                  WOMAN (CONT D)
                    -- highly toxic to some.  Harmless 
                    to others.  I usually get it right.
                          (off Sarah s smile)
                    How can I help you?

                                  SARAH
                    Um, Claire Radcliff suggested I 
                    come by and see you.                                                                                    24.


                                  WOMAN
                    Did she?  For anything in 
                      particular?

                                  SARAH
                    Well, I just moved here, my life is 
                    kind of upside down, and I m 
                    feeling a little...

                                  WOMAN
                    Worried?

      Sarah pauses.   Worried?   Not the word she would have used, 
      but now that she thinks about it...

                                  SARAH
                    Yes.

                                  WOMAN
                    Well, I ve got just the thing...

      The woman leads her over to a wall of SMALL DRAWERS.

                                  WOMAN (CONT D)
                    But I need to start with some 
                      questions, the most personal 
                    being... your name.

                                  SARAH
                    Oh, sorry.  I m Sarah.  And you 
                    must be Peg.

                                  WOMAN
                    Actually, I m Devon.  Peg has the 
                    shop across the street.

                                  SARAH
                    Ohh...

                                  DEVON
                    Don t worry about it.  Tea is tea.

      After one guilty glance over at the other tea shop, Sarah 
      steps closer.

      EXT. SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

      PANNING UP from an inter-squad scrimmage, we find Charlie and 
      Dana watching as they pass by on their way home.

                                  DANA
                    You know, this move would be a lot 
                    easier on both of us if you were a 
                    football star.                                                                                    25.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Doesn t seem so hard on you.

                                  DANA
                    Are you really that slow?  I m 
                    masking my true feelings with 
                      enthusiasm so dad doesn t feel so 
                    bad.
                          (beat)
                    You should try it.

      UP AHEAD -- Andie and her fellow MOCK TRIAL MEMBERS are 
      painting the walls of their  booth  when she spots Charlie. 

                                  ANDIE
                    You re late!

      Dana looks at Charlie.  Late for what?

                                    CHARLIE
                    How can I be late when I haven t 
                    joined?

                                  ANDIE
                    Answering a question with a 
                    question.  You re a natural.

      Dana notes the brightening of Charlie s mood as he talks with 
      Andie.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (takes in the  booth )
                    I don t mean to rain on your 
                    parade, but it kinda looks like an 
                      interrogation room.  

                                  ANDIE
                    Yeah, that s kinda the point.

      Andie points to a sign: LIE DETECTOR  $5.00/question.

                                  DANA
                    You have an actual lie detector?

                                  ANDIE
                    Not yet, but Feldman s making one.

      She looks over at FELDMAN, a geeked-out team member.  He 
      waves, absurdly proud.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So... people are gonna pay money to 
                    be caught in a lie?                                                                                    26.


                                  ANDIE
                    No, they re going to pay money to 
                    catch someone else in a lie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And if this someone doesn t want to 
                    be caught?

                                  ANDIE
                    Then...
                          (realizing he s right)
                    We won t have any customers.  Oh my 
                    god...

      Andie pulls Charlie aside; conspiratorially:

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    Do me a favor.  Please don t say 
                    anything.  It was Feldman s idea, 
                    and he s really excited about it.  
                    Promise?

      Andie still holds Charlie s hand; right now he d promise her 
      anything.

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - SAME

      Coming out of a huddle, Brett lines up in the middle-
      linebacker position.  Quarterback, RILEY, takes position, 
      eyes Brett.

                                  RILEY
                    Yo, Brett.  Your girl hookin  up 
                    with the new guy?

      Riley motions over Brett s shoulder.  Brett turns, sees Andie 
      standing close to Charlie, talking, laughing... 

                                  BRETT
                          (shrugging it off)
                    She wants him for Mock Trial.

                                  RILEY
                    She wants him for something...

      Riley gives Brett and mocking wink -- and that does it.  With 
      the hike, Brett charges through the line, his breath growing 
      more coarse and guttural with each step.  

      Riley fakes the hand-off, drops back when out of nowhere, 
      Brett SLAMS INTO HIM with an animalistic growl, knocking him 
      several yards through the air.                                                                                     27.


      HEARING the HIT, Charlie and Andie turn and watch as COACHES 
      and PLAYERS run to Riley s side.  

      BACK ON BRETT  -- who turns away, trying to gather himself as 
      COACH approaches from behind.  

                                  COACH
                    Creski!

      When Brett fails to turn, Coach grabs him by the helmet, 
      spins him around to reveal his RIGHT EYE now has the PIERCING 
      YELLOWISH COLOR of a WOLF.

                                  BRETT
                    Coach, I m sorry, I --

      Coach stares in shock.  Then, much to our surprise, pulls him 
      closer, whispers sternly --

                                  COACH
                    You lost a contact.

      Brett quickly lowers his head, self-conscious.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    In my office.  Now.

      Coach pushes him off the field, and as he backs away, Brett 
      throws a sideways glance back toward Andie and Charlie.

      ON ANDIE and CHARLIE -- stunned and confused...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Is your boyfriend always that...?

                                  ANDIE
                    No...  Never.

      A CAR HORN sounds -- She turns to see her dad VINCENT, (40), 
      handsome, but certainly not the  exotic  half of Andie. 

                                    VINCENT
                    Come on, Andie, we re late.

                                  ANDIE
                    Gotta go.

      And as Andie heads off to the car --

      EXT. THE ART OF TEA - LATER

      Fast friends, Devon leads a grateful Sarah out the door.                                                                                    28.


                                  DEVON
                    Now remember, two cups a day, no 
                    more, no less.

                                  SARAH
                    Are you sure I can t give you 
                    something for this?

                                  DEVON
                    Wouldn t hear of it. First batch is 
                    always free.

      UNKNOWN POV: From across the street, watching the two 
      women... REVERSE TO:

      EXT. TEA POT - DAY

      PEG MUELLER, attractive, but harder around the edges, watches 
      Devon and Sarah as she adds flowers to her empty outdoor 
      tables.  And something in the way her dark eyes narrow makes 
      us feel thankful Sarah wandered into the other shop... 

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Brett is walking home alone when Lukas, the badass who bumped 
      him in the hallway, rides up alongside on a BMX BIKE.  

                                  LUKAS
                    Heard about what happened at 
                    practice.
                          (enjoying himself)
                    Not like you Creski, to violate the 
                     code. 

      Brett glances over at him.

                                  BRETT
                    You re one to talk.

                                  LUKAS
                    Look, I may not be a model citizen, 
                    but I ve never revealed what I am 
                    inside The Gates.  I know if do, 
                    I m dead.

                                  BRETT
                    I know how it works.

                                  LUKAS
                    Really?  Cause if you knew how it 
                    worked, you wouldn t be with Andie.

      Brett stops, gets in Lukas  face.                                                                                    29.


                                  BRETT
                    Look, you wanna go, we ll go...

                                  LUKAS
                          (doesn t even flinch)
                    Easy, we re just trying to help.

      We re?  Brett looks around to see MORE BMX RIDERS seemingly 
      appearing out of nowhere at either end of the street.

                                  LUKAS (CONT D)
                    Anyone other than Coach turns you 
                    around today, you wouldn t be 
                    standing here right now. 

      Knowing Lukas is right, Brett remains silent.

                                  LUKAS (CONT D)
                    You need to come run with us. 

                                  BRETT
                    I m not doing anything with you.  
                    And last time I checked, running 
                    was a violation of the code.

                                  LUKAS
                    Inside the Gates, yeah.  But 
                      outside... all bets are off.

      Off Brett, no denying a part of him is tempted by the offer --

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

      Nick, Sarah and the kids surround the table, eating.  

                                  DANA
                    -- but most of them walk around 
                    like, been there, done that.  But 
                    the smart clique, they all hang 
                    together.  And they thought it was 
                    cool dad s the new police chief, so 
                    I think I m gonna hang with them. 

                                  NICK
                    Sounds good.  How about you, 
                    Charlie?

                                  DANA
                    He met a girl.

                                  SARAH
                    Oh really?                                                                                    30.


                                    CHARLIE
                    It s nothing.  It s about some 
                    club.  And she has a boyfriend.

      Nick and Sarah share a glance.  Then, only when she takes a 
      sip, do we notice that Sarah is drinking something different 
      than the rest.

                                  NICK
                    What are you drinking?

                                  SARAH
                    It s tea.  A gift from Devon.  She  
                    has a shop on Main Street.

                                  NICK
                      A  gift ... for the wife of the 
                    police chief.

                                  SARAH
                    Yes, sometimes people just give 
                    gifts, and expect nothing in 
                    return.  Like the lasagna, which I 
                    haven t heard you complain about, 
                    was a gift from our neighbor 
                    Claire.

                                  NICK
                    Claire Radcliff?

                                  SARAH
                    How did you know?

                                  NICK
                      I interviewed her today about a 
                    missing person.

                                  SARAH
                    Are you suggesting she s a suspect 
                    in a crime?

                                  NICK
                    She s a person of interest.  Let s 
                    leave it at that.

      On Sarah s face, we register the first flicker of concern 
      that Nick is headed down an all too familiar road. 

                                    CHARLIE
                          (sees it too)
                    You know what?  I think I m done.

      Charlie gets up, leaves the table.  Sarah throws one last 
      look at Nick, then turns her attention back to her plate.                                                                                    31.

      A police cruiser rolls slowly past...

      INT. POLICE CAR

      Marcus at the wheel, scanning each and every driveway.  Leigh 
      rides shotgun, bored out of her mind.

                                  LEIGH
                    How much longer do we have to do 
                    this?

                                  MARCUS
                    Until we find the car.

                                  LEIGH
                    But we re not gonna find the car.  
                    You know why?  Because the car s 
                    not here.  And I can pretty much 
                    guarantee what ever you  think  
                    happened in the Radcliff interview, 
                    didn t actually happen.

                                  MARCUS
                    Well I trust the chief s instincts 
                    over yours.

                                  LEIGH
                    Oh yeah?  You know he killed a guy.

                                  MARCUS
                    I know the department ruled the 
                    shooting justified.

                                  LEIGH
                    How do you  justify  shooting an 
                    unarmed man?

                                  MARCUS
                    We don t know the circumstances.

                                  LEIGH
                    My friend in Cook County DA s 
                    office does.  Chief s off duty, way 
                    out of his precinct, in the middle 
                    of the night.  Claims he saw a gun 
                    on a guy, and shoots, close range. 
                      Department rules it justified, yet 
                    he still resigns.  So what do you 
                    think?  Maybe his  instincts  took 
                    the night off?                                                                                    32.


                                  MARCUS
                    I think maybe we don t know the 
                    whole story.

      As the police car passes by, CAMERA holds on --

      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - NIGHT

      -- the downstairs lights still on.

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - KITCHEN

      With Claire waiting, Dylan lifts a freshly BAKED COOKIE from 
      the pan, holds it to his nose, inhales.

                                  DYLAN
                    I don t smell anything.  You sure 
                    it s enough?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I guess it depends on how many he 
                    eats.

      Even more unsettled, Dylan walks out. Claire watches him go, 
      then begins placing the cookies into a TIN, one by one.

      INT. BASEMENT - LATER

      In an extraordinary display of strength, Dylan drags the body 
      across the floor, and up the stairs like an empty suitcase.

      EXT. FRONT GATE - NIGHT

      Stopping at the guard house on the way out, Claire hands 
      EDDIE the COOKIE TIN.

                                  CLAIRE
                    A little treat for my favorite 
                    guard.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re kidding.  What s the 
                    occasion?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just trying a new recipe.

      INT. RADCLIFF GARAGE - NIGHT

      Removing Woodbury s shirt, Dylan puts it on, then tosses the 
      body into the back of the Range Rover.  From the back, he 
      grabs a baseball cap, puts it on, and closes the gate.                                                                                    33.


      EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

      Deep in a canyon, we peer up the slope of the mountain, stars 
      in the distance.  Suddenly, the night silence is shattered by 
      the SCREAMING ENGINE of the Range Rover as it sails off the 
      edge of the mountain, and into the night sky.  Catching the 
      nose as it lands, the truck tumbles end over end toward 
      CAMERA, finally coming to rest against a stack of boulders.

      Then, looking back up the hill, we see Dylan standing at the 
      cliff s edge.

      EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

      Dylan makes his way down the slope, arrives at the crash site 
      to find the drivers door open, and Woodbury s battered body 
      hanging halfway out.  After taking a moment to study the 
      scene, he kneels down beside the body, sets the LEFT OVER 
      BLOOD on the ground, and then, taking a deep breath, turns 
      away, gathering courage for the unthinkable. Turning back, 
      his fangs are revealed.  And then, with startling ferocity, 
      he tears into the body, ripping flesh from bone. 

      EXT./ INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

      Claire pulls over on the side a mountain road, searches the 
      surrounding woods.  Then, in the headlights, we see Dylan 
      emerge from the canyon.  

      Claire climbs out as he approaches, and even she is shocked 
      by the sight of her husband, bloodied and dirty. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    What happened?

                                  DYLAN
                    It has to look like coyotes.

      He passes her without another word, opens the trunk, and 
      climbs in.  Claire goes to the back, and is about to shut him 
      in when they lock eyes.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    I hope it was worth it.

      And as the trunk closes, enveloping us in darkness, we --

      Sitting in a chair before the monitor, Eddie turns to Nick, 
      with Marcus and Leigh looking on. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I don t know what happened.  Maybe 
                    I ate too much?

                                  NICK
                    That s it?  Police all over the 
                    state are looking for this guy, and 
                    you just let him drive right out?

      Frustrated, Nick stands and is headed for the door when --

                                  EDDIE
                    In my defense, sir, I doubt anyone 
                    could have one of Mrs. Radcliff s 
                    cookies without having ten.

                          (stops)
                    Mrs. Radcliff gave you cookies.

      As Eddie explains, Marcus rewinds the tape.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah, she does that every now and 
                    then, you know, for holidays and 
                    stuff.  Last Christmas, she made 
                    these incredible... 

                                  MARCUS
                    Here she is, sir.

      They all gather around to see VIDEO of Claire handing over 
      the cookies, and then, after hesitating just a moment, pull 
      away.  Nick leans in for a closer look.                                                                                    35.

                    Wait, rewind to just before she 
                    pulls away.
                          (Marcus does)
                    Now slow it down.

      In SLOW MOTION, they ZOOM IN on Claire from the front angle. 
      Leaning forward, she glances up, directly into the lens.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Stop.

      Nick leads Marcus and Leigh.  If he suspected something was

      Claire, Dylan and Emily surround the table, sharing a meal of 
      poached eggs, toast, and freshly squeezed juice.  Minus the 
      nearly unbearable tension, it s a dream American family.   

      After an insufferable silence, Claire finally speaks up.

                    The Bianchi s called again about

                    with Middlesex.                                                                                    36.


      Dylan looks up from his newspaper, studies Claire.

                    I think it s a good way for me 
                    to... keep busy.

                    That s a great idea, Claire.  I ll 
                    pick up a copy after work.

      And just like that, it s like the past two days never 
      happened.

      Andie, oblivious to his discomfort --

                    It works best if the operator and 
                    the subject are not familiar with

                                    CHARLIE
                    And why s that?

                                  ANDIE
                    Because the effect that lying has 
                    on the body -- the increase in 
                    heart rate and blood pressure -- is 
                    similar to other types of emotional 
                    response.

      Charlie forces a smile.  Great.

                                  ANDIE (CONT'D)
                    So here we go: is your name Charlie 
                    Monohan?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yes.

                                  ANDIE
                    Okay, Charlie.  Do you like prunes?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yes.

                                  ANDIE
                    You were...supposed to answer  no. 
                          (off his look)
                    So I can see the difference between 
                    a  yes  and a  no. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    But I like prunes.

                                  ANDIE
                    In my entire life, I ve never met 
                    anyone who likes prunes. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Oh.  Okay...
                          (beat)
                    I hate prunes.

      The machine CHIMES.  ANDIE looks to see several BAR GRAPHS 
      have reached into the red.

                                  ANDIE
                          (a little surprised)
                    It really works.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Great.  So we re done?                                                                                    38.


                                  ANDIE
                    No, we re not done.  And what are 
                    you so nervous about?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m not nervous.

      The lie detector CHIMES.

                                  ANDIE
                    The machine disagrees.  And your 
                    heart rate s up.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (really squirming now)
                    Yeah, because... I m late for 
                    class.  I gotta go.

      Again -- CHIME.  Andie looks at him -- what s going on here?

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    This is ridiculous.  Your machine s 
                    all over the place.  Like you said, 
                    it picks up on all sorts of other 
                    stuff.

                                  ANDIE
                            (correcting)
                    Other emotions.

      They just stare at each other for a long beat.

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    Am I making you nervous?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No.

      The lie detector CHIMES.  Andie turns to Charlie who looks 
      away, embarrassed.  And suddenly, Andie understands.  He 
      likes her.

                                  ANDIE
                          (awkwardly)
                    You know what, you re right...
                          (disconnecting the 
                            machine)
                    This machine is all over the place 
                    and no one is going to come to the 
                    booth anyway, so... thank you.

      Flustered, Andie gathers up the computer and heads for the 
      door.  And off Charlie, head swimming...                                                                                    39.


      INT. HALLWAY - SAME

      Brett is standing with some FOOTBALL BUDDIES when he sees 
      Andie exit the room, visibly rattled.

                                  BRETT
                    Hey -- you okay?

                                  ANDIE
                          (not meeting his eyes)
                    Yeah, I m just... late.  I ll see 
                    you after school.  Okay?

      He watches her walk quickly down the hall, not sure what that 
      was about until he sees CHARLIE exit the same room, make 
      brief eye contact, then move off in the opposite direction.

      INT. ART OF TEA - DAY

      In a line of WOMEN leading to the counter, we find Sarah.  As 
      the woman in front moves aside, Sarah steps forward.

                                  DEVON
                    You re back.

                                  SARAH
                    Yeah, I ran out of the tea.

                                  DEVON
                    Already?  I gave you a week s 
                    supply.

                                  SARAH
                    I know.

                                  DEVON
                          (concerned)
                    Do you maybe have time for lunch?

      EXT. CAFE - LATER

      Lunch, as it turns out, is a bottle of WINE.

                                  DEVON
                    ...so he comes in again, but very 
                    sad this time, and says the tea is 
                    finally working.  I said,  Does 
                    that mean you re sleeping together 
                    again?   And he says,  No, she s 
                    sleeping with Jack, the pool man.  
                    Can I have my money back? 
                          (Sarah laughs)
                    My point is that tea can do a lot 
                    of things, but not everything.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  DEVON (CONT'D)
                    So while I m happy to give you 
                    more, I can t help but wonder if 
                    there s something else going on.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, no, not really...

                                  DEVON
                          (leans in slightly)
                    Why don t you tell me what happened 
                    in Chicago.

                                  SARAH
                    Chicago?  How did you...?

                                  DEVON
                    I m sorry.  I just assumed there 
                    was a reason behind your move.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, yeah, I mean, it was a really 
                    tough year...

      Devon waits for more.  And Sarah suddenly finds herself 
      obliging.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Nick was involved in an... 
                    incident.  A shooting.  There were 
                    a lot of unanswered questions... 
                    and he came this close to being 
                      prosecuted.  It got really bad for 
                    us, for the kids... bad to the 
                    point where I was...
                          (confesses)
                    I was scared Nick and I weren t 
                    gonna make it.

      Sarah looks up, stunned that she has revealed so much.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  I don t know why... 
                    I ve never told that to anyone.

                                  DEVON
                    Well you can tell me anything.
                          (beat)
                    You need someone to trust.

      Devon reaches across the table and places a comforting hand 
      over Sarah s.  Sarah smiles, grateful.                                                                                    41.


      INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

      Andie at her locker.  Shutting the door, she is startled to 
      find Brett, waiting.

                                  BRETT
                    So... did something happen with the 
                    new guy?

                                  ANDIE
                    What?  No.  We were testing the lie 
                    detector.

                                  BRETT
                          (concerned)
                    You were really upset.  Did he say 
                    something to you?

      She looks in his eyes, and for the first time in their 
      relationship, lies.

                                  ANDIE
                    No.

      Brett studies her.  ECU of her eyes, PUPILS DILATING ever so 
      slightly.  SOUND MAGNIFIES as he HEARS her BREATH QUICKEN...

                                  BRETT
                    You re lying to me.

                                  ANDIE
                    Brett...

      WHAM!  Brett SLAMS his fist against her locker door.  
      Stunned, Andie turns from the now dented locker door back to 
      Brett.  What the fuck?  

      Surprised as well and feeling himself start to LOSE CONTROL, 
      Brett backs away, runs down the hall.

      INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Bursting in, Brett grabs hold of the sink, checks his face in 
      the mirror.  Nothing.  Then, he looks down only to discover 
      that his fingers have PIERCED the PORCELAIN.  Oh shit...  

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Charlie is walking down the empty hall when he HEARS 
      something BREAK in the bathroom.  Concerned, he approaches.                                                                                    42.


      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Charlie enters to find the lights out.  He flips the switch.  
      Nothing.  Stepping forward, GLASS CRUNCHES beneath his feet.  
      He looks up to find the overhead light broken.   

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hello?

      Venturing around the corner, he finds one of the sinks 
      partially SHATTERED, dangling from the wall.  After a moment, 
      a low, barely perceptible growl from within one of the 
      stalls.  Charlie steps closer...  

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Hey.  You okay in there?

      Silence.  Charlie glances over at the damaged sink, spots 
      something. Hair?  Fur?  He moves toward it, is almost there, 
      when suddenly, a stall door SLAMS open behind him.  Startled, 
      Charlie spins to find himself FACE TO FACE with BRETT, a bit 
      disheveled, but otherwise looking... human. 

                                  BRETT
                    Hey.  What s up?

      Brett pushes past him, turns the water on and washes away any 
      remaining clue to his identity. Charlie eyes him, wary.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I thought I heard something...

                                  BRETT
                    Was like this when I came in.

      Charlie nods, turns to go when --

                                  BRETT (CONT'D)
                    So how do you like this place?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m... figuring it out.

                                  BRETT
                    Good.  
                          (then, pointed)
                    So you must ve figured out that 
                    Andie and I are together.

      Feeling the threat behind the words, Charlie lets Brett pass 
      without responding.  And as the door shuts behind him --


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                    43.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY

      Nick approaches Leigh:

                                  NICK
                    So where do we stand on that 
                    warrant?

                                  LEIGH
                    DA s got it before Judge Hendricks.

                                  NICK
                    Good.  Stay on it.

      Just then the front door opens.  Nick looks up to find FRANK 
      BUCKLEY, (50), entering with that  casual-but-loaded  look of 
      an obscenely successful real estate developer.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Mr. Buckley.  How can I help you?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Just dropping by.  I meant to be 
                    here yesterday to meet your family, 
                    but I got stuck on our expansion 
                    outside Seattle.

                                  NICK
                    Not a problem.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    How s the house?  Did they finish 
                      landscaping out by the pool?

                                  NICK
                    Just about.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Good, good... 
                          (then, off-hand)
                    So I hear our  missing person  
                    drove off last night.

                                  NICK
                    Possibly.  We couldn t identify who 
                    was driving the car.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Then maybe we need more cameras out 
                    by the gate.  I mean, we can t go 
                    searching people s houses every 
                    time we screw up, right?                                                                                    44.


                                  NICK
                          (catching on)
                    It s actually the D.A. who decides 
                    whether or not we can search a 
                    house. 

      For a moment, the two men face off.  Then --

                                    BUCKLEY
                    You know, Nick, when I built The 
                    Gates it attracted all sorts of 
                    people, but the one thing they had 
                    in common is that, for one reason 
                    or another, they didn t feel safe.  
                    They were willing to pay a premium 
                    for a place they could come home to 
                    at night, and feel protected from 
                    the dangers of the outside world.

                                  NICK
                      I understand.  But what if the 
                    problem is on the inside?

                                    BUCKLEY
                          (stares a beat, then)
                    Look, we both know you don t answer 
                    to me.  You answer to the town 
                    council.  But I did explain to them 
                    that after what happened in 
                    Chicago, your approach here would 
                    be more cautious.  That s the 
                    police chief they re expecting.
                          (beat)
                    I hope I didn t misrepresent you.

      Nick holds his stare.  So that s how it s gonna be.

                                  NICK
                    Not at all, sir.

                                    BUCKLEY
                          (smiles)
                    I ll get those landscapers out to 
                    your house this afternoon.

      INT. THE ART OF TEA - DAY

      Devon is grinding leaves, her back to the door, when suddenly 
      she stands up straight, alert.  A half-beat later, THE DOOR 
      OPENS, bell clanging -- and in walks Peg.

                                  PEG
                          (glancing around)
                    Are you alone?                                                                                    45.


                                  DEVON
                    I was.

      Devon resumes grinding...

                                  PEG
                    You know why I m here.

                                  DEVON
                    Looking for customers?

                                  PEG
                          (ignoring the dig)
                    She s the police chief s wife.

      Devon stops grinding and casually leans against the counter.

                                  DEVON
                    And in one simple twist of fate, 
                    she walked through my door instead 
                    of yours.

                                  PEG
                    I m disappointed in you, Devon.  
                    We re supposed to help people with 
                    their problems, not exploit them.

                                  DEVON
                    My customers aren t complaining.

                                  PEG
                    Because they have no idea what your 
                    tea is doing to them.
                          (reigning it in)
                    Take my advice: leave Sarah Monohan 
                    alone.

                                  DEVON
                    I m not your pupil anymore, Peg.  
                    And your advice, quite frankly, is 
                    the last thing I would ever take. 

      Peg stares, incredulous.  But before she can respond, a 
      customer enters, and the conversation has come to an end.

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      A ringing PHONE answered by Nick, the rest of the family in 
      the background getting dinner ready. 

                                  NICK
                    This is Nick.

      INTERCUT WITH:                                                                                    46.


      INT. PRECINCT - NIGHT 

      Leigh, alone, staring at a FAX.

                                  LEIGH
                    Hey, Chief.  We just got the fax.  
                    Search warrant s been denied. 
                      Insufficient evidence.

      Nick is furious, but tries to keep it out of his voice.

                                  NICK
                    Okay, thanks.

      Nick hangs up to find Sarah staring:

                                  SARAH
                      Everything alright?

                                  NICK
                    Fine.  I ll set the table.

      Off Sarah, watching him go, knowing there s more...

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Sarah is asleep.  Staring into the darkness, Nick couldn t be 
      more awake.  Finally, he climbs quietly out of bed.

      INT. NICK S CAR - THE GATES - NIGHT

      Nick cruises along the immaculate streets.  It s empty, 
      eerie.  Approaching the Radcliff house, Nick pulls to a stop.  
      Stares.  Should I?  After a moment of deliberation, he opens 
      the door...

      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - NIGHT

      Nick approaches on foot, flashlight out.  He heads up the 
      driveway, then veers toward --

      THE GARAGE.  Tries the side door.  Locked.  Shines the light 
      through the glass but sees nothing out of the ordinary.  So 
      he continues on to...

      THE BACKYARD.  A gardening sheds looms to his left.  Nick 
      carefully opens the door and peers in with the flashlight --

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

      Claire SHOOTS UP in bed.  Aware that prey is near, she slips 
      out, careful not to wake her husband.                                                                                    47.


      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - SECONDS LATER

      With inhuman SPEED and AGILITY, Claire moves silently across 
      the room to the french doors.  She peers outside...

      CLAIRE S POV:  Nick crosses the patio, just a few feet away.

      Ducking back out of sight, heart pounding, Claire moves 
      through the house, tracking Nick until she reaches the SIDE 
      DOOR, and slips quietly outside --

      EXT. SIDE YARD - SAME

      Claire moves along the wall toward the back patio... and a 
      collision course with Nick.  She reaches the corner and 
      waits, ready to kill.

      In the BACKYARD, Nick moves across the patio along the wall, 
      oblivious to what awaits.  With each step, he moves closer to 
      the corner.  Three steps to go.  Two steps.  One...

      As Nick turns the corner... WHAM!  A hand grabs his shoulder 
      from behind.  Nick spins, gun raised and finds himself face-
      to-face with... DYLAN.  Time stops.  Then --

                                  NICK
                    That s a good way to get shot.

                                  DYLAN
                    I believe you re the one 
                      trespassing.

                                  NICK
                    We got a report of a prowler.

                                  DYLAN
                      A prowler?  In The Gates?

                                  NICK
                    Probably just some kids messing 
                    around.  But I had to check it out.

      Nick is about to go around the corner, but Dylan stops him:

                                  DYLAN
                    This way.  The side gate is locked.

      As the two men move away we TRACK BACK to reveal CLAIRE 
      around the corner.  Hungry, denied and deeply shaken. 


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                    48.


                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - LATER

      Claire on the sofa, legs pulled to her chest, sickened and 
      ashamed by her obvious loss of control.

      Dylan paces, looks at her for a long beat.  Then --

                                  DYLAN
                    You would ve killed him... the 
                    Chief of Police.

      He waits for Claire to deny it.  Or at least explain it.  But 
      she remains silent.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    We can t do this anymore.  I m 
                    packing you a bag.  You re leaving.

      Claire looks up.  Is he serious?  He is, and he s heading for 
      the stairs.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Wait.  I ll stop.  I know I can get 
                    better.

                                  DYLAN
                    Really?  Like the last time?  And 
                    the time before that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Dylan, please, you don t understand 
                    how hard this is for me.

                                  DYLAN
                    How is this hard?  I get us all the 
                    blood we need from the lab.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s not about the blood!  

      She gestures around at their house.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    It s about... the car pools, the 
                    school committees, the dinner 
                    parties, the book clubs...  No 
                    matter how I hard I try, I m never 
                    going to  assimilate  like you want 
                    me to, not with these people.                                                                                    49.


                                  DYLAN
                    I know you re struggling.  But we 
                    have to try.  Because that little 
                    girl upstairs is counting on you 
                    and me to be here when she wakes 
                    up.  To love her, to protect her, 
                    to be her family.
                          (beat)
                    And if you can t do that for her, 
                    then I will.

      Dylan starts to leave --

                                  CLAIRE
                    You always blame me.  You never 
                    take responsibility.  Never.

      Dylan stops, turns, finds Claire fighting tears.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    You did this to me.  You made me 
                    who I am.

      The truth of her words sink into Dylan like hooks.  As Claire 
      dissolves into tears, Dylan takes her in his arms.

      ON THE LANDING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, we find Emily hiding 
      in the shadows, listening, concern weighing on her face.

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Nick quietly enters in the dark, hoping not to wake Sarah.  
      Suddenly, the bedside lamp goes on.  She s been waiting.

                                  SARAH
                    Where were you?

                                  NICK
                    On patrol. 

                                  SARAH
                    At three in the morning?

      Nick doesn t say anything.  Then it dawns.  

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Please tell me this had nothing to 
                    do with Radcliff s.
                          (he doesn t deny it)
                    In the middle of the night. Off 
                    duty, with your weapon --

                                  NICK
                    Sarah --                                                                                    50.


                                  SARAH
                    Sound familiar, Nick?  We ve been 
                    here three days and it feels like 
                    it s starting all over.  

                                  NICK
                    That s not fair.  I would never put 
                    you through that again, put us 
                    through that.  But you can t expect 
                    me not to do my job.
                          (beat)
                    Sarah, every instinct I have tells 
                    me there s something going on with 
                    those people.

                                  SARAH
                          (pointed)
                    It was your instincts that almost 
                    cost us everything.
                          (beat)
                    I am trying so hard to move on, I 
                    really am.  I stood by you; through 
                    the shooting, the investigation, 
                    the police review...  I believed 
                    you, even when I didn t know the 
                    truth about what happened. 
                          (beat)
                    I want to trust you, Nick... but I 
                    can t.  Not until I know it won t 
                    happen again.  

      And with that, Sarah walks out, leaving Nick stung, 
      contemplating her words.

      EXT. GATES - MAIN STREET- NEXT DAY

      Rising sun casts a warm glow on a LARGE BANNER hanging 
      between two oak trees:  The Gates School, 10th Annual Autumn 
      Fair.   As MUSIC KICKS IN, we begin a SERIES OF SCENES --

      INT. PRECINCT - NEXT DAY

      Nick is at his desk, the Radcliff file open in front of him.  
      Across the -- 

      BULLPEN -- Marcus and Leigh sit at their desks, well aware of 
      the Chief s mood. Finally, they see Nick get up, grabs his 
      gun and coat, and head out the door.  

      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      As the TEACHER lectures, Charlie looks toward Andie, clearly 
      unsettled by the way things were left.  Finally, despite 
      knowing he shouldn t, he lifts his phone, begins TEXTING.                                                                                     51.


    A moment later, Andie s phone vibrates.  Holding it under her 
      desk, she reads  Can we talk? .  She turns to Charlie with a 
      look that says  I just can t , then closes her phone. 

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

      Brett sits on the sidelines, watching the team practice.   
      Looking toward the parking lot he sees Lukas and friends 
      riding the rails on their BMX bikes.  Off Brett, wavering 
      between the two worlds...

      INT. RADCLIFF HOUSE - DAY

      Returning from work, Dylan climbs the stairs.  Reaching the 
      top, he stops, looks into Emily s room.  

      REVERSE TO Claire kneeling behind Emily, braiding her hair, 
      relishing the simple, affectionate contact.  Feeling his 
      gaze, Emily and Claire turn.  They smile, a family again.  At 
      least for now...

      EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FAIR - DAY

      As booths, rides and food stands take shape, we find Devon 
      and Peg arranging their separate booths just a few yards 
      apart, ignoring each other completely.

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - DAY

      With her children swimming happily in the background, Sarah 
      stands amidst BOXES, uncertain if it s even worth unpacking.  

      INT. NICK S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

      Parked a few houses down from the Radcliff s, Nick watches 
      the house as Dylan, Claire and Emily emerge, looking for all 
      the world like a normal American family.

      As they head up the street, Nick turns his gaze to the now 
      empty house.  And off his look, we CUT TO --

      FIREWORKS bursting in the night sky high above The Gates.  
      PAN DOWN to -- 

      EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

      -- where the Fair is in full-swing, a good sized CROWD  
      milling around, enjoying the sights, sounds, and rides.

      Sarah, Charlie and Dana approaching when they spot Nick 
      waiting, just ahead.

                                  SARAH
                    I wasn t sure you d make it.                                                                                    52.


                                  NICK
                    Wouldn t miss it.

      Sarah eyes him, a bit skeptical, when Marcus hurries up.

                                  MARCUS
                    Chief?  You got a sec?

      Apologizing to Sarah with a look, Nick steps aside with 
      Marcus.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    I made some calls and I m pretty 
                    sure I can get us that search 
                    warrant.
                          (off Nick s look)
                    After cocktail hour, Judge 
                    Freeman s pen tends to loosen up.

      Nick looks over to find Sarah watching, waiting. 

                                  NICK
                    Thanks but... we re not gonna need 
                    it.

                                  MARCUS
                    We re not?

                                  NICK
                    No.

      Though full of questions, Marcus responds with a nod.  

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    But Marcus... good work.

      And as Nick returns to Sarah and the kids --

                                  SARAH
                      Everything okay?

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, it s fine.  We re closing the 
                    Radcliff case.
                          (beat)
                    Not enough evidence.

      Nick reaches out for her hand.  Though there is much she d 
      like say, right now it s enough to take his hand, and wrap 
      her fingers in his.  And as they pass --

      PEG S TEA BOOTH - NIGHT

      -- CAMERA finds Claire steping up to the counter.                                                                                    53.


                                  CLAIRE
                    Hi, Peg.

                                  PEG
                          (sensing her troubles)
                    Claire.  Is everything alright?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I need something to help with... 
                    cravings.

                                  WOMAN (V.O.)
                    They can be a real bitch, huh?

      Claire turns to find Devon, offering a knowing smile.  
      Unintimidated, Claire smiles back.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And so can you.

                                  PEG
                          (to Claire)
                    We can talk about this later.

                                  DEVON
                    I think it s a little more urgent, 
                    Peg.
                          (leans in to Claire)
                    Jessica Cooper saw you put that car 
                    in your garage.

      Too shocked to speak or even blink, Claire feigns calm.

                                  DEVON (CONT D)
                    Don t worry.  I helped her forget, 
                    but who knows how long that will 
                    last.

      Anger flares in Claire s eyes as she turns, primal, 
      terrifying.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I could end you, and you d never 
                    see it coming.

                                  DEVON
                          (doesn t even flinch)
                    But that wouldn t really solve your 
                    problem, now would it?

      Peg protectively reaches for Claire.                                                                                    54.


                                  PEG
                          (to Devon)
                    This conversation s over.

                                  DEVON
                          (to Claire)
                    Don t bother with Peg.  She can t 
                    help.  But I have exactly what you 
                    need.  So stop by... anytime.
                          (smiles at both)
                    Enjoy the Fair, ladies.

      And off Claire and Peg watching her go --

      EXT. FAIR - BOUNCE HOUSE - NIGHT

      Dylan is watching Emily play when Frank Buckley steps up 
      beside him.  They share a friendly nod and turn back to the 
      kids in the bounce house.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Sometimes I wish the whole world 
                    could be like that, a place where 
                    no one gets hurt.

                                  DYLAN
                    Isn t that why we re here.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    I hope so.

      EXT. FAIR - LIE DETECTOR BOOTH - NIGHT

      As Charlie predicted, not many takers, but Andie still tries.

                                  ANDIE
                    Lie Detector here.  Is she really 
                      satisfied?  Does he honestly like 
                    that outfit?  Find out the truth.  
                    Five dollars.

      Passers-by keep walking, apparently not interested in the 
      truth, until Charlie walks up.  Andie cools.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey, I was hoping we could talk, 
                    just for a second.

                                  ANDIE
                    I m kinda busy, so...

                                    CHARLIE
                    If you want, I ll pay.                                                                                    55.


      He puts five dollars on the table.  Feldman moves to take it, 
      but Andie snatches it up and says:

                                  ANDIE
                    Not here.

      EXT. FAIR - MOMENTS LATER

      Charlie and Andie settle away from the crowd.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Look, I didn t mean to freak you 
                    out yesterday.  It s just that...
                    I didn t want to leave Chicago, and 
                    I really didn t want to come here, 
                    but the one thing that s been cool 
                    about all this... is you. 
                          (beat)
                    Now I understand where you are, and 
                    Brett made it clear how he feels 
                    about you, and the last thing I 
                    want to do is get in the middle...

                                  ANDIE
                    But... you already have.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I know, but what I m trying to say 
                    is, I don t want whatever the lie 
                    detector may have picked up on to 
                    make you feel like you have to keep 
                    avoiding me, so --

                                  ANDIE
                    Charlie, stop.
                          (waits, then confesses)
                    I didn t freak out because of how 
                    you feel about me.  I freaked out 
                    because of how I might... feel 
                    about you.

      Off Charlie, stunned by her admission, WE RACK PAST HIM a 
      hundred feet away to find Brett LISTENING, his heart breaking 
      with every word.  Then -- 

                                    FELDMAN (O.S.)
                    Andie!  We have a customer!

      Andie and Charlie look at each other.  Now what?


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    56.


                                        ACT SIX

      EXT. FAIR - NIGHT

      Late, but the festival shows no signs of slowing down.  

      UNKNOWN POV as Charlie moves through the crowd, making his 
      way out.

      ON BRETT alone by the game booths, watching Charlie go.  With 
      a chilling sense of purpose, he follows.

      EXT. THE GATES - STREET - LATER

      Charlie walks alone down a quiet street and turns a corner. 
      Brett follows, one block back.  

      When Charlie turns another corner, Brett heads down a 
      parallel street, accelerates to a fast but effortless gait.

      EXT. THE GATES - PARK -- NIGHT

      Charlie enters this large neighborhood park bordered by 
      woods.  He crosses through an open, grass-covered field.

      IN THE WOODS -- Brett tracks him, concealed by trees...

      IN THE CLEARING -- Charlie HEARS something RUSTLE behind him.  
      He stops, turns toward the woods, listens... Nothing.  He 
      begins to move on when a VOICE CALLS OUT --

                                  ANDIE
                          (loud whisper)
                    Charlie!

      Charlie turns to see Andie emerging from the shadows between 
      two giant oak trees.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So...

                                  ANDIE
                    So...

      IN THE WOODS: BRETT watches as Charlie reaches, touches her 
      cheek. Overwhelmed by his emotions, Brett buries his face in 
      his hands.  But upon looking back up, his eyes are now 
      yellow...

      ON CHARLIE AND ANDIE about to kiss, when --

      IN THE WOODS: BRETT -- now fully transformed into a WEREWOLF-- 
      can t hold himself back.                                                                                      57.


      He s ready to sttsck when suddenly, ANOTHER WEREWOLF LUNGES 
      OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND KNOCKS HIM OUT OF FRAME!

      ON CHARLIE AND ANDIE -- as the SOUND of a brief but intense 
      animal fight comes from the woods.  They both turn...

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    What was that?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No idea.

                                  ANDIE
                    Well...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Let s get outta here.

      IN THE WOODS -- Brett, now back IN HUMAN FORM, looks up at 
      Lukas, also in human form, who holds him pinned to the 
      ground.  

                                  LUKAS
                    Not now.  Not like this.

      EXT. GATES - STREET - NIGHT

      Dylan drives along a dark empty street when BLUE AND RED 
      LIGHTS appear behind him.  Glancing into his rearview mirror, 
      he pulls over, waits.  Then Leigh appears at his window.

                                  LEIGH
                    Where you headed so late?

                                  DYLAN
                    Cough medicine.  For my daughter.

                                  LEIGH
                    You sure you want to leave your 
                    wife at home... by herself?

      He looks at her: what s that supposed to mean?

                                  LEIGH (CONT D)
                    I know what s going on, Dylan.

      Though gripped by fear, he remains calm:

                                  DYLAN
                    And what s that?                                                                                    58.


                                  LEIGH
                    Your wife... is sleeping around.  
                    And let s just say she s not very 
                    good at covering her tracks.

      Relieved -- but not about to show it -- he turns to her:

                                  DYLAN
                    Is this police business?

                                  LEIGH
                    No, it s personal.  And if you need 
                    someone to talk to, I m still here.

                                  DYLAN
                          (gently)
                    That s over, Leigh.

                                  LEIGH
                          (sincere)
                    It doesn t have to be.

                                  DYLAN
                    Good night... officer.

      She nods, walks back to her cruiser, leaving Dylan 
        unsettled...

      INT. BATES HOUSE - ANDIE S ROOM - NIGHT

      Andie returns from the park.  Though conflicted about her 
      situation, she can t deny the excitement of the evening.

      She slips off her sweater, revealing a camisole, and takes a 
      seat at her vanity table.  She takes a brush and reaches up 
      to run it through her hair when the edge of her camisole 
      creeps up revealing an odd mark on her side.

      Andie leans into the light, lifts the camisole further to 
      reveal a PATCH OF RAISED GREEN SCALE-LIKE SKIN.  What is 
      that?  She cautiously touches it.  Doesn t hurt.  Concerned.

                                  ANDIE
                    Dad... DAD!!

      Moments later, her father appears in the doorway.  And from 
      the look on his daughter s face, he looks down at the mark.

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    What is this?

      Dad steps closer, kneels down beside her.  He examines the 
      skin with a disturbing look of resignation.                                                                                     59.


                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    Dad?

      He takes a moment to meet her gaze.  Then --

                                    VINCENT
                    The first thing you need to know is 
                    that no matter what happens, I will 
                    always love you.

      Andie stares, now too frightened to speak.

                                    VINCENT (CONT D)
                    I m afraid there s something about 
                    your mother I haven t told you...

      And off the face of a girl who has no idea how her life is 
      about to change --  

      INT. MONOHAN HOUSE - NICK & SARAH S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Nick and Sarah are asleep when, on the night stand, NICK S 
      CELL PHONE RINGS.  Nick fumbles for it, answers:

                                  NICK (INTO PHONE)
                      Monohan...

      EXT. HIGHWAY -- CANYON -- NIGHT 

      BRIGHT LIGHTS illuminate the CANYON as Nick, Marcus and Leigh 
      make their way down a very familiar looking slope...

                                  LEIGH
                    They said there s a car about 
                    twenty yards over that ridge.

      Nick approaches the STATE COP in charge:

                                  NICK
                    Got an ID?

                                  STATE COP
                    John Doe for now.  Maybe you can 
                    help us out...

      Nick, Marcus and Leigh make their way to THE BODY, already 
      wrapped in sheets.  Nick pulls back the cover revealing a  
      perfectly preserved corpse.  It s not Mark Woodbury.  And the 
      condition of the body makes it clear: this isn t Claire and 
      Dylan s work.

                                  STATE COP (CONT D)
                    Weird.  Coyotes left him alone.  He 
                    doesn t have a scratch on him.                                                                                    60.


                                  NICK
                    Not our guy.

      He glances up at Marcus and Leigh -- both of whom stare at 
      the body in shock.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    What?

      Marcus turns to him like he s been punched in the gut.

                                  MARCUS
                    It s Phelps -- our old Chief.

      As Nick stares at his predecessor s dead face, that 
      suspicious instinct surfacing again, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. RADCLIFF HOUSE -- MORNING

      Much like our opening, we find Emily awaiting her carpool at 
      the top of the drive.  Beside her, she rolls her skateboard 
      with her hand, back and forth, back and forth...

      Claire sits atop a landscape stone, lost in thought.  

      UP THE STREET -- Emily sees a car rounding the corner.  She 
      glances briefly at her mother, then back at the car.  With 
      her hand on the board, she waits... waits... waits and then, 
      with one gentle push, sends it rolling down the driveway.  

      It takes a moment for Claire to notice.  But when she does, 
      she stands, just in time to see the car screech to a stop.

      Claire turns to her daughter, stunned by her behavior.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Emily!

                                  EMILY
                    It s okay Mommy.  I won t tell.

      As mother and daughter stare at the car, one conflicted, the 
      other not, we reach --


                                        THE END
