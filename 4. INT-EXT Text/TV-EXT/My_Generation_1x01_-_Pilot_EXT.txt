      Greenbelt High School is in Hyde Park, a suburban 
        neighborhood fifteen minutes outside downtown Austin.  The 
      city itself is a collection of residential neighborhoods 
      surrounding a small urban hub.*

      We hear a WOMAN s voice.*

                    In the year 2000, a documentary 
                    film crew followed a number of High 
                    School Students through their 
                    senior year at Greenbelt High.*

      We see a MONTAGE of moments from a typical high school day.  *

      Note: All the footage we see in this series (unless otherwise *
      noted) has been shot by our documentary crew.  What we are *
      watching, in other words, is not a scripted show, but a *
      documentary called  Generation Y. *

      On the left side of the screen we see a video portrait of

                    I told you.  I m not gonna talk 
                    about my father.

                                  FILMMAKER
                    What about Caroline?

                    I m -- you know, I haven t called 
                    yet.  I mean, I m working on it.  
                    Been busy, but -- getting excited, 
                    I guess.  I mean, the kid s what?  
                    Ten?  It s all dinosaurs and ninjas 
                    at that age, right?  I can do that.

                                  FILMMAKER (O.S.)
                    So you re excited to be a father?

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    Hold on.  Just because I have a kid 
                    doesn't mean I'm a father.

      We hold on Steven as he tries to sell the logic of this.  His 
      phone rings.  Steven looks at the Caller ID, doesn t want to 
      answer, but does because we re watching.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER (CONT D)

      to follow.  What he doesn t realize is he s wearing a 
      microphone, so we can hear every word.

                    to get in on Monday, but ... my

      Steven turns.  Jackie Fox is standing there.  She doesn t see 
      the camera because it s far away.  Steven recognizes her.

                    Let me call you back.

      He hangs up.  Steven looks profoundly uncomfortable to have 
      run into her.  This is the downside to coming home, having to 
      open himself up to people he knows.

                                  JACKIE FOX
                    Oh my God.  What are you doing

                    Nope.  Uh, I read a lot.

      They share an awkward moment, a certain chemistry in the air.

                                  JACKIE FOX (CONT D)
                    It s good to see you.  We should 
                    get a drink sometime.  Or is that *
                    weird because I m married?

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                          (on the spot)
                    No.  I mean -- actually I m not 
                    gonna be in town that long.  Maybe 
                    next time.                                                                                    29.


                                  JACKIE FOX
                    Don t be stupid.  I ll give you my 
                    number.

      She digs through her purse finds a pen, but not paper.  
      Jackie takes Steven s hand and writes her number down.  
      Steven looks both thrilled and uncomfortable, knowing we re 
      watching from outside.  Jackie finishes writing.  Steven 
      looks at the number.

                                  JACKIE FOX (CONT D)
                    Promise you ll call?

      This is exactly what Steven doesn t want; obligations, 
        responsibility, entanglement.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    I, uh -- yeah.  I ll --

                                  JACKIE FOX
                    Great.  
                          (flirty)
                    See you later.

      She walks away, leaving Steven stunned.

                                          ACT THREE


    A beautiful night in the nation s capitol.*

                                                                            CUT TO:*


      The sperm bank is in a strip-mall next to a health food 
      store.  Kenneth rides up on his bicycle.  Helmet on, he 
      chains up his bike.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY
                    I decided last night.  It actually 
                    kind of hit me, you know?  After we *
                    talked.  I mean, what have I really *
                    done to make my dream come true?  *
                    Starting a family.  So what if I *
                    can t, you know, find a wife?  *
                    There are people out there, women, *
                    who are desperate to have kids.  *
                    But they don t have the, uh, what 
                    they need, visa vie sperm.  

      He takes off his bicycle helmet.

                                    KENNETH FINLEY (CONT D)
                    And I can help with that.  Help 
                    start families.  Honestly, I get 
                    pretty excited thinking about all 
                    the women who ll use my sperm -- 
                    or, not excited, that sounds dirty -
                    - but good.  I feel good.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dawn hangs with the stoners and outcasts in the courtyard.  
      The Falcon sits next to her.  Hello Operator, by the White *
      Stripes is playing on a boombox nearby.*

                                  THE FALCON
                          (pointing)
                    Dude, ten o clock -- he s your 
                    lover.

      The camera turns, finds a FAT FRESHMAN BOY tugging at his 
      wedgie, oblivious to the fact that he s in public.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    You got me.  We screwed all day 
                      yesterday.  This morning I found 
                    half a Pop Tart in my underwear.
                          (spots someone)
                    Oooh -- I think I see your lover.

      She points to a pizza-faced GIRL with frizzy hair across the 
      courtyard.  The girl is picking lunch out her braces.

                                  THE FALCON
                    Yeah, she likes it when I call her 
                    Brillo in bed.  I m still too 
                    scared to let her go down on me 
                    though.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                          (beat)
                    What class are we missing?                                                                                    34.


                                  THE FALCON
                    Who remembers?
                          (beat)
                    Hold on.  Dawn s ultimate lover at 
                    nine o clock.

      We see that he s pointing at Kenneth Finley, who has stopped 
      in the courtyard and is trying to get the PRICE TAG off the 
      back of his new pants.  He turns, trying to get a better look 
      at it, ends up chasing his tail like a dog.  

      We FIND Dawn.  She looks slightly sick.

                                  THE FALCON (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    We, uh, we ve actually been dating 
                    for about three weeks.  His name is 
                    Kenneth.

                                  THE FALCON
                      Seriously?

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    He s sweet.  Not my usual alpha 
                    loser, you know?  

      In the courtyard, Kenneth finally gets the tag off.  He holds 
      it up triumphantly.

                                  THE FALCON
                    Your parents must be proud.

      Off Dawn: rethinking her new boyfriend.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON COMPUTER

      We see Dawn, as captured by the computer s camera.  The 
      screen says initiating video chat.  Dawn talks to us as she 
       puts on her face.  

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Yeah, we got married last year.  I 
                    was as surprised as anybody else.  
                    I never saw myself as the army wife 
                    type, you know?  Not to mention a 
                    jock.                                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)35.


                                  FILMMAKER (O.S.)
                    So, what happened?  You and Rolly 
                    traveled in pretty different 
                    circles in high school.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Nothing happened, really.  He was 
                    back here on leave, and he came 
                    into the diner where I worked.  We 
                    just started talking.  You know, 
                    people are just so stupid in high 
                    school.  It s all about labels.  
                    Jock, punk, nerd.  But now -- I 
                    just love him to death.  And I 
                    worry, like, all the time.  
                          (touches her belly)
                    It can t be good for the baby.

      Dawn puts on lipstick, adjusts her cleavage.  We hear the 
      CHIME as the video chat begins.

                                  MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    There s my girl.

      ANGLE ON THE SCREEN

      We see Rolly Marks, 28, with a crew cut, wearing desert 
      fatigues.  Our footage of this scene is all from Dawn s POV, *
      with Rolly visible onscreen speaking directly into his web *
      camera.*

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    Hey, babe.  You look amazing.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    I look fat and tired.  Tell me 
                    you re being careful.

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    I promise.  How s the peanut?

      Dawn touches her rounded belly.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    He likes Mexican food.

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    Well, I ve been showing everybody 
                    the sonogram picture you sent.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    I know.  Isn t she beautiful?  
                    Kenneth put it up on the fridge.                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)36.


      Rolly doesn t like the idea of Dawn living with Kenneth.*

                                  ROLLY MARKS*
                    I really wish you d move in with *
                    Anders and Jackie.  I hate that you *
                    have to stay with a stranger.*

                                  DAWN BARBUSO*
                    Kenneth s not a stranger.  We used *
                    to date.*

                                  ROLLY MARKS*
                    And that s better how?*

                                  DAWN BARBUSO*
                    Baby, Kenneth s harmless.  Besides, *
                    Anders and Jackie don t want me.*

                                  ROLLY MARKS*
                    He s my best friend.*

                                  DAWN BARBUSO*
                    Yeah, but she s a stuck-up bitch, *
                    so they kind of cancel each other *
                    out.  Besides, I m happy here.*

      Rolly looks at his wife.  We see how hard it is for him to be 
      so far away, to not be able to provide for her.*

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    I miss you.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Oh, baby.  I miss you too, so much.

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                          (looks around)
                    Show me something.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                          (coy)
                    What do you want to see?

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    You know.  Come on, babe.  It s 
                    been ten months.  I m dying here.

      Dawn checks to make sure Kenneth isn t nearby.  She turns to 
      the camera.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    Don t look.

      She pulls down her top, flashing her breasts.  *                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)37.


                                  ROLLY MARKS
                          (stunned)*
                    Wow.  They really get big when 
                    you re pregnant, huh?

      In the background we see Kenneth appear in the doorway.  He 
      sees Dawn s breasts and freezes like a deer in the 
      headlights.  Then he sees us watching, turns and walks 
      straight into the doorjam.  Oblivious, Dawn pulls her top up.*

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    You have no idea.

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    Three more months.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    I can t wait.

      Off screen somebody says something to Rolly.

                                  ROLLY MARKS
                    I gotta go, babe.  Love you. 

                                  DAWN BARBUSO
                    I --

      The chat ends, leaving Dawn talking to a blank screen.

                                  DAWN BARBUSO (CONT D)
                    --love you too.

      Dawn sits for a moment staring at the screen.  We see how 
      hard it is for her living with the knowledge that her husband 
      could be killed at any moment.*

                                                                            CUT TO:*

      He signals to his men to take positions.  Two soldiers 
      approach the front door.

      Suddenly, the camera catches MOTION, as an AFGHANI MAN is 
      seen running from the back of the house.  Rolly catches it.

      It is a long run, bullets whizzing past.  Finally, Rolly and

      They drop behind some concrete rubble.

                    On October 3rd, 2004, Steven s 
                    father was sentenced to six years 
                    in prison.  The next day Steven 
                    bought a plane ticket to Hawaii.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Waves crash against the pristine beach.  It s Paradise.

      Caroline and Kenneth are deep in conversation.  We watch from 
      a distance.  Caroline s phone rings.  She looks at the caller 
      ID, doesn t answer.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Caroline and Kenneth are still talking.  Suddenly, Caroline 
      hugs Kenneth.  He doesn t know what to do.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER (O.S.)
                    You know, I had a really -- crappy 
                    dad and -- I m not making excuses.  
                    I m just saying -- I ve got my own -
                    - stuff to deal with -- but I wanna 
                    make this work, you know --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Steven is becoming emotional.

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    -- I wanna be some kind of father, 
                    so I thought -- maybe tomorrow we 
                    could do something -- go to the zoo 
                    or the park or something.  That d 
                    be -- awesome.  Really.  Okay.  
                    Call me back.

      He hangs up, stands for a moment, thinking.  Jackie sticks 
      her head out.

                                  JACKIE HOLT
                    Hey, you re coming back, right?  I 
                    didn t scare you away?

      Steven looks at her.  Jackie s vulnerability is obvious.  Now 
      that she s opened herself up to him he can t abandon her.  
      And yet, Steven has worked so hard to separate himself from 
      other people, to build a wall, but now that he s back he 
      realizes how hard it will be to keep his distance. 

                                  STEVEN FOSTER
                    Not at all.  I ll be right in.

      She smiles, goes back inside.  Steven takes a deep breath, 
      follows.                                    Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)64.

      GROUP INTERVIEW, HIGH SCHOOL, AUSTIN, TX - DAY (2000)

      We see all of our subjects as they pose for the camera.  They 
      are 18 years old, with their whole lives ahead of them.  The 
      twelve teenagers have no idea what the future will bring, the 
      victories and defeats.  We end on their hopeful faces.
