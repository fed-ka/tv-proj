        A mysterious BLACK VAN pulls up to the FRONT DOOR.  TWO 
      BURGLARS dressed in black hustle to the door.

                                    BURGLAR #1
                    It s locked.

                                    BURGLAR #2
                    Here.  I can get us in.  *

                                                                          BACK TO:


      They arrive through the ROOF ACCESS DOOR.

                                  ANDERS
                          (anxiously)
                    OK, cool, where s the fire escape?

                                  BLAKE
                    No fire escape, but I do have a way 
                    out.  You might remember the 
                    classic tale by...  Wait, who wrote 
                    Rapunzel?

                                  ANDERS
                    What are you talking about?

                                  ADAM
                    Fuck it, I m jumping.

                                  ANDERS
                    Please do.

                                  BLAKE
                    No, seriously, let s make a pony-
                    tail out of our clothes and 
                    Rapunzel down.

                                  ANDERS
                    You mean repel?

                                  BLAKE
                    No, Rapunzel.  That s where the 
                    word repel comes from, but it s the 
                    same thing.

                                  ANDERS
                    Pretty sure none of that s true, 
                    but shall we?

      Anders and Blake UNDRESS.  Adam looks over the EDGE, 
      realizing how high up they are.

                                  ADAM
                    I could definitely jump this and 
                    Kerri Strug the landing, but I care 
                    about you guys and I know that I m 
                    your leader.  A general doesn t 
                    leave his platroon, so I ll be 
                    joining, private.

                                  ANDERS
                    That s splendid.

      As Ders and Blake tie their clothes together Adam undresses 
      to REVEAL that under his clothing, he s wearing SPANX 
      (women s compression underwear that give shape to unshapely 
      ladies).  Ders and Blake stare.

                                  ADAM
                    What?  They re called Spanx.  I 
                    haven t had time to hit the gym 
                    lately, OK?!  It s been a tough 
                    quarter and you know I m a stress-
                    eater.

      Adam devours more shrooms.

                                  BLAKE
                    Dude, you re stress-eating some 
                    high grade shit.  We need you 
                    focused.

                                  ADAM
                    Fine, gimme that rope.  I m the 
                    best thrower.

                                  ANDERS
                    Wait, we didn t--

      Adam HEAVES the clothing rope over the edge.  What he forgot 
      to do is tie one end to something on the roof.

      The rope SAILS down to the ground in SLOW MO.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s beautiful.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        17.
