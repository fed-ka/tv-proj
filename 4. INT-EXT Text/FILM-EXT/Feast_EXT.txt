The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a
cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.
Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its
way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES
perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.
The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching
coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky,
weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut
and naive).
Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth
before them.
CHIEF
This is it.
LANKY
Why did it have to be these caves...
COLLEGE BOY
Is something wrong?
LANKY
(to College Boy)
Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.
Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.
The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT."
CHIEF
Let's get that first barrel.
The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS
bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.
Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music
emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.
A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle
on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER
TOY HAS TITS."
A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from
the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.
NAME: BOZO
AGE: 32
JOB: UNEMPLOYED
OCCUPATION: TOWN JACKASS
LIFE EXPECTANCY: DEAD BY DAWN
The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup
trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes
through the front entrance --
P.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing.
P.O.V. - We jump over a bush and crash in the dusty earth.
P.O.V. - We are trucking... labored breathing...
P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead.
P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar...
P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.
P.O.V. - Still running. The bar is getting closer.
P.O.V. - The bar is close -- we leap a ditch.
P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and --
Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...
TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves
and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.
HEROINE (V.O.)
He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly
just the same.
MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than
Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her
stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.
A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.
The orange sun melts into the horizon.
There's a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.
Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.
PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions
peek out from the damaged cellar door.
The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO
pulls into a small gas station
Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks
inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.
Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.
HERO
What's goin' on? The pumps are off.
TUBBS
There's nobody here --
She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There
is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION
ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.
HEROINE
They've been here!
HERO
Turn on the pump!
Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.
Hero fills their Camaro.
HERO
Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck
it down.
Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows...
Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.
HERO
Move it!
Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.
Their loot hits the pavement as they run.
HERO
Get in the car, baby.
Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the
back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.
Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the
sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas
pool. Something rises in the gas station.
Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.
HERO
Roll!
Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the
station becomes a FIREBALL.
Being held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are
both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams.
ROADIE
RUN!!!
THUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL.
The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the
bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her
head out.
Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for
the nearby BEER TRUCK.
The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel,
waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer
of SMOKE blankets the entire area.
The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from
advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.
HEROINE
She's still out here.
Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.
HEROINE
Stay put.
She creeps out alone.
HEROINE
Where are you... come on...
Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.
HEROINE
Come on! Come on!
From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.
At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in,
leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering
the back.
INSIDE TRUCK
Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She
advances, hissing.
HEROINE
Come and get me you blood-chugging
CUNT!
Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg
door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap,
Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.
OUTSIDE TRUCK
Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.
TRAMPY
You got her? You got her!
HEROINE
Not for long, we gotta burn it.
Heroine looks to the others at the breach.
HEROINE
Come on! Let's blow this thing!
The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt
and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with
Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails
to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.
BEER GUY
When this lights, run like hell.
About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his
silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.
HEROINE
(catching lighter)
Here we go...
Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!
A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.
It's Momma Beast. Again and again.
TUFFY
What is that?
HEROINE
She's calling for help.
Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the
truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the
fire with his foot.
BOZO
The fan has officially been buried
in the shit.
Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of
the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped.
The group gasps. Trampy backs away.
TRAMPY
We have to run --
BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit,
UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box
of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar.
From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma
Beast emerges.
HEROINE
Get to your cars!!!
The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.
Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast
RIPS Para from Bozo's back.
BOZO
Motherfucker! Give him back!
Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still
alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.
BOZO
Oh Jesus!
PARA
HELLLPPP!
Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.
BOZO
I thought we lost you --
Para is RIPPED into the air again.
BOZO
You FUCKER!
Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.
TUFFY
(to Heroine)
Get in!
Heroine hops in the back.
Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags
behind, continually looking over his shoulder.
ADULTERER
Run and quit looking back!
As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit
him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his
Trans-Am.
BOZO
DO IT!
VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.
The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.
BOZO
Get me FUCK BIRDS!
Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.
BOZO
No you don't!
BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's
disemboweled body sailing through the air.
BOZO
VENGEANCE!
Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are
moving everywhere.
PARA
Oh Jesussss...
Para crawls along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.
PARA
HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!
Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood
and guts. He spots Para.
BOZO
Hang on!
Para claws the ground.
PARA
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.
BARTENDER
Oh shit!
Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.
PARA
NOOO!!!
Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his
brother.
PARA
COME ON! GODDAMN IT!
Bozo's eyes bulge.
BOZO
Brother!!!
BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.
ADULTERER
Shit!
Bozo floors it.
BOZO
(overly endearing)
I meant to tell you so much!
The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.
Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.
BOZO
Motherfucker!!!
Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.
He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE
from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.
Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and
looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.
BOZO
Lord, if I die, bury me upside down
so the world can KISS MY ASS!
Cousin Beast leaps in.
The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.
A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.
Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random
POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.
Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of
life here either.
The car pulls up to the house. The only sound is the wind.
The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff
wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches
up the street.
The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They
get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer
kneels against his car.
HEROINE
Where is everyone?
ADULTERER
I don't know, I just got here. Did
you find your girl?
HEROINE
She's supposed to already be here.
TUFFY
Your family?
Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.
TUFFY
I'm sorry.
Adulterer sheepishly nods.
HEROINE
This place is a ghost town.
The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond
the glass doors.
ADULTERER
(pointing)
Look!
In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE
stands staring at them.
HEROINE
Charlie?
Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets
awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.
HEROINE
Charlie!
As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.
ADULTERER
Stop! There's something wrong!
HEROINE
Honey!?
The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her
ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly,
the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.
TUFFY
Oh god.
The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast
HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to
right, panic stricken.
CHARLIE
Mommy!
The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something
is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but
Adulterer holds her at bay.
ADULTERER
It's a trap!
At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the
distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.
Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for
Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole
cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.
The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting
Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.
ADULTERER
(gurgling blood)
Run!!!
Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.
Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store
front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him
towards her main prey.
A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the
survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close.
HEROINE
(a whisper)
I love you...
CUT TO BLACK:
A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking
lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps
from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.
A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed
alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into
action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.
THE MAN IN TAN
What's the damage radius?
TECH (27, horn-rimmed glasses, all business) eyes a laptop.
TECH
Twenty miles. Red Mountain,
surrounding farms, local TV studio.
THE MAN IN TAN
How many picked up the broadcast?
TECH
We'll have figures within the hour.
The Man in Tan closes his eyes in thought.
TECH
Sir, what's the spin?
THE MAN IN TAN
Tornado cluster.
TECH
This is the California high desert.
THE MAN IN TAN
Get what you need to sell it.
COMPANY MAN (O.S.)
Sir, we have movement!
The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of
blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN
follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.
A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody
rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.
THE MAN IN TAN
What happened to you?
The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.
Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.
BOZO
Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn
hero for Christ's sake!
A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in
the back. He settles at the sight of the others.
GRANDMA
G'morning.
BOZO
Thanks for waitin' for me back there,
really fuckin' appreciate it!
Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped
into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.
TUFFY
How'd you survive?
BOZO
I found a new weak spot on 'em, but
it damn ain't pretty getting to it.
Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.
HEROINE
Where are you taking us?
THE MAN IN TAN
A trauma center. We have doctors
waiting.
(off Heroine's pause)
You're in good hands now.
The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan
locks eyes with the Driver.
THE MAN IN TAN
Do it quick and spread the mess.
The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.
The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck
drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.
Freeze on him.
NAME: THE MAN IN TAN
AGE: 45
OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU
PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL
LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD
The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.
