      OVER BLACK

      We HEAR the sound of an engine roaring.  Tires screaming.  
      Vehicular warfare.

                                    CASSIUS (VO)
                    Watch it!  WATCH IT!

                                  RYAN (VO)
                    I got it!

                                    CASSIUS (VO)
                    Don t lose him!

                                  RYAN (VO)
                    You wanna drive?!

      Then SMASH OPEN on --


      A CHRYSLER 300 HEMI

      -- shrieking through the streets of San Francisco.


      INT. HEMI - CONTINUOUS

      In the driver s seat, RYAN LOPEZ (early 30s Latino; trim, 
      intelligent and aggressive) racks the wheel, slotting the car 
      through hellacious traffic.

      Beside him, CASSIUS GREEN (mid-30s, African American) loads a 
      shotgun with .50 caliber steel slugs.

      Ahead, we see their target:  an ARMORED BANK TRUCK speeding 
      along the boulevard.

                                    CASSIUS
                    There it is! 

      Suddenly, from O.S., three black CADILLAC CTS-Vs descend on 
      the Armored Truck.

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    Right on time.  

                                  RYAN
                    You doubted me?

                                    CASSIUS
                    On a daily basis.  Okay, here we 
                    go!  Hit it!

      Ryan stomps the accelerator and blasts forward.                                                                                      2.


      EXT./INT. RYAN S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Like a pack of hyenas taking down a bull elephant, the three 
      Caddies work in perfect coordination to try and bring down 
      the Armored Truck.  

      In unison, the Caddies each glide up to a separate truck 
      wheel, lower their windows -- and open up on the tires with 
      AK-47s.  BRRRAAAPPP!  In the blink of an eye, the rubber 
      tires are chewed up and the Truck is hobbled, grinding down 
      the road in a shower of sparks.

      And just as we think Ryan and Cassius are going to join the 
      pack and help them stop the truck --

      Ryan glides up on the rearmost Caddy, cranks the wheel and -- 
      WHAM! -- sends it violently spinning out of the chase with a 
      skillful PIT MANEUVER.

      As Caddy #1 spins out, Ryan punches the gas, pops the curb 
      and speeds down the sidewalk to pull up alongside Caddy #2, 
      positioning Cassius to -- BOOM!  BOOM! -- send two slugs into 
      the engine block, instantly disabling the vehicle.  But just 
      then --


      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRUCK

      Caddy #3 has a nice little surprise...and tosses a Chinese 
      TYPE 72 LANDMINE under the Armored Truck s right front wheel.  
      And when the truck runs over it --

      KA-BOOOOM!  The Truck s right side ERUPTS VIOLENTLY off the 
      ground, flipping over toward --


      RYAN AND CASSIUS

      -- who see the behemoth truck about to crush them.

                                    CASSIUS
                    BRAKE! BRAKE! BRAKE!

      But instead Ryan does the opposite and PUNCHES THE GAS --

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    NO NO NO NO!!

      -- but the move is the right one and lets them zoom clear as 
      the Truck DETONATES into the ground an inch behind them. 

      Ryan turns and smiles.

                                  RYAN
                    Gotta stop doubting me, dude.

      With razor-sharp reflexes, Ryan yanks the wheel and skids 
      around to face the final Caddy, dead ahead.                                                                                        3.


      But Caddy #3 is ready.  Turns their guns on Ryan s Hemi and 
      OPENS FIRE --

      Bullets punch through the car, shatter the windshield, but 
      Ryan hammers the gas and shrieks through the deadly 7.62 
      caliber hailstorm to --

      WHAAAAM!!  Ryan s Hemi T-bones the Caddy and sends it 
      tumbling wildly down the road.  After four or five 
        revolutions, the Caddy finally crunches to a stop.  Dazed, 
      the tatted Skinhead gangsters stumble from the car -- only to 
      find Ryan and Cassius striding up, shotguns leveled.  Badges 
      around their neck.

                                  SKINHEAD DRIVER
                    You don t look like cops.

                                    CASSIUS
                    We re not.

                                  RYAN
                    Gang Task Force.  You re under 
                    arrest.

      Just then, a ton of San Francisco black and whites swoop in 
      and take custody of the gang members.  

      Cassius looks at Ryan, proud.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Look at you.  A month ago, you re 
                    riding patrol, handing out parking 
                    tickets.  And now you ve made your 
                    first bust with the GTF.

                                  RYAN
                          (grins)
                    Was it good for you?

                                    CASSIUS
                    Man, now you re making it weird.

      Just then, O.S.:

                                  VOICE (OS)
                    Sure there s nothing else you want 
                    to destroy while you re at it?

      They turn as one of the patrol officers - JOHN TANNER -- 
      strides up.  

                                  RYAN
                    Nah, I m good.

                                  TANNER
                    You sure?  I mean, there s a 
                    building still standing over there--                                                                                      4.


                                  RYAN
                    You keep running that jaw, I m sure 
                    I ll think of something to shatter.

      Tanner walks right up to Ryan.  But just when it looks like 
      they're about to square off...they both bust up laughing.

                                  TANNER
                    Drinks after shift are on me.

      Tanner grins and claps him on the shoulder.

                                  TANNER (CONT D)
                    Proud of you, partner.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Former partner.

                                  RYAN
                          (smiles at Cassius)
                    Now you re making it weird.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. TREASURE ISLAND - ESTABLISHING

      A man-made island halfway between San Francisco and Oakland.  
      Originally constructed for the World s Fair in  36, then 
        commandeered by the Navy during WWII, the buildings are an 
      odd mix of Art Deco flourish and military spartanism.

      Among these, FIND a small naval prison, now turned Gang Task 
      Force Headquarters -- known affectionately as  The Brig .


      INT. THE BRIG - SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

        A half-dozen lawmen from various agencies await a briefing:  
      FBI.  Marshal Service.  D.A. s office.  SFPD.

      But when Ryan and Cassius walk in, the room erupts in hoots 
      and applause.  Cassius takes a theatrical bow.

                                    CASSIUS
                    My adoring fans...  Up high.  Up 
                    high...  

      Cassius does a victory lap down the aisle, high-fiving 
      everyone he passes.  Detective VANESSA  VEE  HICKS (28; the 
      youngest member of the GTF...and the wildest) steps up 
      eagerly.

                                  VEE
                    Is it true they had a land mine?

      Cassius makes her wait for it.  Then:                                                                                      5.


                                    CASSIUS
                    True.

                                  VEE
                    Damn, why do I always get the lame 
                    calls?  
                          (high-fives him)
                    You re so lucky.

      Finally they reach TAE KIM (34, Korean); the Asian gang 
      specialist on loan from the FBI.  Cassius gives a thousand 
      watt grin and raises his hand.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Up high!

      But Tae leaves him hanging.  Stares, deadpan.

                                  TAE
                      Seriously?  We re celebrating this?

                                  RYAN
                    We stopped the heist.

                                  TAE
                    You did a hundred grand in damage 
                    to save a truck with less than 75 
                    in it.  Do the math.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    It ain t always about the numbers.

      Everyone turns to see SAM CHAPEL -- the tough, dynamic police 
      captain heading up the Task Force -- entering the room.  He 
      meets Tae s eyes.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Sometimes you have to get a little 
                    dirty if you want to take out the 
                    trash.

                                    CASSIUS
                    You must ve skipped that lesson at 
                    the FBI, huh, Tae?

                                  TAE
                      I graduated at the top of my class, 
                    asshole.

                                    CASSIUS
                    And this is where they send the 
                      Valedictorian?

      Everyone laughs.  Tae bristles.  It s clear he has a chip on 
      his shoulder about being assigned here.                                                                                      6.


                                  CHAPEL
                    Settle down.  I just got word back 
                    on the Armored Truck job.  Database 
                    matched the heist crew as a White 
                    Union set.  Probably 4th Street.  
                    They re not rolling over, but 
                    thanks to Ryan and Cassius, we took 
                    eight guys off the chessboard 
                    today.  It s going to set them 
                    back. 

      There s a beat, then:

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    But let s not rest on our laurels, 
                    shall we?  We ve been tasked with 
                    tracking a new type of coke hitting 
                    the Bay area.  They call it 
                       Fishscale .  It s pharma grade, 
                    potent as hell.
                          (beat)
                    Up to this point, the Latino gangs 
                    have cornered the market, and one 
                    family controls the supply -- La 
                    Familia Sud.  Javier Acosta is 
                    running the show. 

      Chapel indicates Acosta s picture at the top of the Latino 
      gang s photo hierarchy along the wall.  The Big Three of San 
      Francisco s gangs each have their own tree.  The Latino gang:  
      LA FAMILIA SUD.  The African-American gang:  THE OAKLAND 
      LORDS.  And the Korean mob:  DOKKEBI PA (or  Goblin gang .)

                                  VEE
                          (under her breath)
                    What show doesn t that guy run?

                                  CHAPEL
                    But now the DEA is saying the 
                    Oakland Lords have a shipment of 
                    the stuff coming in from the Meta 
                    Cartel out of Colombia.  If they 
                    establish a pipeline, they re gonna 
                    start throwing off the balance, and 
                    before you know it we re gonna have 
                      a full-scale gang war on our hands.  
                    We have to avoid that at all costs.  
                    So starting tomorrow, float the 
                    word out, work your sources.  Do 
                    whatever it takes to kill this 
                    deal.
                          (stepping away)
                    See you tomorrow.  Dimissed.

      As the group breaks for the night, Chapel calls out to Ryan.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Lopez.  My office.                                                                                      7.


      INT. CHAPEL S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Ryan enters.  Chapel closes the door behind him.

                                  RYAN
                      Everything okay?

                                  CHAPEL
                    No.  Give me your gun.

                                  RYAN
                    What?  Why?

      But Chapel simply holds his hand out.  Reluctantly, Ryan 
      hands him his piece.  Chapel turns it over in his hands.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Still using your Academy issue...
                          (shakes his head)
                    Every rook buys their first service 
                    piece cheap  cause they don t have 
                    the money, figuring they ll replace 
                    it later.  But they never do.

      Chapel takes a box off his desk and hands it to Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    What s this?

                                  CHAPEL
                    Health insurance.

      Curious, Ryan opens the box...to find a stealth-black SEMI-
      AUTO.  It's stunning&and expensive.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Colt M1911 Tactical .45.  Action 
                    tuned.  Novak sights.  Three pound 
                    trigger pull.  Speed chute mag 
                    well.
                          (beat)
                    Best service piece ever made, 
                    worthy of only the best cops. 

      Ryan stares at the gun in wonder.  Chapel meets his eyes, 
      almost fatherly.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    I got big plans for you.  You re 
                    gonna go far.
                          (beat)
                    Live up to that gun.

                                  RYAN
                    I ll try.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Go on.  Get out of here.                                                                                      8.


      Ryan turns to leave, but as he reaches the door:

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Tae may be an asshole, but he ain t 
                    wrong.  Keep wrecking the city and 
                    the boys upstairs are gonna start 
                    wondering whose side you re really 
                    on.

      They both smile, and as Ryan exits --

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      SHOTGLASSES CLINKING

      Pull back to reveal we are --


      INT. LOCAL BAR - KOREATOWN - NIGHT

      -- where we FIND Ryan and Tanner, having that celebratory 
      drink.  In a perfectly  synchronized ritual, they down a 
      shots, turn the empty glasses over in their hands, then slam 
      them down onto the bartop -- where we see ten other EMPTIES 
      lined up.  

      They re both pretty sloppy, and Ryan laughs while Tanner 
      tries to finish telling a story.

                                  TANNER
                    ...so I m wrestling the guy to the 
                    ground, but this dude s a monster.  
                    280 at least and strong as an ox,  
                    and he keeps pulling his arms 
                    apart.  I m yelling at my partner 
                    to cuff him, but the kid s green as 
                    grass and he can t get the cuffs 
                    on, can t get the cuffs on...  
                    Finally, my strength is giving out 
                    and I m screaming at this kid when 
                    he finally snaps the cuffs around 
                    his wrist -- with my thumb in them!

                                  RYAN
                    No way!

                                  TANNER
                    Yes way!  You should ve seen it.  
                    This guy s making a break for it 
                    and I m hopping around behind him 
                    trying to keep my thumb from 
                    getting torn off.

                                  RYAN
                    What did you do?                                                                                      9.


                                  TANNER
                    What do you think?  Hopped on his 
                    back and maced him up the nose 
                    until he dropped.

      Tanner turns to Ryan, sloppy.

                                  TANNER (CONT D)
                    I m telling you, man.  It ain t the 
                    same without you.

                                  RYAN
                    Well it may not have to be that way 
                    for long.

                                  TANNER
                    What are you talking about?

                                  RYAN
                    I talked with Chapel, recommended 
                    he promote you into the Task Force.

                                  TANNER
                    Yeah?  What did he say?

                                  RYAN
                    Said he s putting in the paperwork.

      These words mean the world to Tanner.

                                  TANNER
                    We re gonna be partners again?

                                  RYAN
                    Looks like it.

      Ryan goes to drink his drink -- but sloshes it everywhere as 
      Tanner picks him up without warning.  And as he starts 
      singing  We Are the Champions  at the top of his voice --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. LOCAL BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Ryan and Tanner stumble out of the bar.  Tanner fumbles in 
      his pocket for something.

                                  RYAN
                    What are you doing?

      By way of an answer, Tanner holds up his KEYS.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    No.                                                                                    10.


                                  TANNER
                    I m fine!  Give me a Field Sobriety 
                    test!

                                  RYAN
                    Okay, here you go --

      And Ryan snatches the keys away.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Failed.

                                  TANNER
                    Hey!  Hey!!
                          (then suddenly serious)
                    What did the policeman say to his 
                    belly button?
                          (beat)
                    You re under a vest.

      Ryan stares at Tanner as he cracks himself up.

                                  RYAN
                      Definitely getting you a cab.

      Ryan pulls out his cellphone and starts to dial, when --

                                  TANNER
                    Hey, yo, check it!

      Ryan turns to see Tanner pointing out into the dark.  Across 
      an empty field, they see a FIGURE tagging an abandoned 
      warehouse -- a young Korean street punk with a bad FAUX HAWK, 
      a distinctive RED JACKET.  

                                  TANNER (CONT D)
                    Tagger.

      Instantly, Tanner starts to move off in the direction of the 
      warehouse.

                                  RYAN
                    Wait, whoa.  

                                  TANNER
                    Come on.  We ll scare the piss out 
                    of him --

                                  RYAN
                    Nah, man.  It s late.  We ll call 
                    it in.

                                  TANNER
                    He ll be gone by then and you know 
                    it.  Come on.  It ll be fun!  Like 
                    old times!
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  TANNER (CONT'D)
                    What, you too high and mighty now 
                    to do a little community service, 
                      detective?
                          (then grins)
                    Come on, brother.

      And Ryan relents.  


      EXT. KOREATOWN WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      There's a sense of fun as the two sneak up on the warehouse, 
      set to surprise what they think are kids.  But when they 
      spring from around the corner --

                                  TANNER
                    What do you kids think you re--?

      -- everything changes.  

      Four CORPSES litter the ground.  Bound and butchered.  
      Members of the OAKLAND LORDS by the look of them.  

      Instantly sober, Ryan and Tanner draw their guns and begin 
      sweeping the shadows.  Suddenly --

      SFX:  A NOISE from O.S.

      Wordlessly, Ryan and Tanner signal each other and move in 
      opposite directions to check it out.  

      TRACK WITH Ryan as he slips through the dark.  The tension is 
      palpable.  Someone could be hiding anywhere.  Then --

      SFX:  SHUFFLING.  FROM UP AHEAD. 

      Coming from an open door leading into blackness at the end of 
      the hall... 

      Wary, Ryan steps closer.  Closer...  Pauses at the threshold 
      to steel his nerves.  Then steps in just as --

      A FERAL DOG comes leaping from the darkness, snarling and 
      snapping!  

      Ryan slams the door an inch ahead of the rabid bitch, who 
      claws and growls to get at him.

      But as Ryan backs away, trying to shake out the jitters --

      SFX:  BANG-BANG-BANG! 

      And Ryan is MOVING!  Homing in on the sound of the gunshots.  
      Races through the darkened building and rounds a corner...

      ...to find Tanner standing there, staring right at Ryan with 
      the most curious expression on his face.                                                                                    12.


                                  RYAN
                    Tanner..?

      Then -- BANG! -- one final shot rings out and Tanner 
      crumples, his body falling away... to REVEAL A FIGURE 
      standing behind him, his upper-torso obscured in shadow, the 
      barrel of his DISTINCTIVE STAINLESS STEEL GUN still smoking.

      And Ryan has the sonofabitch dead to rights.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    DROP YOUR WEAPON!!

      Calmly, the Figure lowers his gun.  There's a beat...then the 
      Figure takes a step forward.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    STAY WHERE YOU ARE!  DON T MOVE!

      Ryan's finger tightens on the trigger as the Figure takes one 
      more step.  Into the light.  And now we SEE the killer's 
      face.  

      But what's more is we see that the killer and Ryan recognize 
      each other.  

      A smile crosses the killer's face (who we'll call TORRES from 
      this point out).  And Ryan does the last thing we expect a 
      cop to do when facing a cop killer...

      He lowers his gun.

      Then Ryan nods, knowing what has to happen next.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Do it.

      And off his command, Torres raises his gun and -- BANG! -- 
      shoots Ryan, who collapses like a heartshot deer.  

      Laughing, Torres walks away as Ryan, laying on the ground, 
      staring at his dead friend, just lets him go...


                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    13.


                                            ACT TWO


      INT. HOSPITAL - THE NEXT DAY

      Ryan lays in a bed, a tube sticking out of his chest.  The 
      DOCTOR is examining him.  Chapel sits in the corner watching 
      everything, his concern almost paternal.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Shot went in just beneath the 
                    shoulder, caused a pneumothorax.  
                    Air filled your chest cavity and 
                    squeezed your lungs.  That s why 
                    you blacked out.  We put the tube 
                    in, got rid of the air in there.
                          (examines the tube)
                    Take a deep breath.  Hold it.

      When Ryan does, the Doc YANKS OUT THE TUBE.  Ryan roars in 
      pain.  Chapel reacts.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Jesus, Doc.  How about some 
                    warning?!

                                  DOCTOR
                            (nonchalant)
                    It s worse when they tense up, 
                    believe me.

      The Doctor slaps an Asherman seal on the wound.

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    You need to follow up with an x-ray 
                    in a couple of days.  No flying for 
                    six weeks.  No rigorous activity.  
                    I ll prescribe meds for pain.

                                  CHAPEL
                    How long should he stay home for?

                                  DOCTOR
                    That s up to him.  The bullet 
                    didn t touch his lungs, arteries, 
                    internal organs...
                          (to Ryan)
                    You re one lucky guy.

      Ryan glares at him, thinking of his dead friend.  The Doctor 
      instantly realizes his mistake.

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    Look, I m sorry --

      But Chapel intervenes.                                                                                    14.


                                  CHAPEL
                    Can you give me a minute with him?

                                  DOCTOR
                    Sure.  I-- I ll go see about 
                    getting him discharged.

      And the Doctor beats a hasty retreat.  When he s gone, Chapel 
      sits beside Ryan, who s lost in a sea of guilt threatening to 
      break him.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Look, kid...  I know how close you 
                    and Tanner were.

                                  RYAN
                    It s my fault --

                                  CHAPEL
                    No, it s not.  You did everything 
                    you could.

      The words twist in Ryan s gut like a knife.

      Just then, a COP opens the door and signals Chapel.  Whispers 
      something into his ear.  When the Cop is gone, Chapel turns 
      to Ryan.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Listen.  I.A. is outside.  They 
                    want to talk to you.

                                  RYAN
                    I just want to go home.

                                  CHAPEL
                    I ll see what I can do.

      Chapel moves to open the door, but pauses at the threshold.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    We re gonna find who did this.  And 
                    we ll see justice done for Tanner.  
                    That s a promise.


      INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE RYAN S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Chapel exits Ryan's room, just as two INTERNAL AFFAIRS 
      officers -- ALAN JEFERS (50) and JESSICA SHAW (32) -- reach 
      the door. 

                                  JEFERS
                    Hey, Chap.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Alan.  Jess.                                                                                    15.


      Jessica s look has all the warmth of an IRS auditor s smile.

                                    JESSICA
                    He awake?

                                  CHAPEL
                    Yeah --

      Instantly, she tries to move past, but Chapel steps in her 
      way.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    -- but listen.  He s had a tough 
                    night.  The guy just lost his best 
                    friend.  He s blaming himself 
                    pretty hard.

                                    JESSICA
                    Sometimes it s okay for people to 
                    blame themselves.
                          (pointedly)
                    At least he feels something.  Some 
                    people can t even do that.

                                  JEFERS
                    Jess --

                                    JESSICA
                    Get out of my way.

      But Chapel doesn t budge.

                                  CHAPEL
                    I m just saying, he s a good kid.  
                    Do you really have to do this right 
                    now?

      Jess gets right in his face.  Whispers low and threatening.

                                    JESSICA
                    Yes, I do, Dad.

      But Chapel holds his ground.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Not tonight.

      Jess gives him an icy glare.  Then turns and storms out.  
      When she s gone, Jeffers shrugs sheepishly at Chap.

                                  JEFERS
                    Kids...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    16.


      EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - KOREATOWN - DAY

      Tae and Vee walk the crime scene from the night before.  A 
      bunch of forensics guys are taking photos, doing their thing.    

                                  VEE
                    Shooter was here.  In the dark.
                          (beat)
                    They never had a chance.

                                  TAE
                    Did Lopez get a description?

                                  VEE
                    No.
                          (indicates)
                    Tanner s body was here.

      Tae looks at the pin flags outlining where Tanner s body was.  
      Also notes the FOUR SHELL CASINGS ejected from the shooter s 
      gun. 

      Tae scans the area.  Points to a empty patch of ground.

                                  TAE
                    And that s where they found Lopez?

                                  VEE
                    Yeah.

      Tae walks over.  Looks around.  By the look on his face, Vee 
      can tell something s not quite right.

                                  VEE (CONT D)
                    See something?

                                  TAE
                    No...
                          (turns)
                    That s the problem.

      And as Tae walks off, keeping his thoughts to himself --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. RYAN S CAR - DRIVING - DUSK

      Ryan is driving home, trapped in his own mental hell...when 
      another car rumbles up behind him.  The car flashes its 
      brights in two quick bursts.

      And Ryan pulls over.

      An instant later, the other car pulls up alongside:  a bad-
      ass  69 CAMARO ZL1 -- a black automotive monster with the 
      most powerful engine Chevy ever made for a heart.                                                                                      17.


      The Camaro glides up alongside, and its tinted windows roll 
      down to reveal the driver, DANTE ACOSTA (30, a Latino triple 
      threat: a smart, heartthrob asskicker.)   There's a moment, 
      then:

                                  DANTE
                    My dad wants to see you.

      Ryan looks around...then kills his own car and gets into the 
      Camaro.


      AERIAL TRACKING SHOT 

      following the Camaro as it cruises into San Francisco's 
      Latino neighborhood...


      INT. DANTE S CAMARO - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

      Dante and Ryan drive in silence.  Eventually, sensing Ryan is 
      troubled, Dante looks to him.

                                  DANTE
                    You did good.

                                  RYAN
                    Sure doesn t feel like it.

      And without another word, they drive the rest of the way to:


      EXT. THE HOUSE OF JAVIER ACOSTA - ESTABLISHING

      -- where a neighborhood barbecue is going on.  The house is 
      sophisticated and well-appointed.  There's music, kids, fun.  
      A real community vibe -- not at all what we expect of the 
      home of a capitan of the Familia Sud.  


      INT. ACOSTA S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Ryan walks through the scene.  It s clear that the people 
      here know him, and as he passes, everyone -- from children to 
      cholos -- respond with smiles and something more.

      Respect.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (OS)
                    Ryan...

      Ryan turns to find an incredibly sultry Latina woman, SILVIA 
      (28), standing there.

                                  RYAN
                    Sil.                                                                                    18.


      For a moment, the two simply stand there, looking at one 
      another.  There s an undeniable CHEMISTRY...

      But just as Ryan is going to say something further, they re 
      interrupted as Dante comes up and puts an arm around her.  
      Gives her a kiss.

                                  DANTE
                    Hey, babe.
                          (to Ryan)
                    I ll go tell Dad you re here.

      And Dante moves off, leaving Ryan and Silvia alone again.  
      There s a beat between them, before someone calls her from 
      O.S. breaking the moment.

                                  SILVIA
                    It s good to see you.

      And Silvia walks away.  Ryan watches her for a moment before 
      moving on...

      ...failing to notice Silvia in the b.g., subtly turning back 
      to watch him go.


      INT. ACOSTA S HOUSE - LIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

      Ryan continues on through the party, absorbing the 
      moment...until a sight stops him in his tracks.  

      Ahead, drinking and laughing with a bunch of hot girls, 
      stands Tanner's killer TORRES.  

      Ryan clenches his teeth and turns to ignore him.  Until --

                                  TORRES
                    Hey, Officer.  Fun time the other 
                    night.  We have to do that again 
                    real soon.

      It's the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Without 
      warning, Ryan storms at Torres.  Shoves partiers out of the 
      way to reach him --

      But he s too late as Ryan gets off one good, satisfying PUNCH 
      before everyone reacts and jumps between them. 

      The two snarl at each other as people pulls them apart.

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    You just made the biggest mistake 
                    of your life.

                                  RYAN
                    You made yours last night.                                                                                    19.


                                  TORRES
                    You re nothing!  You forgot who you 
                    are, you cop loving bitch!

      Everything is about to go Def Con 5 -- until a commanding 
      voice cuts through the chaos.

                                  ACOSTA
                    STOP THIS.

      JAVIER ACOSTA (50; a natural leader of men) stands at the top 
      of the stairs, like a displeased god looking down on the 
        wretchedness of mankind.  His eyes find Ryan.  Bore into him.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    In my office.  Now.

      Ryan shrugs off the men holding him and storms into -


      INT. ACOSTA S OFFICE - NIGHT

      As Ryan waits in Acosta's office, he looks around at the 
      FAMILY PHOTOS that dominate every surface.  There are even 
      photos of Ryan and Dante as young boys.  In every photo, 
      Acosta is a man with an easy laugh, and an easier smile who 
      is beloved by his wife, his children and his community.  
      Awards on the wall proclaim him to be a successful 
        businessman; a valued member recognized by the city's Better 
      Business Bureau for his chain of local supermarkets and 
      restaurants that have stayed in the neighborhood despite 
      economic troubles.  

      Ryan finally notes TWO NASTY GOUGES in the plaster on the 
      wall and we --

                                                                    FLASHBACK TO:


      INT. ACOSTA S OFFICE - TWENTY YEARS AGO - (FLASHBACK)

      Ryan and Dante are kids roughhousing in the same room.  
      They re being wild and having fun -- when Dante accidentally 
      topples over in a chair and the sharp armrest carves the 
      FIRST GOUGE in the wall as it falls.  

      The world stops as the two boys look at the jagged scar raked 
      in the plaster.

                                  DANTE
                    Oh no...

      And just then -- SFX:  FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer.

      A moment later, the door opens and Dante s father, Javier, 
      enters.  He looks at the ghost-white boys...then sees the 
      gouge.  His face instantly darkens.                                                                                    20.


                                  ACOSTA
                    Who did this?!

      The boys look to one another, but neither answers.  

      Javier focuses his rage at Ryan, raising a threatening hand.  

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    You will tell me.  Which one of you 
                    did this?

      But even under the threat of violence, Ryan says nothing.  
      And right as he's expecting the shock of a slap from Javier, 
      what comes surprises him.

      A look of pride.  

      Javier ruffles the boys  hair.  

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    Very good.

      Javier smiles -- and KICKS A SECOND, LARGER GOUGE into the 
      wall.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    Walls you can replace.  Things, you 
                    can repair.  All it takes is money.
                          (meets their eyes)
                    But family...  Trust...  If you 
                    squeal on one another, nothing ever 
                    fixes that.

      Javier leans down, fatherly.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    I m proud of you, Ryan.

      And Ryan's name takes us SMASHING BACK TO --


      INT. ACOSTA S OFFICE - PRESENT/CONTINUOUS

      -- as Javier enters.  Dante is about to follow him in, but 
      Javier turns.

                                  ACOSTA
                    Why don t you wait downstairs.

      For the briefest moment, a look flashes across Dante's face - 
      hurt, jealousy - before he replaces it with practiced 
      stoicism and does as he is told.

                                  DANTE
                    Sure.

      Javier closes the door.                                                                                    21.


                                  RYAN
                    Isn t it risky bringing me to your 
                    house?

                                  ACOSTA
                    I m assuming if I was under 
                      surveillance, you d know and 
                    wouldn t have come.
                          (then, re: his gunshot)
                    How are you?  Are you alright?

                                  RYAN
                    I m still standing.

      Javier smiles and embraces Ryan like a father.  

                                  ACOSTA
                    It s good to see you.  It s been 
                    too long since you ve been home.

      Javier sits and looks to Ryan, genuinely sympathetic.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry about your friend.  He 
                    was a good man.  It s a terrible 
                    thing that s happened, and we re 
                    gonna do our part to make this 
                    right.  I ll make sure his widow 
                    and his family are taken care of.  
                    They ll never have to worry about 
                    money ever again.
                          (beat)
                    But I want you to know that you did 
                    the right thing.  You thought big 
                    picture and held off your personal 
                    anger for the sake of the Family.  
                    It takes quite a man to do that.

                                  RYAN
                    Torres has to pay for what he did.

      Acosta shakes his head.

                                  ACOSTA
                    I ve spoken to Torres, and he s 
                    going to stay out of the way from 
                    now on.
                          (meets Ryan s eyes)
                    But Torres is off-limits from any 
                      retaliation. 

                                  RYAN
                    That s bullshit --

                                  ACOSTA
                    No, it s business.  His father 
                    controls our pipeline of fishscale.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    22.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    I lose him, I lose territory, and 
                    the Family can t afford that right 
                    now.

                                  RYAN
                    What the hell was he doing there, 
                    anyway?

                                  ACOSTA
                    His job.  Torres got wind of the 
                    deal going down between the Lords 
                    and the Colombians and went to bust 
                    it up.  

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, well he enjoys his job a 
                    little too much.  He butchered 
                    those Lord soldiers.

                                  ACOSTA
                    And as distasteful as that is, 
                    what s worse is that the Colombians 
                    got away with the shipment.  Those 
                    drugs are still in play and the 
                    Lords are going to make another 
                    attempt at a trade.  If they get 
                    that shipment, it makes them 
                    stronger and we re gonna have a war 
                    on our hands. What happened to 
                    Tanner will become a footnote 
                    compared to the violence that will 
                    follow, and I don t think either of 
                    us wants to see any more innocent 
                    blood running in the streets.
                          (beat)
                    We have to do whatever it takes to 
                    stop this deal, Ryan.  I need to 
                    know when this trade is going down.  
                    I need to know where.  We need to 
                    end this. 

      Ryan doesn t like the sound of any of this, and is still 
      steaming when Acosta reaches into his desk and sets two 
      BRICKS OF MONEY, each four inches thick, before Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    What s that for?

                                  ACOSTA
                    Help cover your medical costs.  I 
                    know the budget cuts have hit your 
                      department very hard.

                                  RYAN
                    You don t have to do that.                                                                                    23.


                                  ACOSTA
                          (meets his eyes)
                    You re like a son to me.  We re 
                    family.  We take care of our own.

      Acosta pats him on the back.  Ryan looks at him.  At the 
      father figure he s strived to make proud his entire life...

      And eventually, he sighs and takes the money.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      INT. RYAN S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Ryan's at home, sitting in a chair, contemplating the BRICK 
      OF MONEY Acosta gave him, all that it represents, when --

      SFX:  THERE S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

      Quickly, Ryan lifts a board in the floor to reveal his SECRET 
      CACHE.  In the quick glimpse we get of it, we see it s filled 
      with other bricks of money, burner cellphones and an 
      assortment of firearms -- evidence of his double life.  

      Ryan tosses the money Acosta gave him in with the rest, 
      slides the floorboard back in place and opens the door to 
      find --

      INTERNAL AFFAIRS LIEUTENANT JESSICA SHAW standing there.  Her 
      eyes narrow dangerously.  

                                    JESSICA
                    Wanna tell me where you ve been?

      For a heart-stopping moment, we think Ryan is about to be 
      busted...

      But then he pulls her inside and kisses her.  Instantly, her 
      demeanor softens.  

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    I m so sorry about your frie--

      But he silences her with a kiss.  And as they devour one 
      another passionately, and clothes begin to come off --


                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    24.





                                            ACT III


      INT. RYAN S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Ryan and Jessica, post-coitus.  They lay there in the 
      moonlight, peaceful.  Her fingers gently tracing the area 
      around his gunshot wound.

      After a moment, she sighs and gets up.  Moves to the dresser 
      and begins to put her clothes on.

                                    JESSICA
                    I wish we didn t have to sneak 
                    around like this.

      Ryan cuts her a look.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    What s the worst that could happen?

                                  RYAN
                    If people find out I m sleeping 
                    with an I.A. Investigator, who also 
                    happens to be my boss s daughter, I 
                    could think of a couple things...

                                    JESSICA
                          (flirty)
                    Well, on the plus side, if we both 
                    lose our jobs, we could spend more 
                    time in bed together.

                                  RYAN
                    That wouldn t be the worst thing in 
                    the world.  
                          (reaches for her)
                    Come here.

      But Jessica doesn t respond.  Just stands there, her back to 
      Ryan.  Frozen by something she s seen on the dresser.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Jess..?

      Now she turns -- and reveals a gun in her hand.  Ryan s Colt.  
      She holds it, icy.  Her entire demeanor changed. 

                                    JESSICA
                    He gave this to you, didn t he?

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, but --                                                                                    25.


                                    JESSICA
                     Colt 1911.  Best service piece 
                    ever made.  Blah, blah, blah...   
                    I ve heard the speech.
                          (softening)
                    Listen, I get it.  He s 
                      charismatic.  He draws you in.  But 
                    you can t trust him.  The things 
                    he s done to my family, to this 
                      Department...
                          (shakes her head)
                    You have a bright future ahead of 
                    you, Ryan.  But only if you don t 
                    get too close.  Believe me, I ve 
                    seen plenty of bright careers get 
                    snuffed out because of decisions 
                    he s made.

      As she exits, she casts one final glance at Ryan.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Don t be one of them.

      And then she s gone.

                                                                          FADE TO:


      EXT. MOUNTAIN VIEW CEMETERY - THE NEXT MORNING

      A beautiful hillside cemetery with panoramic views of the 
      Bay.

      A full, military-style police funeral for Tanner is underway.  
      The entire Department has turned out to honor the fallen.  
      It's a somber ceremony; a moment for every cop to reflect.

      In an emotional scene, Ryan presents the flag to Tanner's 
      WIDOW.  As he does so, PAN ACROSS the faces of the Gang Task 
      Force.  Chapel.  Vee.  Cassius.  The sadness in everyone's 
      eyes is palpable. 

      Except for Tae, who stares intently at Ryan with something 
      more akin to suspicion...

      PRELAP:  PARTY MUSIC and --

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      INT. POLICE BAR - LATER

      -- a wake held in Tanner's honor, cop style.  The room is 
      filled with drunken Law Enforcement Officers.                                                                                    26.


                                  RYAN
                    Tanner was never one for 
                      speeches...unless he was the one 
                    making them.  If he were here, he d 
                    tell me to shut the hell up and 
                    drink.
                          (raises his glass)
                    So let s drink.

      And everyone does.  Ryan wanders through the crowds.  Sees an 
      open seat, plops down in it, drink in hand.  But as he takes 
      a sip --

      Ryan looks up to see Tae sitting a few seats away, studying 
      him coolly.  After a moment, he speaks.

                                  TAE
                    You know, when I was in Quantico, I 
                    had this one course.  A whole 
                    semester on Officer Involved 
                      Shootings.  You look for patterns, 
                    what could be done differently, 
                    better.  And almost to a fault, in 
                    every incident, for every single 
                    shot the suspect would fire off, 
                    the cops returned five.  I remember 
                    coming to incidents and seeing 
                    brass casings everywhere.  It s 
                    shocking when you see how many. 
                    Sometimes you d get hundreds in a 
                    single incident...
                          (pointedly)
                    ...and yet you didn t even return 
                    one.

                                  RYAN
                    What are you trying to say?

                                  TAE
                    Nothing.  Just making observations.

      Without taking his eyes off Tae, Ryan rises.  Walks to stand 
      before him.  Stares dangerously into his eyes...then pounds 
      his drink and SLAMS the glass down on the table in front of 
      Tae like Tanner and he used to do.

                                  RYAN
                    He was my best friend.  You have no 
                    idea what you re talking about.

      And without another word, Ryan walks away.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    27.


      INT. THE BRIG - SQUAD ROOM - DAYS LATER

      Cassius enters in sweats.  He wanders around, but not finding 
      what he s looking for, he turns to a detective on the phone.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Where s Ryan?

      The detective points to the back -- where we find Ryan 
      working at a computer.

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    Dude, it s our day off.  What s 
                    going on?

                                  RYAN
                    I ve been on the phone with 
                    forensics about the bodies in the 
                      warehouse.  They found a few vials 
                    of coke on  em when they searched 
                    them.  

                                    CASSIUS
                    Vials?

                                  RYAN
                    Of Fishscale.  A sampler set.  The 
                    full shipment was never there.  The 
                    meet was to sample product and 
                    agree to terms.  And check this:

      Ryan holds up an EMERGENCY ADVISE SHEET from the DEA.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    DEA s been tracking a heavy narco 
                    shipment sitting south of the 
                    border, but this morning it s gone.  
                    They lost it.  Think it slipped 
                    through.  It s the shipment, man.  
                    And it s heading our way.  

                                    CASSIUS
                    So what s it mean?

                                  RYAN
                    That we got a clock.  And that we 
                    have to go shake some trees in 
                    Oakland to figure out when it s 
                    coming and where.

      Cassius stares at him, stone-faced.

                                    CASSIUS
                    But it s our day off.

                                  RYAN
                    Come on, man.  I need you.                                                                                    28.


      And as Cassius sighs, CUT TO:


      INT. CASSIUS S CAR - DRIVING THROUGH OAKLAND - DAY

      Cassius and Ryan cruise into Cassius's old hood in his sweet 
      '83 Monte Carlo SS, Cassius crooning all the while to Al 
      Green's  Let's Stay Together  grooving from the stereo.  

                                    CASSIUS
                    ...Ooh, baby, let s, let s stay 
                    together.  Loving you whether, 
                    whether, times are good or bad, 
                    happy or sad...
                          (beat)
                    Man, why can t anyone do music like 
                    that anymore?

                                  RYAN
                    Same reason no one makes bell 
                    bottoms.   Cause no one buys  em.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Do you want me to kick you out in 
                    the middle of the hood?  Seriously?

      As they continue on, people on the street wave and call out 
      Cassius s name.

                                  RYAN
                          (re: the neighborhood)
                    Old haunt?

                                    CASSIUS
                    It s where I grew up.  Used to be 
                    this cool little soul food place on 
                    that corner there when I was like 
                    fifteen, sixteen.

                                  RYAN
                    Taste as good as home?

                                    CASSIUS
                          (scoffs)
                    Home?  My mom s idea of cooking a 
                    family meal was opening a box of 
                    Captain Crunch.  And for the 
                    record, I hate collared greens, but 
                    there was this girl with the most 
                    insane body that worked the 
                      afternoons. 
                          (wistfully)
                    Alisha...  I d go in there and 
                    order up plates of that shit just 
                    to keep her coming to the table.  I 
                    had it bad for that girl.                                                                                    29.


                                  RYAN
                    You guys ever hook up?

                                    CASSIUS
                    I was working up my courage.
                          (beat)
                    But I waited too long.  One night, 
                    place gets robbed.  She got shot.  
                    Took her out.  Such a waste.
                          (then)
                    It s why I became a cop.

                                  RYAN
                    To find the guys who did it?

                                    CASSIUS
                    No.   Cause of everyone s reaction.  
                    People she served every day for a 
                    year, know what they said?   Huh .  
                    That s how normal death was in East 
                    Bay, like I was talking about the 
                    weather.  Didn t matter if it was a 
                    neighbor, your brother or your best 
                    friend; that was the sum of a 
                    person s entire life.   Huh .
                          (beat)
                    Kids shouldn t grow up in a world 
                    where if their best friend gets 
                    shot, they re not even surprised 
                    anymore.  That was my crossroads.

                                  RYAN
                    Rest in peace, Alisha.

                                    CASSIUS
                    To hell with rest.  I hope she s 
                    shaking that incredible booty in 
                    Heaven.

      Just then, Cassius points to something out the window.  

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    Oakland GPS.

      Ryan follows his gaze to a particular bit of GRAFFITI.  The 
      words -- 

                                      THE HOOD, BITCH!

      -- spray painted on the wall of an abandoned apartment 
      building, followed by an ARROW that runs the length of the 
      block.  As they cruise along, Ryan's eyes follow the arrow, 
      until they round the corner and finally see the arrow's 
        head...along with FIFTY DUDES hanging out on the sidewalk.  

      Cassius smiles.                                                                                    30.

                    Home, sweet home.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. TELEGRAPH AVENUE - KOREATOWN - ESTABLISHING - SAME TIME

      San Francisco s  Korean business district.  A city council 
      sign proudly proclaims: 

                      KOREATOWN.  THE SOUTH BAY S GOT SEOUL!


      INT. TAE S CAR - KOREATOWN - DAY

      As it pulls up before a Korean massage parlor.  Vee looks at 
      him, askance.

                                  VEE
                    Really?

                                  TAE
                    Those Lords were murdered in 
                      Koreatown.  If anyone is gonna know 
                    anything, it ll be here.  We find 
                    the shooter, we find the shipment.

      But Vee is dubious.

                                  VEE
                    Is that really all this is about?

                                  TAE
                    Look, I just want to take down the 
                    bad guys --
                          (as he exits the car)
                    -- whoever they may be.


      INT. KOREAN MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

      Tae and Vee enter and march through the building.  As they 
      blow through the back, an AGING MAMASAN chases them.

                                  AGING MAMASAN (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    Hey!  You can t go in there!

                                  TAE (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                          (waving her off)
                    It s okay, big sister.

      And he and Vee head down a set of stairs into a --                                                                                    31.


      KOREAN FAN-TAN (GAMBLING DEN)

      Tae and Vee enter an underground gambling hall.  The 
      deafening clacking of tiles and shuffling of cards stops dead 
      as every head in the place swivels to look at them as they 
      enter.

                                  VEE
                    Uh...  Hi.

                                  TAE
                    Come on.

      As gambling resumes, they move through the room until they 
      find the ELDER BOSS of the DOKEBBI gang. 

                                  ELDER BOSS (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    Ladies aren t allowed.  You know 
                    better.

                                  TAE (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    You re right, I do.  She s no lady.

                                  VEE
                    What s he saying?

                                  TAE
                    Nothing.  Just old man stuff.

      Tae turns back to the Boss.

                                  TAE (SUBTITLED KOREAN) (CONT D)
                    I want to talk to you about the 
                    police officer who got killed in 
                    Koreatown --

      But the old man waves him off.

                                  ELDER BOSS (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    Go away.  

                                  TAE (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    Look, if anything happens down 
                    here, I know you know about it.  
                    These are your streets.  Someone 
                    knows something, you know who it 
                    is.  Just point me in the right 
                      direction.

                                  ELDER BOSS (SUBTITLED KOREAN)
                    This is a place for gambling, not 
                      interrogations.

      So Tae sits in the chair opposite.

                                  TAE
                    Then I guess you should deal the 
                    cards.                                                                                    32.


      The Elder Boss raises an eyebrow.  

                                  ELDER BOSS
                    It s twenty thousand dollars a 
                    hand.

                                  TAE
                          (undaunted)
                    Put it on my tab.

                                  VEE
                    What?!

      Impressed, the Boss smiles and deals out the colorful cards 
      for a game called Hwatu.

                                                                NOW CUT BACK TO:


      EXT. OAKLAND GANG NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME TIME

      Cassius and Ryan walk the street.  As they near, people 
      disappear into buildings, wanting nothing to do with the 
      cops.  SPOTTERS start shouting up the street.

                                  SPOTTERS
                    Two-five!  Two-five!

      Ryan turns to Cassius.

                                  RYAN
                    Guess we ve been announced.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Yeah.

                                  RYAN
                    What s two-five?

                                    CASSIUS
                    Half of 5-0.  Half a cop.  They re 
                    just messin  with you.

                                  RYAN
                    How do you know they re not just 
                    messing with you?

      Just then, Cassius spies the informant he's looking for -- a 
      300 lb. blob of a man named PEE WEE.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    That s Pee Wee?

      When Pee Wee sees them coming, he looks like he's going to 
      run.  Cassius breaks out laughing.                                                                                      33.


                                    CASSIUS
                    Aw, c mon, man.  Now that s just 
                    sad.  Even you know you don t got a 
                    block in you.  

                                  PEE WEE
                    I can run!

                                    CASSIUS
                    You run, you re gonna set off every 
                    car alarm in the neighborhood.
                    Look at you.  Even your clothes 
                    have stretch marks.  Now just come 
                    over here and talk to us.  Don t 
                    make me harpoon your ass.

      Pee Wee hesitates...but ultimately he turns and waddles over.

                                  PEE WEE
                    Why you gotta be so mean, yo?

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:


      INT. GAMBLING DEN - SAME TIME

      Tae and the Elder are finishing their game.  It s a big hand.  
      Lots of money on the table, it can go either way.  

      But Tae s the one who wins.  You see the frustration on the 
      Boss s face -- he doesn t part with money easily.  

                                  ELDER BOSS
                    You win.

      He starts to push the money across the table...but Tae stops 
      him.  Pushes it back.

                                  TAE
                    Keep it.  Just tell me who to talk 
                    to.

      And as the Boss considers --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. PEE WEE S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

      Cassius is talking with Pee Wee while, in the b.g., Ryan is 
      walking around...poking through things...

                                  PEE WEE
                    I told you, dawg!  I don t know 
                    nothin !
                          (nervously eyes Ryan)
                    What are you doing, man?                                                                                    34.


                                    CASSIUS
                    Don t talk to him.  Look at me.  
                    You and I are having the 
                      conversation.  Or am I boring you?

                                  PEE WEE
                    No, man, it s just --

                                  RYAN
                    Oh my...

      Cassius and Pee Wee look over -- to where Ryan has found a 
      box of magazines.  Ryan holds one up.  On the cover, a larger 
      and smaller man are locked in an embrace.  The title:  BEARS 
      AND CUBS.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Now I know you ain t the cub.

      Cassius shakes his head.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Oh, Marquece...  What would your 
                    boys say?  Kinda messes with your 
                    street cred, don t it?

                                  PEE WEE
                    Gimme that!

      As Pee Wee struggles to his feet, Cassius calls out to Ryan 
      theatrically.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Run, man!  It s a bear attack!

                                  RYAN
                    Run?  Aren t I supposed play dead?

                                    CASSIUS
                    Nah, man.  That s just with 
                      grizzlies.  Black bears you re 
                    supposed to run for your life.

                                  RYAN
                    I can never remember that.

                                  PEE WEE
                          (annoyed)
                    That s my cousin s.  It ain t mine.

      Ryan flips it over and reads the address label.

                                  RYAN
                    Marquece King.  351 Filbert Street, 
                    Oakland, California.

      Pee Wee snatches the magazine back.                                                                                    35.

                    What do you want?

                                    CASSIUS
                    I told you.  The Fish deal.

      Pee Wee sighs, exasperated.  Comes to a decision.

                                  PEE WEE
                    It s going down sometime in the 
                    next 48 hours.  

                                  RYAN
                    Where?

                                  PEE WEE
                    I don t know.  I swear, I don t.  
                    But I d leave it alone, Cassius.  
                    The Lords are stirred up.  Last few 
                    days, I been seeing enforcers from 
                    other sets drifting into town, 
                    looking to find whoever killed 
                    their boys.  They re out for blood.

      Ryan and Cassius look to one another and nod -- they got what 
      they needed.  As they start to move out:

                                  PEE WEE (CONT D)
                    You never saw this shit.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Whatever you say, man.

      Ryan pats the magazine Pee Wee holds as he passes.

                                  RYAN
                          (can t resist)
                    Happy hunting.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. KARAOKE BAR - KOREATOWN - DAY

      Tae and Vee sit at the bar, watching their quarry -- the 
      Korean tagger (YONG) from the warehouse where Tanner was 
      killed.  He is belting out an off-key but earnest Korean 
      rendition of Creep by Radiohead.  When he s done, Tae rises --

                                  TAE
                    Here we go.

      -- but Vee stops him. 

                                  VEE
                    I got this one.                                                                                    36.


                                  TAE
                    You sure?

      Vee's answer is to shrug off her jacket, undo a couple 
      buttons on her blouse and shake her hair so that it drapes 
      wild around her shoulders.  

                                  VEE
                    You tell me.

      She looks hot as hell.  Tae gives her an appreciative gaze, 
      then sits back down.  Sips his drink as Vee walks across the 
      room and makes contact with Yong.  Flirts with him.  Whispers 
      in his ear.  Though we don t hear the words, we get the idea, 
      and after a moment, Yong smiles, gets up and leads Vee past a 
      HULKING BODYGUARD into:


      A PRIVATE ROOM IN THE BACK - CONTINUOUS

      When the door closes behind them, Yong indicates a HUGE BAG 
      OF ECSTACY on the table as he starts to take off his shirt.

                                  YONG
                    X.  Take whatever you want.

      Vee moves toward Yong, who opens his mouth for a kiss - and 
      is completely surprised when she SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND.

                                  YONG (CONT D)
                    What the --?!

      By way of explanation, Vee pulls out her badge.

                                  VEE
                    Cop was shot three days ago.  I 
                    heard you recognized the shooter 
                    then ran off like a little bitch. 
                    And now you re going to give me his 
                    name.

                                  YONG
                    Or what?

      But this isn't Yong's first rodeo.  He isn't scared of cops.   
      So Vee pulls out her STUN GUN and sets it against his crotch.

                                  VEE
                    Or we go gangnam style.

      Yong looks at her, smug.  

                                  YONG
                    You can t do squat to me, cop.                                                                                    37.


                                  VEE
                    No?  Then let me ask you this:  if 
                    a tree falls in the woods and no 
                    one s there to hear it, does it 
                    make a sound?

      And then she ZAPS him. 

      Yong screams, his body flopping like a fish on a dock, and we 
      MATCH TO:


      INT. KARAOKE BAR - MAIN ROOM - SAME TIME

      -- where the Hulking Bodyguard hears RHYTHMIC POUNDING 
      against the wall that he mistakes for energetic fucking.  

      Tae cuts him a look about the noise.

                                  TAE
                    Pretty enthusiastic, those two, 
                    huh?

      Tae sips his drink and the noises continue for a few moments 
      longer...until eventually Vee emerges, adjusting her hair.

                                  VEE
                          (re: Yong)
                    He s gonna need a few minutes.

      As they walk away, Tae cuts a look at Vee.  

                                  TAE
                    Anything?

                                  VEE
                    Hell yeah.
                          (vicious little grin)
                    I got the shooter s name.


                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    38.





                                          ACT FOUR


      EXT. HACIENDA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DAY

      A colorful family restaurant/Acosta shell corporation in the 
      Latin Quarter...


      INT. HACIENDA - DAY

      Ryan walks through the restaurant and enters the kitchen, 
      where he finds Acosta's older, right-hand man, TIO GORDO 
      ( Uncle Fatty ) cooking up some homemade pork tamales.

                                  TIO GORDO
                    There he is!

                                  RYAN
                    Tio.

      The lovable guy hugs Ryan when he sees him.

                                  TIO GORDO
                    Look, I made your favorite.  Pork 
                    and chicken.
                          (holds them up)
                      I slow-cooked it all night.

      Ryan takes one.  Takes a bite.

                                  RYAN
                    Man, I miss these.

                                  TIO GORDO
                    You won t have to for long.  A guy 
                    at the Whole Foods down the street 
                    asked if he could start selling 
                    them in the fresh foods counter.  
                    Tio Gordo s tamales.  Catchy, 
                    right?

                                  RYAN
                    Not really.

                                  TIO GORDO
                    Wiseass.

      They both smile.

      Just then, Javier, Dante and a couple other soldados enter.

                                  ACOSTA
                    Ryan, I m glad you re here.                                                                                    39.


                                  RYAN
                    I ve got news on the shipment --

      But Acosta stops him.

                                  ACOSTA
                    You know the rules.  No business 
                    before lunch.  Sit down.  Eat.

      They all sit down at a tiny table in the back and dig in.  
      And for the first time, we get a glimpse into this group when 
      there's no tension.

                                  DANTE
                    Has Tio told you about his tamale 
                    deal?

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah.  I can see the product 
                      description now:   Made with love 
                    and care...by the guy who shanked 
                    four peckerwoods in prison. 

                                  TIO GORDO
                          (shrugs)
                    Who hasn t had an exuberant youth?

                                  ACOSTA
                    I can t believe that after 
                      everything this family has 
                      accomplished, all anyone will 
                    remember is you and your fake-ass 
                    smile on a tamale wrapper.

      Everyone laughs and we DISSOLVE TO:


      SAME SHOT - A BIT LATER

      Lunch is over and Tio is clearing the dishes.  

                                  ACOSTA
                    That was delicious, Tio.  Thank 
                    you.

      And with that, the time for business has come.  Javier turns 
      to Ryan.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    First things first.  Word is 
                    someone from your Task Force is 
                    sniffing around asking about 
                    Torres.

                                  RYAN
                          (nods)
                    I ll see what I can do.                                                                                    40.


                                  ACOSTA
                    No.  I need you to kill it.  We 
                    can t afford to let Chapel anywhere 
                    near Torres.  He s a smart guy and 
                    he makes connections.  I ve seen it 
                    too many times.  Don t 
                      underestimate him. 

                                  RYAN
                    I won t.

      Satisfied Ryan understands the gravity of the situation, 
      Acosta moves onto other subjects.

                                  ACOSTA
                    Now tell me about the deal.

                                  RYAN
                    They re trading the Fishscale 
                    sometime in the next two days.  DEA 
                    thinks the shipment is coming 
                    through the port.

      One of the soldados speaks up.

                                    SOLDADO
                    Unless you ve got any idea which 
                      container, we ve got over a quarter 
                    million of  em to search coming 
                    into that port every day.  It 
                    doesn t really help us --  

                                  DANTE
                    Actually, it does.  My crew threw 
                    up taps on the Lords  cell network.  
                    If we know the port and roughly 
                    when it s coming, then we ll hear 
                    it and we can catch  em. 

      Acosta indicates the soldado.

                                  ACOSTA
                    Old school.

      Then looks proudly to his son.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    New school.  Good work, Dante.
                          (then to soldado)
                    You, get a better attitude.  Now 
                    go, we all have work to do.

      They all leave, except for Ryan who lingers at the table a 
      moment longer.  Acosta notices.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT D)
                    You miss this, don t you?                                                                                    41.


                                  RYAN
                    Every day.

      Acosta nods.  Sits across from him.

                                  ACOSTA
                    It weighs on me, too.  But you re 
                    the only one who can pull this off.  
                    Most of my men wouldn t last a day 
                    on the Force -- you ve thrived 
                    there for five years.  Do you know 
                    why?  You re special, Ryan.  I ve 
                    known it from the moment you first 
                    walked into this house as a child.   
                    It was a hard decision letting you 
                    go under... you re like my own 
                    flesh and blood.  But I need you 
                    there.  It s the most important 
                    thing we ve ever done.  
                          (puts a hand on his 
                            shoulder)
                    And it s not going to be forever.

                                  RYAN
                    I know.

                                  ACOSTA
                    One of these days, you re going to 
                    come back to the family, and you ll 
                    take your rightful place by my 
                    side.
                          (beat)
                    Dante may be my son... but you re 
                    the heir.  
                          (meets his eyes)
                    I have big plans for you, Ryan.

      It s a powerful moment --

      That s interrupted as Ryan s phone goes off.  It s a text 
      message from Cassius that reads: 

                        Get to the Brig.  Shit s going down.

      Ryan rises.

                                  RYAN
                    I gotta run.

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      EXT. THE BRIG - MOTOR POOL - DAY

      Ryan pulls up to a maelstrom of activity.  The entire Task 
      Force is clad in tactical gear and racing into a SWAT VAN.                                                                                    42.


                                    CASSIUS (OS)
                    Hey --

      Ryan turns as Cassius runs up, tosses him a Kevlar vest.  
      Grabs him.  Guides him to the van.

                                  RYAN
                    What s going on?

      Just then, Chapel steps up.

                                  CHAPEL
                    We got the name of our shooter.  
                    Miguel Torres.  Works with the 
                    Familia and he s a Two Striker.  I 
                    want that gun he shot Tanner with --
                          (looks at all his guys)
                    -- but I ll settle for anything.  
                    Whatever gets this guy off the 
                    street.

      Nearby, Vee takes particular note of this statement.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Let s go take him down.

      And as the van door slams closed on Ryan s shocked face, CUT 
      TO:


      INT. SWAT VAN - DRIVING - MINUTES LATER

      The team sits on the ready benches -- four to a side -- as 
      they fly through the streets.  Some check their gear.  Some 
      close their eyes for a moment of peace.

      Ryan subtly pulls out his cellphone.  Makes sure no one is 
      looking...and swaps out his SIM CARD for a burner one.

      Secretly, Ryan begins typing out a message to Dante:

                    911.  GTF IS ONTO TORRES.  GET HIM OUT.

      But as Ryan continues typing, at the far end of the van --

      TAE looks over and sees him surreptitiously messing with his 
      phone.  Suspicious, Tae quietly rises and starts walking 
      toward him

      RYAN doesn t see Tae getting closer...and closer.  He s 
      typing away with one hand --

      -- when Tae appears over his shoulder.

                                  TAE
                    What are you doing there, Ryan?                                                                                    43.


      Ryan looks up, surprised, as Tae reaches out and turns Ryan s 
      hand to reveal --

      -- a game of WORDS WITH FRIENDS he s got up.

                                  RYAN
                    I d let you play...but we re not 
                    really friends.

      Deflated, Tae walks back to his seat...and the moment his 
      back is turned, Ryan slips the SIM CARD into his vest pocket.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      DANTE - IN HIS WIRETAP STATION

      Headphones on, listening to his wiretap channels, his 
      cellphone sitting on the desk beside him.  

      Suddenly, his cellphone begins to CHIME, and we see Ryan s 
      text message pop up on its face...

      ...but because of the headphones, Dante doesn t hear the 
      alert.  And after a moment, the screen goes back to black.  

      And Ryan s message goes unnoticed.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. TORRES S APARTMENT COMPLEX - ESTABLISHING

      The SWAT VAN arrives and disgorges its occupants.  

      The Task Force moves through the apartment complex, zeroing 
      in on Torres's unit. 

      When everyone s stacked up outside his apartment, Chapel nods 
      and Tae quietly slips an envelope under the door, whispering:

                                  TAE
                      ...warrant...

      Then -- BOOOM!!!  They shatter the door with a RAM and storm 
      in.

      With practiced precision, the team splits off into two-man 
      teams, each taking a room.


      TRACK WITH RYAN AND CASSIUS

      as they move toward the rear of the apartment, kick open the 
      master bedroom door -- and spy Torres s just as he slips out 
      the open window!                                                                                    44.


                                    CASSIUS
                    FREEZE, MOTHERFU--!

      But Torres is gone.  

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                          (calling to the team)
                    HE S RUNNING!

                                  RYAN
                    Cassius --

      But Cassius bolts out the window after him.


      EXT. TORRES S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Torres has dropped to a lower roofline and is booking across 
      the rooftop.  Cassius drops after him, in hot pursuit, and 
      Ryan a heartbeat later.

      TORRES hauls ass across the rooftop, leaping vents and 
      ducking pipes, finally sprinting over a 2x10  PLANK laid from 
      ledge of this building to the next.

      When he s across, Torres turns and shoves the plank, sending 
      it toppling four stories to the asphalt below a heartbeat 
      before Cassius and Ryan pull up short at the ledge.

      Cassius is furious.  Ryan is secretly happy Torres is getting 
      away.  He puts a hand on Cassius s shoulder and starts to 
      lead him away --

                                  RYAN
                    Come on, we ll get him next time.

      -- when Cassius is overcome with rage.  And before Ryan can 
      stop him, Cassius books for the edge -- and LEAPS ACROSS to 
      continue the chase.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Goddamn it...

      Now Ryan is forced to follow in hopes of helping Torres slip 
      free.  Swallowing his fear, Ryan runs and makes the jump as 
      well.


      EXT. CITY STREETS - SAN FRANCISCO - CONTINUOUS

      Ryan and Cassius blast through a maze of alleyways, pursuing 
      Torres in a CRAZY FOOT CHASE FOR THE AGES.  

      Torres pulls out all the stops, racing through traffic and 
      vaulting across moving cars in a suicidal bid to escape.  

      When they reach a fork in the path, Ryan tries to point 
      Cassius in the wrong direction --                                                                                    45.


                                  RYAN
                    This way!

      -- but Cassius s instincts are solid and chooses the right 
      path.

                                    CASSIUS
                    No, here!

      Eventually they come to a SERIES OF ALLEYS where they need  
      to -- 

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    SPLIT UP!

      Ryan chooses the right direction and sees Torres ahead, 
      racing right into --

      -- a DEAD END ALLEY.

      Ryan pours on the steam, running after Torres.  When he 
      reaches him, he turns to get him the hell out of there --

                                  RYAN
                    Come on!  HURRY!!

      -- when Cassius rounds the corner a block away.  

      Instantly, Torres tries to run -- but Ryan grabs him and 
      TACKLES him to the ground.  Hard.

      As the two impact the ground --


      ECU - RYAN S VEST

      as his burner SIM CARD pops from his pocket and falls 
      unnoticed to the alley floor... 


      BACK TO SHOT

      Torres is enraged.  

                                  TORRES
                    Are you crazy?!  What are you 
                    doing?  You gotta let me go!!

      But seeing Cassius running closer, Ryan roughly cuffs Torres, 
      whispering in his ear:

                                  RYAN
                    It s too late.  We got two seconds.  
                    What s in the apartment?  What can 
                    they find on you?

                                  TORRES
                    Nothin !                                                                                    46.


                                  RYAN
                    Drugs?  Money?

                                  TORRES
                    No.  I m totally clean --

      Ryan s relieved.  Until:

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    -- except for the gun.

      Torres looks Ryan dead in the eye.

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    And if they find it and I go 
                      down...I m taking your sleeper ass 
                    with me.
                          (malicious little grin)
                    You got some decisions to make, 
                    moco.

      And as Ryan s world spins, Cassius arrives.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Good catch, brother.
                          (into his radio)
                    10-95.  Suspect in custody.

      And as Cassius yanks Torres to his feet, CUT TO:


      INT. TORRES S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      The Gang Task Force is ripping the place apart, looking for 
      anything incriminating, when Ryan enters.

      In a tense scene, Ryan stands there, heart pounding, eyes 
      scanning every surface, searching for the gun that will spell 
      his doom.

      And then he spies it.  A bit of HOLSTER WEBBING peeking out 
      from behind some books on a bookshelf -- right next to Tae 
      who is tossing stuff around.  And as Tae turns to the 
      bookshelf, Ryan has to do something right fucking now!

                                  RYAN
                    Find anything yet?

                                  TAE
                    Why?  You nervous?

                                  RYAN
                    No.  I m a cop.  And I want the guy 
                    who killed my partner.  What don t 
                    you understand about that?

      As Ryan talks, he walks forward, positioning himself between 
      Tae and the gun.                                                                                    47.


                                  TAE
                    Back off.

                                  RYAN
                    How about you tell me what your 
                    problem is?  What the hell are you 
                    so goddamn mad at?

      Ryan taps Tae in the chest for emphasis.

                                  TAE
                    Don t touch me.

                                  RYAN
                    You know everyone thinks Mr. FBI 
                      Super-Agent is pissed to have been 
                    pulled off his stellar career path 
                    to slum with us regular folk on our 
                    little Task Force.

      Ryan pokes him again.  Tae clenches his jaw.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    But you know what I think?  I think 
                    maybe the truth is you re pissed 
                    because you know weren t good 
                    enough.  That they didn t keep you 
                    and sent you here...cause they knew 
                    you couldn t cut it. 

      Ryan pokes him in the chest again -- and that s it.  Tae 
      snaps, shoving him back, and the fight is on.  Ryan throws a 
      punch and the two erupt into a SAVAGE FIGHT that sends them 
      both SMASHING INTO THE BOOKSHELF.  The two grapple on the 
      ground and Ryan cries out as Tae squeezes the shit out of his 
      wounded shoulder, causing it to bleed.

      The fight ends as Tae unleashes a brutal series of punches 
      that Ryan doesn't defend...but instead uses the moment to 
        surreptitiously scoop up Torres's gun and slip it into his 
      waistband.  

      That was his plan all along.

                                  CHAPEL
                          (rushing in)
                    What is this?!  Break it up!  BREAK 
                    IT UP!

      Eventually, Tae and Ryan are separated.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    What is wrong with you two?!  We 
                    save our fighting for the gangs, 
                    not each other!
                          (re: Ryan)
                    Get him out of here!                                                                                      48.


      But Ryan doesn t wait for an escort, shouldering his way 
      outside --


      EXT. TORRES S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      -- to where Torres is sitting in the squad car.

                                  RYAN
                    You re clean.

                                  TORRES
                    Then I guess your secrets are safe 
                    a little longer.

      But just then, Vee steps out of the apartment --

                                  VEE
                    Look what I found.

      -- and she holds up the HUGE BAG OF ECSTACY we saw in the 
      karaoke bar.  Vee shoots a vengeful little smile at Torres.

                                  VEE (CONT D)
                    May not be a murder charge...but 
                    Third Strike s a bitch.

      And as Vee heads back in, Torres glares menacingly at Ryan.

                                  TORRES
                    Guess I spoke too soon.


                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    49.





                                          ACT FIVE


      INT. THE BRIG - BULLPEN - DAY

      The team has returned.  Torres is being detained in a holding 
      cell in the basement.  Ryan paces nervously. 

      A moment later, the door to the holding cells buzzes and Vee 
      steps through.  

                                  VEE
                    Torres wants to cut a deal.  Says 
                    he ll give up something to drop the 
                    drug charges.

                                  RYAN
                    What s he offering?

                                  VEE
                    Don t know, but he says it s big.  
                    His lawyer will be here in ten 
                    minutes.  Guess we ll find out 
                    then.

      Ryan s world is reeling.  He steps away from the team and 
      pulls out his phone to warn Acosta.  But when he goes to 
      switch the SIM CARD -- it s no longer in his pocket.

      Ryan curses.  Frantically double-checks every place it could 
      be.  

      But it s gone.

      The clock s ticking down.  Ryan needs to make contact, so he 
      runs --


      EXT. BRIG - PARKING LOT

      -- to his car.  Throws open the glove box, reaches behind and 
      opens a SECRET COMPARTMENT that holds several BURNER SIM 
      CARDS.  Tears one out, slams it into his phone and dials.

      As the phone rings, MATCH CUT TO --


      DANTE - IN A GARAGE

      -- where he and ten other soldados are gearing up for war.  
      Dante is breaking heavy shotguns and full-auto street 
      sweepers out of lockers when his cellphone begins BUZZING.  
      He checks the number and picks up.                                                                                    50.

                    New SIM?


      INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN BRIG/DANTE IN GARAGE

                                  RYAN
                    I lost the other.  Burn it.  

                                  DANTE
                    Not good, brother. 

                                  RYAN
                    Forget it, we ve got bigger 
                    problems.

                                  DANTE
                    I know, I ve been trying to reach 
                    you.  We got a hit on the wire.  
                    The Lords and the Colombians are 
                    doing the Fishscale trade down at 
                    the old Transit Terminal on Mission 
                    an hour from now.  We ve scrambled 
                    a crew of hitters and we re going 
                    to break it up.  I need you to keep 
                    the cops in the dark as long as you 
                    can.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, well I kinda got my hands 
                    full.  Torres is in custody.

                                  DANTE
                    What?!
                          (then)
                    You gotta get him out of there --

                                  RYAN
                    I can t.

                                  DANTE
                    If he talks --

                                  RYAN
                    I know.

                                  DANTE
                    It ain t good enough to know.  You 
                    gotta do something about it.  
                    Whatever it takes.

      And Dante hangs up.  Ryan s world is quickly becoming a 
      whirlpool of shit.  Everything s spinning out of control.


      INT. BRIG - MOMENTS LATER

      As Ryan returns, Vee hangs up her phone.  Turns to Tae.                                                                                    51.


                                  VEE
                    Torres s lawyer is at the gate.  
                    Let s go get him.

      Ryan knows it s now or never.  So he chooses now.

      As Vee heads toward the parking lot, Ryan angles close...and 
      STEALS HER SECURITY BADGE as she passes.

      When no one s looking, he sneaks to the secure holding bloc 
      door and swipes Vee s card across the card reader.  Her name 
      flashes across the access screen and -- BZZZT! -- Ryan gains 
      access to:


      THE BRIG S HOLDING BLOC 

      Ryan sneaks his way down the back stairs and past other cops 
      in the holding bloc.  Stealthily opens the final door that 
      will lead him to Torres s cell -- 

      -- only to find Chapel standing on the other side, waiting 
      like an executioner at the block.

                                  CHAPEL
                    You know how I knew I d find you 
                    here?

      Ryan stands there, caught.  Chapel levels his gaze at him. 

                                  CHAPEL (CONT'D)
                    Because if that guy killed my 
                    partner, you bet your ass I d be 
                    down here, too.

      And Ryan can t believe his eyes as, amazingly, Chapel steps 
      aside.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    I left the arrest report open.  No 
                    telling how much he resisted when 
                    he came in.
                          (moving off)
                    Just keep it less than lethal.

      And as Chapel exits, Ryan stares after him in wonder... 

      And more importantly, admiration.

      When Chapel s gone, Ryan hurries forward, toward --


      INT. TORRES S HOLDING CELL - DAY

      Ryan enters the cell.  Torres is not happy to see him.                                                                                      52.


                                  TORRES
                    Your secret s about to get out, 
                    cop.

      But Ryan cuts him off by grabbing him by the throat and 
      SLAMMING him against the wall.

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    What are you going to do, murder me 
                    in my cell?  My lawyer s here in 
                    five minutes.  It s over for you, 
                    snitch.

      Ryan shakes his head.

                                  RYAN
                    Acosta will kill you if you give me 
                    up.

                                  TORRES
                    Screw Acosta.  And screw you.  You 
                    think I m going to spend life 
                    behind bars for some planted 
                    evidence and a bogus third strike?  
                    This is self-preservation.  I m 
                    gonna cut a deal.  But to do that, 
                    I m gonna have to give something 
                    up...
                          (grins)
                    ...and you re the best thing I ve 
                    got.

      And off Ryan s sinking look, CUT TO:


      EXT. BRIG - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

      As Torres's LAWYER arrives.  

                                  VEE
                    Mr. Rhymes?

      Tae and Vee greet him, and as they escort him through the 
      building toward Torres's cell, SMASH BACK TO:


      TORRES S CELL

      With time running out, Ryan turns to Torres.

                                  RYAN
                    What if I gave you something else?

                                  TORRES
                          (shrugs)
                    Doubt it will be good enough.                                                                                    53.


      INT. BRIG - BULLPEN - SAME TIME

      Tae, Vee and the Lawyer arrive at the door to the holding 
      bloc.  Vee reaches for her badge -- and finds it missing.

      Confused, she looks around --

                                  TAE
                    I got it.

      Tae swipes his own.  And as they begin heading down the 
      stairs, SLAM BACK TO:


      TORRES S CELL - SAME TIME

      Ryan looks Torres in the eyes.

                                  RYAN
                    It will be.

      And off Torres doubtful expression -- 


      INT. HOLDING BLOC - SECONDS LATER

      Tae, Vee and Rhymes round the corner to Torres s cell...

      ...and find him sitting in his cell.  Alone.

                                  TORRES
                    About frickin  time.

      What they don t find, however, (though the audience does) is 
      the stairwell door at the far end of the room slowly sliding 
      shut from where Ryan just barely made his escape...

      Torres looks to his Lawyer.

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    I think we have a deal to make.


      INT. BRIG - BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER

      The office is alive with activity.  But Ryan sits in the 
      middle of it all, utterly still.  As we PUSH IN, we see that 
      he s typed a text message into his cell...but his finger 
      hovers over the SEND button.  Tense.  Waiting.  Staring at 
      the holding area door...

      A moment later, the door buzzes and Chapel comes out.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Ryan!

      Ryan turns, uncertain what s going to happen next.                                                                                    54.


                                  CHAPEL (CONT'D)
                    Get the team together.  He gave us 
                    the Fishscale deal.  It s going 
                    down now.

        Immediately, Ryan breathes a sigh of relief and hits SEND and 
      we SMASH TO:


      AN ARMADA OF CARS - SPEEDING THROUGH THE STREETS

      Acosta s group heading to kill the fishscale deal.  Dante s 
      car is in the lead...


      INT. DANTE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Dante is driving when he receives the text from Ryan.  It 
      reads:

                              Pull back.  Deal s covered.

      Dante stares at the text, concerned.

                                  DANTE
                    I hope you know what you re doing.
                          (then into radio)
                    Turn it around.  We re pulling out.  

      And Dante cranks the wheel, forcing his car into a u-turn.  
      Behind him, the other follow suit and as they all head for 
      home, MATCH BACK TO --


      INT. BRIG - BULLPEN - SAME TIME

      Ryan gets a text confirmation from Dante -- 

                                            Copy.

      -- followed a moment later by a word of warning:

                              But watch the front door.

      Just then, Chapel shouts to the room.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Suit up!  We move out in five!


      INT. BRIG - LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The team gears up for the raid.  Ryan reaches his locker, 
      which is right next to Vee s, who s suiting up.  He eyes her.

                                  RYAN
                    You know.  It was pretty lucky we  
                    found those drugs in his apartment.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                  RYAN (CONT'D)
                      Especially considering the Familia 
                    makes it rule to not keep product 
                    in their homes.  
                          (pointedly)
                    And they don t deal X.

      Vee meets his eyes.  Ryan doesn t look away.  She knows what 
      he s insinuating.

                                  VEE
                          (defiant)
                    You have a problem with that?

      And Ryan earns her eternal trust when he says:

                                  RYAN
                    No.

                                                                          SLAM TO:


      EXT. ABANDONED TRANSIT TERMINAL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

        A long-abandoned terminal for transbay buses...

      Now PULL BACK TO REVEAL Ryan and the rest of the Gang Task 
      Force setting up outside the structure, while --


      INT. ABANDONED TRANSIT TERMINAL - SAME TIME

      The handoff is going down.  A contingent from the Oakland 
      Lords stand across from a group of heavies from the Colombian 
      Meta cartel.  

      The Colombian KINGPIN gestures, and his men bring forward a 
      CRATE and pop the lid to reveal WRAPPED KILOS OF FISHSCALE 
      COCAINE.  The Kingpin cuts one open to show how the 
      pearlescent brick SHINES and SHIMMERS.

                                  COLOMBIAN KINGPIN
                    Isn t that the prettiest fish 
                    you ve ever seen?  Now you show me 
                    the money.


      EXT. ABANDONED TRANSIT TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

      With backup from the S.F.P.D., the Gang Task Force readies to 
      move in on the handoff.

                                  CHAPEL
                    I want two stinger squads, six men 
                    apiece.  Simultaneous breech, front 
                    and back.  I ll lead Alpha through 
                    the front.

      And just then, Ryan remembers Dante s warning.  Speaks up.                                                                                    56.


                                  RYAN
                    Not the front.
                          (off Chapel s look)
                    Lords have been sending some of 
                    their guys through the military.  
                    They know to heavy-stack their 
                    softest entry points.  You ll be 
                    walking into a hailstorm.

      Chapel considers, then nods, trusting Ryan s instincts.

                                  CHAPEL
                    We ll breech from the side.  We 
                    move in five, strike in 30.  Go.

      And the teams move out.


      SERIES OF SHOTS - THE RAID - CONTINUOUS

      In perfect coordination, the Task Force moves in from the 
      side, and on cue -- KA-BOOOOM! -- effects entry.  Sweeps 
      through the building in a pincer formation, getting the drop 
      on the drug trade.

                                  TASK FORCE OFFICERS
                    POLICE DEPARTMENT!  GET DOWN!! 

      The Lords know enough to instantly give up, the Colombians 
      try to shoot their way out in a BRIEF BUT INTENSE GUNFIGHT.

      Cassius, Tae and Vee exchange fire with the enemy, each 
      taking out targets in individual hero moments...

      But the fight only comes to an end when Ryan makes a bold 
      move, dashing across a no man s land of gunfire to slide 
      under some construction equipment and take down the 
      Colombians  leader.  With Ryan's gun to the Kingpin s head --

                                  RYAN
                    It s over!

      -- the rest of the Colombians give up.

                                                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


      INT. ABANDONED TRANSIT TERMINAL - LATER

      After action...  The site is alive with detectives gathering 
      evidence for the eventual court case. 

      Off to the side, Tae, Vee, Cassius and Ryan watch.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Fishscale gets taken off the 
                    streets.  Colombian pipeline gets 
                    shut down.  Gang war gets averted.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                    CASSIUS (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    I d call that a win for the day.

      Just then, Chapel steps up.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Tae, Vee, good work on tracking 
                    down Torres.  He may have walked, 
                    but in the end we got something 
                    bigger because of you two.

      The praise goes a long way for the team.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Ryan, walk with me.

      He does, and together they walkt across the building --  

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Thought you should see this.

      -- and arrive at the building s front door, where they see 
      it s been RIGGED WITH EXPLOSIVES.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    If we had gone in through the 
                    front...

      Chapel doesn t finish the thought.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Good instincts, kid.  You re gonna 
                    fit in here just fine.

      And as Chapel claps Ryan on the back, the MUSIC RISES and we 
      launch into the:


      ENDING MONTAGE

      --  EXT. BRIG - PARKING LOT:  The day s work done, Tae, Vee, 
      Cassius and Ryan walk to their cars together.  More a team 
      now than ever before.  They say their goodbyes and as they 
      drive away, CUT TO:

      --  INT. RYAN'S CAR - NIGHT.  Ryan s driving when his phone 
      rings.  He picks up to hear Acosta s voice.  [NOTE:  THE 
      FOLLOWING DIALOGUE IS TO PLAY OVER THE REST OF THE ENTIRE 
      MONTAGE SEQUENCE.]

                                  ACOSTA
                    I wanted those drugs.  But more 
                    than anything I wanted them out of 
                    the Lords  hands.  You did that, 
                    and you got Torres clear.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    It wasn t exactly how I thought it 
                    would go down...but you improvised 
                    and looked like a hero to the 
                      Department in the bargain.  And 
                    that s good for all of us. 
                          (means this)
                    I m proud of you, Ryan.

      --  EXT. JESSICA'S HOME - NIGHT.  Ryan stands before the 
      door.  A moment later, Jess opens it.  Ryan isn't two steps 
      inside before they begin to kiss.  And as Ryan scoops her up 
      and carries her to the bedroom, DISSOLVE TO...

      --  EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT  An ECU shot of Ryan's 
      forgotten SIM CARD laying on the ground.  Then, a moment 
      later, a MYSTERIOUS HAND reaches in and picks it up.  And as 
      we're left wondering just who the hell found it, CUT TO:

      --  INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.  Jessica rolls over 
      in her sleep, reaching out for Ryan...but her arm settles on 
      empty sheets.  Ryan isn't there.  Where is he?  We find out 
      in the next scene, which is:

      --  INT. RYAN S CAR - LATE NIGHT.  Ryan is parked.  Staring 
      at something through the windshield, he picks up his 
      cellphone and dials.  MATCH CUT TO:

      --  PEE WEE S APARTMENT - SAME TIME.  As Pee Wee picks up his 
      ringing cellphone.  

                                  PEE WEE
                    Yo.


      INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/PEE WEE AT HOME

                                  RYAN
                    I think I found something your 
                    buddies are looking for.

      --  EXT. STRIP CLUB - MINUTES LATER.  Torres exits the club 
      and stumbles drunkenly to his car.  He fumbles with the keys 
      and gets in.  But as he goes to put the key into the 
      ignition, he NOTICES something sitting on his dashboard:  THE 
      DISTINCTIVE GUN TORRES KILLED TANNER WITH.

                                  TORRES
                    How the hell..?

      As he stares as the piece, unbeknownst to him, we NOTICE Pee 
      Wee and a half-dozen Lords materialize from the dark and 
      surround the car.

      After a moment, Torres looks up and sees that he s 
      surrounded.  And then in unison, the Lords sweep their 
      jackets open and draw an array of AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.                                                                                    59.


                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    Oh God no NO --

      Torres cries out in fear, but the Lords unload and -- 
        BRRRRAAAAAPPPPPPPP! -- the gunshots cut him off.  The 
      vengeful fusillade goes on and on, Torres s car and body 
      being obliterated by a thousand bullets.

      In the end, when all their magazines have been emptied, 
      Torres slumps dead.  And as the Lords melt back into the 
      shadows, PULL BACK across the street...

      ...to where Ryan sits in his car, having had a front row seat 
      to the whole show.  With the death of his friend avenged, he 
      starts up his car to head for home, and as the MUSIC 
        CRESCENDOES, and we --

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
