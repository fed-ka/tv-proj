tight security at this event.

APRIL

He chuckles and starts to heads into the park...

APRIL
Actually, I don t have my ID.

RICHIE

Aw, c mon, man. Look at that face. 
Can t she be my plus-one?

The Security Guard just sighs. Not worth it. To April:

SECURITY GUARD
Just gotta check your bag.*

April calmly puts her bag on the table and the guard starts *
rifling through it...and then something FALLS OUT. Richie *
zeroes in on an ID on a LANYARD: April Carver - Boston Post. *
Richie and April lock eyes. She tries to joke.*

APRIL
Well, looks like you found my ID. 

But Richie s face is COLD. He turns to the Guard.*

RICHIE*

The Guard steps toward April, but she grabs her bag and RUNS *
PAST THEM, into the park!


INT. FENWAY PARK - CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS22

April HIGHTAILS it down the concourse, the Guard hot on her 
trail. She rounds a corner and dives into an abandoned 
REFRESHMENT BOOTH before the Guard can see her. Once clear, 
April emerges and starts speed-walking the other way...

George follows her.

GEORGE

APRIL

dozen blood donation stations are set up. She takes a seat

A FEW OF THE RED SOX enter. RICHIE MIRANDA leads the way, 
pushing a LITTLE BOY in a wheelchair and stopping at a MIC. 
Nearby, an intense WOMAN (30s) - his PUBLICIST - motions for 
him to put his arm around the boy. Richie complies and the 
TEAM PHOTOGRAPHER snaps photos.

RICHIE
Without blood donations, kids like 
Shane here wouldn t be with us 
today. That s why this team is 
honored to show Boston how it s 
done. 
(wryly)
And I know my blood s clean cause 
it gets tested every week now.

 Richie Then cringes. publicist Richie s laughs. crowd The

You guys are crazy! You really 
wanna get your arm poked with 
needles just to hang out with a 
couple ball players?

bleed for their team. Okay, let s 
get this party started.

to the tubes. Richie pats the chair next to him.

RICHIE
Now who wants the best seat in the 
house? 

APRIL

I do!

Richie squints into the crowd, but April is deliberately 
HIDING behind a tall man, so he doesn t see her.

RICHIE
Well, come on up, whoever you are!

And then April starts to look QUEASY. She glances next to 
her, at her own BLOOD pouring into the bag. She closes her 
eyes. Richie notices and rolls his eyes.

RICHIE
Oh what, now you re sick?

APRIL
I just have a thing about blood.

RICHIE
Great idea coming to a blood drive 
then. 

APRIL
No really, I feel weird...

She suddenly stands up, delirious, and rips the tape and 
tubes off her arm. And then, she FAINTS. Richie panics.

But before April answers, she notices something and startles. 
RICHIE s sitting in a nearby folding chair.

APRIL
What are you doing here?

RICHIE
Didn t have a choice. I m here to 
clean up my reputation. Can t 
really leave the girl who faints on 
me in front of all those people. At 
least my publicist says I can t.*

He jerks his head toward the window. Outside, his PUBLICIST 
paces the aisle, staring in like a hawk.

vitals.

As he opens his kit, Richie turns to leave. April impulsively 
calls out:

APRIL
I m not okay, actually.
(Richie turns around)
I m dying. And the only cure is an 
interview with you.

She closes her eyes dramatically. Richie tries to remain 
stoic but can t help but laugh at her persistence. 

RICHIE
You are unbelievable.

APRIL
I don t know if that s a 
compliment.

RICHIE
Me neither. 

The medic pulls out his stethoscope and blood pressure cuff 
and examines April as their conversation continues.

Do you know that guy? He keeps 
checking on you.

April turns and notices GEORGE peering in through the window

RICHIE
Sorry. You must really miss him.

APRIL

You know, you d think so. But I got 
a lot of money out of it, so...

Richie is startled. Doesn t know what to say. 

(CONT D) APRIL
Sorry, I get really awkward with 
emotional stuff and make 
inappropriate jokes. I got that 
from my dad, actually. He couldn t 
take anything seriously either.

RICHIE
I lost my dad too. Last year.

APRIL
(confused)
Wait, I thought your dad comes to 
all your games. 

RICHIE
Stepdad. Most people think he s my 
real dad, but...I reconnected with 
my biological father a little while 
back. Then of course, he had to go 
and have a stroke six months later.

APRIL
That must have been really hard.

He glances back at Danny, who is suppressing another cough. 
To his horror, a small one escapes.

They both laugh and we realize they re friends. 

BETH

APRIL
I mean, not technically. It s work

BETH
So make it not work related. Feed 
him tequila shots and pin him 
against a wall. Done.

APRIL
Beth.

BETH
Okay, or be a prude and talk about 
feelings. I m sure this dude would 
be into that. He has a scented 
candle on his desk! 

APRIL
I never should have told you about 
the candle. And it smells like 
trees. It s not like, vanilla.

BETH
Whatever, it s still a little 
metrosexual for me. I prefer strong 
silent types who watch sports and 
shoot guns.

APRIL
That makes no sense. You watch 
Downton Abbey. And donate to the *
Audubon Society.

Beth holds up a hand, not about to accept any constructive 
criticism now or ever.
