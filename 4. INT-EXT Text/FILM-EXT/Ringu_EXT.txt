Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.
She gets
out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.
She stops in front
of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.
RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.
Several
GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in
groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.
Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.
Dazedly, she
walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.
The placard reads
that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School
for Women.
Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.
She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLS.
ASAKAWA
Excuse me.
This is, um, kind of a
strange question, but by any chance
were you friends of that young girl
that died in the car as well?
The three girls turn their faces to the ground.
ASAKAWA
Please.
If you know anything...
GIRL RIGHT
They all died the same day.
Youko.
Tomoko.
Even Iwata, he was in a
motorcycle accident.
GIRL LEFT
Because they watched the video.
ASAKAWA
Video?
GIRL LEFT
Thats what Youko said.
They all
watched some weird video, and
after that their phone rang.
ASAKAWA
Tomoko-chan watched it, too?
Where?
Girl Left shakes her head.
GIRL LEFT
She just said they all stayed
somewhere.
GIRL RIGHT
There was a girl with Tomoko when
she died.
Shes had to be
hospitalized for shock.
GIRL MIDDLE
They say she wont go anywhere
near a television.
Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE
with a small covered parkway for a garage.
She gets out of her car,
closes the door.
She stares at the house, unmoving.
Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.
She
walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.
We see
Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and
her friends eating lunch.
The camera had its date-and-time function
enabled, and the photos are marked
97 8 29.
The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in
front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.
The sign reads:
IZU PACIFIC LAND
ASAKAWA
Izu...
Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the
four friends clowning around in their room.
Suddenly she comes to a
shot taken the next day, at check out.
The friends are lined up, arms
linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if
someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of
existence.
Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES
blowing up in her wake.
Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:
IZU PACIFIC LAND
Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is
less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental
COTTAGES.
She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.
She pauses
now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.
She
withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and
her friends with their faces all blurred.
The four are posing in front
of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.
Asakawa lowers the
photo to regard the cottage before her.
B4
She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.
Its open.
Asakawa walks in.
Asakawa eats silently, alone.
It is dark and raining heavily.
Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to
school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.
The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi
comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction,
blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at
this other pedestrian.
It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.
He
has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.
The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor
speaking.
Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
way.
The man resumes walking as well.
Caption-- September 14th.
Tuesday.
The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL,
but the door has already opened from within.
Asakawa leans out, holding
the door open for him.
Neither of them speaks.
Wordlessly, Ryuji enters
the apartment.
Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain.
There is a knock on the glass door behind her.
A moment later,
Ryuji slides the door open.
RYUJI
Its over.
Asakawa re-enters her apartment.
Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away
looking agitated.
CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.
Hes deep in
thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about
him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.
A PAIR
OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears,
heading directly for Ryuji.
Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as
that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so
that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand
just before Ryuji.
The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.
A gust of WIND rips by.
Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his
ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the
videotape.
The sound grows stronger.
RYUJI (VO)
So, it was you.
You did it.
The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal
background sounds return.
Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white
is nowhere to be seen.
Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his
apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.
RYUJI
Hey.
Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.
ASAKAWA
What happened to you?
RYUJI
(gruffly)
Nothing.
He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.
Asakawa follows.
Yoichi is walking to school.
He looks back over his shoulder, just
once,then resumes walking.
A car speeds along.
CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden,
traditional-style HOUSE.
Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before
the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.
The car from the
previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.
The passenger door opens and
Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.
Asakawa walks leisurely
after her son.
YOICHI
Grandpa!
KOUICHI
Whoa, there!
So, you made it, huh?
Caption-- September 17th.
Friday.
ASAKAWA
Yoichi says hes looking forward to
doing some fishing with you.
KOUICHI
Is that so?
Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.
YOICHI
Cmon grandpa, lets go!
KOUICHI
OK, OK.
Well get our things
together and then we can go.
Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on,
are ankle-deep in a shallow river.
Yoichi holds a small NET, and
Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly.
KOUICHI
There he is!
Cmon, there he is,
dont let him go!
Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.
KOUICHI
Oh, oh!
Ah... guess he got away,
huh?
YOICHI
That was your fault, grandpa.
Asakawas father laughs.
KOUICHI
Well, whaddya say we try again?
He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in
tow.
KOUICHI
Well get im this time.
Asakawa looks away, pensive.
WAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on
its way.
CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over
the waves.
RYUJI
I shouldve been more careful.
When I was at your place that
day, I could feel something
there.
I thought it was just
because of the video...
ASAKAWA
You mean that Tomoko
RYUJI
Thats not Tomoko.
Not anymore.
ASAKAWA
Yoichi... he can see them too,
cant he?
Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.
ASAKAWA
Its all my fault.
First Tomoko
died, then those three others.
It
should have stopped there, but it
didnt.
Because of me.
RYUJI
I wonder...
Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly.
ASAKAWA
How did the rumors about the
video even start in the first
place?
RYUJI
This kind of thing... it doesnt
start by one person telling a
story.
Its more like everyones
fear just takes on a life of its
own.
ASAKAWA
Fear...
RYUJI
Or maybe its not fear at all.
Maybe its what we were
secretly hoping for all along.
The ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.
Ryuji and Asakawa walk
the length of the gangplank towards the shore.
A man named MR.
HAYATSU is already waiting for them.
He holds up a white SIGNBOARD
in both hands.
ASAKAWA
Mr. Hayatsu?
HAYATSU
Aah, welcome!
You must be tired
after your long trip.
Please,
this way.
Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan.
Caption-- September 18th.
Saturday.
Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance.
HAYATSU
Hello?
The INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional
KIMONO, comes shuffling up.
She addresses Mr. Hayatsu.
KAZUE
Thank you.
She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji.
KAZUE (contd)
Welcome.
HAYATSU
Well, Ill be off then.
He gives a little bow and is off.
Kazue, meanwhile, has produced
two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa.
KAZUE
Please.
Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes.
Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.
Caption-- September 19th.
Monday.
Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring
out at the sea.
Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.
Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks
first.
The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his
accent.
YAMAMURA
Yalld do best to be off soon.
Seas probably gonna be rough
tonight.
RYUJI
What kind of a child was Shizuko?
YAMAMURA
Shizuko was... different.
Shed come
out here by herself everday an just
stare out at the ocean.
The fishermen
all took a dislikin to her.
Oceans
an unlucky place for us, ysee: every
year it swallows up more of our own.
You keep starin out at somethin
ike that...
RYUJI
Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga
kuru zo.
If you keep playing in the
water, the monster will come for you.
Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised.
RYUJI
Shizuko could see inside people,
couldnt she?
Down to the places
theyd most like to keep hidden.
It
must have been difficult for her...
Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.
YAMAMURA
Please leave!
Now!
Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm.
RYUJI
Ive got a little of that ability
myself.
It was you who spread the
word about Shizuko, wasnt it?
And you who first contacted
Professor Ikuma?
YAMAMURA
Whatre you--?
RYUJI
You thought youd be able to make
some money off her.
You even got
some, from one of the newspapers.
YAMAMURA
Leave me the hell alone!
Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.
Both Ryuji and Asakawa take
pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.
RYUJI
Tell us about Shizukos daughter.
Who was she?
YAMAMURA
I dont know!
RYUJI
She was there, with Shizuko. She
had to be.
Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally
causes him to stumble and fall.
Ryuji comes up behind him,
grasping him firmly.
At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as
he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding
FLASH
The setting is a large MEETING HALL.
A number of people are seated
in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS
SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.
A BANNER hangs above the stage, which
reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.
FLASH
Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration
before the press.
He also realizes--
RYUJI
(to Yamamura)
You were there!
FLASH
YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE
onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.
Standing off to one
side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.
RYUJI	(O.S.)
You stood there and watched the
demonstration.
CUT back to the beach.
Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the
prone Mr. Yamamura.
Suddenly there is another
FLASH
Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it
as if she had actually been there.
She watches as Shizuko receives
a sealed clay POT in both hands.
Shizuko regards the pot a moment
and then places it gently on the table before her.
She takes a
calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin,
rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.
The members of the press talk
excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.
Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the
folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.
The phrase on both
sheets is identical.
JUDGE
Match.
Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.
Shizukos features melt into a soft
smile.
The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by
Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.
JUDGE
Match.
Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see
the unseen.
Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair,
begins striding angrily towards the stage.
REPORTER
Faker!
This is nothing but trickery,
and the lowest form of trickery at
that.
The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger
accusingly at Shizuko.
REPORTER
What are you trying to pull, woman?
A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.
REPORTER #2
Thats right!
Professor Ikuma,
youre being fooled!
By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and
shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and
frightened.
She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing
din.
Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.
The
first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the
others.
Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to
the floor.
The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters
face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.
REPORTER #3
Whats happened?
REPORTER #4
Hes dead!
REPORTER #5
(to Shizuko)
Witch!
Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.
They stop as someone
unseen steps up, blocking their passage.
Shizukos eyes widen, her
head shaking in disbelief.
SHIZUKO
Sadako?
Was it you?
CUT to Ryuji on the beach.
He looks up excitedly.
RYUJI
Sadako?!
He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single
character SADA reflected in reverse. *
>* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty")
>or -ko ("child").
Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."
Sadako is, of
>course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.
RYUJI
Sadako killed him?
She can kill
just with a thought?
YAMAMURA
Shes... a devil spawn.
CUT back to the demonstration hall.
Sadako, her face completely hidden
by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.
Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.
All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw,
bloody stumps.
CUT back to the beach.
Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the
vision, has begun to swoon.
Finally her legs give out and she crumples
to the beach.
Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.
He glances down at
her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.
The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.
Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three
watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.
White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea.
Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning.
Several FISHING BOATS are docked.
The wind whips her hair crazily
around.
She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--
ASAKAWA
(calling)
Ryuji!
Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.
He is
in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.
ASAKAWA
Ryuji!
The phone in my apartment
never rang!
It only ever rang at
the rental cottage!
Professor
Ikuma mustve...
RYUJI
And weve got no way of going back.
HAYATSU
Its too dangerous!
The thought of
anybody going out in this weather...
The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their
situation.
Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them.
YAMAMURA (O.S.)
Ill take you out.
The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the
gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.
YAMAMURA
Sadako is callin yall, reckon.
Mayhap to drag you down under the
water.
Short silence.
Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa,
turns back to face Mr. Yamamura.
RYUJI
Please.
Take us out.
A tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.
Mr. Yamamura stands
at the wheel, his face expressionless.
Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.
He heads down
below toward the captains area.
Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel.
RYUJI
We made it.
Maybe Sadako doesnt
have it out for us after all.
Long pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing.
YAMAMURA
Shizuko... she used to -speak- to
the ocean, just ramble away.
One
time I hid, listenin to one of her
conversations.
Mr. Yamamura pauses again.
YAMAMURA (contd)
And it werent in no human language.
Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise.
Caption-- September 20th.
Monday.
Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.
He holds a
pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.
A
length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.
He runs towards a
RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in
hand.
YOICHI (O.S.)
Hello?
ASAKAWA
Yoichi?
Its mommy.
I just called
to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.
Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.
YOICHI (O.S.)
Im tired of it here, mom!
I wanna
go back to school.
ASAKAWA
(smiling)
Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa
to talk like that.
YOICHI (O.S.)
Hes laughing.
You wanna talk to him?
ASAKAWA
No, thats...
Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.
She seems about to lose
her composure.
ASAKAWA
Im sorry, Yoichi.
Ill... Ill
see you tomorrow.
YOICHI (O.S.)
Whats wrong?
Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.
ASAKAWA
Mommys got something she has to do.
Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?
Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.
He shuts the DOOR
just short of a slam.
CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.
She half-
runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring
blankly into space.
Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his
SEATBELT.
RYUJI
What time was it when you first
watched the video?
Asakawa glances at her watch.
ASAKAWA
Seven or eight minutes past
seven.
PM.
No more than ten
minutes past.
RYUJI
If the rumors are true, that
time is gonna be our deadline.
Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas.
The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.
The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before
coming to an abrupt halt.
Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless,
gets out of the passenger side.
Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a
shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.
RYUJI
-Here-.
CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental
cabins.
Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop
before cabin B4.
The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by
wooden LATICEWORK.
Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but
keeps hold of the PICK.
He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins
smashing away at the latticework.
When he has cleared enough space for
passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.
When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.
The two enter the
earthen basement.
UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY
Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.
The BEAM arcs outwards,
illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern
rental cottage.
The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old
STONE WELL.
The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off
with a solid-looking stone LID.
Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.
RYUJI
I knew it!
The well.
He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the
lid.
Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.
ASAKAWA
The well...
Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.
He sets their enclasped
hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the
surface of the lid with their free hands.
Asakawa closes her eyes in
concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach,
Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.
FLASH
The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.
A YOUNG GIRL in
a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on
the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.
FLASH
Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.
FLASH
There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.
He suddenly
produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the
back of the head.
The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl
behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the
well.
The body falls into its depths.
Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well
with both hands, looking down.
He flashes a guilty look in either
direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does
so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.
The image from the
videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well,
looking up to see this man staring back down at her.
This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.
FLASH
ASAKAWA
Her own father!
The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body
crumbles.
Ryuji catches hold of her.
RYUJI
It was Ikuma who put this lid on.
And Sadakos still inside.
Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.
He inserts it under
the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.
Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
the lid begins to move.
Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two
lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.
The lid slides off,
dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.
Ryuji sits to one side, winded
with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.
She shines it
down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What
WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.
Ryuji sees her expression
and begins removing his JACKET.
RYUJI
Ill go.
He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.
CUT to an overhead shot of the well.
A ROPE is fastened to one side,
and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.
His eyes wander
overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out
human FINGERNAILS.
Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless
fingernails line the sides of the well.
RYUJI
Sadako was alive!
Shed tried to
climb her way out.
Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing
Sadakosterrible agony.
He waits a moment longer before edging his
way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of
the well.
He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up
to Asakawa.
RYUJI
Lower the buckets!
Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.
Ryuji
grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when
finished.
RYUJI
Take it up!
Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.
She walks a small
distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.
She happens to
glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start
realizes that the sun has already started to set.
A nervous glance at
her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket
to find another full one already awaiting her.
RYUJI
Take it up!
In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.
He looks at it for a long
moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.
Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her
strength beginning to fade.
She half-stumbles, glances up... and is
shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.
CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength
almost gone.
She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past
6:00.
She calls frantically down to Ryuji.
ASAKAWA
Its already six!
RYUJI
(explosively)
I know!
Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!
The bucket slowly jerks into motion.
Asakawa pulls it up to the rim
of the well, holds it unsteadily.
She takes one faltering step and
falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.
CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.
RYUJI
Take it up!
Nothing happens.
RYUJI
Asakawa!
The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.
CUT to Asakawa,
her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply
keep her body moving.
She glances behind her, sees through the wooden
lattice that it is now pitch black.
A look of resignation crosses her
face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and
falling in on itself.
CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing
Ryuji.
RYUJI
(fuming)
What the hell are you doing?
Trying
to get me killed?
CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.
Ryuji calls out from the well.
RYUJI (O.S.)
Hey!
Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim
of the well.
Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of
Asakawa.
RYUJI
Asakawa!
She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.
RYUJI
Well change.
Youre in no condition
to keep this up.
Asakawa suddenly springs into life.
Her voice is frantic, fearful.
ASAKAWA:
No!
RYUJI
Who do you expect to pull up these
buckets, then?
ASAKAWA
But, we dont even know if its doing
any good...
Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.
He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.
RYUJI
And what about Yoichi, huh?
Is his
mother not coming to pick him up
after all?
He releases his hold on her.
The two stare at each other a long time,
saying nothing.
CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT
now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with
grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.
Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder
and down into the well.
The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in
and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.
RYUJI
Dont look down!
She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.
CUT to Ryuji leaning
over the rim of the well, peering down at her.
For an instant,
everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at
all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or
if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.
CUT to
Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.
Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.
A FLASHLIGHT hangs
from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.
Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.
She calls out pleadingly.
ASAKAWA
Where are you?
Please, come out.
Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.
A full bucket
already awaits.
She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.
She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending
it up.
Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again,
her voice close to tears.
ASAKAWA
Please.
Where are you?
Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes
of stagnant water.
With a start, she realizes that her fingers have
caught something.
Seaweed?
Asakawa draws her hands close for a
better look... and sees that is HAIR.
A thick clump of long, black
hair.
Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching
Asakawa just below the wrist.
Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND
like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.
It
is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.
CUT to a
shot of Asakawas face.
Far from being frightened, her features are
oddly placid.
She regards the fearsome thing before her with an
almost tender look.
Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long
hair.
ASAKAWA
Its you...
She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head
with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.
Its
sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the
green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.
Like a
mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal
remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes
begin to glaze.
CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.
RYUJI
Hey!
Asakawa!
Its already 10
minutes past seven!
We did it!
Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.
Her body
suddenly falls forward, limp.
Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson
headlights flashing.
A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying
something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.
CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa
sitting on the curb.
Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET
draped over her shoulder.
ASAKAWA
Why would Ikuma have killed her?
His own daughter...
RYUJI
Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.
ASAKAWA
What?
RYUJI
Maybe her father... wasnt even human.
The two exchange glances.
Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST,
which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.
The ugly
bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.
RYUJI
Its gone...
He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.
RYUJI
Enough, already.
Its over.
Cmon.
Ill take you home.
Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.
Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.
He and Asakawa
get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is
a long moment where neither of them says anything.
RYUJI
Get some rest.
He flashes her the slightest of grins.
RYUJI (contd)
I still have a thesis to finish.
CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost
metaphoric distance between them.
ASAKAWA
...thank you.
Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.
He gets into his car and
drives off.
Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the
entrance of her apartment.
Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.
At first her face is calm and
tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably
darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.
She now looks very
anxious.

If you are reading this
translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP
reading this now and watch the scene for itself.
Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.
He
suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers
death.
Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and
making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.
There is a
single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa
lightly by the arm.
GUARD
Are you a resident here, maam?
ASAKAWA
Im Takayama Ryujis wife!
The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.
GUARD
Im sorry maam, but theyve already
taken the body away.
Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.
Body?
ARIAL SHOT of Asakawas car.
We hear her VOICE on the cell
phone.
ASAKAWA (O.S.)
Dad?
Its me.
Im on my way over.
Look, dad, Ive got something to ask.
Its for Yoichi...
