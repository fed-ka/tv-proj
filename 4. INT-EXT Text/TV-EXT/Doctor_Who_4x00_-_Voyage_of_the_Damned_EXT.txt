                                    MR COPPER
 
                    So!  I take it, you'll be going?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The open sky.

                                    MR COPPER
                    And... what about me?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I travel alone.  It's best that
                    way.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Then what am I supposed to do?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Give me that credit card.

      Mr Copper hands it over, the Doctor studies it, sonics it.

                                    MR COPPER
                    It's only petty cash.  Spending
                    money.  All done by computer, I
                    didn't really know the currency, I
                    thought a million might cover it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    A million pounds?

                                    MR COPPER
                    Enough for trinkets.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Mr Copper, a million pounds is
                    worth fifty million credits.*

                                    MR COPPER
                    How much..?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Fifty million, and fifty six.*

                                    MR COPPER
                    ...I've got money.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yes you have!

      And Mr Copper takes the card.  Incredulous.  Then stands
      back, exultant, laughing to the skies.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Oh my word.  Oh my Vot.  Oh my
                    goodness me, yee hah!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's all yours.  Planet Earth. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Now that's a retirement plan. 
                    Just you be careful, though!
 
                                    MR COPPER
                    I will, I will, oh I will!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No interfering.  I don't want any
                    trouble.  Just... have a nice life.

                                    MR COPPER
                    I can have a house!  A proper house! 
                    With a garden!  And a door!  Oh,
                    Doctor!  I'll make you proud!

      He grabs the Doctor, kisses his cheek -

      Then runs off, into the snow, towards the city, yelling:

                                    MR COPPER (CONT'D)
                    I can have a kitchen!  With chairs! 
                    And windows!  And... plates!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um... where are you going?

                                    MR COPPER
                    No idea!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nor me.


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode X - Shooting Script - 28/06/07 - page 83.

      The Doctor turns to the Tardis, gets out the key.

      But Mr Copper stops, calls back, a silhouette in the snow.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Oh, and Doctor! 
                          (pause)
                    I won't forget her.

      The Doctor just nods.  Then looks up.

      FX: NIGHT SKY, and in amongst the snow, just for a second,
      there's a glimpse of shining BLUE STARDUST, then gone.

      Then the Doctor looks back across the night.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Merry Christmas, Mr Copper.

      And the Doctor goes into the Tardis.

      FX: the ancient grind of engines, and the Tardis fades
      away, obscured by the snow, gone.
