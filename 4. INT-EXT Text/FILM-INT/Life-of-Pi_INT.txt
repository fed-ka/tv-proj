A modest row house. There is a French influence to the decor,
along with books and artwork that celebrate the spiritual.
PI PATEL (50 - intelligent, Indo-Canadian) cooks an Indian
meal. The often-skeptical WRITER (late 30s, a disheveled
French Canadian), watches Pi.
ADULT PI
The way of karma; the way of God.
WRITER
I assumed your father was a
mathematician - because of your
name.
ADULT PI
Oh, far from it. I was named after
a swimming pool.
WRITER
There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'
ADULT PI
(He chuckles.)
You see, my uncle, Francis, was
born with too much water in his
lungs. They say the doctor swung
Francis around by the ankles to
clear the water out and that's what
gave him the huge chest and skinny
legs that made him such a great
swimmer.
WRITER
(Amused.)
Is Francis actually your uncle? He
said he was friends with your
father.
3.
PI
I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary
uncle' - my father's best friend,
my swimming guru.

ADULT PI
(Regarding lunch:)
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
WRITER
No, not at all... And your name?
ADULT PI
Hmm?
WRITER
You - you were going to tell me how
you got your name, I think.
ADULT PI
I got it from something Mamaji once
told my father. Most travelers
collect postcards or teacups on
their journeys - but not Mamaji.
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

ADULT PI (CONT'D)
He swims in every pool he comes
upon...

ADULT PI
... but he did, and I was named
"Piscine Molitor Patel."
10
12
ADULT PI (V.O.)
Even the teachers started doing it -
not deliberately, of course...
SCIENCE TEACHER
So then - what might occur if we
release gas too quickly? Pissing?
Pi is aghast. Several students splutter and howl, whispering
the slip to others. Laughter ripples around the room, all
eyes on Pi.
BOY
He said Pissing!
SCIENCE TEACHER
That's enough - order!
ADULT PI (V.O.)
When we returned the next year for
our first day of school, I was
prepared.
6.
Class is held in a large open room. Roll call.
BOY
Present sir.
HISTORY TEACHER
Piscine Patel...
PI - AGE 12, rises, crosses to the front.
PI (AT 12)
Good morning. I am Piscine Molitor
Patel, known to all as...
(He writes "PI" on the
board.)
... "Pi," the sixteenth letter of
the Greek alphabet...
Pi writes , then quickly charts out a general notion of the
concept on the chalkboard.
PI (CONT'D)
... which is also used in
mathematics to represent the ratio
of any circle's circumference to
its diameter - an irrational number
of infinite length, usually rounded
to three digits, as...
(He writes "3.14.")
3.14. PI.
Pi underlines his name, faces the class.
HISTORY TEACHER
Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down.
WRITER (V.O.)
And from then on you were Pi?
ADULT PI (V.O.)
Well, no. Not quite ...
As Pi returns to his seat, Bully #2 leans forward,
whispering:
BULLY #2
Nice try, Pissing.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
But I still had the whole day ahead
of me. French Class was next...
7.

14
Pi repeats his act in French, 3.14159265 on the board.
PI (12)
Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel -
dit'Pi'...
ADULT PI (V.O.)
Then Geography...
15
16
A LIBRARIAN runs down the hall, a huge book tucked under his
arm, followed by dozens of students. He reaches Pi's class,
pushes his way through the crowd.
LIBRARIAN
Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly!
17
17
Close on Pi writing digits. Pull back - the entire chalkboard
is filled with numbers. All watching are stunned. The
librarian compares Pi's writing to the math book.
LIBRARIAN
It is right... He's really doing
this!
Students clap and cheer - even the bullies. Several chant
along with him as he writes:
ALL
1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI!
8.
ADULT PI (VO)
By the end of that day, I was Pi
Patel, school legend.
18
18
The writer laughs, then ventures onto a new topic.
WRITER
Mamaji tells me you're a legend
among sailors, too. Out there all
alone -
ADULT PI
I don't even know how to sail. And
I wasn't alone out there. Richard
Parker was with me.
WRITER
Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't
tell me everything. He just said I
should look you up when I got back
to Montreal.
ADULT PI
So what were you doing in
Pondicherry?
WRITER
Writing a novel.
ADULT PI
By the way, I enjoyed your first
book. The new one, is it set in
India?
WRITER
No, Portugal, actually. But it's
cheaper living in India.
ADULT PI
Ah. Well, I look forward to reading
it.
WRITER
You can't. I threw it out. Two
years trying to bring it to life,
and then one day it sputtered,
coughed, and died.
ADULT PI
I'm sorry.
9.
WRITER
(Shrugs, making light of
it.)
I was in a coffee house in
Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning
my loss, when this old man at the
next table struck up a
conversation.
ADULT PI
Yeah, Mamaji. He does that.
WRITER
When I told him about my abandoned
book, he said:
(Imitating Mamaji:)
"So... a Canadian who's come to
French India in search of a story.
Well, my friend, I know an Indian
in French Canada who has the most
incredible story to tell. It must
be fate that the two of you should
meet."
ADULT PI
I haven't spoken about Richard
Parker in so many years... What has
Mamaji already told you?
WRITER
He said you had a story that would
make me believe in God.
ADULT PI
(Pi laughs.)
He would say that about a nice
meal. As for God, I can only tell
you my story; you will decide for
yourself what you believe.
WRITER
Fair enough.
ADULT PI
Let's see, then - where to begin?
CUT TO: MONTAGE
OF PONDICHERRY,
1954:
10.
19
18
ADULT PI
When the French handed Pondicherry
back to us in 1954, the town
decided that some sort of
commemoration was in order.
25
27
WRITER
It sounds magical, growing up in-
The Writer stops, realizing that Pi's eyes are closed in
prayer. The Writer watches in awkward silence, his head
halfbowed.
ADULT PI
Amen. Let's eat.
WRITER
I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.'
ADULT PI
(As he serves food:)
Catholic Hindus do.
WRITER
Catholic Hindus?
ADULT PI
We get to feel guilty before
hundreds of gods instead of just
one.
WRITER
But you're a Hindu first?
12.
PI
None of us knows God
until someone
introduces us. I was
first
introduced to God as
a Hindu. There
are 330 million gods
in the Hindu
religion - how can I
not come to
know a few of them?
28
29
It is raining outside. Pan from the window; Mother lies in
bed with Pi as they continue sharing this story for the
thousandth time. Mother's voice plays over (Note: they speak
in Tamil throughout the following dialogue):
PI
...But he didn't!
MOTHER
That's what he told her. "I didn't
eat dirt!" "No? Well, then open
your mouth." So Krishna opened his
mouth.
Pi opens his mouth in imitation.
MOTHER (TAMIL) (CONT'D)
And what do you think Yashoda saw?
PI (TAMIL)
What?
MOTHER (TAMIL)
She saw in Krishna's mouth the
whole entire universe.
13.
30
PI AND RAVI'S BEDROOM, 1966 - NIGHT
30
Pi has made a tent of his blanket, a flashlight glowing
beneath the covers. In his tent, Pi flips through the pages
of a Hindu comic book, enthralled by the story of Krishna...
The panels of the comic book show Krishna's mouth falling
open, revealing stars and planets, the universe unfolding in
wondrous detail.
34
PONDI TEMPLE COURTYARD, 1966 - NIGHT
34
A tank ceremony is about to begin. The tank is a square
reservoir the size of a soccer field; Pi's family sits among
the crowd on the steps that lead down to the water.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
The gods were my superheroes
growing up. Hanuman, the monkey
god, lifting an entire mountain to
save his friend Lakshmana. Ganesh,
the elephantheaded, risking his
life to defend the honor of his
mother Parvati. Vishnu, the Supreme
Soul, the source of all things.
Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
shoreless cosmic ocean and we are
the stuff of his dreaming.
FATHER
(With quiet sincerity.)
Spectacle. Don't let the stories
and pretty lights fool you, boys.
Religion is darkness.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
My dear 'Appa' believed himself
part of the 'new India.' As a
child, he'd had polio; he used to
lie in bed, wracked with pain,
wondering where God was. In the
end, God didn't save him; Western
medicine did.
Below, Mother watches the ceremony, lost in contemplation.
14.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
My 'Amma' went to college and
thought her family was part of the
'new India' as well - until her
parents cut her off because they
thought she was marrying beneath
her. Her religion was the only link
she had to her past.
36
37
Pi leans down to the font beside the door and drinks. He's
about to leave again when he notices the stations of the
cross depicted on plaques that encircle the church.
PRIEST
You must be thirsty. Here, I
brought you this.
Not knowing what else to do, Pi takes the glass and drinks.
An awkward pause as he searches for something - anything - to
say. He finally points up to one of the paintings.
PI
Why would a god do that? Why would
he send his own son to suffer for
the sins of ordinary people?
The Priest smiles down upon Pi.
PRIEST
Because He loves us. God made
Himself approachable to us - human -
so we could understand Him.
(MORE)
15.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
We can't understand God in all His
perfection, but we can understand
God's son and His suffering as we
would a brother's.
38
38
ADULT PI
That made no sense. Sacrificing the
innocent to atone for the sins of
the guilty? What kind of love is
that?
39
41
Pi stands quizzing the priest near the altar.
PI
If God is so perfect and we're not,
why would He want to create all
this? Why does He need us at all?
PRIEST
All you have to know is that He
loves us. "God so loved the world
that He gave His only Son." This
Son taught us to love one
another...
The priest's words continue as Pi leans in, listening.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
The more I listened to the priest,
the more I came to like this Son of
God.
42
42
Pi kneels, smiling, in an attitude of worship.
16.
PI
Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing
me to Christ.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
I came to faith through Hinduism
and I found God's love through
Christ, but God wasn't finished
with me yet.
43
44
Pi is out in front of the house kneeling on a prayer mat,
repeating a prayer. Father passes by with friends. He stops
to watch Pi.
45
45
Father sits at the dinner table with his family. The servant
offers a dish of lamb to Father only. Father pops a bite into
his mouth, savoring it.
FATHER
This lamb is exquisite - it's best
dish on the table. You are all
missing out...
As he chews, Father notices Pi completing a blessing.
17.
FATHER (CONT'D)
You only need to convert to three
more religions, Piscine, and you
will spend your life on holiday.
RAVI
(Laughing:)
Are you going to Mecca this year,
Swami Jesus? Or to Rome, for your
coronation as Pope Pi-us?
MOTHER
You stay out of this, Ravi. Just as
you like cricket, Pi has his own
interests.
FATHER
No Gita, Ravi has a point, no? You
cannot follow three different
religions at the same time,
Piscine.
PI
Why not?
FATHER
Because believing in everything at
the same time is the same as not
believing in anything at all.
MOTHER
He's young Santosh - he's still
finding his way.
FATHER
And how can he find his way if he
does not choose a path?
(To Pi:)
Listen: instead of leaping from one
religion to the next, why not start
with reason? In a few hundred
years, science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe than
religion has in ten thousand.
MOTHER
That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about
what's out there -
(With a hand to her
heart:)
- but not what is in here. Art,
music, literature - they all spring
from our faith.
18.
FATHER
Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.
I do not expect us all to agree
about everything. But I would much
rather have you believe in
something I don't agree with than
to accept everything blindly. And
that begins with thinking
rationally. Do you understand?
Pi nods.
FATHER (CONT'D)
Good.
Pause.
PI
I would like to be baptized.
Father and Mother react. Ravi stifles a laugh.
46
- DAY
47
Pi (12) and Ravi (14) cross into a drab cement enclosure
behind the tiger exhibit. A hallway with closed gates at both
ends leads out to the exhibit.
RAVI
Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in
here without him.
PI
Stop worrying. I have seen him do
this a thousand times. I want to
meet our new tiger.
He drops meat on the floor by the bars.
RAVI
Pi!...
PI
Hello! Richard Parker!
48
52
A rainy early morning in monsoon season. Pi (now 16) lies in
bed, reading "Notes from the Underground." Ravi is still
asleep. The radio plays in the other room.
NEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
... and so has placed the country
in a State of Emergency.
(MORE)
23.
NEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
Under the directive, the states of
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be
placed under the direct authority
of the central government. Police
will be granted powers to arrest
and indefinitely detain citizens
responsible for the uprising.
Unauthorized...
Ravi's alarm goes off. Ravi reaches to shut it off.
55
64
Pi sits at dinner with the family, a half-smile on his face,
obviously lost in thoughts about Anandi. Father's voice
gradually breaks through into Pi's consciousness.
FATHER
So...you see? We have talked about
it for some time... Do you
understand what I'm saying? Pi?
Pi glances over.
PI
Sorry. You've been...
26.
FATHER
Worried. For my family. Our animals
are worth far more abroad than here
in India, and if the town council
stops supporting us, I don't know
where we'll be. So... it is what we
have to do. Do you understand?
PI
I'm sorry... what are we talking
about?
RAVI
We are leaving India.
PI
What??
MOTHER
We are selling the zoo.
FATHER
The zoo itself was never ours to
sell - the land belongs to the
town. But the animals are ours, and
if we sell them, we will have
enough to start a new life.
PI
But where would we go? Our life is
here Appa!
FATHER
Canada. I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg. I'll be
shipping most of the animals for
sale in North America; we can get
freighter passage for the whole
family. So, it is settled. We will
sail like Columbus!
PI
But Columbus was looking for India!
68
The family stands in the mess hall line along with the CREW.
The FRENCH COOK, a grizzled and thoroughly unpleasant man,
loads a plate and slides it over the counter to Mother. The
meal consists of liver and onions, sausages, and rice soaked
in gravy. Mother points at her rice.
MOTHER
My sons and I are vegetarians. Do
you have anything - ?
The French Cook ladles ore gravy over her rice.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
No - no! Not more gravy.
FRENCH COOK
(Thick French accent:)
You don't want gravy?
28.
MOTHER
(Quickly switching to
French:)
No, I want something vegetarian. I-
The cook takes her plate, sets it on the counter in front of
Father. The following takes place in French (subtitled).
FRENCH COOK
There. No problems.
FATHER
She asked if you have something
vegetarian.
FRENCH COOK
Vegetarian - the cow that produced
this liver was vegetarian, the pigs
that went into these sausages were
vegetarian.
FATHER
Very funny. But she doesn't eat
liver.
FRENCH COOK
(Getting irritated:)
Then she can eat the sausages, the
rice, the gravy.
(To Mother:)
Or you can go cook your own food.
FATHER
How dare you talk to my wife like
that?
The cook shoves a plate of plain rice over the counter.
FRENCH COOK
Here's your rice. I cook for
sailors, not curry eaters.
Father grabs the cook's forearms, yanking him halfway over
the high counter.
FATHER
What did you call us??
FRENCH COOK
Let go of me!
FATHER
Who do you think you are? You're
nothing but a servant!
29.
FRENCH COOK
I feed people! You feed monkeys!
FATHER
I'll teach you respect!
Sailors descend on the two, pulling them apart.
A SHORT TIME
LATER -
69
69
The family sits eating silently in the aftermath of the
scuffle. A TAIWANESE SAILOR comes alongside Pi carrying a
plate of rice with gravy. He speaks with a Taiwanese accent
and a gentle smile.
TAIWANESE SAILOR
Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I
eat rice next to gravy. On ship,
gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay?
You try?
Pi smiles in gratitude, but the gravy looks anything but
appetizing.
70
70
Pi eats a banana from the food set aside for the animals in
the cargo hold. He sits next to the transport cage of ORANGE
JUICE, a female orangutan with a baby orang in her arms.
Animal crates and cages surround Pi, the air filled with
screeches and growls.
Father enters the hold, carrying food for the animals.
FATHER
(Noting Pi's banana:)
Don't worry - we will have plenty
of fresh supplies after we stop in
Manila.
Father mixes tranquilizer pills into food for the orangs.
PI
Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's
not going to cause any trouble.
FATHER
The stress of traveling is not good
for the animals.
(MORE)
30.
FATHER (CONT'D)
And it helps with the seasickness.
We don't want to be cleaning up
after a seasick orangutan, do we?
Pi looks up, notices Father watching him.
Father tries to smile along with his little attempt at humor,
but his manner is stiff, his eyes furtive and uneasy.
ADULT PI (V.O.)
My father was a businessman - he
had never handled the animals
himself. I realized that leaving
India must have been harder for him
than it was for me.
71
74
Darkness - the faint glow of a nightlight. Close on Pi's
sleeping face, the cabin swaying in the storm.
BANG. A loud, deep rumble breaks into his consciousness. The
ship shakes. Pi's eyes open. He looks around, listens.
Nothing. He leans over the side of his bunk and wakes Ravi.
PI
Ravi? Did you hear that?
(Pause)
Ravi?
RAVI
... I'm sleeping.
PI
It's a thunderstorm! Let's go
watch!
RAVI
Are you crazy? We'll get hit by
lightning.
PI
No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge
first.
32.
RAVI
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.
On the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts
uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father.
75
75
Pi heads upstairs to the deck.
76
Pi stumbles down the tilted staircase.
PI
AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!
Halfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his
family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an
instant before the emergency lights come on in the water
below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to
swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a
ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim
further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is
too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the
stairwell.
33.
151
Thunder, rain and surf hammer the tarp from above; Pi pulls
himself under the tarp. Richard Parker's grunts and labored
breathing can be heard, but man and beast are only fully
visible when lightning strikes, Pi trying to stay as far away
from the tiger as he can manage. Before long the boat is
tossing Pi and the tiger as though in a washing machine, the
two helplessly colliding with one another, Pi choking as
water splashes in.
152
170
WRITER
It was human tooth?
ADULT PI
Don't you see, the island was
carnivorous.
WRITER
Carnivorous? Like... a Venus
flytrap?
ADULT PI
Yes, the whole island - the plants,
the water in those pools, the very
ground itself. During the day,
those pools held fresh water, but
at night, some chemical process
turned the water in those pools
into acid - acid that dissolved
those fish, that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees and
Richard Parker running to the boat.
WRITER
But where did the tooth come from?
ADULT PI
Years ago, some poor fellow just
like me must have found himself
stranded on that island.... And
like me he thought he might stay
there forever. But all that the
island gave him by day, it took
away again by night. To think - how
many hours spent with only meerkats
for company? How much loneliness
taken on?
(MORE)
64.
ADULT PI (CONT'D)
All I know is that eventually he
died, and the island digested him,
leaving behind only his teeth. I
saw how my life would end if I
stayed on that island. Alone and
forgotten. I had to go back to the
world, or die trying.
171
178
On Adult Pi alone:
ADULT PI
And then Richard Parker, my fierce
companion, the terrible one who
kept me alive, disappeared forever
from my life.
181
174
It is near sunset, the light from the windows casting theroom
in a golden hue - the same lighting we have just seen as Pi
was leaving the island.
67.
ADULT PI
You know, my father was right.
Richard Parker never saw me as his
friend. After all we'd been
through, he didn't even look back.
But I have to believe that there
was more in his eyes than my own
reflection staring back at me. I
know I felt it - even if I can't
prove it. I just wish...
(Beat. He sighs.)
You know, I've left so much behind.
My family, the zoo, Anandi, India -
I suppose in the end the whole of
life becomes an act of letting go.
But what always hurts the most is
not taking the moment to say
goodbye. I was never able to thank
my father for all I learned from
him, to tell him that without his
lessons I would never have
survived...
And I know he's a tiger, but I wish
I'd said: 'It's over. We've
survived. Thank you for saving my
life. I love you, Richard Parker.
You will always be with me. May God
be with you.'
The Writer shakes his head, astonished.
WRITER
I don't know what to say.
ADULT PI
Hard to believe, isn't it?
A pause as the writer decides how to respond.
WRITER
It is a lot to take in, to figure
out what it all means.
ADULT PI
If it happened, it happened. Why
should it have to mean anything?
WRITER
Well, some of it is pretty
incredible.
Pi nods - a half-smile - then rises, crossing to the
bookshelf.
68.
ADULT PI
I was the only one who survived the
shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping
company sent two men to talk to me
in the Mexican hospital where I was
recovering. I still have a copy of
their report.
Pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase.
ADULT PI (CONT'D)
They had insurance claims to
settle, and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank. They didn't
believe me either.
Pi hands the notebook to the Writer. On top, there is a
newspaper article with the headline "BOY RESCUED: 227 DAYS IN
THE PACIFIC." The Writer unclips the article, revealing the
insurance report beneath. We hear Okamoto's first line over
the report.
A175
A175
OKAMOTO
Thousands of meerkats? On a
floating carnivorous island? And no
one has ever seen it?
YOUNG PI
Yes. Just like I told you.
CHIBA
Bananas don't float.
OKAMOTO
(In Japanese:)
Why are you talking about bananas?
CHIBA
You said the orangutan floated to
you on a bundle of bananas. But
bananas don't float.
OKAMOTO
(In Japanese:)
Are you sure about that?
YOUNG PI
Of course they do. Try it for
yourself.
69.
OKAMOTO
In any case, we are not here to
talk about bananas or meerkats.
YOUNG PI
I've just told you a long story.
I'm very tired.
OKAMOTO
We're here because a Japanese cargo
ship sank in the Pacific.
YOUNG PI
Something I never forget. I lost my
whole family.
Pause.
OKAMOTO
(In Japanese:)
Get him some water.
(In English:)
We don't mean to push you. And you
have our deepest sympathies. But
we've come a long way. And we're no
closer to understanding why the
ship sank.
YOUNG PI
Because I don't know. I was asleep.
Something woke me up. It may have
been an explosion; I can't be sure.
And then the ship sank. What else
do you want from me?
CHIBA (OFF)
A story that won't make us look
like fools.
OKAMOTO
We need a simpler story for our
report. One our company can
understand. A story we can all
believe.
(Chiba gives Pi a glass of
water.)
YOUNG PI
So.... a story without things you
never seen before.
OKAMOTO
That's right.
70.
YOUNG PI
Without surprises. Without animals
or islands.
OKAMOTO
Yes. The truth.
B175
B175
WRITER
So what did you do?
ADULT PI
I told him another story. Four of
us survived...
YOUNG PI (V.O. - OVERLAPPING)
Four of us survived...
C175
C175
YOUNG PI
...The cook and the sailor were
already onboard. The cook threw me
a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard.
Mother held onto some bananas and
made it to the lifeboat. The cook,
the cook was a disgusting man. He
ate a rat. We had food enough for
weeks, but he found the rat in the
first few days - and he killed it,
and dried it in the sun and ate it.
He was such a brute, that man. But
he was resourceful. It was his idea
to build the raft to catch fish. We
would have died in those first few
days without him. The sailor was
the same man who brought rice with
gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't
understand much of what he said,
only that he was suffering. I can
still hear him - the happy Buddhist
who only ate rice with gravy. He
had broken his leg horribly in the
fall. We tried to set it as best we
could, but the leg became infected
and the cook told us we had to do
something or he'd die. The cook
said he'd do it, but mother and I
had to hold the man down. And I
believed him - we needed to do it.
(MORE)
71.
YOUNG PI (CONT'D)
So... I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm
sorry", but he just kept.. looking
at me, his eyes so... I'll never
understand the point of that man's
suffering. We didn't save him, of
course. He died. The morning after,
the cook caught his first dorado,
and I didn't understand what he'd
done at first, but Mother did, and
I'd never seen her so angry. 'Stop
whining and be happy,' he said. "We
need more food or we'll die. That
was the whole point.' 'What was the
point?' Mother asked. "You let that
poor boy die in order to get bait?
You monster!' The cook got furious.
He started towards her with his
fists raised, and Mother slapped
him hard, right across the face. I
was stunned. I thought he was going
to kill her right then. But he
didn't. The cook didn't stop at
bait either, no. The sailor, he
went the same way the rat went -
the cook was a resourceful man. It
was a week later that he... Because
of me. Because I couldn't hold onto
a stupid turtle. It slipped out of
my hands and swam away and the cook
came up and punched me on the side
of the head and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars. I thought he was
going to hit me again, but then
Mother started pounding on him with
her fists and screaming, "MONSTER!
MONSTER!" She yelled at me to go to
the raft - "Nee poda!" I thought
she was coming with me or I'd never
have... I don't know why I didn't
make her go first. I think about
that every day. I jumped over and
turned back just as the knife came
out. There wasn't anything I could
do; I couldn't look away... He
threw her body overboard. Then the
sharks came. I saw what they... I
saw. The next day I killed him. He
didn't even fight back. He knew he
had gone too far, even by his
standards. He'd left the knife out
on the bench. And I did to him what
he did to the sailor. He was such
an evil man, but worse still, he
brought the evil out in me.

I have to live with that. I was
alone in a lifeboat, drifting
across the Pacific Ocean. And I
survived.

After that, no more questions. The
investigators didn't seem to like
the story, exactly - but they
thanked me, they wished me well,
and they left.
Pause. The Writer speaks his thoughts aloud as the
realization strikes.
WRITER
So...
the stories... Both the zebra
and the sailor broke their leg. And
the hyena killed the zebra and the
orangutan. So ... the hyena is the
cook. And the sailor is the zebra,
mother is the orangutan... and
you're... the tiger.
ADULT PI
Can I ask you something?
WRITER
Of course.
ADULT PI
I've told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean.
Neither explains what caused the
sinking of the ship, and no one can
prove which story is true and which
is not. In both stories, the ship
sinks, my family dies, and I
suffer.
WRITER
True.
ADULT PI
So which story do you prefer?
WRITER
The story with the tiger. That's
the better story.

ADULT PI
(Heartfelt:)
Thank you. And so it goes with God.
WRITER
(Pause. He looks up.)
Mamaji was right. It is an amazing
story. Will you really let me write
it?
ADULT PI
Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?
They hear a car pulling into the alleyway alongside the
house.
ADULT PI (CONT'D)
My wife is here. Would you like to
stay for dinner? She's an
incredible cook.
WRITER
I didn't know you had a wife.
ADULT PI
And a cat, and two children.
WRITER
So your story does have a happy
ending.
ADULT PI
Well, that's up to you. The story's
yours now.
The Writer smiles. Outside, car doors slam; we hear voices as
Pi's wife and children cross around to the front. Pi rises
and moves to the door. The Writer glances one final time at
the report. He flips the page and hesitates, reading the last
few lines aloud.
WRITER
(Reading:)
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding story
of courage and endurance
unparalleled in the history of
shipwrecks. Very few castaways can
claim to have survived so long at
sea, and none in the company of...
(He looks up at Pi)
...an adult Bengal tiger."

PI
(Off:)
We have a guest. Let me introduce
you...
THE WRITER stands and faces Pi. We see his POV - on Pi,
holding his daughter in arms, surrounded by his family,
smiling...
