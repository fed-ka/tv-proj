          breaks as a hand in a black glove punches through it... 
          and our first thought has to be this is the killer but as
          the hand reaches in, unlocks the lock and then opens the
          door, we see it's JOHNNY and BRUCE... wet from the rain,
          eyes intense... Bruce is carrying a baseball bat, Johnny
          using his cane... lightning flashes now and then... they
          pause once they're inside... whispering --

                                        BRUCE
                          Anything you want to tell me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like?

                                        BRUCE
                        Like 'I can see the killer and
                        he's hiding upstairs in the hall
                        closet'...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't have X-ray vision, Bruce.

                        Are you sure?
                                (as they climb the
                                  stairs)
                        How do you know if you don't try?


          UPSTAIRS - INTERCUTTING STEADICAMS AS THEY CHECK THROUGH
          THE HOUSE -- BRUCE

          pauses by a door, hesitates, opens it quickly... sees no
          one inside and moves on...


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          moving, encountering no one... he hears a strange noise...
              clickety-clickety-clickety... he reacts, moves toward the
          sound...



          running an endless race around its spinning wheel in its
          cage... it stops to stare at Johnny who sticks his head
          in the door...



          as Johnny enters... like everywhere else, there's no one
          to be found... he takes off his gloves and starts to touch
            things... a hairbrush, a nurse's uniform hanging on the
          back of a door.  Bruce enters... Johnny grows more
          frustrated as the scene continues...

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, he's not in the hall closet. 

          More desperate, Johnny starts touching the bed, the walls,
          the windows...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The hospital said she went home
                        three hours ago... so where the
                        hell is she... I don't feel
                          anything...

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you're just trying too
                        hard...

                        dead?

          FADE IN:*

          CLOSE-UP ON DEPUTY FRANK DODD (23) (RESHOOT ENTIRE SCENE)*

          In contrast to Johnny's desperation, Dodd is calm,
          measured... Johnny, wet and impatient, is sitting at Dodd's*
          desk as the deputy takes the report...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (controlled)
                        It is my real name.  Smith.  John
                        Smith.    

          Dodd stares at him a beat then, unconvinced, types a short
          burst into his computer.  We see we're in a modest office. 
          Up 'till now, it's been a quiet night.  Bruce is sitting
          by the door, watching Johnny give the report.  Two other
          deputies (including ROSCOE, 30) and an attractive but
            dressed-down police reporter, DANA BRIGHT, 25, are playing
          liar's poker in a far corner... her feet are up on the
          desk, crossed at the ankle as a man's might be... she
          studies a dollar bill...

                                        DODD
                        And why do you think something
                        has happened to this woman, Mr...
                          "Smith"?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Isn't it enough that she's still
                        missing three hours after the
                          hospital said...

                                        DODD
                        We don't begin to investigate
                        missing person reports for forty-
                        eight hours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...She may be dead by then... she
                        may already be dead...

          Dodd is growing more suspicious of this man with every

            answer... he studies him a long distrustful beat...

                                        DODD
                        And how would you know that, Mr.
                        Smith?

          Behind Johnny, we may see Bruce hang his head and rub his
            temple...

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        I just do. 

          Bruce just can't stay silent any longer --

                                        BRUCE
                        He sees things.  Okay?  Like a
                        psychic but times a hundred.  He
                        sees things.   

          At that, the reporter swings her legs off the desk...

                                        DANA
                        Scuse me, Roscoe...

                        He saved a baby from a burning
                          house...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        He found a man's mother that
                          everyone thought was dead.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce... sit down...

                                        BRUCE
                        Do not, under any circumstances,
                        play poker with him.  Okay?  Listen
                        to the man.

          The Sheriff who has come out of his office to see what
          the commotion is about... and in case we've forgotten, he
          is WALT BANNERMAN, Sarah's husband... who moves to

          Walt gives him a look - do I know you?

                        Dana Bright, Bangor Daily News,
                        Mr. Smith.  Are you saying you
                        can help the Sheriff's department
                        catch the strangler?

                                        WALT
                        Don't answer that.  Let's go in
                        my office.

                          Sheriff, I'm not even close to
                        "all right".    

          Johnny studies him a long beat.

                        If you don't want to believe me,
                        there's nothing I can do about
                        it.  But when they dig Allison

          who laughs and turns away, trying to hide it... Johnny
          feels the stares... moves to the door... Johnny exchanges
            a frustrated look with Bruce who moves to join him...

          Johnny acknowledges and they exit.  Once out the door,

          And this is something they would have discussed and decided
          together in advance so it's not a surprise to Walt.  But

                        happy to finally be out of that
                          terrible hospital.

          He stops in mid-sentence as he sees Sarah talking to
          Dodd... she turns at the sound of his voice and her jaw
          drops as she sees Johnny and Walt together...

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny.  What are you doing here? 

                                        WALT
                        Just a little police business. 
                        Nothing for you to be concerned a--

                                        JOHNNY
                        He rousted me.

          Off Sarah's look --

                                (shaking his head)
                          I didn't...

                        Told me the town wasn't big enough
                        for the both of us...

          And then she realizes this is Johnny... Sarah turns and
          looks sharply at him... he looks evenly at her, just the
          barest trace of that old sparkle in his eyes...

                                        WALT
                        We had a lunch date, didn't we... 

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe Johnny can join us...

                        No... no... no... no... no...



          The three of them at a table as the waitress brings their
          food... soup goes to Sarah...

                                        WAITRESS
                        Split pea.

          And then identical plates of cheeseburgers go to the men.

                                        WAITRESS
                          Cheeseburger.  And a Cheeseburger.

          Johnny and Walt glance at the other's cheeseburger and
          consider the implications.

                                        WAITRESS
                        Enjoy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you, ma'am.  

          Awkward silence... it's made all the more uncomfortable
          by the presence of TWO UNATTENDED CHILDREN punching each
          other in the booth behind Johnny throughout the scene...

                                        SARAH
                        I love the soup here.  

          More silence.  Johnny gives it a go...

                        So.  How did the two of you meet?

          Walt and Sarah look even more uneasy which they try to
          cover...

                                        WALT

                        I was visiting you.  Walt's
                          grandmother was dying...

          Nods all around, silence.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Hospitals are great places
                        to meet singles.

          Silent beat.  Okay, Walt tries to break the ice.

                                        WALT
                        Sarah says you were quite the
                        hockey player.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Doc says that's over with now.

          Walt nods, searching for anything else to say.

                                        WALT
                        I had a football injury myself.

                                (beat, realizing)
                        I mean, our son -- all... our
                        son.  

          Behind Johnny, the kids' MOTHER who has it with them,
          tries to get them out... they're still punching each
          other... The kids slide out of the booth, one boy pushes
          the other and he stumbles into Johnny and as he does THE
          SCENE FREEZES FOR A MOMENT and then continues.

                        Hey, guys... no fighting, okay?

          The kid looks at him, surprised, and as a result, the
          waitress scurries by with the coffee and it never falls.

          Moving with them as they enter... to see Allison sitting

          had a hammer, would be banging himself over the head with
          it and will not under any circumstances look at Johnny
          because he might kill him if he did.  And on that image,

          A few minutes later.  Johnny stands alone as the forensic
          technicians continue to pack up around him feeling lost,
          confused and very much out of place.  A few yards away,

                        I'm worried about you.

          He takes a couple eggs out of the fridge, reaches in for
          a bottle of cold cappuccino... impishly trying to joke
          her attention away from his problems --

                        Our taste of the day...

          He tosses it to her as he closes the refrigerator... she
          frowns as she catches it, knows what he's doing.  He moves
          around the kitchen with busy work relating to his eggs...
          Sarah blocks him from the stove, forcing him to pay

          He sighs in the warmth of her embrace and then he turns

          them, they sink to their knees, still kissing... beginning

                                        WALT'S VOICE
                        It's over, Frank.  Come on out
                        now.  We'll get you the help you
                        need.


    73Z173Z1CLOSER ON DODD

          He can see the figures of Walt and Johnny approaching
          several yards away... he readies his gun... but the sirens
          grow louder... he looks at the gun... and then turns and
          swallows the barrel...


    73Z273Z2JOHNNY AND WALT

          react and duck as they hear the shot fired... thinking it
          was aimed at them... but an instant later... they can see
          the splattered blood dripping down the cellar wall... and
          they move over and look down at Dodd's body.  They exchange
          a glance as Burl Ives sings on...          DEAD ZONE: WHAT IT SEEMS - ACT FOUR - 01/17/02        54.
