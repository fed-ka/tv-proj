Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
efficient man with a good case.
The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
carefully rehearsed.
BARBARA
... we go back to our homeroom for
dismissal, unless you have a pass
for sports or something.
PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
And is that what you did on the
day in question?
BARBARA
No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
after class.
PROSECUTOR
What happened next, Barbara?
BARBARA
Mr. Gettys closed the door.
PROSECUTOR
Everyone else had gone?
BARBARA
Yes. He told me to sit in the
chair beside his desk.
MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
enduring this testimony.

In your own words, Barbara, can
you tell us exactly what happened
during the next few minutes?
KEVIN LOMAX.
Defense counsel.
Taking it all in.
BARBARA (O.S.)
I told him I was afraid I would
miss my bus. He promised I would
get to the bus on time if I would
help him to do something...
Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
taking inventory -- assessing damage --
BARBARA (O.S.)
... Then he put -- before I could
say anything -- he placed his hand
inside my blouse...
Kevin -- checking the jury and --
BARBARA (O.S.)
... I was so frightened I didn't
move. I thought if I was just
quiet it would be okay...
Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
him cold --
BARBARA (O.S.)
... Then his other hand went up
under -- inside my skirt...
Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
feeling their way along the leg of his chair --
BARBARA (O.S.)
... his hand then, it started, he
started, moving back and forth --
farther and farther inside my
skirt...
Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --
BARBARA (O.S.)
... he said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings,
that he wanted to find out what
kind of feelings I had...

Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --

BARBARA (O.S.)
... I didn't know what to say, I
was trying to think of something
to say but I was confused and he
just kept on -- with his hand --
moving it -- under my dress --
higher and higher...
Kevin is rocked.
Trying not to show it.
BARBARA (O.S.)
... then I, I was asking him to
stop but it was like he couldn't
hear me -- he just kept on --
Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --
BARBARA (O.S.)
-- and then I screamed...
Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --
BARBARA
... then he, he got mad and said
we would have to try again
sometime.
PROSECUTOR
And did he try again?
BARBARA
Not with me.
PROSECUTOR
With friends of yours?
BARBARA
Yes.
PROSECUTOR
And when you told them what he had
done to you, they told you what he
had done to them, isn't that true?
BARBARA
Yes.
PROSECUTOR
I have nothing further.

KEVIN
The wife. The kid. The outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.
GETTYS
You're my lawyer! You're here to

You know what I'm thinking? Why

What's the game plan, Kevin? I

KEVIN
Fuck off.
REPORTER
'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
today's events. Speculation,
however, was widespread that the
young lawyer's unblemished string
of victories would come to an end
in this courtroom.'
Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...
REPORTER
It was a nice run, Kev. Had to
close out someday. Nobody wins

BARBARA
No.
KEVIN
Any theories on why you've done so
poorly in math this year?
BARBARA
It's not my fault.
KEVIN
Would you say Mr. Gettys is the
problem?
(as she shrugs)
You're not sure. Have you had
any discipline problems in math
class this year?
BARBARA
No.
KEVIN
No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has
had to talk to you repeatedly
about your behavior? Isn't that
why he asked you to stay after
class?
BARBARA
No.
KEVIN
Have other teachers ever asked you
to stay after class?
BARBARA
Once or twice.

This is way out of...
KEVIN
Credibility and bias.
JUDGE

BARBARA

The word special came up in your
testimony earlier. You claimed
that Mr. Gettys asked you whether
you had special feelings, if you
felt special.

Have you ever heard of a game
called 'Special Places?'

If I need to call those other
children, I will.

This room we're in was built --
architecturally designed -- to

A psychic centrifuge. Makes you

Inclusion. Commonality. Synergy.
All that good shit. That's what
I'm looking for today. Because
when I hear stories -- the kind
of stories I've been hearing --
about backbiting, about partners
not working together, departments
cutting each other's throats

KEVIN
Mr. Moyez?

We've never met. I'm a lawyer.
I'm here about the animals.
MOYEZ
As you wish.
KEVIN
I'll be arguing your case with the
city. I need to ask you some
questions.
(gets folder)
I've done a little preliminary
research -- precedent -- cases in
the past that dealt with Santeria
and Vou--
MOYEZ
No. This is not Santeria. We are
not Voodoo. Candomble.
Obeayisne. None of that. We are
much older. Before. Before all
of it.
KEVIN
Okay.
Is there a name?
Or...
MOYEZ
We have papers. At your firm.
We
have the tax exemption.
KEVIN
Okay.
I'll get right into that.

The animals. Let's start with
that, then.
MOYEZ
We have an investment in blood.

Perhaps we could start at the

Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside
the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a
glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez
goes to a workbench near the wall --

MOYEZ
What is the name of the man who
will prosecute us?

U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.
Eight days ago, in Kansas City,
two men pushed a calf into a steel
frame as a third man fired a high-
voltage staple-gun into the
animal's skull. Men kill animals
and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez
killed a goat. He killed a goat.
And he did it at home, in a manner
consistent with his religious
beliefs. Now some people may find
it bizarre.

It's certainly not a religious

It's not as common as, say,
circumcision. It's certainly not

is transformed into blood. It's
not even as common as the handling
of poisonous snakes to prove one's
faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't
two thousand miles away in a
stockyard. He doesn't use
electricity to kill. And worst of
all...

Phillipe Moyez is not shrink-

He's right, Alex. People need

KEVIN
You're not happy tomorrow? The
next day? We'll move over. But
right now -- this moment -- you
need immediate representation.
CULLEN
I've got a fourteen-year-old
stepdaughter who I care more about
than anything in the world. They
won't let me call her from
downtown. They won't let me talk
to her after I'm out. I gotta go
deal with that first.
KEVIN
We need to issue a statement.
Cullen looks to Milton.
Waiting.
Help me.
MILTON
He's a winner, Alex. And they'll
never see him coming.
CULLEN
I'm gonna make some very tough
phone calls. Then I'm gonna take a
pill and try to get some sleep. My

Good night to you.

MILTON
Kevin, hang on...

How's Cullen. Everything on beam?

That's a long conversation.

MRS. LOMAX
Are you happy here?

You're kidding, right? Am I happy?
Every now and then I look around

awful hard for me, 'cause I died

MRS. LOMAX
You were always running somewhere.
KEVIN
I guess I finally got there.

BARZOON
Can't turn over what you don't

Mr. Weaver would suggest.

Your Honor, this is outrageous.
We need to get in there and seize

Alexander Cullen is guilty of
murdering three people in cold
blood with malice aforethought.

JUDGE POE
Proceed.
KEVIN
We just spent our morning listening
to Mr. Broygo talk about his
'evidence'. What he neglected to
tell you is what this case is
really about. He left out the most
important fact of all: Alex Cullen
was somewhere else when these
murders took place. Now, Alex
Cullen has done a lot of things I
don't like. He's been a terrible
husband to all three of his wives.
He's been a destructive force in
the lives of his step-children.
He's cheated the city. His partners.
His employees. He's paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars in penalties and
fines over the years. I don't like
those things. I don't expect you to
like them. There will be other things
during the course of this trial that
you will hear about and like even
less. But this isn't a popularity
contest. It's a murder trial and
Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

KEVIN
What are you talking about?
MRS. LOMAX
We stayed a week. The Tremont
Hotel, it's not there anymore, I
went by and it's gone -- they had
a restaurant downstairs and we ate
there almost every meal --
KEVIN
Wait.

More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is
his frighteningly grim determination.
Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out.

Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in

restaurant.
(waiting)
Finish the story.
MRS. LOMAX
He talked to me. Nobody'd ever
really talked to me before. Sixteen
years old, a thousand miles away
from home, somebody takes an
interest... Working so hard,
putting himself through school,
I'd never met anybody like that.
Knew the Bible, every word, just
knew it by heart. Every meal,
there he was, at my ear and I
just... I didn't want that week to
ever end. But it did. He came to
say goodbye, it was late, and I
started to cry and he said not to
worry, 'Behold, I send you out as
sheep amidst the wolves.' And that
just stopped me cold because we'd
spent that whole day at Bible study
reading Matthew Ten and there was
just no way for him to know about
that, so I was... I took it as a
sign. I let him in. And then
everything was different. He was
cruel. He was so cruel and I was
so ashamed, I thought I'd die...
Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase.
Mary Ann...
MRS. LOMAX
I promised right there if God would
let me back into His grace I would
never leave again. I prayed there
was a reason this terrible thing
had happened. There had to be a
reason. And there was. It was
you. You were my blessing. You
were reason enough to endure
anything. How much I love you.

choice. 'You know what scares me,
John? I leave the case, she gets
better and I hate her for it...'
Remember?
KEVIN
You set me up.
It's entrapment.

Who told you to pull out the stops
for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the
direction you took -- Snake
handlers, Popes and swamis all
feeding at the same trough -- whose
ideas were those? And then
Cullen -- knowing he's guilty --
seeing those pictures -- putting
that lying bitch on the stand...

time to lose, right? You didn't

Kevin alone with the mirror and his
reflection.
And then it's over. He's made his decision. Replacing
his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --

Kevin walking through. His game face.
A court officer
opening the doors and --
CUT TO:

Kevin entering. Standing there a moment. Searching for
Heath in the back of the courtroom. He's not there. A
single empty seat.
Kevin moving quickly down the aisle.
Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin
comes in behind her. Embracing her. Holding her tightly
to him with a fervor that we alone will understand.
MARY ANN
Honey, what are you doing?
(quietly)
Are you okay?
Kevin nods. Smiles. Backs away. Into his seat.
Gettys
there beside him. Kevin will not look at him.
BAILIFF
All rise for the honorable Justice
Garson Deeds.
The Judge enters.
Takes his seat.
JUDGE
(to Barbara)
You're still under oath, young
lady.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
(to Kevin)
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
KEVIN
Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry,
but I can no longer represent my
client. I need to be replaced as
counsel.
Another silence. But this one isn't very long. There
will be chaos in the courtroom. Gettys will freak out
and the press will start running for the phones and the
Judge will be banging that gavel, as we --

As the doors open and the chaos begins to spill into the
hallway. Kevin trying to rush away with Mary Ann but
right behind them --
REPORTER
Kevin! -- Hey!
(catching up)
Listen, this story -- this is the
one, pal -- this is the one you
dream about --
KEVIN
There is no story.
REPORTER
Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis
of conscience? You gotta be
kidding. It's huge!
KEVIN
They're gonna disbar me, Larry.
You can cover that.
MARY ANN
Can they do that?
REPORTER
Not when I get through with the
story.
(still walking)
You gotta talk, Kevin. You gotta
gimme an exclusive.

REPORTER
(CONT'D)
This is wire service.
This is
'Sixty Minutes'. This
is a story
that needs to be told.
It's you!
You're a star!
KEVIN
Call me tomorrow.
REPORTER
You got it.
First thing.
Kevin nods.
Holding Mary Ann's hand as they escape.

The Reporter watching them go for a moment.
Then turning
back.

(EFX) And as he does, his features change, transforming - - like
that -- into Milton.
288

It's Milton.
Always there.
And he smiles.
And we FREEZE FRAME.
FADE OUT.
