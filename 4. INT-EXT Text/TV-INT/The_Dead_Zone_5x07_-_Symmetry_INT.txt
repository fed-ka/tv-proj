          Somebody is sleeping on a couch, covered by a blanket. 
          As the blanket is slowly thrown back, we see JOHNNY.  He
          sits up, still in his clothes.

          For a moment he's lost in the dream, can't place where he
          is.  An attractive woman in her mid-30s, MAIYA, comes out
          of the kitchen.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                                (looking around)
                          I forgot where I was.  Like a
                        dream.

          Johnny notices about a dozen child-like drawings tacked
          up around the room.  Not bad for a kid.  Maiya appears
          with a cup of coffee and hands it to him.

                                        MAIYA
                        What was it about?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        What?

                                        MAIYA
                        Your dream.

                        I can't remember.
                                (re: his clothes)
                        I must have been pretty tired.

                                        MAIYA
                        It was after 2 when you got here. 
                        I can't thank you enough.

          There's a real connection here.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Listen, Maiya, the phone calls in
                        the middle of the night, the hang
                        ups, it has to be your ex-husband,
                        right?  Which means he knows where
                        you are.

          Maiya, clearly upset, reflects for a moment.

                                        MAIYA
                          Remember how I always used to say
                          I wanted an unconventional life,
                        to live on the edge?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Sounds like Cole's a little too
                        edgy.

          Maiya overcome, fights tears.

                                        MAIYA
                        How did I get into this mess?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        You can't blame yourself.

                                        MAIYA
                        Cole was... he turned into somebody
                        I don't even know.  The things he
                        did... I had to get away from
                        him.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        If he violates the restraining
                        order, you can have him sent to
                        jail.

                                        MAIYA
                        What about Siena?  He's her father. 
                        What's it going look like if I
                        have him sent to prison?

                        He said he'd never let me take
                        his daughter away.

          A little girl, SIENA, 6, comes running out into the
          kitchen, her ever-present crayons and drawing pad in tow. 
          She's an old soul in the body of a child.

                        Good morning.

                        Why did you come over in the middle
                        of the night?

          Johnny and Maiya exchange a look, it's clear she doesn't
          want to worry her daughter.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                                (spots the eggs)
                        I had a craving for your mom's
                        world famous mushroom omelette. 
                        Hungry?

                        don't know all the things there
                        are to do in Maine.

                        I bet I do.  I bet I've done them.

          Siena shows Johnny her drawings of each activity.

                        We're going blueberry picking. 
                        And lobstering.  And... Have you
                        ever found buried treasure?

                        That one I missed.

          Siena flips to a DRAWING of a MAN AND A LITTLE GIRL UNDER
          A PALM TREE.

                        My daddy told me about how he was

                          someday.  In the Land of Gold.

          Maiya, uncomfortable at the mention of Cole, deflects.

          Siena runs out of the room, Maiya eyes her, worried.

                        You're doing the right thing.

          She touches his face.

          Maiya grabs a hand-crocheted scarf and starts to wind it
          around her neck.

          Maiya rethinks the scarf, unwinds it, drops it on the
          kitchen counter.  Siena runs past them like a bullet.

                        this connection.

                                        BRUCE
                        She sounds perfect.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She feels perfect.

          Again, he looks at Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The doctors told me coma patients
                        lose memories, but why is all
                        this coming back to me now? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, why now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't you have something else you
                        need to do?

                                        BRUCE
                        Not a thing.  I'm all yours.

          He smiles at him again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great.  Guess I'm saddled with
                        you.

                                        BRUCE
                                (secret smile)
                        Guess so.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ignoring, back to
                                  business)
                        Let's head back to Maiya's house. 
                        See if I can pick up a clue about
                        where she and Siena might have
                        gone.



          CAMERA tracks Johnny as Desmond as he moves through the
          living room, looks at A ROW OF PHOTOS on the mantel: Maiya
          with Siena at different ages, a younger Maiya and an
            AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY dressed in togas at a frat party. 
          He picks that one up.  As a flicker of recognition...

          SFX: DOORBELL RINGS

            Johnny/Desmond goes to the door.

                                        DESMOND
                        Sheriff Bannerman told me you
                        might be able to help.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You spoke to Walt?

                                        DESMOND
                        When I took him Maiya's scarf. 
                        He said you'd need something of
                        hers to touch.

          Johnny eyes his surroundings -- weird, he was just here,
          but somehow it all feels different.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was here last night.

          He seems unsure even as the words leave his mouth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She called me.  She was afraid
                        Cole had followed her.

                                        DESMOND
                        That's strange.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        DESMOND
                        She called me, too.  I came over
                        and spent the night on the couch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You slept on the couch?

                                        DESMOND
                        Then this morning, after she and
                        Siena left, Cole shows up. 
                          Sonofabitch sucker punched me.

          Rubs his cheek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Cole punched you?

          Johnny's mind is racing now, as he starts coughing, then
          sputtering.

                                        DESMOND
                        Dude, are you okay?

          Johnny gets up and staggers up against the door.  He's
          choking as he reaches for his throat.  Desmond comes up
          close to his face, it seems bizarre.

                                        DESMOND
                        What's wrong?  What's happening
                        to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't breathe!

                                                                          FLASH CUT TO:



          Johnny is suddenly driving.  There's nobody in the
          passenger's seat.  He seems both disappointed and relieved.*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Where could she be? *
                                (racking his brain)*
                        What do I know about her?

          Suddenly a PARTY FAVOR HORN blasts in his ear!  He spins*
          around to FIND Bruce sitting behind him in the back seat,
          SMILING.

                                        BRUCE
                        Happy birthday, Johnny!

          Johnny tries to keep control of the car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's great.  Why don't you just
                        drive us into a tree while you're
                        at it?

                                        BRUCE
                        Wasn't me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I figured that out.

          Johnny looks up into the rear-view mirror, but Bruce is
          gone.  Suddenly, he gets the party favor blasted at him
          again, but now from the passenger seat.

          REVEAL Bruce, now magically sitting beside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to stop saying that.

                                        BRUCE
                        Like I said, it wasn't me.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        If you're my subconscious, why do*

                        dude that popped you in the eye? 
                        We gonna kick his ass?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We aren't going to do anything. 
                        You're just here for moral support.

                                        BRUCE
                        I can do that.  But I'd like to
                        try out some karate moves I learned
                        in high school.

          Bruce chops his hands through the air with the playful
          energy of a kid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Judo and I learned it at the
                          Y.M.C.A.  If you're going to be
                        me, at least get it right.

                                        BRUCE
                          Whatever.  The fact is you don't
                        find Maiya, you might be lookin'
                        at another long, dark, sleep.

          Johnny knows he's right.  Hell, it's his own fear.

                        Because I can't think of any place
                        else to start.  Can you?

          Bruce shrugs, then blasts him with the party favor again.

                                        BRUCE
                        Happy birthday to... us! Get it? 
                        Happy birthday to you and me.

          Johnny is not amused.

                                        BRUCE
                                (stop laughing, deadpan)
                        Dude, you need to seriously lighten
                        up.

          Johnny just shoots him a look as he reacts and we FLASH
          CUT TO...


          Walt is checking something in a file cabinet, as
            Johnny/Desmond ENTERS (hand bandaged--PRODUCTION CHOICE). 
          Bruce isn't with him as he steps into the office.  Walt
          sees Johnny, but there's an odd feeling of distance.

                                        WALT
                          I didn't expect to see you back
                        so soon.

          He walks away as Johnny/Desmond follows.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I got kind'a turned around.  I
                        wanted to see if you'd heard
                          anything about Maiya?

                                        WALT
                        Same thing I told you before. 
                        We're looking for her.

    31CONTINUED:31

          He walks away again.  Johnny is beginning to get an
            uncomfortable vibe.  Again, he follows.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I was just wondering if maybe you
                        could assign a few more people to
                        the search?  Make it a priority
                        case?

          Walt looks at him with a hard expression.

                                        WALT
                        I know you're worried about your
                        friend, but I already told you,
                        we're looking for her.  All my
                          deputies have copies of her
                          picture.  That's all I can do.

          Again Walt walks away.  Johnny seems totally confused
          now.

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE
                        Y'ever get the feeling you might
                        be invisible?


          REVEAL BRUCE

          He's sitting on the desk next to Johnny.  Walt does not
          see him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, what's it gonna take, a
                          lightning bolt from Heaven?  The
                        guy isn't seeing you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me?

                                        BRUCE
                                (knocks on Johnny's
                                head)
                        Hello?!  You see anybody else
                        around here?

          He's right.  Johnny looks around, then steps over to the
          glass window and checks his reflection.  Bruce is suddenly
          standing beside him.

          REFLECTION - DESMOND

          He sees Desmond's image staring back at him.

          Oddly, Bruce has no reflection at all.

                                (in Johnny's VOICE)
                        That's why Walt is acting funny. 
                        He thinks I'm Desmond.

          RESUME BRUCE AND JOHNNY

          Standing side by side.

                                        BRUCE
                        You are Desmond.  I mean, you're
                        you, but you're also... It's
                          complicated.

          Walt walks back into the room.

                                        WALT
                        Still here?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Look, Sheriff, I know you don't
                        know me, but I'd really appreciate
                        it if you'd tell me what's going
                        on?  Please, it's important.

          Walt turns to him.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        What about Johnny Smith?

                                        WALT
                        What about him?

          Johnny hesitates, as suddenly Bruce is REVEALED sitting
          on top of the file cabinet.

                                        BRUCE
                        Uh-oh.  You opened a big can'a
                        worms now.

                        I just know he's concerned about
                        finding Maiya.  Don't you think
                        you ought'a consider him?

                                        WALT
                          Johnny'll find you if he needs
                        you.  He can take care of himself.

                                        BRUCE

          Bruce puts his hand up to his mouth like a child with a
          secret.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

                                        WALT
                        Go home.  We'll find her.
                          Everything'll be all right. 

          Walt walks away.  As Bruce suddenly appears standing next
          to Johnny.

                        That's what he thinks.  What now
                          Birthday boy?

          Johnny thinks, then grabs the photo and looks at it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to go somewhere and think.

                        Good idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I wasn't asking your opinion.

          Johnny walks away.

                        Now you're mad at me?  That doesn't

                        Yeah.  But look at this car.  I
                        always wanted a Mustang.

                        Sorry.  What now?

          Johnny looks into the rear-view mirror.

          REFLECTION

          As he sees Cole's eyes staring back at him.


          Johnny looks around and notices a receipt folded and stuck
          into the ash tray.  He picks it up and unfolds it.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                        It's a motel receipt.  Cole must
                        be staying somewhere near the
                        coast.

          Johnny digs into his pocket and pulls out a motel room
          key.

                        Let's go check my motel room.

          Johnny fires up the engine.

          Johnny takes one last look in the mirror, then...

                        can.

                        Fun, isn't it?

          Johnny picks up on the energy of the room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can feel him.

          Bruce sees TWO AIRLINE TICKETS on the night table.  And a
          TRAVEL BOOK about Peru.  A BROCHURE that says "Incan
            Treasure: Visit the LAND OF GOLD."

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like he's planning a trip. 
                        There are only two tickets.

          As Johnny stares at the brochure, emotions begin churning
          inside him.  As he channels Cole's rage, he violently
          shoves the bed out of the way, revealing a SUITCASE
          underneath it.

                                        BRUCE

          Johnny/Cole tosses the suitcase on the bed, violently
          rips through it until he stops, and lifts out a HANDGUN. 
          He steps back holding the gun, sits on the end of the

          clues as to where Maiya might be.

          He tosses around little notepapers by the phone, maps,
          address books.  Doesn't see what he's looking for.

                        find Maiya.

          Johnny pops in suddenly.  Looks around.  The remains of a
          birthday party.  Plates of half-eaten cake.  Glasses of
          wine.  Wrapping paper.

                        I'm me.  I mean, I'm us.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          He turns away trying to figure it out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was last night.  My birthday
                        party.  Why am I here?  This has
                        nothing to do with finding Maiya.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe it does, maybe it does.

          Johnny shoots him a look and walks out into the foyer.

          Johnny sees Walt, Sarah and JJ with Vision Johnny by the
          door, the last of the party guests.

          Bruce leans over to Johnny, a drink in hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Those Bannermans.  Always the
                        last to leave.

          Johnny ignores him, watches himself say good-night to his
          friends.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Thanks, you guys.  This was great.

          Sarah gives him a hug.

                                        SARAH
                        'Night, Johnny.  Happy birthday.

          She heads out the front door. Walt slaps him on the back.

                                        WALT
                        Good night, old man.

          Walt starts out. JJ shyly slips a small gift wrapped in
          comics into Vision Johnny's pocket.

                                        JJ
                        This is from me.  It's dumb.

          Vision Johnny smiles at him.

                        Bet it isn't.

          JJ stops his hand.

                                        JJ
                        Don't look now, okay?  Later.

          Vision Johnny smiles at JJ's pre-teen embarrassment. 
          Can't show emotions, not cool.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Okay.  Thanks though.

          As JJ leaves and Vision Johnny waves good-night out the
          front door, then looks at the mess and shuts off the lights
          and climbs the stairs.

            A gleeful Bruce drags Johnny over to a FISH TANK.

                                        BRUCE
                        You always wanted a fish tank.

          Johnny looks in the tank.  A fish floats belly-up on the
          surface.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They cost extra to do that?

                        You can't hurt my feelings.  I'm

                        How could I forget?

          He's about to turn away when he sees something.  Looks
          closer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Siena talked about searching for
                        buried treasure.  I forgot about
                        that.

                                        BRUCE
                        Where do kids go to look for
                          treasure?

          Johnny looks back at the fish tank.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The beach.  Sarah said they found
                        me on the coast highway.

          Bruce reappears on the other side of him.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's great!  Maine has 3,478
                        miles of coastline.  Where do we
                        start?

          Johnny ponders the problem, as...



          The house is neat again.  Johnny as Maiya is pulling framed
          photos out of a cardboard box, looking for one in
          particular.  He pulls one out.

          INSERT SHOT: Photo of Maiya and Siena AT THE BEACH.

            Suddenly, the phone rings, catching Johnny/Maiya off guard.

          His expression changes to alarm.  He hangs up quickly.

                        There was nobody there.

            Johnny/Maiya reacts, suddenly looking across the room
          into a wall mirror and seeing,

          REFLECTION - MAIYA

                                        MAIYA

                        Oh my God.  Look at me.

          Siena comes in, looking sleepy, carrying her sketch pad.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          As he turns away from the mirror.

                                        JOHNNY/MAIYA
                        Did the phone wake you?  I'm sorry. 
                          Everything's okay. Go back to
                        sleep, sweetie.

          He looks at Bruce and shrugs.

                                        SIENA
                        I can't sleep.  I need a story.

                        I know.  Why don't you draw me a
                          picture!

          Bruce shoots him a thumbs up.

                                        SIENA
                        Of what?  Of Daddy and the Land

                        Of me and you.  How's that sound?

          As Johnny/Maiya reaches for the phone, Siena shows Johnny
            a drawing from the pad.

                                        SIENA

          Bruce and Johnny exchange a look.  That's it.

          of the chaos, holding Siena's drawing.  Bruce pops in.

          Desmond comes out of the bedroom, also mid-search, more
          papers in his hand.  Johnny is startled to see him.

                        I came here with Desmond to look
                        for a clue.

                        You had a vision?

          Bruce pops out.  Johnny/Vision Johnny nods.  As he and
          Desmond rush out,

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Johnny jumps in the car, starts it.

          Through the windshield, sees Desmond come hurrying out of
          the house towards him.



          Johnny/Cole looks up from the dashboard as someone gets
          in the car next to him.

                                          JOHNNY/COLE

                        So close now I can feel her.

          He looks over, expecting Desmond.  But it's Bruce.  Bruce
          smiles.

          Johnny reacts,

                        What are you doing here?

          Realizes he's in a different car.  He looks out the
          windshield towards what should be Maiya's house.  But
          he's not right in front of Maiya's house.  The Range Rover
          is.  He's parked across the street.

          Cole's face looking back at him.

                        I saw it.  Treasure Beach.

                        Johnny, you have a concussion. 
                        The doctor said you need to--

                        Cole was watching the house.  He
                          followed us.  That's how he found
                        her.  What happened?  Tell me. 
                        Where's Maiya?

          Bruce and Walt exchange a look.

                                        WALT
                        You were lucky.  That kind of
                        rage.  I don't think anyone could
                        have stopped him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's dead?  Maiya's... dead?

          On Johnny's despair,

          Pick up with guilt-ridden Johnny still reeling from his
            realization.  He's getting dressed.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Why couldn't I see that?  I led
                        him right to her.
                                (beat)
                        I made this happen.

                        Cole did this, not you.

                        We still have a problem, John.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                        Cole's taken Siena.  The police
                        have no idea where.

                                        WALT
                        I've put out an APB and a full
                        Amber Alert.  We don't think he
                        would hurt his own daughter, but...

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        I have to find her.

          As Vision Johnny gets up, a DOCTOR comes in.

                                        DOCTOR
                        You're awake, that's good. 

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        I need to go.

          Johnny reaches for his clothes, starts getting dressed
          (pulls on his pants, hospital gown still on top).

                                        DOCTOR
                        Mr. Smith, I have to warn you.  A
                          concussion, with a previous history
                        of brain injury, is a very serious
                        situation.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                          A little girl's life is at stake.

                                        DOCTOR
                        I can't tell you how dangerous
                        this might be.

                        I'll be with him, Doctor.

          The doctor hesitates a beat, then exits.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        We've got to find Cole.  The last
                        place anyone saw him was at the
                        beach?  Treasure Beach.

          Walt nods.  Johnny reaches for his personal effects on
          the table next to his bed--wallet, keys, watch.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        We'll start there, see if I can
                        get a hit off something--

          He stops, halted by the sight of a SMALL GIFT, wrapped in
          a sheet of comic book paper resting next to his watch on
          the bedside table.  He reaches for it, an odd feeling
          washing over him, almost like a sixth sense.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        What's this?

                                        SARAH
                        A birthday present.  From JJ. 
                        With everything that happened...
                        you didn't get a chance to open
                        it yet.

          Johnny slips off the paper (it comes off easily) and holds
          a PENKNIFE in his hand.  He sits back down heavily on the
          bed, staring at the penknife (SUBTEXT: he realizes it
          could've helped him).

          A voice comes from the doorway.

                                        OBSERVER BRUCE
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

          Johnny suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
          with Observer Bruce, looking at Vision Johnny sitting on
          the bed.

          The Johnny in the doorway realizes,

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm still in the vision.

          He takes it in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is what happens if I don't
                        change this. 

          He looks at Bruce, as it dawns on him.

          From the reflection on the car window, we see that Johnny
          is Cole, at the wheel of the Mustang.  Through his
          windshield, in the distance he's watching Vision Johnny
          and Desmond.  They are standing next to Maiya's car. 
          Vision Johnny has just touched it.  Vision Johnny and
          Desmond split up.

          Once they are out of sight, Johnny/Cole gets out of the
          car.



            Johnny/Maiya, amped by seeing Cole, enters the cave, 
            worriedly searching for Siena.

                                        JOHNNY/MAIYA
                        Hey, Siena, you in here? 

          No answer.  Johnny/Maiya's eyes dart around, panicked, as
          he doesn't see Siena, tries to keep the tremor out of his
          voice.

                                        JOHNNY/MAIYA
                                (sing song)
                        Come out, come out wherever you
                        are...

          Suddenly Siena comes rushing out from around a corner. 
            Johnny/Maiya sighs with relief.

                                        SIENA
                        Look, Mommy, treasure!

            Johnny/Maiya comes closer, looks into the palm of Siena's
          little hand, sees a sparkly piece of rock.

                                        JOHNNY/MAIYA
                        Pyrite.

                          Pirate's treasure.

            Johnny/Maiya kneels down, talks calmly but firmly to Siena.

                                        JOHNNY/MAIYA
                        Listen, Picasso, I need you to do
                          something for me.  Stay right
                        here, okay?

                        You get another turn, okay?   
                        Stay hidden until I come back. 
                          Promise?

          Siena nods, hides.  Johnny/Maiya hates leaving her, but
          it's the safest thing.  As Johnny/Maiya leaves the cave
