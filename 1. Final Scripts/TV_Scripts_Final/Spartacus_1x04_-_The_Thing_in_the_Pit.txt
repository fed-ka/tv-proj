  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - DAY

  CLOSE ON a well-muscled back.  WIDEN to REVEAL SPARTACUS, 
  Sura's binding beneath his shackled wrist as TWO GUARDS lead 
  him to the cliff.

  BATIATUS

  stands waiting for him, looking out across the parched 
  mountains.  The Guards shove Spartacus forward.  A beat.

                        No, Dominus.

  Batiatus finally looks over, pinning Spartacus with hard 
  eyes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yet you dishonor me.  An agreement 
                        reached, an oath sworn!  You would 
                        submit to gladiatorial training!  
                        Call me master and attend the 
                        rules!  In return, I would search 
                        for your dear precious wife!  But 
                        your haste bested you.  Defying 
                        Doctore. Maneuvering to usurp 
                        Gnaeus to face Crixus in the arena.

  -- Spartacus is SLAMMED onto a table by BARCA and ASHUR. -- 
  Ashur grabs a large CLAY POT filled with ASH and BLOOD. -- 
  Ashur haphazardly SMEARS a handful of the crimson mixture 
  over Spartacus  writhing torso and face as Barca struggles 
  to restrain him. -- Ashur grabs SURA S PURPLE BINDING on 
  Spartacus  wrist, struggles to remove it. Spartacus goes 
  berserk, manages to forearm shiver Ashur, sending the 
  cripple crashing to the stone floor.

                                        ASHUR
                        Thracian bitch.

  Spartacus lunges forward, but Barca grabs his neck, forcing 
  him back onto the table, hard -- he s going nowhere. 
  Spartacus chokes as Barca s grip tightens like a vise.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Barca! Release!

  REVEAL Batiatus, stepping through the threshold. Barca nods, 
  releases his stranglehold.

                                        BARCA
                        Dominus.

  Spartacus sucks in staccato breaths as Batiatus stands over 
  him. Ashur recovers, glaring at Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I think it best your wife s binding 
                        remains here. Where you re going, 
                        you may lose it. Along with your 
                        arm.

  Batiatus offers his hand. Spartacus hesitates, then unties 
  the binding and reluctantly hands it to Batiatus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

  Batiatus exits. As Barca restrains Spartacus, Ashur pulls 
  out another handful of the crimson mixture from the clay jar 
  and slams it into Spartacus  jaw, SMASHING US TO --


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Batiatus quickly strides down the corridor, Sura s binding 
  dangling between his fingers. DOCTORE appears.

                        cannot be tamed, it must be

  CLOSE ON a damp SPONGE held by Naevia as she dabs at the

  Lucretia glowers, not pleased with the answer. Batiatus

  dagger.

                        Crixus remains the single draw of 
                        the ludus. All interest of 
                        employment for the games falls 
                        squarely upon his shoulders. Of the 
                        new recruits, Varro is the only man 
                      of promise. Spartacus and Kerza 
                        prove worthless in the arena. So I 
                        fight them both tonight where they 
                        may yet fill our purse.

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The punishing sun beats down on the parched earth. 
  Gladiators train, sweat dotting their hardened bodies. 
  CAMERA FINDS CRIXUS and VARRO, intensely sparring, their 
  muscles bulging with each vicious blow. TIME SLOWS as

  SPARTACUS

  enters the square in shackles, led by Barca and Ashur. His 
  brow set, the crimson and ash veneer inviting stares from 
  Gladiators who have lowered their swords to gawk at the 
  walking dead man.

  Crixus spits in contempt. Varro tenses, taking in the 
    information. Doctore cracks his whip.

  The men resume training. Doctore recoils his whip, eyeing 
  Spartacus with stern regret as he s shoved next to KERZA, 
  also smeared with ash and blood. A tense beat as they 
  exchange looks.

  Spartacus ignores the remark. Kerza s face darkens.

  INT. THE PITS - NIGHT

  -- KERZA S JAW CRACKING as it COLLIDES with a mallet of a 
  FIST, sending

  RIVULETS OF BLOOD

  through the air in SLOW MOTION, SPLATTERING ACROSS the FACES 
  of the BLOODTHIRSTY DREGS that make up this MOTLEY CROWD 
  encircling the death fights -- a stark contrast to the 
  pageantry of the arena. TIME RESUMES as they HOWL for blood, 
  loving the gratuitous gore. CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES around

  IXION,

    a gargantuan sadist wearing his last victim s FLAYED FACE AS 
  A MASK. He stalks a near-dead Kerza in the  ring  of the 
  abandoned blood-stained courtyard of a two-storied insula 
  known as  The Pits .

  KERZA

  screams as Ixion lands a bone-splintering blow, sending him 
  CRASHING to the ground. Ixion picks up a fallen RUSTY BLADE 
  and descends on him as the CAMERA MOVES


  INTO THE CROWD,

  its loud din drowning out Kerza s screams OFF-SCREEN. CAMERA 
  finds CORPSES of losing fighters hanging from meat hooks, 
  illuminated by the blazing CREMATORY at the periphery.

  A DROOLING OGRE OF A MAN

  fucking a CARBUNCLED, ANDROGYNOUS WHORE from the rear, 
  cheers the fight as he grunts and thrusts.

  UGLY MEN AND EVEN UGLIER WOMEN,

  in various states of unkemptness, drink, fight, and fuck. 
  MONEY exchanges grimy hands at a furious rate as the 
  denizens bet on the death match. Come to rest on 

  SPARTACUS

  shackled in the cell adjacent to the fighting area. His eyes 
  study the bizarre surroundings. He s never witnessed fights 
  of this nature in Thrace, nor the arena. These are not men, 
  but animals. And to survive, he must become one. Ashur 
  drifts past, joining

  BATIATUS

  by the cage door, frowning at the beating Kerza s taking. 
  Barca looms at his side as promised, his eyes alertly 
  scanning for any potential danger.

                        You will be the first to receive 
                        what is due, I assure you.

                        Unless you d care to press the 
                        matter...?

  Barca takes a step forward, looming over the much smaller 
  Ovidius. Ovidius grits his teeth, realizing there s nothing 
  he can do.

                                          OVIDIUS
                      At your convenience then. Until 
                        such time, the points accrue.

  Ovidius moves off. Batiatus  face darkens.

                                        BATIATUS

                        again, I will accrue your fucking 
                        head.

  The crowd ERUPTS, drawing Batiatus  attention to IXION, 
  howling victoriously. He hoists the gore-dripping

  FLAYED FACE OF KERZA

  up to the crowd. REVEAL Kerza s limp body lying in a pool of 
  his own blood, head devoid of skin. Ixion stands proud, 
  takes a bite from the facial flesh and spits it into the 
  crowd -- a cannibalistic souvenir for the merciless gawkers.

  ANUBIS,

  a huge, unpleasant man with a scarred face and milky eye, 
  steps forward to proclaim the winner.

  The crowd ROARS. Two BRUTES appear. One shackles Ixion 
  before escorting him out of the ring, while the other 
  removes Kerza by impaling his chest with a meat hook, then 
  dragging the limp body through the crowd, rest on

                                          SPARTACUS,
                        who watches Kerza s fate. 
                        Spartacus  eyes burn with 
                          determination, readying himself for 
                        his first bout.

  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Naevia escorts Crixus through the villa, passing various 
  SLAVES attending the place. Crixus  eyes fall on her neck, 
  which is absent the OPAL NECKLACE he gave her in 103.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your neck is bare.

                        You did not favor it, then? The 
                        necklace I gave you?

  She pulls the necklace from her robes and presses it into 
  his hand. Crixus hardens at the rebuke.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

  Lucretia stands with her back to Crixus as he enters. She is 
  a vision in a sheer robe, as beautiful as she is commanding.

                        more.

                        Draw closer, and make it so.

  He complies, taking her in his arms and kissing her. She 
  melts into him hungrily -- and discovers his hand clenched.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        What are you clutching? Show me.

  Crixus is forced to think on his feet.

                        A humble offering. For a goddess.

  He opens his hand, revealing the opal necklace.

                        Help me put it on.

  She removes her emerald necklace. He slides behind her, 
  draping the simpler opal necklace round her neck. He begins 
  kissing her neck, then slides her robe off her shoulders. 
  His hands explore her nakedness. She moans, grinding against 
  him.

  her. She gasps in ecstasy. As he works himself in and out of 
  her, PAN OVER to the DOORWAY where

                        death descend anew! Behold, Myrmex!

  The crowd roars and cheers as MYRMEX, a chiseled Egyptian 
  whose face is covered in tattoos, is led up. He grins at the 
  crowd, eyes blazing with the red mist of blood-lust.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Behold, Spartacus!

  Spartacus is led up, his face set in stone. The crowd jeers 
  and hisses, a few pelting him with garbage.

  BATIATUS,

  flanked by Barca and Ashur, frowns at the reaction.

  Myrmex reaches in and pulls out the small BLOODIED KNOB OF A 
  FEMUR. Anubis inspects the selection, then declares --

  NOTE: Sphairai (ancient spiked gloves). Shouts from the 
  crowd placing bets as a BRUTE emerges from the shadows, 
  quickly attaches the Sphairai onto Myrmex s hands and 
  forearms as Anubis thrusts the urn at Spartacus. Spartacus 
  reaches in and pulls out a PIECE OF JAW BONE. Anubis

  Spartacus  forearms and hands. Barca frowns at the 
  selection.

  Ashur nods, moves off to place the bet. The Brutes finish 
  equipping Myrmex and Spartacus. Anubis addresses the crowd.

                        Charon arrives!

  Anubis throws his arms up. The Brutes shove Spartacus and 
  Myrmex into the blood encrusted fighting area. The crowd 
  shouts and cheers, craving blood.

  SPARTACUS AND MYRMEX

  circle one another, the din all but deafening. Myrmex 
    sadistically smiles, then PUNCTURES his tongue with one of 
  the spikes from his Sphairai. His mouth instantly floods 
  with blood, which he promptly

  SPITS

  at Spartacus, the blood splattering his face. Spartacus 
  quickly wipes away the blood. Myrmex seizes the distraction, 
  attacking Spartacus and opening a gash across his chest with 
  his spiked gloves. Spartacus counters, on the defensive.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Spartacus and Myrmex trade blows. Spartacus is getting 
  the worst of it, his blood SPLATTERING the crowd.

  BATIATUS

  wipes a fleck of blood from his cheek, frowning sourly at 
  the proceedings. The gods seem truly against him.

  MYRMEX

  lands a painful blow, roars to the crowd. They greet him 
  with cheers.

  SPARTACUS  POV

  of the crowd, distorted through the pain, the cacophony 
  assaulting him as if from underwater.

  ON SPARTACUS

  as he shakes the pain from him, his jaw setting in anger and 
    determination. Myrmex attacks. Spartacus is driven back, 
  recovers, unleashes a barrage of savage blows. Blood flies, 
  splashing Anubis, , but Myrmex refuses to go down.  He 
  retaliates, driving Spartacus back towards

  ONE OF THE MEAT HOOKS

  hanging from the rafters.  Spartacus grabs the hook and 
  SLAMS IT UP through Myrmex's jaw.  Myrmex screams, blood 
  spewing from his mouth as he grabs Spartacus around the 
  throat, strangling him.  Spartacus chokes, punches Myrmex in 
  the ribs in an attempt to get him to release.  Losing 
    consciousness, Spartacus desperately grabs the hook and

  RIPS MYRMEX'S FUCKING JAW OFF

  in a spray of gore.  It flies into the crowd, causing a 
  commotion as the crowd scrambles for the gory souvenir. 
  Myrmex stands dazed, blood spewing from torn arteries as his 
  tongue flops loosely.  A frozen moment.  Myrmex collapses, 
  dead.  Anubis steps forward.

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  money exchanging hands.

  SPARTACUS

  stands bloodied and exhausted, the fight having cost him 
  dearly.

  BATIATUS

  beams in excitement and relief.  Barca laughs in delight 
  over the unexpected victory.

                        Give him a moment's rest.  Then

  Spartacus sitting on one of the tables as the MEDICUS tends

  WIDEN TO REVEAL SURA is now by his side in her blue Thracian 
  dress. Spartacus takes her in with a warm smile, drawing 
  strength from her presence.

  Spartacus suddenly winces in pain, the lighting smashing 
  back to normal. POP WIDE, revealing the Medicus stitching up 
  another gash. Sura is gone, a fleeting dream. OFF Spartacus, 
  his wounds deeper than mere flesh and blood...

  INT. BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus trudges down the corridor in a haze of exhaustion 
  and pain. A GRUNTING SOUND echoes from BARCA S CELL. 
  Spartacus absently glances in as he passes, spotting

  BARCA FUCKING PIETROS

  inside. Pietros MOANS in pleasure, smiling at Spartacus as 
  another thrust sends him into ecstasy. Spartacus continues 
  down the corridor, arriving at

  THE BARRACKS

  where Varro and a knot of Gladiators lie sprawled across the 
    straw-littered floor. Varro half rises at the sight of 
  Spartacus, glad to see him yet breathing.

  locks eyes with Hamilcar -- then turns and exits, too weary 
  to argue.

                      In the business of jewelry, 
                        perhaps.

  Lucretia turns, finds SOLONIUS encroaching, accompanied by 
  several SLAVES.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A beautiful piece. Allow me to buy 
                        from you. At full price.

  Ramel glares as Solonius fishes out his purse of coins.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You have a woman in mind that would 
                        favor it, Solonius?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Indeed. She stands before me, a 
                        vision.

  He holds out the coins. She eyes them, hesitating.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Take it, and keep your emeralds. 
                        The thought of them against your 
                        skin warms mine.

                        I ll have your offer, Ramel.

  She hands Ramel the necklace. Solonius smiles at his 
  rejected proposal.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Pride. Always part of your 
                        considerable charm.

                        Beloved Ovidius mentioned something 
                        about fighting his men in The Pits.

  Lucretia tenses, embarrassed as Solonius sips from the skin.

                        A temporary measure.

                        With honor.

  Solonius bows to Lucretia, moves off. Lucretia glares after 
  him, turns to Ramel who hands her a small purse of coins.

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  The Gladiators train under the blazing sun. Sweat courses 
  down their rippling muscles, streaking filth from torsos. 
  Wooden swords CLASH against battered shields.

  SPARTACUS

  watches from across the square where he sits on the parched 
  earth.  Eyes distant and increasingly hollow, hand rubbing 
  his wrist where Sura's binding once resided.

  DOCTORE

  weaves his way through the men, whip ever in hand.

                                          DOCTORE

                        after Spartacus into The Pits.

  Crixus, Barca, and most of the other men LAUGH at Spartacus. 
  Varro frowns, feeling for his friend. Doctore cracks his 
  whip, the men pause, quieting down.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        The man is no base humor, to be 
                        laughed at.  He is a tale of 
                        caution.  Ponder over while you 
                        fill your bellies.  Eat!

  The men comply, heading towards the Mess Hall.  Pietros 
  approaches Spartacus with a small cup of water and a bowl of 
  gruel.

                                          PIETROS
                        A little porridge, and water.  Only 
                        a sip.  The drought...

  Spartacus takes it.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Thank you.

  Barca spots Pietros.

  Pietro hustles off.  Crixus laughs.

                        Your boy fancy the Thracian, does

  They turn to find Ashur limping up.

                        I always wondered how you acquired 
                        the name.

  Crixus stops, glares at Ashur.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

  Ashur forces a smile.

                        I was merely curious.  The gift I

                      An opal necklace, of the finest --

  Crixus  foot shoots out, kicking Ashur s bad leg out from 
  under him. He goes down hard, grunting in pain. Doctore 
  glances over, turns away.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your tongue rattles too freely in 
                        your mouth! Secure it, or see it 
                        join that useless leg of yours.

  Ashur deferentially backpedals.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies. The question was born of 
                        goodwill, I assure you.

                        Fuck your good will in the ass.

  Crixus moves away with Barca in tow. Ashur s eyes darken 
  with hatred as he painfully rises.

  Barca s eyes narrow.

  Barca turns to Batiatus, who stands on the other side of the 
  gate separating the Mess Hall from the stairs leading to the 
  villa.

                                        BATIATUS

  Spartacus painfully rises, the motion WIPING US TO --


  INT. THE PITS - NIGHT

  CORVUS, a scarred, blood-drenched fiend with muscles as hard 
  as petrified wood, connects an elbow to Spartacus  ash and 
  blood smeared jaw. Spartacus, drenched from head to toe with 
  sweat and blood, staggers back, the sword in his hand 
  tumbling from his grasp.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Corvus, forearms encased in blood-crusted steel, assaults 
  Spartacus. The background BLURS in and out of FOCUS around 
  Spartacus, the crowd s SHOUTS alternate between being 
  MUFFLED and HEIGHTENED. The beatings are taking a serious 
  toll.

  SPARTACUS SNARLS,

  countering the assault with a fist to Corvus  torso, the 
  impact sending shock waves of punishment through the brute s 
  body. Spartacus hammers. Corvus counters. The two stand toe-
  to-toe, slugging it out, blood flying.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.
  CONTINUED:

  CORVUS

  lands a crushing blow to the mid-section, reopening a GASH 
  over Spartacus  ribs. Spartacus grunts in pain. Corvus 
  surges, tackling him to the ground. His fists rain down, 
  pounding Spartacus  face into raw meat.

  BATIATUS

  eyes the action with concern. Barca looms behind his master, 
  enjoying the blood along with the SCREAMING CROWD -- now 
    considerably larger than the night before... a result of 
  word spread about Spartacus  victories.

                        worthless --

  SPARTACUS

  blocks a blow and HEADBUTTS Corvus, smashing his nose. 
  Corvus howls. Spartacus kicks him off of him and


  INTO THE CROWD,

  taking some of the rowdy fucks down with him. A few 
  overzealous fans join in the fun and kick Corvus while he s 
  down. Corvus rises, tossing the offenders aside as he rushes

  SPARTACUS,

  who greets him with bloodied fists. They trade devastating 
  blows, blood flying into the howling crowd. Spartacus takes 
  the brunt of the exchange, on the verge of getting his 
  brains knocked out. Corvus hauls back, launching his fist at 
  Spartacus  face. Spartacus bends out of the way at the last 
  second,

  GRABBING CORVUS AROUND THE NECK

  from behind. Corvus struggles, the capillaries in his eyes 
  BURSTING. Tears of BLOOD streak his cheeks. Spartacus roars 
  -- an animal, subhuman sound of rage. CRACK! Corvus  neck 
  snaps. The man goes limp, sliding from Spartacus  grasp, 
  dead before he hits the floor.

  THE CROWD ROARS

  at the victory. Spartacus sways, barely clinging to 
    consciousness. The crowd BLURS around him, their cheers a 
    REVERBERATING CLAMOR. His eyes fall on

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

  SURA,

  the lone FIGURE IN FOCUS standing at the front of the crowd. 
  She wears her blue dress, sans leather top. The dress is now 
  tattered and dirty. Tears fill her eyes, her heart breaking 
  at the agony Spartacus is forced to endure.

  ON SPARTACUS,

  his own eyes welling with tears at the sight of Sura, the 
  state of her dress. His hand reaches out, desperate to feel 
  her skin against his. It s snatched out of the air by

  ANUBIS,

  who throws it in the air to the roar of the crowd.

                                        ANUBIS
                        Spartacus! Victor!

  Batiatus raises his arms to the crowd.

                        Now that s how you send a shit to 
                        the afterlife!!!

  The crowd howls with laughter and cheers. Spartacus turns 
  back to where Sura was standing, only to find her gone. He 
  blinks the blood and sweat from his eyes, attempting to 
  regain his senses as two BRUTES shackle him.

  ASHUR

  weasels his way through the crowd, passing two DRUNKARDS as 
  he goes (we will see these men again later).  He draws up 
  next to Batiatus in excitement.

                                        ASHUR
                        The odds soar in Spartacus  favor. 
                        They believe he s unbeatable. A 
                        dead man whose soul refuses to 
                        leave its body.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus has no soul. It resides 
                      in the heart of another.

  Spartacus bloody, empty in his victory, is dragged towards 
  Batiatus by one of the Brutes.

  CRIXUS exits the bath, glistening and naked save a towel

  Guard opens the gate.

  The Guard secures the gate after Crixus, who starts for the 
  stairs.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Wait.

  Crixus pauses. Naevia watches as the Guard moves off.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Domina will grow impatient. You 
                        know the urgency of her desires --

  Naevia turns, satisfied the Guard is out of earshot. She 
  struggles to keep her voice low.

                                        NAEVIA
                        She did not summon you.

  Crixus eyes her in confusion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Then why am I here?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                        The necklace. You purchased it for 
                        me?

                                        CRIXUS
                      As I said.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Then why does it grace the neck of 
                        the Domina?

  Crixus stares in surprise, can t help but laugh at the 
  absurdity of the question.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The mind of a woman! Deflect a 
                        gesture then question where it 
                        lands. Your words -- I cannot 
                        accept this.

                        Yes. My words. Cut off before 
                        completion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And the others to follow?

                                        NAEVIA
                        That it is impossible for me to 
                        keep it, regardless of desire. 
                        There is nothing in my possession 
                        that was not given to me by Domina. 
                        Are you so thick that this fact was 
                        ignored? Did you think she would 
                        not notice?

  Crixus stares at her for an uncomfortable beat, the 
  realization of his mistake blossoming.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I... I misunderstood your meaning 
                      in the returning of it.

                                        NAEVIA
                      Of course you misunderstood! You 
                        have no mind outside the arena! You 
                        think only with your sword and your 
                        shield, you stupid, lumbering --

  Crixus abruptly pulls Naevia into a passionate kiss. Naevia 
  stiffens, momentarily acquiesces... then suddenly pulls 
  away. A charged beat.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  Words meant more for herself than Crixus.

                        Guard!

  She quickly retreats up the stairs.  Crixus watches her for 
  a moment as a hopeful, genuine grin bends his lips.  The 
  Guard reappears, unlocking the gate.  OFF Crixus as he exits 
  back into the ludus, barely containing the joy of the stolen 
  kiss...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus scrapes blood and ash off of his oiled skin with 
  shaking hands, WINCING with each stroke. The fights have 
  taken a devastating toll on him, both physical and mental.

                                        SURA (O.S.)
                        How much longer?

  SURA appears next to him, her blue dress in worse condition 
  than before. Her hair is becoming matted and stringy. While 
  still beautiful, her appearance is beginning to reflect 
  Spartacus  mental state.

                                        SURA

                        only thing that keeps my heart 
                        beating...

  She reaches down to touch his face. He closes his eyes, 
  taking solace from her warmth.

                        You look like shit.

  Spartacus opens his eyes to find Varro has entered. From 
  Varro s POV, Spartacus is alone. From Spartacus  POV, Sura 
  is still by his side.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        remains if I'm to save you.

  Varro eyes him with uncertainty, not understanding.

                        Save me from what? Spartacus...?

  Spartacus blinks, his eyes struggling to focus his reason, 
  only to find Sura is now gone. Spartacus stares at Varro for 
  a moment. He stands, his legs uncertain but determined.

                      in the turning away of it.

  He offers Varro a weak yet genuine smile of friendship as he 
  painfully exits. OFF Varro watching him go, certain in the 
  knowledge that his friend s life -- and sanity -- draws 
  quickly to an end.


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  COINS splattered with blood spill onto Batiatus  desk. POP 
  WIDE to reveal Batiatus and Ashur standing over the 
  winnings.

                                        ASHUR

                      An offer for the full price was 
                        offered by Solonius, who happened

  A beat as Batiatus wrestles with that, concedes the point.

                        You struck the wiser bargain.

  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus, body littered with gashes and bruises, slowly 
  trudges through the corridors. The din of the Gladiators 
  laughing, gambling, and fucking strain to pierce his veil of 
  pain, as if again heard from underwater.

  SPARTACUS  POV,

  as he moves through the corridor. Everything is distorted, 
  coming in and out of focus. He passes GNAEUS, who sneers at  
  him, face twisted into a grotesque mockery. He passes the 
  barracks, seeing more

  DISTORTED FACES,

  eyeing him through the bars.  Varro rises from where he sits 
  talking with Hamilcar, his face filled with concern at the 
  sight of Spartacus.  He holds the MANDRAKE ROOT out through 
  the bars, hoping Spartacus will change his mind.

  SPARTACUS GLANCES AT IT,

  continues on his way in a fog of agony. The din of the ludus 
  rises, a deafening wave of sound. He reaches the landing to 
  the stairs and painfully lowers himself to the floor, back 
  against the wall.






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.
  CONTINUED:

  SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS

  as the din fades out, replaced by the sound of his own 
  labored breath. His eyes flutter shut. SILENCE. A long beat. 
  A SHADOW falls over him.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Spartacus.

  Spartacus jerks awake, his eyes struggle to find a heavily 
  back-lit Batiatus looming above him from the stairs. Jupiter 
  descended from the heavens.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have fought well. The gods 
                        reward you...

  Batiatus motions Spartacus to follow him. Spartacus pushes 
  himself to his feet, his body wiping us to --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Shafts of MOONLIGHT illuminate the square. Batiatus steps 
  out from the shadows with a dazed Spartacus in tow. Batiatus 
  stops, turning to Spartacus with a warm smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The promise is kept.

  Batiatus indicates the edge of the cliff. Spartacus looks 
  over, his eyes filling with wonder and relief as he sees

  SURA

  standing there with his back to him, the full, lush moon 
  caressing her diaphanous white gown. (The same one from 
  Spartacus  vision/memory in episode 102.) Her hair and dress 
  flutter in the warm breeze. 

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura...

  She turns, a gentle, sad smile gracing her perfect face. 
  Spartacus rushes to her, tears streaking his cheeks. He 
  takes her in his arms, kissing her, a drowning man finally 
  blessed with air again.

                                        SURA
                                  soft)(
                        I will always be with you...

  Behind them, the MOON DARKENS with clouds, turning BLOOD 
  RED.

                        Even in death.

  Lightning FLASHES in the sky. Spartacus eyes it with 
  confusion and worry.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        The rains are coming...

  He turns back to her, freezes in horror. TEARS OF BLOOD fall 
  across her cheeks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura --

                                        SURA
                        Save me.  Before they wash 
                        everything away...

  THUNDER BOOMS. RAIN begins to fall. Drops land on Sura s 
  gown -- but it s not water. It s BLOOD. They streak Sura s 
  white gown, her hair and face dripping with it. Spartacus 
  falls to his knees in front of her, equally bloodied, 
  screaming to the heavens in agony and loss.

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  Batiatus steps out in his dressing gown, drawn by the sound. 
  There is no rain of blood. No Sura. Only Spartacus in the 
  moonlight, losing his mind. Batiatus stares for a beat, then 
  heads back into the villa, his body WIPING US TO --


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus jerks awake.  Blood drips down his face -- one of 
  his wounds has reopened.  He wipes at it, stares at the 
  blood, the nightmare still fresh.

  ASHUR

  who helps Barca prepare Spartacus for a return to The Pits. 
  Spartacus sits motionless as they apply the blood and ash. 
  Battered. Scared. On the brink of complete madness.

                                        ASHUR
                        Not so much fight in him now, is 
                        there?

                        place you wouldn t last a fucking 
                        breath.

  Ashur glares, but is interrupted before he can reply.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Spartacus.

  Spartacus glances over with half dead eyes. Batiatus has 
  appeared in the doorway, heavily back lit. Reality mirroring 
  his dream.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have fought well. The gods may 
                        yet reward you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                to himself)(
                        The gods. They came to me last 
                        night. Like they often did with 
                        her. In a dream.

  Batiatus studies Spartacus with a frown, waves Ashur and 
  Barca back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And what did they show you?

  Spartacus blinks, grits his teeth, trying to focus. His eyes 
  land on Batiatus, now seeing him clearly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The truth. Your profit from my 
                        blood ends tonight.

  Batiatus doesn t care for the sound of that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Refuse to fight, and I will cease 
                      my attempts to find your wife.

  Spartacus laughs. There is no mirth in it. Only weariness 
  and pain as the madness creeps back in.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have to save her.  Before the 
                        rains come.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Give way to your meaning, you mad 
                        fuck!

  Batiatus strikes Spartacus hard across the face, snapping 
  his head to the side. A tense moment as Spartacus slowly 
  turns it back around to face Batiatus, his eyes hard and 
  focused again.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The odds remain high in my favor?

                        Then bet everything you have 
                        against me.

  Ashur glances to Batiatus in surprise. How s that again?

                                        BATIATUS
                        You would die in The Pits? 
                        Willingly, to see my fortune rise?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes.  If you will hold to wrest my 
                        wife from the Syrian with a piece 
                      of it.

  Batiatus considers the offer.

  Ashur and Barca move in to comply. PUSH IN on Spartacus, his 
  eyes set to the task of dying as the SOUNDS OF THE CROWD in 
  The Pits swells, carrying us to --


  INT. THE PITS - NIGHT

  The CROWD yells and leers in SLOW MOTION. PAN ACROSS THEM to 
  find Spartacus as he s led past by the Brutes.

  THE TWO DRUNKARDS,

  swill from their ever-present cups, the wine dripping from 
  their mouths as they cheer Spartacus on.

  ANUBIS

  announces Spartacus as he s brought to his side.

                                        ANUBIS
                        Behold, Spartacus!

  The crowd ROARS. Ixion, the fiend that flayed off Kerza s 
  face, is ushered in by a Brute. Ixion now wears KERZA S FACE 
  as his death mask. Gruesome and cruel.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Behold, Ixion!

  The CROWD ERUPTS in response. Ixion snarl-laughs at 
  Spartacus. Spartacus looks right through him, barely 
  registering the man.

  ASHUR

  limps up next to Batiatus and Barca as Anubis goes into his 
  pre-fight spiel.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The wager is placed?

                                        ANUBIS
                        What weapons shall the gods bless 
                        them with?!  Or curse them with

  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus nods, tensely eyeing the crowd for such signs of 
  suspicion as Anubis thrusts out his clay urn to Ixion. Ixion 
  draws a SLIMY PIECE OF RIB BONE.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Ixion draws bipennis!

  NOTE: Bipennis (double headed axe). A Brute emerges from the 
  shadows and hands Ixion the double headed axe. Anubis offers 
  the urn to Spartacus. Spartacus draws a BLOODIED FRAGMENT OF 
  A RADIUS (forearm bone).

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus draws sica!

  NOTE: Sica (curved three-foot sword). Another Brute appears, 
  hands Spartacus his sword.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                      We have but a single rule! Only one 
                        survives! Mongrel on mongrel, till 
                        Charon arrives!

  Anubis throws his arms up. The Brutes shove Spartacus and 
  Ixion into the blood encrusted fighting area. The crowd 
  shouts and cheers, craving blood.

  IXION

  flurries his axe as he stalks towards Spartacus. Spartacus 
  grips his sica, steeling himself for the fight -- and his 
  death.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Ixion attacks. Spartacus narrowly dodges the axe, 
  counters with a SLASH that grazes Ixion s chest, prompting

  RIBBONS OF BLOOD

  to suspend in air before SPRAYING faces in the crowd. Ixion 
  HOWLS, returns with a brutal onslaught. Spartacus BLOCKS, 
  spins, and dodges as best he can, but Ixion finally 
  connects, the blade splitting the skin across

  SPARTACUS  BACK,

  splaying blood. Spartacus staggers in agony.

  Ixion swings, intent on decapitating Spartacus. Spartacus 
  deflects the blow with his sword, but the force sends his 
  weapon HELICOPTERING into the crowd in SLOW MOTION, landing 
  at the feet of the

  TWO DRUNKARDS.

  Drunkard #1 kicks it aside, his eyes narrowing, suddenly not 
  drunk at all as he focuses on Batiatus across the room. He 
  nods to Drunkard #2, who also turns dead sober as he slips a 
  DAGGER from his robes. Drunkard #1 follows suit. The two 
  assassins split up, disappearing into the crowd as they head 
  towards the unsuspecting Batiatus.

  SPARTACUS,

  now weaponless, is doing his best to avoid Ixion s deadly 
  axe. He lands a series of blows with his bare fists, but 
  Ixion responds with a belt from the axe s handle, sending 
  Spartacus to the ground, spewing blood. TIME SLOWS as 
  Spartacus locks eyes with

  BATIATUS,

  who nods in response. Time to sacrifice his life for Sura s. 
  Ixion raises the axe behind Spartacus, prepared to deliver 
  the death blow. But Spartacus  eyes shift, spotting Drunkard 
  #1 closing in behind Batiatus, the assassin s dagger 
  catching the light.

  SPARTACUS TENSES,

  realizing that if Batiatus dies, Sura will be lost forever.

  IXION SWINGS HIS AXE,

  the blade CONTRAILING as it slams down towards the back of 
  Spartacus  head. Spartacus ROLLS ASIDE a split second before 
  it connects. The axe slams into the floor, throwing sparks.

  SPARTACUS

  kicks Ixion back, sending him stumbling back.

  BATIATUS

  stares in shock, seeing his staggering wager in jeopardy. He 
  still doesn t see Drunkard #1 approaching from behind.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

                        What the fuck is he doing?!

  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus surges to his feet, shouting to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Behind you!

  But his shout of warning is drowned out by the shouts of the 
  crowd as Ixion attacks.

  BARCA

  cocks his head, having picked up that something s wrong. He 
  catches the BLUR of movement behind him, whirls just as 
  Drunkard #1 surges towards Batiatus with his dagger. Barca 
  intercepts, the blade SLASHING HIS ARM.

  BATIATUS AND ASHUR

  turn in shock at the assault. Batiatus fumbles for his 
  dagger. Barca GRUNTS in pain, his face twisting in rage as 
  Drunkard #1 slashes at him. Barca grabs his arm, SNAPPING it 
  as he rips the dagger free and starts SLASHING THE FUCK out 
  of Drunkard #1. Blood splatters everywhere.

  DRUNKARD #2

  emerges from the crowd behind Batiatus and smashes Ashur out 
  of the way. Batiatus whirls around just in time to avoid the 
  death blow, but gets sliced across the ribs. Batiatus  
  dagger flies from his hand. Barca, still carving up Drunkard 
  #1, doesn t realize Batiatus is about to be murdered.

  SPARTACUS

  sees Drunkard #2 going in for the kill. He unleashes a 
  BARRAGE OF VICIOUS BLOWS against Ixion, rips the axe out of 
  his hand and DECAPITATES him in a geyser of blood.

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  then quickly dive out of the way as Spartacus spins around 
  and HURLS THE AXE. TIME SLOWS as the blade lazily ROTATES 
  through the crowd, narrowly missing them. TIME RESUMES as

  THE AXE SLAMS INTO DRUNKARD #2 S BACK

  a moment before he would have plunged his dagger into 
  Batiatus  heart. The Drunkards s body slumps to the floor, 
  revealing a shaken Batiatus clutching his bloody side. CHAOS 
  ERUPTS

  all around him. Barca, having dispatched Drunkard #1, shoves 
  the crowd away from his master. Batiatus locks eyes with 
  Spartacus, knowing the man just saved his life, but in the                                                                                     44.

  process won the fight. And lost him a fortune. OFF 
  Spartacus, victorious, but realizing he may yet find his 
  life forfeit before the night is done...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  The dead body of Drunkard #1 crashes to the sand, landing 
  beside the body of Drunkard #2. Ashur inspects the bodies 
  with a torch for light. Batiatus favors his bloody side as 
  he rails at Barca. Barca s arm drips blood, his wound not 
  yet addressed.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You, my protector! And here I stand 
                        bloodied!

                                        BARCA
                        I did not see there was another.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You must see all when my life is 
                        the balance! Ring your crown with 
                        eyes, or have the two you possess

                        Unfamiliar. But certainly the mark 
                      of a slave.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A slave? They send common slaves to 
                        kill Batiatus!

  Batiatus erupts, viciously kicking the dead bodies. 
  Goodfellas by way of Tony Soprano.

                        Common... fucking... slaves?!

  He tires, takes a moment to catch his breath and resumes his 
  calm.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Discover their master. I wish to 
                        have words with him.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia stands in her sheer robe, bathed in moonlight and 
  lost in thought. Her hand absently fingers the OPAL NECKLACE 
  Crixus gave her. A beat. Her other hand drifts to her belly, 
  longing for it to be filled with life.

  BATIATUS

  enters behind her. He pauses, the beauty of his wife 
  amplified by his brush with death. Lucretia senses his 
  presence, smiles without turning.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The kalends are upon us. The first 
                        day of a new month.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I ll prepare a sacrifice. Perhaps 
                        the gods will finally grace us with 
                        a child in return...

  Batiatus wraps his arms round her waist, his hand covering 
  hers. Lucretia s smile falls as she spots BLOOD on them.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Quintus!

  She turns, fear and concern welling in her eyes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I m all right. A minor annoyance.

  She spots the blood seeping from the side of his toga, her 
  concern deepening.

                                        LUCRETIA

                      It will take more than a scratch to 
                        wrest me from your side.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  He winces, favoring his side.

                        will die in response.

  He chuckles as she ushers him to the bed.

                        The agents have already been

                        I had thought to erase all debt 
                        through them after tonight. 
                        Spartacus offered terms to see it 
                        so.

                        widow. He saved my life in The Pits 
                        this night.

                        A place you would not have been if 
                      it weren t for him. He is cursed by 
                        the gods. I would see his life 
                        ended, as it should have when he 
                        stepped into the arena, doomed to 
                        execution. Every day Spartacus yet 
                        breathes, I fear his curse becomes 
                        our own.

  OFF Batiatus, her words resonating...


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus lies prone on a table, waiting for the Medicus to

  Spartacus painfully opens his eyes, focusing with difficulty

                        Batiatus summons you.

  A beat. Spartacus knows this is not going to end well. He 
  painfully rises, his battered body WIPING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Doctore leads Spartacus into the moonlit square.  Batiatus 
  stands waiting, a gleaming GLADIUS gripped tightly in his 
  hand.  Spartacus eyes the sword as he stops in front of his 
  master, knowing his fate. And accepting it.  A long beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My wife believes you are cursed by 
                        the gods. I m inclined to agree.

                        your miserable life. Before it 
                        further infects mine.

  Spartacus offers no resistance to the idea.

                        A promise was made. You would find

                      As do you.

  A long beat. Batiatus  fingers tighten on the sword and -- 
  he suddenly turns it around, offering it to Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The promise is kept. I will 
                        continue the search for her.

  Spartacus regards the handle, surprised to find SURA S 
  PURPLE BINDING tied round it. He takes it, unsure of the 
  meaning.

                        You saved my life. Gods or not, a 
                        debt that demands repayment.
                                to Doctore)(

                        training as soon as he s able.

  Batiatus walks off. Doctore graces Spartacus with the 
  faintest of smiles, then follows after Batiatus. Spartacus 
  stands alone, awash in the moonlight. Sword in hand. Hope 
  growing in his heart. A gladiator once more.
