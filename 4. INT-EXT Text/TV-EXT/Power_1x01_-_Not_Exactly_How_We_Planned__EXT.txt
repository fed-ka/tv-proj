      The Maybach door opens, the Bruno Magli shoe hits the 
      pavement, and the camera pans up to FIND JAMES  GHOST  ST. 
      PATRICK, our hero-- as handsome and debonair as a black James 
      Bond. He surveys the crowd waiting outside a mobbed Manhattan 
      club. Ghost turns and offers his hand to his woman-- and we 
      see his platinum-and-diamond wedding ring as he helps her out 
      of the car. This is his wife, TASHA,  the perfect sum of 
      street + money-- think Mary J. Blige, but so fine it hurts. 
      As she gets out of the car, she pauses, straightening her 
      Cavalli dress. She whispers in his ear:

                                  TASHA
                    Tell me I m beautiful.

                                  GHOST
                    You know you are.

      Tasha beams as Ghost lets her walk ahead of him. For a 
      second, CAMERA LINGERS ON their chauffeur, SHAWN (20, lean, 
      black), who watches Tasha s ass as she and Ghost walk down 
      the red carpet toward the club. They are recognized 
        immediately: a BOUNCER clears a path as they glide past the 
      people waiting in line. Ghost nods to MAX, the doorman (30, 
      Prada body, Prada suit) who presides over the crowd with 
        unparalleled skill. Max opens the door for Ghost and Tasha, 
      touches his radio:                                                                                      2.


                                  MAX
                    Boss is here.

      His radio message is picked up by a second bouncer inside the 
      club --


      Eddie stands outside, up against back of the building. It s 
      as quiet and dark as the front of the club is vibrant and 
      bright. He dials his cell:

                                  JULIO (O.S.)
                    Hello?

                                  EDDIE
                    Where you at?


      DAVID, (27, black) stands outside a shipping container with 
      uniformed CUSTOMS OFFICER. The officer opens the container 
      and shows David several keys of cocaine, wrapped for him to 
      take delivery. David pulls a wad of cash out of his jacket 
      and begins to count. The Customs Officer s greedy eyes glow, 
      but then David s phone buzzes. He shakes his head at the 
      customs guy and repockets the cash. As both men walk away and  
      the music gets louder... SMASH TO:


      ... and stops to look at the people waiting in line to get 
      inside, half-smiles. Shawn is waiting at the curb. He opens 
      the back door.

                                  SHAWN
                    You goin  home now, Mrs. St. 
                    Patrick?

                                  TASHA
                    Where else would I go?

      Off Tasha as she gets in the car, her smile fading...


      Ghost stands across the street from the front of the club, 
      watching the last of the crowd tumble out into the night. 
      Eddie approaches.

                                  EDDIE
                    Been lookin  all over for you. 
                    Everyone got clear. No problems. 
                    Nobody tried shit.

                                  GHOST
                    Didn t want to miss this part.

      Bouncer #1 shuts the door behind the last stragglers. The 
      lighted  Truth  sign goes out.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    All the hustling. All the work. It 
                    brought us here. For kids that grew 
                    up like us, to make something, in 
                    the city. Ain t no small shit.

                                  EDDIE
                    We lost forty stacks tonight before 
                    we closed the store, plus whatever 
                    we lost since.
                          (lightly)
                    We make up for that selling drinks?

                                  GHOST
                    You know it ain t about that.

                                  EDDIE
                    It s gonna be about our ass when 
                    Lobos finds out we left his product 
                    sitting in a shipping container, 
                    losing money by the minute.
                          (then)
                    You know he sets fire to people, 
                    right?

                                  GHOST
                    That guy was fucking his sister.
                          (but)
                    I m gonna bring him his money.                                                                                    20.


                                  EDDIE
                    Outta your own shit?

                                  GHOST
                    Unless you d like to contribute?

      Shawn pulls up at the curb in the Maybach. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah, I got half. But it s out at 
                    my mother s.

                                  GHOST
                    Give it to me tomorrow night. 
                    You ll come for dinner.

                                  EDDIE
                    Thanks for the girls, by the way. 
                    Kept me busy while I was waiting 
                    for our people to check in.

                                  GHOST
                          (as he gets in the car)
                    You ever gonna get over that 
                    redhead shit?

                                  EDDIE
                    Probably not.

      Both men burst out laughing. As the Maybach pulls away...


      ESTABLISH Ghost s building, a gorgeous titanium and steel 
      TriBeCa high rise, overlooking the Hudson. (Think the Richard 
      Meier buildings on Perry St.) Doctors, lawyers and 
        stockbrokers share Ghost s roof-- but he s in the penthouse.


      Follow each of them, split-screen, as they head through the 
      city of New York in different directions. The cars wind their 
      way out of Manhattan, over the bridges and through the 
      neighborhoods of the outer boroughs -- Eddie to Brooklyn, 
      Ghost to the Bronx.                                                                                     33.


      People react as the Maybach rolls through the projects and 
      the Mustang waits at a stop light outside a bodega... STAY 
      WITH the Maybach as it turns up a side street and parks at a 
      typical city playground. Slide, jungle gym, kids drawing in 
      chalk on the concrete. The MUSIC ends.

      Inside the car --

                                  SHAWN
                    What do we do now?

                                  GHOST
                    We wait.

      Off Ghost, calm --


      Eddie pulls up in the Mustang, parks outside a row house with 
      kids playing in the street out front. Julio and Eddie walk up 
      the front stairs, knock on the door. A twelve-year-old GIRL, 
      MAGDALENA, opens the door.

                                  JULIO
                    Your big brother home?

      The girl eyes Eddie with suspicion, then closes the door.

                                  MAGADALENA (O.S.)
                    Tell Anibal a white man is asking 
                    for him.

      There s indecipherable shouting from inside, then the door 
      opens again.

                                  MAGADALENA (CONT D)
                          (to Eddie)
                    Come this way.

      Eddie and Julio walk through the living room and the kitchen. 
      The old women are cooking, but the young women -- gorgeous 
      and businesslike -- are counting money at the kitchen table. 
      Magadalena leads Eddie and Julio into the backyard.


      A string of lights is hung around the fence -- red, white, 
      blue, and lime green. Eddie s is the only white face we see 
      anywhere. Magdalena points to a group of men playing 
      Dominican Dominoes at a card table under the lights. Eddie 
      walks down into the backyard and ANIBAL, the corpulent leader 
      of this set of Trinitarios, looks up.                                                                                    34.


                                  ANIBAL
                    Eduardo. Where s Ghost?

                                  EDDIE
                    He sends his regards. And our toll.

      Eddie hands Anibal an envelope. Anibal counts, and smiles.

                                  ANIBAL
                    You play dominoes?

                                  EDDIE
                    It s not a social visit, Anibal. We 
                    got hit last night.

                                    ANNIBAL
                    I didn t hear that.

                                  EDDIE
                    Not a word?

                                  ANIBAL
                    Nada. 

                                  EDDIE
                    A score like that somebody will 
                    brag about. You ll hear something.
                          (then)
                    Fifty stacks. Seventy-five if you 
                    bring him to us alive.

                                  ANIBAL
                    It means that much to you?

                                  EDDIE
                    If it s one of your people, you can 
                    kill him yourself. We just want to 
                    watch.


      Ghost sits with Latin King Inca CARLOS  VIBORA  RUIZ. Ruiz 
      watches his daughter on the swings. Shawn watches from the 
      Maybach keeping an eye on Ghost and on Ruiz s men, across the 
      way in a black SUV.

                                  RUIZ
                    If I knew who ordered it, he d be 
                    dead already.

                                  GHOST
                    What?                                                                                    35.


                                  RUIZ
                    We got hit too.
                          (off Ghost s surprise)
                    Money man. Same as yours. Angel. 
                    They shot him in the back of the 
                    head. Got a baby on the way.

                                  GHOST
                    That s fucked up.

      Ghost gives Ruiz the toll envelope. Ruiz looks inside.

                                  RUIZ
                    A man of your word. Your people s 
                    safety in my territory is 
                      guaranteed.

      Ruiz rolls up his shirt, revealing his Latin King tattoos.

                                  RUIZ (CONT D)
                    I know you work with other crews. 
                    But we gotta dead this before it 
                    goes further. I could lend you some 
                    men, extra protection--

                                  GHOST
                    If our people ride together, I ll 
                    lose the trust of the Trinis and 
                    the Bloods.

                                  RUIZ
                    Can t trust them anyway.

                                  GHOST
                    Eddie and I are neutral. You know 
                    that. But maybe there s something 
                    else we can work out.

      Off Ghost, coming up with a plan...


      Lobos s black SUV is waiting as he comes outside with his 
      men. Javier opens the door for Lobos, who gets inside. As the 
      SUV pulls away from the curb, FIND another car, parked a 
      block away, pulling out into traffic. The driver is a Latino 
      male THUG in a sweatshirt and sunglasses, hood pulled up over 
      his face. There s a TEARDROP TATTOO on his cheek. He follows 
      the Lobos SUV as it turns uptown.... 


      Eddie and Julio ride in Julio s SUV. They pull into an empty 
      parking lot and stop directly next to a tremendous white 
      escalade. Eddie gets out in the middle, meets Ruiz, who gets 
      out of the Escalade with one of his soldiers. He sees Eddie 
      and Julio, frowns slightly.

                                  RUIZ
                    Where s Ghost?

                                  EDDIE
                    He sends his respects. He s working 
                    another hustle tonight.
                          (off Ruiz s look)
                    Without you, we can t get this kind 
                    of firepower overnight. You sure we 
                    can t thank you?

      Eddie opens his coat, shows Ruiz a thick stack of bills.

                                  RUIZ
                    Catch the motherfucker. That ll be 
                    thanks enough.

      He gestures to the back of the Escalade. Eddie walks back 
      with him. Ruiz presses the automatic open button on his 
      keyfob and the Escalade s back gate slowly opens, revealing 
      an arsenal of weapons. Off Eddie s face reacting happily to 
      the sight,  Get Busy  begins:


       GET BUSY  continues as Tasha enters the club with a nod from 
      Max the doorman. She stops, reacting to the redecorated club 
      and the crowd: at the young girls in tight, bright dresses 
      and the men dancing with them, moving to the pounding music. 
      She stops a bouncer.

                                  TASHA
                    Can you find my husband for me?

                                    BOUNCER
                          (into the radio)
                    Anybody got eyes on the boss?

      Tasha looks up at Revis and his friends in VIP, covered in 
      girls and alcohol and having a great time. Tasha runs her 
      hand over her black dress, feeling invisible.

                                    BOUNCER (CONT D)
                    The Boss is prepping the live act 
                    now. Can I take you to your table?

      He indicates a table upstairs with a bottle of champagne 
      chilling on ice, away from the action. Tasha looks, then:

                                  TASHA
                    I know where he ll get to me a 
                    little sooner.

      And she heads right into VIP, into the Birthday party in full 
      swing. As she works her way up to Revis s table....


      ... and the sexy song ends. Konstant revs up into a club 
      banger, and Ghost watches as the crowd goes apeshit, dancing. 
      His phone BUZZES with a text from Eddie:  Done.  Ghost types 
       4AM,  then puts his phone away and turns back to the packed 
      club. The CAMERA PANS the room in his POV, then swings around 
      to reveal we re --


      FOLLOW Sabueso s SUV as he heads back toward Manhattan. He 
      dials through the Bluetooth in his car.

                                    SABUESO
                    Yo, Kendall. It s  Bueso.

                                    KENDALL (O.C.)
                    Where have you been? I ve been 
                    texting you for two days.


      He parks, then takes off his cap. He puts on a pair of
