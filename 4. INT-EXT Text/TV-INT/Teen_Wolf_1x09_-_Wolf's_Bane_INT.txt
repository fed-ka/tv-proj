      While the sky outside his classroom windows darkens to night, 
      Mr. Harris finishes cleaning up chemical supplies. With the 
      exasperated sigh of someone who clearly has not had a good 
      day, he shuts the supply cabinet.

      Harris picks up his notebook from his desk, about to put it 
      in his briefcase, when something catches his eye--

      A CRINKLED PIECE OF PAPER. He gazes at it, head tilting in 
      confusion. Written on the paper are names and addresses. The 
      first one is David M. Harris, name and address crossed off. 
      The second is Lionel B. Harris. Also crossed off.

      Grant S. Harris, Thomas M. Harris, and on and on until down 
      at the bottom his eyes pause on a name that isn t crossed 
      off: Adrian R. Harris.

      He slowly lowers the paper from his eyes, revealing the NAME 
      PLATE on his desk: Prof. Adrian R. Harris.

      He glances to the open door out to the hallway. Not a sound 
      in the darkened school.

      Quickly folding up the paper, Harris stuffs it in his 
      briefcase. Just as he s starting toward the door, he pauses. 
      Breath held, he stands very still.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Please, don t kill me.

      Behind him, a silhouetted figure moves ever-so-slightly in 
      the darkness. It speaks with an ODD WHISPERY VOICE.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you know who wrote that list?

      Harris doesn t respond. The figure starts forward.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)

                                  MR. HARRIS
                      Laura--Laura Hale.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you know why she was looking for 
                    you?

      Harris shakes his head. Terrified, he barely breathes.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    I know why. Turn around, Adrian. 
                    Turn around and I ll show you.

      But Harris doesn t move, paralyzed with fear. STRANGE SOUNDS 
      begin emanating from behind him as the silhouette grows 
      larger, rising up, changing shape.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Turn around.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    No. Please.

                                  VOICE
                    Look at me. Look at what you ve 
                    done.

      Harris closes his eyes, shaking his head again and again. A 
      TABLE FLIPS UP past him, SLAMMING AGAINST THE WALL.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Oh, God--

      But then another VOICE jolts his eyes open.

                                  DEREK
                    Get down!

      Harris blinks, Derek suddenly in front of him, grabbing his 
      jacket and yanking him out of the way as--

      ANOTHER TABLE goes tumbling. They both look up to see the 
      REAR EXIT DOOR of the Chemistry room clattering against the 
      wall, the Alpha gone.

      Half on the floor, Harris clutches at Derek when--                TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/113.

      BRIGHT LIGHTS FLOOD THROUGH THE WINDOWS. A voice comes 
      booming from a BULLHORN.

      She and Ulrich look through the windshield where two RED

      It s Derek s Camaro. And inside--


      Scott grips the wheel. Next to him, Stiles looks out the rear

                    If you don t go faster--a lot 
                      faster--they re going to kill us!

      So Scott FLOORS IT sending them careening toward a turn. But 
      Stiles looks through the rear windshield, confused.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    They re gone.

      He glances to the POLICE SCANNER in his lap and raises the

      Derek pulls out a folded up piece of paper and opens it to 
      show him a simple photocopy. Scott takes one look and lets 
      out a hopeless sigh.

                      What--what are those?*

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    Holding still, please.

      Jackson tries to remain motionless on top of the CRINKLING 
      PAPER underneath his skin. But then he jerks forward.

                                  DR. FENRIS (CONT D)
                    That didn t hurt, did it?

                                    JACKSON
                    No. It was just cold.

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    Good. Because this actually will 
                    sting just a little bit.*

      Fenris presses forward and Jackson FLINCHES, teeth gritting.

                                  DR. FENRIS (CONT D)
                    Holding still, please.

      But Jackson keeps wincing in pain as Fenris applies a STEEL *
      TOOL to one of the SCABS at his neck.

                                    JACKSON
                    Hey. Hey, that hurt. A lot.

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    You ve got something under the skin 
                    here. Just a moment longer.

      Dr. Fenris begins pulling something out of Jackson s neck...               TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1110.

      A PURPLE FLOWER. The stem drips with BLOOD but the flower 
      itself remains pristine, a vibrant purple. Jackson tries to 
      get up, but the Doctor pushes him down.

                                    JACKSON
                      Stop--stop--it hurts.

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    Almost done.

      The wolfsbane flower twists up out of Jackson s neck just 
      like the twine Scott and Stiles pulled up from the grave 
      holding Derek s sister.

      PURPLE PETALS fall to the floor around Jackson as he starts 
      crying out. As he starts SCREAMING.

                                  DR. FENRIS (CONT D)
                    Holding still--*

      Jackson finally lurches up and around to look at the Doctor. 
      But the person holding him down is Derek, eyes GLOWING BLUE.

                                  DEREK
                    Hold still.

      Jackson SNAPS awake. He lies on his back on the examining 
      table. Dr. Fenris walks in, his attention on a clipboard.

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    You can put your shirt back on now. 
                    The scabs on your neck are nothing 
                    to worry about.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m okay for my game tonight?*

                                  DR. FENRIS
                      Absolutely. But I do need to give 
                    you an antibiotic. Have you been 
                    eating any strange herbs lately?

                                    JACKSON
                    Like what?

                                  DR. FENRIS
                    Well, you have aconite poisoning.

                    It s a purple flower. Sometimes 
                    called monkshood or... 

      He pauses, searching for the word.

                    Then you are familiar with it?

                    No. I have no idea how I knew that.


      Melissa McCall stops tapping at her computer when a shadow 
      falls over her. Jackson looks down with a charming smile.

                                    JACKSON
                    Would you mind if I look something

                                    JACKSON
                    Yeah. Good friends, actually.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Just be quick, okay?*

      She gets up, angling the monitor toward him. 

      Jackson types in the word: Wolfsbane. He taps the mouse, *
      clicking and clicking while images flash over his face. Eyes 
      flitting over the screen, he slowly begins to smile. Then, he 
      even laughs.

      Melissa looks up from a few charts to see Jackson walking 
      away without a word. Watching him go, she steps back to the 
      desk and slowly turns the monitor so she can see it.*

      But she doesn t find anything ON THE SCREEN, just icons and *
      the desktop image. Melissa looks up as Jackson walks out of *
      the hospital and-- *

      Into the crowded high school corridor. Walking with renewed 
      purpose and confidence, Jackson heads right for Scott who is 
      busy dialing in the combo on his locker.

                                    JACKSON
                    I know what you are, McCall.

      He says it so casually that it causes Scott s voice to catch 
      in his throat.

      He steps forward, crossing the corridor to corner Scott at 
      his locker. Not a hint of uncertainty on his face.

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh, sorry... but I have no idea 
                    what you re talking about.

      FADE IN:


      Stiles and Scott burst through the double doors out of one 
      corridor and into the next. Their talk is frantic and fast.

                                  STILES
                    How the hell did he find out?

                    Did he say it out loud? The word.

                                  SCOTT
                    What word?

                          (trying to whisper)
                    Werewolf. Did he say I know you re 
                      a werewolf.

                                  SCOTT
                    No. But he implied it pretty 
                    freaking clearly.

                                  STILES
                    Okay, maybe it s not as bad as it 
                    seems. He has no proof, right? And 
                    if he wanted to tell someone who s 
                    going to believe him anyway?

      The BELL RINGS as the last students hurry in. Scott sees a 
      seat behind Allison and goes for it. But someone from the 
      other aisle puts a leg up on it before he can sit down.

                    phone. Thought you might want it.

      Allison gives an uncomfortable nod as the English Teacher, 
      Mrs. Ramsey, begins class.

                                  MRS. RAMSEY
                    All right, I d like to return to 
                    our discussion from yesterday with 
                    a more in depth analysis of Iago 
                    and the way in which he preyed upon 
                    Othello s jealousies...

      ON HER DESK - Allison s phone vibrates with a message. She 
      clicks on it to see Scott has sent her a PICTURE. It s a 
      photo of the two of them holding each other.

      At his desk, Scott leans forward, trying to catch her 
      reaction. He notes the smile that comes to her face as the 
      images vibrate onto her phone... 

      Holding hands. Cheeks pressed together. Scott kissing her 
      while she snaps the shot with her free hand extended.

      But then Allison sets the phone back down on the desk. When 
      she turns around, he s stunned to see tears in her eyes, an 
      angry glare at him.

      Quickly gathering her things, she gets up right in the middle 
      of the teacher s lecture.


      Allison charges into the empty corridor with Scott chasing 
      after her.

                    Okay. I came up with a Plan B in 
                    case something like this happened.

                                  SCOTT
                    What s Plan B?

                                  STILES
                    Just steal the stupid thing.

                                  SCOTT
                    Couldn t we try getting to Harris?

                                  STILES
                    My Dad gave him a 24-hour 
                      protective detail. All we ve got is 
                    the necklace. Steal it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles. He s watching us.

      Scott follows Stiles s gaze to find Jackson through the 
      crowd. Eating with Allison and Lydia at a table across the 
      way. Watching their panic with obvious amusement.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Act normal.

      Stiles nods, trying to act normal--an impossibility--while 
      Scott glances to Jackson whose stare never seems to waver.

      Jackson takes a bite of an apple. The CRUNCH of teeth into 
      pulp soars toward across the room, the sound SLAMMING at 
      Scott, causing him to wince. When he looks up again, Jackson 
      has set down the apple now gazing at Scott with interest.

                                    JACKSON (V.O.)
                    Scott?

      Jackson s voice whispers toward him. Softly winding past 
      other students, intensifying when it reaches Scott s ear. 

                                    JACKSON (V.O.)
                    Can you hear me?

      He tries not to glance over again. Jackson pulls away from 
      the table to whisper without Lydia, Allison and the other 
      girls hearing him. 

                                    JACKSON (V.O.)

      Scott stares down at his tray, trying to remain calm.

                                    JACKSON (V.O.)
                    You trying to pretend not to hear 
                    me?

      Scott throws Stiles a fake smile, nodding at him.

                    Your mind s a blank? You can t

                    And FYI, he s not sitting with them 
                    anymore.

      Scott eases his gaze toward Lydia and Allison, noticing the 
      seat where Jackson was is now empty.

                    Looking for me, McCall? I m right 
                    here.

      Scott resists the temptation to look around, keeping his eyes 
      on Stiles and his lunch.

                                    JACKSON (V.O.)

      seeing the effect on his face, nevertheless.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1120.

                    if you don t give me what I want.

      fork into his food.

                    And when I m done with that...

      Glancing over past the other students, Scott s eyes fall on 
      Allison. She smiles at something Lydia and the other girls 
      are talking about. Then catches Scott s stare.

      Two swimmers burst through the surface of the swimming pool s 
      lanes. Jackson and Allison look to each other as they grab 
      onto the side of the pool.

                    these cheekbones? Aerodynamically 
                    suited for speed in the water.

                    They are pretty impressive 
                      cheekbones.

      Allison s black bag sitting on one of the benches. As he 
      reaches to unzip it, he keeps an eye out to the two teens 
      below, still in the water.

      But Jackson just smiles that perfect smile and continues 
      walking into the darkening corridor.


      Hurtling into his room, Stiles rips his bag off his back and 
      jumps to his computer. He types while simultaneously trying

      Finally, Stiles clicks the door shut revealing Derek on the 
      other side.

                                  DEREK
                    Scott didn t get the necklace?

                                  STILES
                    He s still working on it. But 
                    there s something else we can try. 
                    When we were trapped in the school 
                    that night Scott sent a text to 
                    Allison telling her to meet him 
                    there.

                                  DEREK
                    So?

                                  STILES
                    So it wasn t Scott.

                                  DEREK
                    Can you find out who sent the text?

                                  STILES
                    No. But I know someone who can.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1126.



      Scott slips into the dark bedroom through the window, feet 
      gently landing on the carpet. He glances out the open door to 
      the hallway and stealthily inches toward it.

      Listening in, he doesn t hear a sound from the rest of house.

      Pulling back, his eyes scan the room for the necklace. He 
      quickly checks Allison s desk, mirror, picks up pillows, 
      yanks open the closet, drawers, every inch of the bedroom.

      But the necklace is nowhere to be found.


      School bag over his shoulder, Danny stands in Stiles s room.

                                  DANNY
                    You want me to do what?

      Danny sits down next to him at the desk. Behind them, Derek 
      sits in a chair by the bed trying to look inconspicuous while 
      reading a magazine.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                          (whispering to Stiles)

                            name)
                    Miguel.

      Derek glares over the magazine s edge in disbelief. Even 
      Stiles cringes at his own stupidity.

                                  DANNY
                    Is that blood on his shirt?

      Derek s T-shirt hangs torn and blackened by dried blood.

                    Miguel, I thought I told you to 
                    just borrow one of my shirts?

      Glaring with even more fury, Derek slowly puts the magazine 
      down and gets up to open Stiles s closet.

      He turns back, but notices Danny gazing past him, eyes 
      fixated on Derek s bare, muscular torso as he grabs another 
      shirt. A smile creeps over Stiles s face.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                          (to Derek)
                    That looks good. What do you think,

                                  STILES
                    The shirt?

                                  DANNY
                      I think--I think it s a nice shirt.

                                  STILES
                    Think he should try something else?

                            speaking)
                    It s... It s not exactly his color.

      Annoyed, Derek pulls off the T-shirt, exposing his perfect 
      abs once again. As Danny s jaw drops open again, Stiles leans 
      in to whisper in his ear.

                                  STILES

                    None of these fit.

      As Derek pulls his shirt off again--

                                  DANNY
                    I ll need the ISP, the phone number 
                    and the exact time of the text.


      On the verge of giving up, Scott takes one more look around. 
      His gaze lands on a corkboard by Allison s desk on which hang 
      various items. He pulls one off the board.

      It s a RECEIPT for bowling. He turns the small piece of paper 
      around to reveal words written on the back:

      First date with Scott!

      With an agonized sigh, he slowly sits into the chair at her 
      desk. And that s when he notices--

      A BOOK on the desk with a SILVER CHAIN leading out from 
      between the pages. Delicately gathering the chain in his 
      palm, he opens the book.

      Allison s necklace lies in the middle, a bookmark. As he 
      picks it up, his eyes fall on the text in the book.

      It s all about the Beast of G vaudan. Some words are circled 
      with a highlighter: legend, mythic, monster. Then two words, 
      circled most heavily:

                                  SCOTT
                    Loup garou?

      With another glance up to make sure he s still alone in the 
      house, Scott pulls out his phone and snaps a picture of the 
      strange words. 

      He hits the TRANSLATE app and waits. First the language comes 
      up: French. Then the translation appears one devastating 
      letter after another...

      Scott follows Argent into the kitchen.

                    She should be back in a few 
                    minutes. She sometimes goes for a

                    That s okay, I should go. I ve got

                    You want something to drink? I m 
                    going to have a beer.

      Argent pulls two beers from the fridge. Bewildered, Scott 
      watches him uncap both and slide the second one over.

                                  SCOTT
                    You don t need to test me anymore.

      Allison steps inside the dark and lonely structure. She gazes 
      around the charred walls, peers up the stairs. Stepping into 
      the second room, she notices something on the floor.

      Kneeling to get a closer look, she finds FOUR DEEP GROOVES 
      scratched into the floor.

      Spreading her fingers out, she traces the lines, simulating 
      for her own eyes how the grooves might have been scratched in 
      by a human hand. Then she looks up and SCREAMS. 

      Kate stands under the archway.

      Argent steps closer to Scott as if cornering him. Scott can t

                    You get that I m just thinking of 
                    my daughter s safety?

                                  SCOTT
                    Would you believe me if I said I 
                    think about it too? That it s all I 
                    think about?

      While Argent looks at him curiously, the words hold Allison 
      frozen in the kitchen.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    When we were in the school the 
                    other night, every choice I made, 
                    every thing I did, every single 
                    thing, was to make sure she was 
                    safe.

      Finally, Argent nods, letting all of the hostility and 
      suspicion slip away.

                                  ARGENT
                    You should go. Don t want to be 
                    late for your game.

      IN THE KITCHEN - Listening to the living room door close as 
      Scott leaves, Allison slowly rests her thought-heavy head 
      against the wall.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1133.

      Stiles drives with Derek in the passenger seat.

                                  STILES
                    Yes and it looks like the drawing.

                                  DEREK
                    Ask him if there s something on the 
                    back of it. There s has to be 
                      something. An inscription. An

      In the now parked Jeep, Stiles glances to the radio clock 
      with a pained sigh.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    You won t play if you re not here 
                    to start.

                                  STILES
                    I know. If you see my Dad, tell 
                    him... tell him I ll be there. Just 
                    a little bit late.

      He hangs up.

                                  DEREK
                    You re not going to make it.

                                  STILES
                    I know.

                                  DEREK
                    And you didn t tell him about his 
                    mother.

                                  STILES
                    Not until we find out the truth.

      They both turn their attention to the building now visible 
      through the windshield... 

      Beacon Hills Hospital Long Term Care.


      Phone to his ear, Stiles paces up the empty corridor.

                                  STILES
                    I said I can t find her.


      Still in the Jeep, Derek talks to Stiles on his cell.

                                  DEREK
                    Ask for Jennifer. She s been 
                    looking after my uncle.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Yeah well, he s not here either.

                                  DEREK
                    What?              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1137A.



      Stiles peers through the open patient room door.

                                  STILES
                    He s not here. He s gone.

      Inside the patient room, Peter s wheelchair sits empty.


      Derek sits up in alarm.

                                  DEREK
                    Get out of there. It s him. He s 
                    the Alpha.


      Stiles slowly pulls the phone away, turning around to see--

      Peter Hale. He gives the boy a friendly smile, burns 
      stretching hideously up one side of his face.

                                  PETER
                    You must be Stiles.

      FADE IN:


      Stiles takes a nervous step back from Peter. Then spins to 
      find Jennifer standing on the other side of the corridor.

                                  JENNIFER
                    What are you doing here? Visiting 
                    hours are over.

      Stiles looks from her to Peter. Both of them approaching.

                                  STILES
                    You... and him... you re the one 
                    who... and he s the... Oh, my God. 
                    I m going to die.

      But then a HAND presses to Jennifer s cheek and SLAMS her 
      head to the wall. She crumbles to the floor to reveal Derek 
      behind her.

                                  PETER
                    That wasn t nice. She s my nurse.

                                  DEREK
                    She s a psychotic bitch helping you 
                    kill people.
                          (to Stiles)
                    Get out of the way.

      Derek s mouth opens, revealing sharpened fangs. He lowers 
      into an attack pose.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, damn.

      Stiles presses himself up against the wall as Derek launches 
      himself at Peter.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/1138A.

      His uncle, however, barely seems to move. EYES FLASHING RED, 
      he grabs Derek by the jacket, slamming him into one wall, 
      CRACKING THE PLASTER, then SLAMMING him into the opposite 
      side with the same result.

      Hands above his head, Stiles cowers down as plaster rains 
      over him.

      Peter drops Derek down. Hand still gripping his neck, he *
      drags the younger werewolf toward Jennifer s body.*

                                  PETER
                    You think I killed Laura on 
                    purpose? One of my own family?

      He lets Derek slap down to the tile floor. Peter digs through 
      his Nurse s unconscious body for her car keys.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    My mind--my personality--was 
                    literally burned out of me. I was 
                    being driven by pure instinct.

      Derek launches himself back up. Peter responds by planting a *
      foot right on Derek s torso, sending him tumbling back. Blood *
      at his lips, Derek pulls his head up.*

                                  DEREK*
                    You want forgiveness?*

                                  PETER*
                    I want understanding. Do you have *
                    any idea what was happening to me 
                    in those years? Slowly healing cell 
                    by cell. Then even more slowly *
                    coming back to consciousness. Yes, 
                    becoming an Alpha--taking that from 
                    Laura--it pushed me over a plateau *
                    in the healing process. I can t 
                    help that. And I tried to tell you 
                    what was happening. I tried to warn 
                    you.

      On his feet again, Derek goes for a last attack. But Peter 
      easily launches him across the empty reception desk and 
      CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS BARRIER.

      A desk lamp is all that lights the dark classroom. Stilinski 
      peers out the window while a haggard and sleep-deprived 
      Harris talks from his desk.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    It was six years ago and in my 
                    defense, it was before I d gotten

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    I met her at a bar. We had a lot of 
                    drinks. A lot. She started asking 
                    me what I do. And she kept asking 
                      questions. Do you know what that s 
                    like? To have someone actually be 
                      interested in the topic of

                    Like I said, I talked. Because it s 
                      fascinating stuff. How you could 
                    melt away the lock on a bank vault.

      Harris snaps his mouth shut. Stilinski gives a knowing nod.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    You can appreciate how delicate the 
                    situation was.

                    You don t remember her name? Where 
                    she was from?

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    No. Which is exactly what Laura 
                    Hale asked. And I ll point you in 
                    the same direction I pointed her.

                      A necklace the girl was wearing. 
                    That s the symbol on it. I asked 
                    her about it. She said it was a
