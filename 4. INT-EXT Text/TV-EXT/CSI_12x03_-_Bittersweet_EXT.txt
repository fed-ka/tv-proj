    Flying over the strip, heading downtown.*



  Full blown crime scene.  CRIME TAPE surrounds the dripping
    artwork, dripping now into a PLASTIC CUP.  Nick, in just his
    T-shirt, does a HEMATRACE TEST on the dripping liquid --

                                    RUSSELL (O.S.)
                  Nice catch.

    CAMERA FINDS RUSSELL, staring at another CEMENT CUBE mounted
  on the wall nearby.  In the cement is an IMPRESSION of
    something that has caught his eye.  

                                  NICK
                        (re: test)
                  Definitely human.  
                        (re: dripping block)
                  Think there's a real arm in there?

    Russell reads the tag next to the cement cube: "Negativity
  by Slade".  $2200.

                                    RUSSELL
                For these prices?  I won't say it. 
                Oh, I'll say it... arm and a leg.

    Russell cranes his neck one way, then the other, trying to
    interpret the impression in the cement cube.

                                    RUSSELL
                So, Nick, which one is she?

                                  NICK
                  Hunh?

                                    RUSSELL
                        (re: evidence shirt)
                  Nice shirt, at least it used to be. 
                Art opening?  I mean, c'mon.  You
                had to be on a date.

    Russell looks up, scans the crowd, zeroes in on Callie.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Cute brunette.  Leather skirt?  

                                  NICK
                  She's Doc Robbins' niece.  Visiting
                  from Ohio.  Just showing her around.

                                    RUSSELL
                You can have a personal life, Nick. 
                  It's okay.

  Nick feels like he stepped in a trap.  Russell returns his
    attention to the cement cube mounted on the wall.

                                    RUSSELL
                  What do you see?

                                  NICK
                Aw, don't start.

    Russell puts his face into the impression of the cube.

                                  NICK
                  I wouldn't be putting my face in
                  there.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Okay.  You do it.  That's an order.

  Nick eyes Russell.  Is he serious?  His look says he is,
    gestures: "Go ahead."  Nick sticks his face into the cube. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  They say beauty is in the eye of
                the beholder.  I'm not saying this
                art is beautiful.  But I think you're
                  beholding half a face there.

  Nick pulls away from the cement, now sees what Russell sees.

                                  NICK
                  Nose.  Cheek.  Eye socket.  I see
                it.  

  Nick turns to Russell, but he's already scanning the rest of
  the gallery --

                Not saying I'd want this stuff in
                my house.  But I would like to see
                the rest of the collection.  
                        (turns to the crowd)
                Is there an artist in the house?

    A heavily TATTOOED MAN, SLADE, 20s, comes over to them.

                                  SLADE
                  Yeah. I'm the artist.  Slade.

                  Crime Lab.  Love what you're doing
                  here.  The cement is fresh... and
                  that hint of decomp.  What's your
                  process? 

                                  SLADE
                I'm an artist, man.

                                  NICK
                See that license plate over there? --

  Nick points to a mangled rear bumper masquerading as a dog.

                                  NICK
                  You're going to be making a lot of
                  them, if you don't answer the man's

                So, these blocks, did they talk to
                you before or after the cement dried?

                                  SLADE
                  It's called "found art" for a reason. 
                  Like "that's how I found them".

  Top of the ravine.  FIND Slade, standing next to a BLACK AND

  -- PAST OLD TV SETS, BROKEN ELECTRONICS, REFRIGERATORS, OLD
    TIRES, MATTRESSES, COUCHES, ETC.  Finally, reaching Russell
  and Nick, in COVERALLS and GLOVES, searching the junk.  

    Russell finds a HIBACHI.  It's rusty, but in decent shape. 
  He TAGS it and sets it aside.

                                  NICK
                  That evidence?

                No.  But it's a perfectly good

                Why not?  I'll clean it up.  Enough
                  junk in the world, why buy more.

  He spots a wrecked TV, a boot through the screen.

                No, but electronics have serial
                  numbers.  Maybe one of our litterbugs
                is a killer, or saw our killer.

  Nick snaps a PICTURE, as Russell digs out another CEMENT
    BLOCK, no bigger than a Zappos box.  Russell turns over the*
    cement block, sees --*

    A YOUNG GIRL'S FACE

  Most of the head encased in the block.  But the dusty, semi-
    mummified face, crawling with bugs, is visible where the
  "art" cement cracked off.

                You ever read "The Lady in Cement?"

  As he rounds the front of the Denali, we see why --

  DOE.  Naked, heavy-set, acne'd skin, mid twenties, face down. *
  What looks like dirt under his nails and in his ears.

                                  GREG
                But no blood pool. *

    Morgan notices dual lividity.  *

                                    MORGAN
                  Slight lividity on his back.  But
                  lividity's fixed in the lower
                    extremities.  

                                  GREG
                    Inconsistent with his current
                  position.

  Now, Morgan checks out the SOLES and HEELS of the vic's feet.  

                                    MORGAN
                No blanching on the soles of his
                  feet.  Weird.  Guy died standing
                up, but not standing on anything.  

                                  GREG
                  Maybe he was suspended.  Hung.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                        (re: neck)
                  I don't see any ligature marks.  

    A beat, as they all consider this.  *

                                  GREG*
                  Roll him.*

  David struggles to roll him, Greg jumps in to help.*

                                  GREG
                  Pretty well fed for a junkie.  

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                No jaundice.  Don't see any track
                  marks.

                                    MORGAN
                  Check his teeth.

  David pries the mouth open.  Guy's got a perfect set of pearly
    whites.  Must've cost him a bundle.  And healthy gums.

                                  DAVID PHILLIPS
                  Wish I had pearlies like that. 
                  Beautiful gums.

                                  GREG
                Guy wasn't on the pipe.

                So, we can forget trash run.  He
                  didn't die here.  He was dumped. 
                Oh, this is good.  

  OFF Greg, if only Morgan was as excited about him --



  Sara gets out of her Denali, heads for the condo.  Stops
  when she spots --

    SARA'S POV: AN OLD, RUN DOWN, BLUE SEDAN

    parked across the street.  ED BURROWS (from vigilante website)
  at the wheel.  He's as disheveled and run-down as his car.

  Sara approaches, taps on the passenger window.  Burrows just
  keeps his eyes glued to the condo.  Sara opens the passenger
  door, sweeps away a pile of food wrappers so she can sit.



  PICK UP Sara entering a complex where FAMILIES and teenage
  GIRLS are sunbathing and playing in the pool.  She spots --  

  GINA SINCLAIR, 30s, killer body, flower earrings, drinking a*
  BEER as she soaks up rays on a lounge chair with a POMERANIAN. 
  Gina exudes a cool confidence.  Sara stands in front of her,
    blocking Gina's sunlight.  Her pomeranian BARKS at her.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                CSI Sidle, right?
                        (re: beer)
                  Care for a cold one?

  Sara doesn't take the bait.

                                  SARA
                  Look good, Gina.  Guess prison agreed
                  with you.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  You're looking a little pale.   

                                  SARA
                  It's all that time in the lab. 
                  Busting psychos like you.
                        (then)
                  Found a girl.  In cement.  

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                Got nothing to do with me.

                                  SARA
                  Then you won't mind if I search
                  your apartment.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  It's kind of a mess.  Maid's day off.

                                  SARA
                  You're on parole.  I don't need a
                  warrant.

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                And I don't need to be harassed. 
                By you.  Or by numbnuts out in the
                  car.  Burrows has been stalking me
                  ever since I got out.

                                  SARA
                You did rape, murder and dismember
                his daughter.  

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Court said Todd did it.  I'm as
                  much a victim as any of those girls.   

  This gets under Sara's skin.  She notices Gina craning her
  neck to look around her.  Sara turns to see some TEEN GIRLS
  in bikinis, frolicking in the pool.

                                  SARA
                Am I blocking your view?

                                  GINA SINCLAIR*
                  Just admiring the flowers.

    Sara's had enough.  She steps into the center of the
    courtyard, addressing the whole complex: sun worshippers,
    PEOPLE on their balconies, everyone...

                                  SARA
                  Excuse me, can I have your attention
                  please?  I'm with the Las Vegas
                  Police Department.  I don't know if
                you know this, but your neighbor
                  over here, Gina Sinclair, Apartment*
                  310...  She's a rapist and a
                  murderer.  And if I were you, I'd
                  keep an eye on your kids.

  The whole complex looks at Gina, concerned.  Sara shoots
  Gina a "fuck you" look, more determined than ever to put her
  back behind bars --

                                  SARA
                Get up.  I'm calling your parole
                  officer.  Let's see what kind of
                  mess your maid left.

                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                      ACT TWO

  FADE IN:





    Russell talks to COLLEEN HUGHES, 21, pretty but fragile. 
  Her physical scars may have healed but in her eyes, the pain
  is still there.  Colleen is wearing a waitress uniform.  

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                ... I can't believe they let her out.

    A rush of fears and memories come flooding back.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  Where is she?

                                    RUSSELL
                As a condition of her parole, she
                has to stay in Vegas.  

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                Of course she does.  So what, now
                  she's free and I have to hide? 

                                    RUSSELL
                No one's saying you have to hide. 
                But for now, it might be good if
                you move back in with your parents --

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                No way.  You have any idea what
                  it's like to live with parents who
                  thought their kid was dead.  Then...
                  They didn't let me breathe without
                  them for the last four years.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Maybe you have a friend you could
                  stay with.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  I don't have friends.  Cause I don't
                  trust anyone.  Shrinks call it PTSD.
                  I say once you've been chained to a
                bed and raped every day for eleven
                  hundred and twelve days... it's
                  better to be alone.

                                    RUSSELL
                  I could see about police protection.

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                No.  Why don't you send the cops
                  over to her place.  I can take care
                of myself.  I'm done being a victim.

    Russell pulls out his CARD, writes numbers on the back.

                  Office number's on the card.
                          (writing on back)
                  Here's my cell.  Call me anytime.

  She takes the card.  Takes a look from the MANAGER --

                                    COLLEEN HUGHES
                  I got to get back to work.

  She moves off.  OFF Russell's look.



  An industrial part of town.*



    Denali pulls up.  Russell and Sara get out.  Sara shoots a
  look across the street, clocks Burrows' sedan.  No Burrows.  

                                  SARA

    Something's not right.  Suddenly, they hear a WOMAN'S SCREAM!
  Is it Colleen?  They rush toward the building.  Sara pulls
  her gun.  Russell pulls his cell --
