                                  Rockne S O'Bannon      We begin with the final two minutes of Episode 422... 
      Crichton proposes, Aeryn accepts. A ship swoops down and 
      FIRES, turning them to crystal, which shatters to thousands 
      of pieces and drifts to the bottom of the ocean...

      UNDERWATER - ALIEN OCEAN FLOOR - CG

      The murkiness clears... we're at the bottom among stone 
      formations; exotic flora dances, strange alien fish dart. 
      WE MOVE IN on what looks like little black, shiny pebbles, 
      scattered everywhere.

        A grey-green HAND reaches into FRAME. Stubby fingers begin 
      picking up the shiny pebbles. PAN UP TO REVEAL--

      RYGEL.

      Occasional bubbles escape his nose as he drifts down here 
      with complete ease. He glances at the last of the pebbles, 
      then shoves them into his mouth and swallows.

      A small fish swims past his face. Rygel's eyes shift; he 
      regards the fish, then -- his head darts, lightning fast, 
      catching the struggling morsel in his teeth. Gulp.

      EXT. SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER - SPACE

      The centerpiece of an armada consisting of seven smaller 
      ships, the behemoth carrier is bristling with armaments.


      INT. SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER - BRIDGE

      TIGHT ON CAPTAIN BRACA as he receives quiet word from his 
      young and very scared Communications Officer. Braca's 
      already drawn face tightens more.

      TRACK WITH Braca across the massive bridge, command centre 
      for the entire armada. HIGHEST LEVEL OF TENSION. Everyone 
      as quiet as they can be. Waiting...

                                  BRACA
                    Sir... Sir.

      A lone figure stands silhouetted by the stars out the 
      enormous three-story-tall windows. A very familiar       silhouette. A very calm silhouette.

                                  BRACA
                    Another deep space contact from 
                      Peacekeeper Strategic Command. Grand 
                      Chancellor Maryk. Again.

      The figure doesn't turn. We're forced to sweep around him. 
      And in CLOSE UP, we behold -- SCORPIUS. With nonchalant 
      disdain, he extends a hand. Braca places a COMMS HEADSET 
      into it. Everyone pretends not to listen.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Grand Chancellor...

      EXT. MARYK'S BATTLE FLAGSHIP - SPACE

      In orbit around Peacekeeper Outpost DD-17, a colourful 
      world with fierce weather cover. The massive ship is 
      cocooned by layers of other combat and support vessels.

      INT. TACTICAL CORE - MARYK'S BATTLE FLAGSHIP

      The Peacekeeper version of the White House's Situation 
      Room. Data screens, deep space comms stations, etc. Nerve 
      center for the entire Peacekeeper military machine.

      GRAND CHANCELLOR MARYK stands in the eye of this power 
      room. Answerable only to High Command. Yet even they are 
      intimidated by him. Not so much a man as a force of nature. 
      And at the moment, it takes everything in his power not to 
      explode with the rage that consumes him.

                                  MARYK
                          (re REPORT he holds)
                    Ambush a Scarran armada six times 
                    larger than your own, Scorpius?
                            (exploding)
                    Where the hezmana in my orders did you
                    find the phrase "Preemptive Attack"?



                                                                            INTERCUT:                                  SCORPIUS
                    The Scarrans were massing for an
                    impending onslaught we all know is
                    coming. A conflict we are ill-situated
                    to win. By challenging them before 
                    they were prepared, we at least have a
                    fighting chance.

                                  MARYK
                    You were sent there to--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    With all due respect, I was sent here 
                    to perish at the vanguard of this 
                      inevitable conflict. I have simply 
                    refused to participate on their 
                    terms... Or yours.

                                  MARYK
                            (hissing fury)
                    Because of your actions, the Scarran
                    Empire has declared war against us. Do
                    you know what that means, Scorpius?

      The crew of Scorpius' bridge all suddenly have to pee. 
      Scorpius, however, barely hides his pleasure. He moves near 
      one of the forward stations; manned by a woman with short 
      hair, not dressed like the others. His hand brushes her 
      shoulder gently -- his touch electric to her.

      SIKOZU turns to catch his eye. Hers also glint with 
      excitement, sharing his adventure.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Has Peacekeeper High Command issued a
                        counter-declaration?

                                  MARYK
                    Moments ago. We are officially engaged
                    in the last war of our era.
                            (rueful hatred)
                      Congratulations.

      LOSE INTERCUT as Sccrpius tosses his Comms headset to the 
      deck. This is what he's always longed for.                                  SCORPIUS
                      Assessment?

                                  SIKOZU
                    He did not relieve you of
                    command, and their declaration 
                    response was drafted in
                      miraculously short time... They know
                    you're correct.

      Scorpius nods; that's his take, too.

                                  BRACA
                    Sir... As positioned, we're completely
                    exposed in--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    A highly magnetic region of space.
                            (for everyone to hear)
                    Suit up, Captain, and I'll show you 
                    how to win a war.

      And off Braca's reaction...

      UNDERWATER - ALIEN OCEAN

      Rygel is now swimming upward toward the surface. 
      Struggling, because his belly is full of pebbles.

      Above, A LATTICE FRAMEWORK looms. The underside of some 
      floating "platform. "Rygel approaches the glassy underside 
      of the water's surface and--

      A POWERFUL HAND plunges in, seizing him.

      EXT. BARGE - DAY

      Rygel is unceremoniously PLOPPED onto the barge. A pair of 
      heavy boots beside him. Rygel belches water from his lungs, 
      purposely onto the boots. With royal disdain--

                                  RYGEL
                    Thank you ever so for your "kind"
                      assistance ...

      The wearer of the boots kneels into FRAME. It is D'ARGO.                                  D'ARGO
                    Always anxious to lend a hand, your 
                    royal loftiness ...
                            (beat)
                    Have you recovered all of the
                    pieces?

                                  RYGEL
                            (starting to retch)
                    So often I've proclaimed having a 
                    belly full of Crichton and Aeryn. 
                    Never thought it'd be so literal...

      He vomits. Up comes the huge pile of black pebbles... along 
      with stomach juices, and partially-digested flora and fauna 
      from the ocean floor, including the alien fish we saw him 
      eat earlier. Off D'Argo's look--

                                  RYGEL
                    What -- you don't get hungry... ?

                                  CAA'TA (0.S.)
                    Is that all of the pieces, Hynerian?

      D'Argo and Rygel both look at the O.S.speaker with 
      identical contempt. D'Argo rises. REVEALING:

      THREE EIDELONS stand guard over them. Each holds an Eidelon 
      rifle. The leader is named CAA'TA. The Eidelons' faces all 
      sport the telltale segmentation lines.

      D'Argo eyes Caa'ta balefully.

                                  D'ARGO
                      I appreciate your show of concern for 
                    my friends -- considering it was you 
                    who put them in this state.

                                  CAA'TA
                      Inadvertent. Our weapon only renders a
                    potential enemy in a temporary 
                      crystalline state. It was their unique 
                      physiologies that caused them to... 
                      shatter... as they did.
                            (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                  CAA'TA (CONT'D)
                    What did you call their species again?



      NORANTI scurries up, scoops a fist-full of the gooey 
      pebbles, turns to two palettes laid out on the sand. A 
      large mound of the black pebbles rests atop each palette. 
      Noranti samples the gooey pebbles in her mouth.

                                    NORANTI
                    This is Crichton -- he is called a 
                    human.
                            (tastes another pebble)
                    And Aeryn -- Sebacean. Definitely 
                    Sebacean.

      D'Argo and Caa'ta watch her actions with matching grimaces.

      Rygel is struggling to pull on his tunic.

                                  CAA'TA
                    We need all the pieces to have any 
                    chance of reconstructing your friends.

      D'Argo grabs Rygel by the tunic which still covers Rygel's 
      head. D'Argo yanks down the tunic. Rygel finds himself eye 
      to eye with the clench-jawed Luxan.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Have you gotten them all?

                                  RYGEL
                    From under every rock, every crevice. 
                    I sifted the bottom sand with my bare 
                    hands -- look at my nails!

      One of the Eidelon Guards listens on his comms. Then--

                                    EIDELON GUARD #1
                    Caa'ta! The Leviathan ship -- it is
                      returning!

                                  CAA'TA
                    I hope the others of your crew have 
                    been successful in their quest.

      No one wishes this more than D'Argo, Rygel, and Noranti.                                  CAA'TA
                          (to Guard)
                    Order the concealment canopy lowered.

      EXT. SPACE - ABOVE QUJAGAN WATER PLANET - CG

      Only the expansive ocean visible from horizon to horizon. 
      Then a shimmering displacement of energy over a particular 
      section of ocean as the Eidelon concealment canopy is 
      powered down, and...

      The Eidelon city is revealed. A glistening, metropolis of 
      towering, exotic architecture.

      A TRANSPORT POD FLIES in at the TOP of FRAME as the Qujagan 
      barge races over the water towards the city.

      EXT. DOCK - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      A newly-landed Transport Pod HISSES steam. D'Argo moves to 
      the stairs; Caa'ta beside him, rifle ready. Two EIDELON 
      GUARDS emerge from the Pod, rifles in hand. They spot 
      Caa'ta, nod to him. Then CHIANA pops out of the Pod between 
      the two Guards. A smile appears on D'Argo's lips.

                                  CHIANA
                    D'ARGO!

      She does a Chiana-leap off the ramp, landing in his arms.

      D'Argo is startled to see: her eyes are different.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Chiana... your eyes.

                                  CHIANA
                    I CAN SEE AGAIN, D'ARGO. I CAN SEE.

      Extremely pleased, D'Argo hugs her powerfully.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What happened?How did you--

                                  CHIANA
                    WHAT?                                  D'ARGO
                            (wincing)
                    WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?

                                  CHIANA
                    I'M NOT SHOUTING. IT'S MY HEARING. 
                    WHEN MY SIGHT WAS RESTORED, MY 
                      HEARING... WELL, HE SAYS IT'S ONLY 
                      TEMPORARY.

                                  D'ARGO
                    He who?HE WHO?

                                  CHIANA
                    THE DIAGNOSAN.

                                  D'ARGO
                    YOU FOUND A DIAGNOSAN? -

                                  STARK (O.S.)
                    We found one -- yes.

      STARK emerges from the Pod. He grins proudly and indicates 
      the statuesque figure behind him. A DIAGNOSAN.

      The Diagnosan steps authoritatively from the doorway. 
      Pauses haughtily.

      Takes one more step, and -- goes ass over teakettle down 
      the ramp... landing face first in the mud at D'Argo's feet. 
      He MOANS pathetically.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What's wrong with him?

                                  CHIANA
                    WHAT?

                                  GRUNCHLK (O.S.)
                    Nothing's wrong with him. Really...

      GRUNCHLK is pushing past Stark. D'Argo's eyes narrow, 
      firstin surprise -- followed immediately by contempt.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Grunchlik. I thought you were...                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Dead? Not hardly, mate.

                                  CHIANA
                    IT'S GRUNCHLK. YOU REMEMBER GRUNCHLK,
                    DON'T YOU?

      Grunchlk is helping the very-unsteady Diagnosan to his 
      feet.

      The Diagnosan is pawing at the mud on his tunic.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Here ya go big fella. Upsy-daisy. 
                    Soles get that later. Here...

      Grunchlk offers a Raslak bladder to the Diagnosan.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Take a pull on this. Hair of the 
                    dramm...

      The Diagnosan reaches with one hand -- and misses.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Two hands, doc, two... there ya 
                      go...Splendid!

      The Diagnosan takes a long, long, long drink. D'Argo gives 
      Chiana a disbelieving look. She shrugs, it's the best they 
      could do.

      Stark grins, he's proud of the find.

      INT. SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER - BRIDGE - MID-BATTLE

      BATTLE LIGHTS GLOW RED. CROSS-TALK EVERYWHERE as officers 
      man posts. THE SHIP IS ROCKED BY AN EXTERNAL EXPLOSION.

      Out the windows, we see SCORPIUS' FLEET, now augmented by 
      SCORES OF TINIER PROWLER CRAFT, engaged in pitched battle 
      with A MASSIVE NUMBER OF SCARRAN FIGHTERS. In the distance, 
      SEVERAL SCARRAN DREADNAUGHTS fire at us. The overall effect 
      is the Peacekeepers are outnumbered and outgunned.

                                  COMMS OFFICER #1
                    Sir! The Scarran vanguard has breached
                    our defense perimeter!      THE SHIP IS ROCKED AGAIN. Focused on her readouts, Sikozu 
      speaks with clipped efficiency, Scorpius behind her.

                                  SIKOZU
                    We have drawn them in sufficiently. 
                    The trap is set.

                                  SCORPIUS
                      Sub-particle magnetic pulse cycle?

                                  SIKOZU
                    Peaking

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Captain -- initiate the plan exactly 
                    as I gave you.

                                  BRACA
                    Aye, sir.

      INT. BRACA'S PROWLER - FLYING - INTERCUT

      Braca in flight suit, at the controls.

                                  BRACA
                    All pilots -- deactivate targeting and
                    flight systems. We fly manual from 
                    here.
                            (leans into turn)
                    Kesshon Red Team, heel close to my 
                    left flank! Blue Team arc right! Upon
                    signal, execute tiered attack on lead
                    Scarran Dreadnaught. Confirm.

                                  RED TEAM LEADER
                    Red Leader confirms plan of attack.

                                  BLUE TEAM LEADER
                    Blue Team's with you, Captain.

      BRACA'S SHIP BEGINS TO SHUDDER, TAKING FIRE. Out his 
      window, A DREADNAUGHT BEGINS TO GROW LARGER. He's flying 
      straight into the enemy's heart.

      INT. SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

      Sikozu's eyes gleam. Scorpius is pure concentration.                                  SIKOZU
                    Fly straight in. Their targeting
                      telemetries will be corrupted at least
                    two degrees off-center by the ambient
                      magnetics. Dare them to hit you point-
                    on.

      The command carrier is rocked again.

                                  COMMS OFFICER #1
                    All armada ships now taking heavy 
                    fire, sir. They're swarming us.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Only for the moment.
                    Stand position.

      INT. BRACA'S PROWLER - FLYING

      Outside his window, Scarran fighters zip by, FIRING TRACER 
      LASERS. The Dreadnaught is huge -- he's that close.

                                  BRACA
                    And... fire !

      Braca unleashes MISSILES THAT SLAM INTO THE DREADNAUGHT. 
      More missiles from other Prowlers streak past on either 
      side of him, also ERUPTING IN FIERY EXPLOSIONS.

      INT. SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

      THE COMMS FILL WITH SHOUTS OF SUCCESS. TEN PILOT'S VOICES 
      ALL TALKING AT ONCE. BRACA CUTS THROUGH--

                                  BRACA
                    Celebrate later. Regroup on axis Viga. 
                    I want another run.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Enemy fighters spinning to defense.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Captain -- as you circle, concentrate 
                    on single pilot craft. You should find 
                    their exhaust outlets inviting.                                  BRACA
                    Marauder units Decca and Jira hew wide
                    for stagger assault with Tri-nad
                    Torpedos. All other craft blow those
                    frelling Scarran fighters to hezmana!

      A CHORUS OF EXCITED SHOUTS FILL THE COMMS. Even the bridge 
      crew around Scorpius is starring to understand that they 
      have a chance here. A good chance.

      Sikozu looks with admiration and lust to her man, and...

      INT. EIDELON HEALING FACILITY - DAY

      The two palettes have been relocated to this Eidelon 
      "hospital", full of arcane equipment, exam tables, etc.

      The Diagnosan stands before a pair of side-by-side 
      Suspension Cones -- vertical cones of colored light.

      Still wobbly, he is nevertheless performing the service he 
      was brought here for: his hands a blur as he lifts the 
      pebble pieces and places them in the correct anatomical 
      position in the vertical cones of light. Once positioned, 
      the pieces hang in place. It's like a 3-D jigsaw puzzle 
      suspended in mid-air. Already big sections of Crichton's 
      and Aeryn's bodies are back together, each in the 
      respective pose when crystallized.

      Noranti hovers over the Diagnosan, proofing his work and 
      pointing out errors.

      OFF TO ONE SIDE: D'Argo stands with Chiana and Grunchlk.

      The Eidelons have set out some food -- Grunchlk is 
      generously helping himself. Meanwhile, D'Argo is dripping 
      some viscous brownish liquid into Chiana's upturned ear.

                                  CHIANA
                    I HATE THAT!

                                  D'ARGO
                    IT'S ULKEEN HONEY. NORANTI SAYS IT 
                    WILL HELP RESTORE YOUR HEARING.
                          (to Grunchlk)
                    This is all your fault.                                  GRUNCHLK
                    The doc restored the pretty little
                    thing's eyesight -- you think that's a
                    simple matter?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Those aren't even her own eyes.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Those are Kesslite peepers she's got
                    there -- better than the Nebari ones 
                    she was born with...

                                  D'ARGO
                          (to Chiana)
                    HOW'S THAT?

      Chiana instantly throws her hands over her ears.

                                  CHIANA
                      Frell...not so loud!

                                    NORANTI
                            (strident, to the Diagnosan)
                    No. No! He'll hardly want that in the 
                    middle of his face.
                            (pointing)
                    Lower.

      D'Argo looks over at the wobbly-legged Diagnosan.

                                  D'ARGO
                    He better get this right.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    You're lucky to have him. Diagnosans 
                    are going to be at a premium now -- 
                    what with the war and all.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What war?

      Chiana finishes wiping her ears. Now her normal voice--

                                  CHIANA
                    The Peacekeepers and Scarrans have
                    declared war against each other.                                  D'ARGO
                    Don't the Peacekeepers know what 
                    they're up against ... ?

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Scarrans didn't give 'em much choice.
                    They were already taking the galaxy by
                    force... system by system...

                                  D'ARGO
                      A galaxy-wide war...

      Chiana nods. Grunchlk pops some grapes in his mouth--

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Splendid profit to be made during
                    something like this, fella plays his
                    Tadak tiles right...

      D'Argo glares at him. Caa'ta steps up--

                                  CAA'TA
                    It appears your Diagnosan has nearly
                    completed the positioning.

                                    NORANTI
                            (exiting)
                    I'll go and inspect their life support
                    system in case this doesn't work.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Whether this restoration is effective 
                    or not, we expect you gone from our 
                    world by nightfall

                                  D'ARGO
                    With pleasure.

      ANGLE - THE TWO SUSPENSION CONES

      When we last saw them, Crichton and Aeryn were in an 
      embrace... and the two palettes are now rolled together so 
      that the lovers are once again in that embrace.

      A team of Eidelon THERAPEUTIANS ready a laboratory version 
      of their Stasis Device. The Diagnosan steps back... like an 
      artist admiring his work. His hand darts out toward 
      Grunchlk, who is there, ready, with the Raslak bladder. The       Diagnosan takes a long, celebratory draft. Caa'ta nods for 
      the Therapeutians to proceed. They trigger the device and--

      The beam hits Crichton and Aeryn. The tiny pebble pieces 
      begin to pulse... to stretch and pull... attracted then 
      repelled from each other...

      The kick from the beam plays on D'Argo's face, as well as 
      the others', as they watch with supreme anxiety.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN FAST on Crichton and Aeryn's forms... 
      actually traveling inside their bodies... we RIDE the 
      fibers, the tissues, the very molecules of the muscles and 
      organs and bones... as they find their "neighbors" and 
      begin to knit back together... the brain cells reuniting, a 
      spark igniting with every synapse that finds its mate... 
      With one final powerful

      FLASH, the Stasis Device powers down--

      CLOSE - TWO SHOT ... CRICHTON AND AERYN. Still locked in 
      that kiss. Sensing a change of locale, their eyes open. 
      Even before breaking from the kiss, their eyes shift as 
      they take in the room around them. Flummoxed to find 
      themselves indoors, with an audience!

      They instantly break from the kiss and spin down out of the 
      Suspension Cones, each aiming a Pulse Pistol, covering the 
      others back.

                                  D'ARGO
                    You're alive!

      As Caa'Ta and the other Eidelon RAISE THEIR RIFLES in 
      response.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Lower your weapons!

      D'Argo sweeps up Crichton in a huge hug. Chiana throws her 
      arms around Aeryn. Crichton and Aeryn exchange looks past 
      D'Argo's and Chiana's backs: We obviously missed 
        something... Though no one lowers their weapons, Crichton 
      and Aeryn start to put the clues together...

                                  CRICHTON
                    How long?                                  D'ARGO
                    Almost sixty solar days.

                                  AERYN
                    Where?

                                  CHIANA
                    Still on that water planet.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Put your weapons down, now.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Bad guy?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Yes... and no. They did let us put you
                    back together.

                                  AERYN
                    Put us back together... ?

                                  CHIANA
                    You were... crystallized. By their 
                    weapon. They said it was an 
                      accident...

                                  CRICHTON & AERYN
                      Crystallized?

      Suddenly -- Caa'ta and his Guards seize Crichton and Aeryn.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Last warning...

      Off D'Argo's nod, Crichton and Aeryn lower their pistols. 
      Caa'Ta and his pal DO NOT lower theirs.

      Rapidfire, as Crichton and Aeryn are led away at gunpoint 
      in different directions--

                                  CRICHTON
                    You said "yes."

                                  AERYN
                    I did.                                  CRICHTON
                    It's been sixty days -- any regrets?

                                  AERYN
                    None.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We're engaged!

                                    D'ARGO&CHIANA
                      Congratulations!

      INT. SCORPIUS'S COMMAND CARRIER - BRIDGE - MID BATTLE

      The conflict still rages outside, but it's FARTHER from us; 
      the Peacekeepers are pushing the enemy back. The bridge 
      crew is energized. It's a renewed Braca who ENTERS, FLIGHT 
      HELMET under his arm.

                                  BRACA
                    Sir -- as you predicted, their gunners 
                    and pilots are no match for ours on 
                    manual contro--

      Braca stops as Scorpius FREEZES, jolted by something. As if 
      hearing some far-away noise no one else hears.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Scorpius? What is it?

      The tiniest trace of a smile touches Scorpius' lips.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Prepare to withdraw.

                                  BRACA
                    Withdraw?

                                  SIKOZU
                    Our Marauders and Prowlers are too far
                    flung to recall quickly.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Only we withdraw. This Command 
                    Carrier. The remainder of the armada 
                    is to continue engaging the enemy, 
                    covering our escape.                                  BRACA
                            (horrified)
                    Bur, sir -- we're winning.

                                  SIKOZU
                            (studying him closely)
                    Without this carrier, all remaining 
                    units will be destroyed.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    My orders are clear.

                                  BRACA
                    We're sacrificing our ships, our
                    pilots... to retreat? From victory?

                                  SCORPIUS
                            (SCARRAN VOICE NOW)
                    You may stay, if you choose.

      Beat. Braca backs off, shaking; spins to the crew--

                                  BRACA
                    Plot egress route, hangars closed, rig

                            (easing close)
                    Scorpius? What has happened?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    He's alive, Sikozu. John Crichton... 
                    is still alive.

      INT. TACTICAL CORE - PK BATTLE FLAGSHIP

      Maryk stares at a message just handed to him.

                                  MARYK
                      Retreating?

                                  LT JATOS
                    Scorpius has powered off his on-board
                    beacon. We have no way to track him.                                  MARYK
                    Broadcast this order. Highest 
                    priority. The instant his Command 
                    Carrier is spotted, it is to be fired 
                    upon. No hailing; no offer of 
                      surrender. I want that coward Scorpius 
                    and all who fly with him erased from 
                      existence!

                                  LT JATOS
                    Aye, Chancellor.

      The Comms Officer hurries off.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                    Scorpius is many things, Maryk... none 
                    of them good. But a coward? Never...

      Maryk looks around at the speaker. GRAYZA. Much to 
      ourshock, she is pregnant. Her- body language, her close 
      stance to Maryk tells us she is more than a mere advisor.

                                  MARYK
                    He has initiated this war and then
                    turned and run. How do you define
                      cowardice, Grayza?
                            (beat)
                    Perhaps the half-breed bastard has 
                    decided to shift allegiances and join 
                    our enemy.

      Grayza's hand brushes Maryk's.

                                  GRAYZA
                    Grand Chancellor. Consider my counsel 
                    on this carefully. Hatred of the 
                    Scarrans is Scorpius's sole consistent 
                    trait. It is something else...

      Several LIEUTENANTS hover, anxious to speak with Maryk.

                                  MARYK
                    At this moment, what else is there?

      As Maryk spins to his Lieutenants and matters of war. PUSH 
      IN on Grayza. We see that she already has her suspicions...      EXT. SPACE - SCARRAN WAR COMMAND POST - CG

      CLOSE ON the muzzle of some huge canon-like gun. WIDEN--

      WE are in the midst of the Scarran War Command Post. A 
      fleet of warships protect the single Scarran Decimator at 
      their centre.

      INT. SCARRAN WAR NEXUS - DECIMATOR

      The stunning centre of the entire Scarran war machine. The 
      Scarran Command LIEUTENANTS are loud, physical (Scarrans 
      being heavily influenced by their reptilian origins). The 
      Charnds who man the support stations are terrified of the 
      Lieutenants who pace behind them.

      AS WE MOVE up to the pleased EMPEROR STALEEK --

                                    STALEEK
                      Excellent. Have our commanders 
                    continue to attack civilian targets. 
                    It forces the Peacekeepers to divert 
                    their precious Command Carriers.

      WAR MINISTER AHKNA approaches  

                                  AHKNA
                    Emperor Staleek--

                                    STALEEK
                    What is it?

                                  AHKNA
                    We have received a deep space comms
                    cipher.

                                    STALEEK
                    We receive tens of thousands of--

                                  AHKNA
                    This is from a most unexpected source.
                    With a most unexpected message.
                            (beat)
                    It is about... John Crichton.

      This gets Staleek's attention.                                  AHKNA
                    The sender knows the human's current,
                    location. An out of the way water 
                    planet. No defences to speak of.

                                    STALEEK
                    Do the Peacekeepers have him?

                                  AHKNA
                    Not yet.

                                    STALEEK
                    Your source -- is it reliable?

                                  AHKNA
                    At the moment? Impeccable.

      Staleek stares off, weighing this. Finally--

                                    STALEEK
                    Have a course plotted. We will take a
                    full battle contingent.

                                  AHKNA
                    A full contingent? For one man?

                                    STALEEK
                    Not for the man. For the knowledge he
                      possesses.
                            (dark beat)
                    Were you questioning my order, War
                    Minister?

      Beat. Ahkna backs away, spins, thrusts a DATA PAD at an 
      officer--

                                  AHKNA
                    Plot course to this location.

      And as Ahkna addresses her task, PUSH CLOSE on Staleek's 
      troubled expression...

      INT. EIDELON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Windowless. A chair Crichton refuses to sit upon. He's in 
      the light; Caa'ta hurls questions from the shadows.                                  CRICHTON
                            (perfectly frustrated)
                    What--? Again?-

                                  CAA'TA
                    One more time, if you don't mind.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (duh)
                    Body Language 101 -- I mind. How many
                    times you need to hear the same story?

                                  CAA'TA
                    Until we believe it is sans 
                      fabrication.

      Crichton steps aggressively toward the shadows. Caa'ta 
      reacts defensively. He has HIS WEAPON. Crichton stops, 
      peers into the darkness. Sees a SECOND FIGURE watching: 
      PRIESTESS MUOMA, gentle countenance, appraising eyes.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Are you the Good Cop, the Bad Cop, or 
                    the Meter Maid?

      Muoma remains stoic.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Continue

                                  CRICHTON
                    Alright -- one last time... My name is 
                    John Crichton, and I was born a poor 
                    black child. My mother ran a bordello 
                    where all the girls were Academy Award 
                    Winners. Dad was a famous Earth --
                            that's-the-planet-you've-never-heard-
                    of-but- keep-asking-about-as-if-me-
                        telling-you-for-the- hundredth-time's-
                          gonna-make-you-get-it-any-better --
                    astronaut who worked nights as Michael
                    Jackson's plastic surgeon...I was an 
                      astronaut, too, and one day, after
                    getting shot from a giant circus 
                    cannon into space, I was doing some 
                    tests in my experimental module, 
                                  (MORE)                                  CRICHTON (CONT'D)
                    Farscape One, for what was supposed to 
                    be a three hour cruise. But the
                    weather started getting rough, the 
                    tiny ship was tossed, and I rode the 
                    commode -- which is another way of 
                    saying "shot through a wormhole" --and 
                    was flushed out here in your end of 
                    the galaxy. Blah-blah, blah-blah, I 
                    end up on Moya, the Leviathan, our 
                    living ship, with those creatures out 
                    there, now my friends, who were at the 
                    time prisoners escaping from really 
                    bad guys. Now, Aeryn, the gorgeous 
                    lady you played three-dimensional 
                    jigsaw puzzle with? She was one of the 
                    evil Peacekeepers -- how 'bout that 
                    for a misnomer? -- assigned to 
                    recapture them, and me. Why me? 
                    Because I landed in the wrong place at 
                    the wrong time, Alice. We're all 
                    peaceful, we all wanna get back to our 
                      respective homes, and we all wanna
                    get satellite TV, but I can't tell you 
                    how many times and how many nasty 
                    species since then won't let that 
                    happen. Bitter? Me?... So life's just 
                    been one grand alien anal probe
                    after another since then, culminating 
                    with this latest indignity... you.
                            (beat)
                    Did that match my previous version?

      And off their consternation and Crichton's exasperation...

      EXT. EIDELON STREET - DAY

      The streets are alive with foot traffic'and commerce. We 
      pick up Crichton and Chiana moving through the scene--

                                  CRICHTON
                    A five hour interrogation?

                                  CHIANA
                    Calm down. If our stories match, we 
                    get to go.      Passing a FOOD STALL, Chiana quickly sees no one is 
      watching and PINCHES SOME for her and Crichton. They eat 
      and walk 

                                  CRICHTON
                    All this overkill; they worried about 
                    the war?

                                  CHIANA
                    I think paranoid before that. But this 
                    is the big one, Crichton. Everybody's 
                    getting sucked in, chewed up, and spit 
                    out.
                            (spits out bad tasting food)

                                  CRICHTON
                    Not my problem.

      With a SHRIEK OF JOY, Chiana jumps onto his back.

                                  CHIANA
                    I knew you'd be smart! I knew you were 
                    done.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm done.

                                  CHIANA
                    No more hero.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Uh-uh.

                                  CHIANA
                    No more, "I've got an idea."

                                  CRICHTON
                    Fresh out.

                                  CHIANA
                    I love you.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You're on my list. Where's the woman 
                    at the top?                                  CHIANA
                    Aeryn? With the Doc. Felt something 
                    funny about the baby while they were
                      questioning her.

      Crichton stops and stares daggers.

                                  CHIANA
                            (defensive, indicating)
                    I'm taking you there...

      In zero mood, he grabs her arm and DRAGS HER up the street.

      INT. HEALING FACILITY - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Aeryn lies on an exam table. The Diagnosan has his battered 
      implement case open. He traces a palm scanner over Aeryn' s 
      body. Grunchlk stands nearby, his back to the procedure... 
      but can't help stealing glances.

      Wound tight, Crichton kneels at the side of the table, 
      caressing Aeryn's face. Both are concerned.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What kind of "funny"?

                                  AERYN
                      Different.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Aeryn...

                                  AERYN
                    I'm not sure. Maybe when we were
                      crystallized ...

      Trying to stem his fears, Crichton is up and pacing.

                                  CRICHTON
                    All I was looking for was a few 
                    minutes, a few lousy minutes, to 
                    propose. Didn't ask for an hour; a 
                    weekend in Tahiti... Just a few 
                    stinking minutes where some cantina
                    refugee wasn't shooting at us.

                                  AERYN
                    It's gonna be alright.                                  CRICHTON
                    Bet'cha. Know why?'Cause we're done.
                    Punching out. Finite. Next Ferengi I 
                    see? Dead first; no questions later.
                            (calms; strokes her hair)
                    From this moment on, my one and only 
                      concern... my life... is you... and 
                    our baby.

      Aeryn looks into his eyes, smiles, nods. They both turn to 
      the Diagnosan as he SPEAKS URGENTLY to Grunchlk.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Are you sure?

      The Diagnosan holds the palm scanner over Aeryn's abdomen 
      one more time. Aeryn tries to sit up.

                                  AERYN
                    What is it? Is the baby healthy?

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    The doc doesn't know what you're 
                    talking about, missy. There is no 
                    baby.

                                  AERYN
                    John... ?

                                  CRICHTON
                    What do you mean no baby?

      Grunchlk taps Aeryn's hand, tries for compassion. Tries.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    If you had a little passenger 
                      before...it... well, it ain't aboard 
                    the train no more...

      Crichton and Aeryn exchange a look of pain and horror. The 
      Diagnosan scans again. Says something.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Doc says you never were preggers.

                                  AERYN
                    But I was. I know I was!                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Well, there's no baby now. No nothin.

      Crichton stares at Aeryn. Then, slowly, a notion dawns--

                                  CRICHTON
                    We were in pieces... thousands of
                    pieces...

      And as the idea sinks in on him--

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. BISTRO - EIDELON CITY

      D'Argo seated. Crichton and Aeryn stand nervously over 
      him,having just told him the news.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Rygel said he got every last piece off
                    the ocean floor.

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel?

                                  D'ARGO
                    He was very thorough. We made sure of 
                    it. He even carried the pieces up in 
                    his stomachs so he was sure not to 
                    drop any back dow--

      And the realization slowly strikes them all simultaneously.

      INT. HEALING FACILITY - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Rygel struggles as Crichton and Aeryn forcibly hold him 
      down allowing the Diagnosan to run a scan over him.

                                  RYGEL
                    YOUR BABY IS WHERE?

      The Diagnosan turns to Grunchlk.

                                  DIAGNOSAN
                          (IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE)
                    The baby's inside him. Alive and fine.                                  GRUNCHLK
                          (to Rygel)
                      Congratulations, mate. You're a 
                    mother.

                                  CRICHTON, AERYN, RYGEL
                    NO!

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Whoa, whoa, keep yourselves calm. The 
                    wee babe is doing just fine.

                                  RYGEL
                    Yeah -- but it's doing just fine 
                    inside me! How?!

                                  DIAGNOSAN
                            (speaks with great 
                            difficulty)
                      Im-plant... in Hynerian... mid-die 
                    stomach

                                  CRICHTON
                    This cannot be happening.

      Aeryn seizes the Diagnosan.

                                  AERYN
                    Do something!

      Grunchlk grabs her to separate them. Crichton grabs 
      Grunchlk. Grunchlk gives him a hard look.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Fees about to go up.

      Grunchlk releases Aeryn. Crichton, ready to strangle 
      someone, releases Grunchlk. Then, to the Diagnosan--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Move it back into Aeryn. Now.

                                  AERYN
                    Whatever it takes. I--.                                  DIAGNOSAN
                          (IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE)
                    If I do it, both the baby and Rygel 
                    will die.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Doc won't do it.

      Before Crichton or Aeryn can do anything, Rygel grabs 
      Grunchlk's tunic, yanks hard -- pulling Grunchlk to him--

                                  RYGEL
                    Won't?! I want this thing removed
                      immediately.

                                  AERYN
                    It's not a thing.

                                  RYGEL
                    Fine -- I want this 'miracle of life' 
                    the frell out of me!

      The diagnosan chitters...

                                  GRUNCHLK
                            (translating)
                    -- At the end of the first quadmester.
                    Baby's still too small now. Fragile.

      Grunchlk draws his finger across his throat.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (staying calm)
                    First quadmester?

      Reacting, Rygel grabs the Raslak bladder nearby. He really 
      needs a drink. It is slapped out of his hand. By Aeryn.

                                  AERYN
                    No Raslak.

                                  RYGEL
                    Did you hear what he just said?!

                                  AERYN
                    Until I get my baby back, you eat and
                    drink only what I tell you.      Rygel stares harshly. The Diagnosan falls to his knees, 
      trying to save his precious Raslak. Crichton looks from the 
      Diagnosan on the floor, to Rygel who carries his child. 
      Crichton shakes his head in disbelief. Then his eye goes to 
      Aeryn, and her troubled expression sobers him instantly.

      EXT. BISTRO - EIDELON CITY

      Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo, Chiana, Noranti and Rygel eating. 
      An EIDELON SERVER delivers food with a jaundiced look. 
      Other Eidelons pass by with unfriendly glances. Chiana 
      reaches over and gently touches Rygel's stomach.

                                  CHIANA
                      Incredible. What's it feel like?

                                  RYGEL
                    You tell me.

      RYGEL STABS HER HAND WITH AN EATING UTENSIL. Chiana YELPS 
      and pulls away. Aeryn wrenches the utensil from Rygel.

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel, really what's it like?

                                  RYGEL
                    Like having a parasite. A large
                    parasite. That's growing.

      Her worst fears confirmed, she SWITCHES PLATES OF FOOD.

                                  RYGEL
                    I hate weeba eggs.

                                  AERYN
                      Apparently babies love them.

      Rygel sees he's not going to win; accepts with a GRUMBLE.

                                  CRICHTON
                          (re the cold stares)
                    Is it just me, or is that the only 
                    love here?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Chiana's right -- they're paranoid.                                  STARK
                            (arriving)
                    No. Wrong. Not paranoid. I've been
                    talking to many of them--

                                  RYGEL
                    Our ambassador. No wonder they're
                    avoiding us.

                                  CHIANA
                    What's their problem, then?

                                  STARK
                    Fear. Abject fear.

                                    NORANTI
                    Of what?

                                  STARK
                    Their fear extends even to
                    talking about their fear.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Perfect. I see no reason to exacerbate 
                    it by staying any longer.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Whoa, D, think it over... On the other
                    side of their concealment canopy is
                      Armageddon. We wanna fly into that,
                    right now?

      D'Argo looks around the table for other opinions. Realises 
      they're all in agreement with Crichton.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (sighs, rising)
                    They won't like it but I'll ask.

      Chiana has been playing with her new vision.

                                  CHIANA
                    Good time to ask.
                            (off everyone's look)
                    Their magnetic energy fades by midday.
                    Cool eyes.                                  STARK
                    So what we do in the meantime?

                                  CRICHTON
                            (quietly)
                    Get married.

      Everyone freezes. Aeryn looks up--

                                  AERYN
                    Pardon.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Before the baby's born.

      Aeryn sees the puppy-dog passion in Crichton's eye. Noranti 
      grabs Aeryn's face like a grandmother would--

                                    NORANTI
                    You will make a beautiful bride -- I 
                    will see to it! 

      EXT. TEMPLE PLAZA - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Minimalist set up for a wedding. An ARCH, a table with 
      SMALL CAKES and GLASSES OF RASLAK. D'Argo and Stark wait at 
      the designated "altar". Rygel samples the cake. Across the 
      plaza, Crichton approaches with Muoma and Caa'ta.

                                  MUOMA
                    It is the first time I have presided 
                    over the union of soldiers.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We're not--
                          (re Caa'ta)
                    He's the only one carrying a gun.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Either way, your petition to remain 
                    among us has been denied. Upon 
                      conclusion of your ceremony, you will 
                    all leave, vowing never to reveal our 
                      existence.

                                  CRICHTON
                    If you don't mind my asking, who're 
                    you hiding from?                                  MUOMA
                            (sweetly)
                    Everyone.

      As they arrive at the altar spot--

                                  STARK
                    Aeryn's coming! The bride!

      They all look up to see Aeryn stepping into view across the 
      courtyard. Her only concession to the process is A FLOWING 
      VEIL fashioned from scavenged pieces of DIFFERENT GAUGE 
      NETTING; everything underneath regular Aeryn leathers. 
      Chiana keeps pace behind, holding the train. Noranti 
        periodically chucks ALIEN FLOWER PETALS up toward Aeryn as 
      they move. As the petals rain down on her, Aeryn swats them 
      away, annoyed and embarrassed.

                                  STARK
                              (enraptured)
                    She looks--

                                  D'ARGO
                      Different.

                                  RYGEL
                      Ridiculous.

                                  CRICHTON

                                    RICHTON
                    Bridal shop was closed.

      When Aeryn arrives beside him, Crichton takes her hand and 
      stares into her eyes.

                                  AERYN
                            (way under her breath)
                    You owe me.

      Crichton nods. But can't stop grinning.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Wish my Mom was here.

                                  AERYN
                    Glad mine isn't.                                  MUOMA
                    Is there any particular invocation you
                    would like me to use?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Uh... "Dearly Beloved"...

                                  MUOMA
                    Dearly Beloved...

                                  CRICHTON
                          (re church)
                    "We're gathered here under the shadow 
                    of this most magnificent"--

      Suddenly, THE SHADOW MOVES! THE SHADOW ELONGATES AND 
      CROSSES OVER THEM, ENGULFING THE WHOLE PLAZA AND BEYOND IN 
      DARKNESS, like an eclipse!Everything stops; all eyes go 
      skyward.

      THE UNDERSIDE OF A PEACEKEEPER COMMAND CARRIER is seen 
      moving high overhead. Still outside the planet's 
      atmosphere, it is nevertheless a terrifying presence.

                                  AERYN
                    Command Carrier.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Peacekeepers!

      Furious, Caa'ta grabs Crichton accusingly--

                                  CAA'TA
                    Lies! All lies!

      At a loss for words, Crichton shakes his head numbly.

      A SMALLER CRAFT -- A MARAUDER -- is now visible heading 
      down toward this very spot.

      Caa'ta pushes Crichton away and begins dragging Muoma 
      toward the temple. The Eidelons are all fighting panic.

                                  MUOMA
                    They seem to know exactly where we 
                    are. How, if the concealment canopy is 
                    still in place?                                  CAA'TA
                    They know because we have been 
                    betrayed.

      As he hurriedly guides Muoma toward the temple, Caa'ta 
      SHOUTS to some Eidelons nearby---

                                  CAA'TA
                    Alert the militia!

                                    NORANTI
                    Oh, preserve us -- what shall we do?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Go with them.
                          (to Stark)
                    You, too. Let 'em know it wasn't us;
                    keep 'em calm till we sort it out.

      Noranti and Stark nod, then follow the Eidelons.

                                  CHIANA
                    I know you guys don't believe me, but 
                    we are cursed.

                                  AERYN
                    Hide Rygel. Defend him with your life.

      As Chiana drags Rygel off--

                                  RYGEL
                            (covering their exit)
                    Your curse is getting worse.

      JET WASH from the descending Marauder WHIPS THE SCENE. 
      Aeryn realizes she's still wearing the veil and rips it 
      off. A moment later, she produces two PULSE PISTOLS and 
      hands one to Crichton. D'Argo draws his QUALTA BLADE and 
      (offscreen) CONVERTS IT INTO A RIFLE.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Who wants to bet me? It's gotta be.
                    C'mon, bet me. Somebody...

      THE MARAUDER'S LANDING RAMP THUMPS INTO THE PLAZA. 
      Crichton, Aeryn and D'Argo stand fast in the whipping wind 
      -- THE NOISE CRESCENDOING as the ENGINES DIE DOWN, STEAM 
      HISSING.      A long beat, and then a SINGLE PAIR OF BOOTS DESCENDS THE 
      RAMP. Scorpius.

                                  SCORPIUS.
                    Hello, Crichton.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Easy money.

      INT. TEMPLE DOORWAY - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Shouting orders the whole way, Caa'ta hustles Muoma through 
      the large doors like the Secret Service Agent he is. AS THE 
      DOORS CLOSE, Stark rushes through them--

                                  STARK
                      Please!You must listen!We knew
                    nothing of this. Crichton and the 
                    others - will fix it.

      Slowest of all, Noranti arrives just as the doors are 
      swinging shut. Flattening herself to slip through, she 
      watches as the surface of the closing doors passes inches 
      from her face. A bird's eye view of the ORNATE RELIEF 
      SCULPTURE CARVED UPON THEM. A familiar sculpture.

                                    NORANTI
                    Oh, that's familiar...

      As the doors close further, Noranti risks peril to stick 
      her head between them for a final glance at the sculpture.

                                    NORANTI
                    Where have I seen th--
                          (a quaking breath)
                      Eidelons... Of course -- Eidelons!

      Bang!The doors shut, all of them inside. Noranti approaches 
      the others, her intenisty seizing the moment.

                                    NORANTI
                    Eidelons! You're Eidelons!

      Yeah, this is what they need right now; a lunatic.

                                  MUOMA
                    Yes, we are.                                    NORANTI
                            (matter of fact)
                    Then you can end this war. So just 
                    stop pretending you can't!

      And off the Eidelons' and Stark's stunned reactions...

      EXT. TEMPLE PLAZA - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Sikozu has joined Scorpius as they approach Crichton, Aeryn 
      and D'Argo. In the background, Eidelons run scared.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Apologies if this is a bad time, but I
                    believe we need to talk.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How did you find me?

      Scorpius reaches forward to tap Crichton' s forehead.

      Crichton bats away the gesture, and we continue to PUSH IN 
      on Crichton, and suddenly we're--

      INT. PRINCETON CLASSROOM, CIRCA 1950 - DAY

      The blackboards are filled with arcane math equations, the 
      centerpiece of which is the world-changing result: E=MC2. 
      (Buried in the notations are a few obligatory Harveyisms, 
      such as: E=MC Hammer, and E=MC5). Tin fans RATTLE. A figure 
      scribbles equations with inspired brio. From the back, it 
      looks like Albert Einstein, unruly hair and all.

      Crichton sits at a school desk, surrounded by dozens of 
      other empty ones. The figure spins, revealing HARVEY.

                                  HARVEY
                    Ach, John -- it has been such a long
                    time, my friend.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How could you lead Scorpius to me? You
                    can't contact him directly.

                                  HARVEY
                    When the neural implant containing my
                    essence was... "introduced" to your 
                    brain-      Crichton flinches at--

      FLASH MEMORY - Crichton screaming as Scorpius shoves a rod 
      into his ear. (Episode 119 or 120)

                                  HARVEY
                    There were several features built in 
                    even I wasn't aware of. When you -- we 
                    --were crystallized, Scorpius sensed I 
                    was gone. No need for him to chase 
                    after a dead man...

                                  CRICHTON
                    And when they put me back together...

                                  HARVEY
                    I would surmise the second signal 
                      indicating your resurrection, as it 
                    were, was enough to lead him here.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (facetious)
                    Whattaya think he wants, Harv?

                                  HARVEY
                    What they always seek from the gifted. 
                    If not an equation, then perhaps--



      Harvey indicates the E=MC2 on the blackboard, which MORPHS 
      INTO A SWIRLING WORMHOLE.

                                  HARVEY
                      A wormhole. Or in your case, a 
                    wormhole weapon .

                                  CRICHTON
                    Nobody listens when I tell 'em it 
                    can't be done.

                                  HARVEY
                    Why should they? Before some 
                      smartypants figured it out, nuclear 
                    weapons were considered impossible. 
                    Maybe if they push you a little 
                    harder.                                  CRICHTON
                          (at the blackboard now)
                    I can find a wormhole. Predict when 
                    it'll open. Even navigate one, push 
                    comes to shove. But I can't make it 
                    into a weapon.

      Crichton crosses a BIG "X" on the blackboard over the 
      wormhole, causing the WORMHOLE TO DISAPPEAR. He breaks the 
      chalk stick and hands it back to Harvey.

                                  HARVEY
                    All true, John. But you do know where 
                    to obtain that knowledge.
                            (sly)
                    Doesn't take an Einstein to figure 
                    that out, does it?

                                  CRICHTON
                            (turns away with)
                    Love the hair.

      EXT. TEMPLE PLAZA - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      As before; Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo, Scorpius and Sikozu.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    It is time.

      Crichton reacts; there's that word again.

                                  CRICHTON
                    For... ?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Really? What? In your sick little 
                    plan, my theme music is playing? 
                      Heeeeeeeere's Johnny!

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You must have heard that annihilation 
                    war has broken out between the Scarran 
                    Empire and Peacekeeper Alliance.                                  CRICHTON
                    It made the papers. How much of that 
                    are you responsible for?

      Scorpius returns an even look.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Wonderful. You can go now

      Sikozu steps aggressively up to Crichton-- 

                                  SIKOZU
                    What does it take to make you realize
                    your significance in all this?

                                  CRICHTON
                    I've got no significance, Sputnick. 
                    I'm retired.

                                  SIKOZU
                    This is not a conflict that allows for
                      abstentions. You must choose sides.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Choose sides? Fine. I'll take 
                    coleslaw, beans and corn on the cob.

                                  SIKOZU
                    The Scarrans will prevail if someone
                    doesn't--

      Aeryn grabs Sikozu's arm sharply, stopping her tirade.

                                  AERYN
                    Someone else.

      Sikozu wrenches herself free. The women glare.

                                  AERYN
                    Let's you and I have our own little
                      discussion, Sikozu.

      Aeryn begins walking off. After a moment, Sikozu follows. 
      As they leave, D'Argo leans close to Crichton. -                                  D'ARGO
                    I'll make sure the locals don't come 
                    out shooting at all of us. We've kind 
                    of upset their little Utopia.

      Crichton nods as leads Scorpius out into --

      EXT. STREET - EIDELON CITY - CONTINUOUS

                                  SCORPIUS
                    How have you been, Crichton?

      Crichton stares; starts LAUGHING at the casualness of it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm fine, Bob. You? The wife? Kids?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Busy.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'll bet. Business is booming, huh?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Sikozu was correct about one thing. 
                    The Scarrans will not lose. Help us 
                    build a wormhole weapon.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Golly gee, Bob, that sounds so
                      reasonable. Only two problems. No
                    matter what you believe, I cannot do 
                    it. And, just as important... I don't 
                    think the Peacekeepers are any better 
                    'n the Scarrans.
                            (turning to leave)
                    We don't validate parking. Piss off.

      SCORPIUS GRABS CRICHTON'S ARM and whips him back. This is 
      not civil. Crichton attempts to wrench free, but Scorpius 
        effortlessly holds on in a vise grip. They struggle, then-

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You will find no serenity during this
                    conflict, Crichton. Examine your
                    choices.                                  CRICHTON
                    You're not listening. Wormholes, no. 
                    Weapons, no. Killing, no. Crichton, 
                    no.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    True. A wormhole weapon may kill many. 
                    But if you do nothing, what greater 
                    number will perish if the Scarrans 
                    advance across the galaxy unchecked?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Don't lay that on me. I didn't start
                    this war.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    But you can end it.

      EXT. PLAZA/TEMPLE DOORWAY - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      D'Argo is heading towards the Temple Door AS IT SWINGS 
      OPEN. Stark comes charging out followed by a gobsmacked 
      Muoma and Caa'ta. Noranti has just finished explaining 
      something to them all. STARK DANCES AROUND HIM EXCITEDLY; 
      giddy mad.

                                  STARK
                    D'Argo! D'Argo, a miracle!
                            (pointing, gesturing)
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk! Peace!

      Stark's very presence is agitating. D'ARGO TONGUES HIM, 
      dropping the bouncing Stykera unconscious. Turns to 
      Noranti.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What is he talking about?

                                    NORANTI
                            (herself excited)
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk! Peace!

      D'Argo holds up a palm, stopping her. Takes a deep breath. 
      Turns to Muoma.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Please?                                  MUOMA
                            (weary, defeated)
                    We are the last Eidelons -- all others
                    hunted to extinction.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Hunted... ?

                                  MUOMA
                    Our ancestors possessed the means to
                    influence peace. . A gift that has 
                    sadly, not survived to our generation.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I'm familiar with the history.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Then you will also know that twelve-
                    thousand cycles ago, their Great 
                    Temple was destroyed, the Conciliators 
                    within murdered, and all outposts of 
                    our species slaughtered by those who 
                    wished to conquer and enslave.

      He points angrily at the Peacekeeper Marauder.

                                  D'ARGO
                    They're not here to harm anyone. 
                    Believe it or not... they're looking 
                    for a way to stop the war.

                                    NORANTI
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk!

                                  MUOMA
                    Arnessk was the center of our 
                    spiritual power; site of the long lost 
                    Great Temple, upon which this very 
                    edifice is modeled. However, today, 
                    Arnessk is a barren and lifeless 
                    world.

      D'Argo looks to the fervent Noranti. He gets it--

                                  D'ARGO
                    Perhaps not... We have been there.      As Muoma and Caa'ta react--

                                    NORANTI
                    That's what I've been telling them. 
                    But they're too scared to believe. 
                    Pilot can show them. Pilot has the 
                    proof!

      And off the moment...

      INT. EIDELON CITY - HEALING FACILITY

      Crichton and Aeryn are pupils for Noranti's instruction. 
      She fiddles with a LOCAL VIEWSCREEN.

                                  AERYN
                          (to Crichton)
                    D'Argo said after Noranti explained it
                    all to them, the Eidelons were in 
                    tears.

      Noranti spins on them, all bad-teeth and excitement--

                                    NORANTI
                    Oh, goodness, yes!

                                  CRICHTON
                            (recoiling)
                    I'll bet. Ever brush your teeth?

                                    NORANTI
                    Pilot? Pilot, are you ready?

      Pilot appears on screen.

                                  PILOT
                      Commander, Aeryn... These images are
                    part of the data upload transmitted by
                    Jool before we left her on Arnessk. I
                    have more in the archives, if you
                    require.

      PILOT'S IMAGE IS REPLACE BY FOOTAGE FROM EPISODE 403 
      showing Arnessk as BARREN. Noranti narrates...                                    NORANTI
                      Undoubtedly, you recall--
                          (to Aeryn, off she goes)
                    Except you, because you weren't there. 
                    That was right after Crichton
                    realized he loved you more than 
                    anything, but you were as frizbot as a 
                    scalded kika cat and ran when he--

      CRICHTON WHISTLES to get her attention. Points to the 
      monitor.

                                    NORANTI
                    Hm... Arnessk...
                            (refocuses)
                      Remembering now, the ancient Eidelons 
                    were not long dead as everyone 
                    assumed, just suspended in time for 
                      twelve-thousand cycles. And when we 
                    reversed the device holding them 
                    there, back they came into existence!

      ON THE SCREEN - THE GREAT TEMPLE SHIMMERS INTO VIEW.

        Simultaneously, the HOODED PRIESTS ALSO REAPPEAR.

                                  AERYN
                    Sounds exciting.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I went swimming with the Creature from
                    the Black Lagoon.

                                    NORANTI
                    Quite heroic, he was.
                            (leans in, angry)
                    But that's not the point, is
                    it?!

      Crichton and Aeryn react like chastened schoolkids.

                                    NORANTI
                    There can be no doubt that
                    these Eidelons we see today are the 
                    direct descendants of--

      She indicates the screen, where we REVEAL THE HOODED       PRIESTS HAVE FACIAL MARKINGS IDENTICAL TO PIKAL AND THE 
      OTHERS!

                                    NORANTI
                    The ancient, peacemaking Eidelons of
                    Arnessk!

      Aeryn and Crichton exchange looks.

                                    NORANTI
                    Do I have to explain it all? These
                    legendary ombudsmen created peace as
                      effortlessly as Rygel does gas.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm sure that's their slogan.

                                    NORANTI
                    Nimbots! Our host Eidelons are 
                    clueless zwiks when it comes to 
                      peacemaking. However, why could
                    not their ancestors teach them?

      All of a sudden, Crichton and Aeryn's look takes on a whole 
      different understanding...

      EXT. EIDELON STREET - DAY

      Crichton and Aeryn stroll past vendors. Workshopping it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    It's not our fight.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We have no obligation to take sides.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    On the other hand, the ancient 
                    Eidelons know how to create peaceful 
                    gas.                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    And even if the MTV Generation here 
                    stays clueless, the Arnesskan 
                      graybeards could save a lot of lives.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    And until there's peace, everyone's 
                    gonna chase me, cause they think I can 
                    create some winner-take-all weapon.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    So helping others make peace, helps 
                    me, and you.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I like this new, compliant Aeryn. How
                    long does it last?

                                  AERYN
                    Until we're married.
                            (off his look)
                    We have to leave here anyway. Even if 
                    we search for a place to sit out the 
                    war, it requires little effort to take 
                    a few of these Eidelons to Arnessk. 
                    Then, it's their problem.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Agreed ...
                          (an evil smile)
                    And you know what the best reason of 
                    all is? It'll piss the hell outta 
                    Scorpius.      INT. SLEEP CHAMBER - EIDELON CITY - DAY

      Rygel sleeps fitfully. Chiana, bored, picks at the food.

      Chiana looks up as the door opens and Scorpius enters. 
      Chiana grabs a candle stick/bottle - whatever is close at 
      hand - to use as a weapon and positions herself 
        protectively in front of Rygel.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Crichton and the others are 
                      sequestered with the Eidelons.

                                  CHIANA
                            (shrugs)
                    It's so secret even I wasn't invited.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    What are they discussing?

                                  CHIANA
                    Don't ask me. I'm here with you.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Is D'Argo still the captain of your 
                    ship?

                                  CHIANA
                    Much as we have one.

      During the last few lines, Chiana has been moving forward 
      and Scorpius has been backing out of the room. Chiana slams 
      the door, locking Scorpius out. She leans against it, 
      shaken.

      INT. PILOT'S DEN - MOYA

      D'Argo and Muoma, followed by Caa'ta and Pikal, cross the

      walkway to Pilot.

                                  MUOMA
                    The most exciting aspect, of course, 
                    is the possibility of learning how to 
                    influence peace in others.

                                  D'ARGO
                    A noble aspiration, High Priestess.                                  MUOMA
                    We have discussed it among ourselves, 
                    and would be appreciative if you could 
                      - transport Caa'ta and Pikal to 
                    Arnessk as an introductory delegation.

                                  D'ARGO
                    We have room for many more.

                                  PIKAL
                            (annoyed with Caa'ta)
                    As I have repeatedly said.

                                  CAA'TA
                            (abrupt)
                    Centuries of hiding in fear do not 
                    melt away suddenly, Pikal.
                          (to D'Argo)
                    Many remain skeptical of your motives 
                    and abilities.

                                  D'ARGO
                    And that's just on our side.
                            (Caa'ta doesn't smile)
                    Joke.

      It's an awkward moment with a humourless soldier, so D'Argo 
      turns back to Muoma.

                                  D'ARGO
                    These two, then?

                                  MUOMA
                            (nods, then addresses Pilot)
                    I know something of Leviathans and 
                    their symbiotic Pilots. Peaceful to a 
                    fault, if I recall.

                                  PILOT
                    To Moya or myself, violence is less 
                    than an option.

                                  MUOMA
                    Neither is duplicity?
                            (off Pilot's agreement)
                    Then I ask a simple query. 
                                  (MORE)                                  MUOMA (CONT'D)
                    These beings that you ferry; do you 
                    trust them?

                                  PILOT
                            (honest beat)
                    Within normal circumstances; 
                      implicitly.

                                  MUOMA
                    Then I entrust Pikal and Caa'ta to 
                    your care, and pray you a safe 
                    journey.

      ANGLE - DOORWAY OF HEALING FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

      Noranti, Grunchlk and the Diagnosan are in conference with 
      Aeryn. The Diagnosan rummages in his shopworn medical bag, 
      pulls out A CLEAR-SIDED DEVICE. A few mismatched tubes hang 
      from it. Hands it to Noranti.

                                  DIAGNOSAN
                          (IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE)
                    This will do the trick. It's called a 
                    "Tissue Transferal Conductor."

      Noranti nods, understanding perfectly.

                                  GRUNCHLK

                    hasn't got all the pieces for it.
                            (before Aeryn can protest)
                    You'll probably find everything else 
                    you need up on your ship. Doc'11 give 
                    you detailed instructions.

                                  AERYN
                      Unacceptable. You're coming with us.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Sorry, but Doc and I aren't going
                    anywhere near Peacekeeper territory. 
                    We got some past issues with them...                                    NORANTI
                    Aeryn -- this is a relatively simple
                      procedure.

                                  AERYN
                    My baby is in a Hynerian. It's nowhere
                    near simple.

                                    NORANTI
                      Nevertheless, a vipp, a vopp, a slip, 
                    a slop, the child is yours.

      Aeryn stares daggers. CRICHTON APPROACHES.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What's up?

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Baby talk.

      They observe the DIAGNOSAN SPEAKING RAPID-FIRE IN HIS OWN 
      LANGUAGE pointing something out to Noranti, who nods, 
      understanding.

                                    NORANTI
                    Simple, indeed. So elegantly designed,
                    anyone can do it.
                            (hands the DEVICE to 
                            Crichton,
                            starts to leave)
                    Good luck.

                                  AERYN
                    What?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Whoa!

      Crichton grabs the exiting Noranti by the collar and yanks 
      her back.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Where you going?

                                    NORANTI
                    Not with you.

      Crichton looks to Aeryn. She hasn't a clue.                                  AERYN
                    Why not?

                                    NORANTI
                    These Eidelons have just absorbed a
                      thunderbolt revelation. I know more
                    about their ancient culture than them.
                    They can benefit from my instruction
                    until you return.

      With a "That's final" smile, she EXITS.

      Crichton looks at Aeryn.

                                  AERYN
                          (to the Diagnosan)
                    Can I do it myself?

      The Diagnosan shakes his head emphatically.

      Aeryn looks back at Crichton.

      The Diagnosan is tilting back for another long drink of 
      raslak. Aeryn grabs the booze while Crichton thrusts the 
      Tissue Transferal Conductor back into the displeased 
      Diagnosan's hands.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Start over.

      And as the Diagnosan and Grunchlk settle in for another 
      round of Baby Transfer 101...

      EXT. MOYA - IN ORBIT AROUND QUJAGAN - ESTAB. - CG

      ... with the PK Command Carrier in similar orbit in b. g. 
      Our TRANSPORT POD enters frame, heading toward Moya.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Almost home, Pilot. Please trace a
                    course back to the planet Arnessk. 

      INT. PASSAGEWAY - MOYA

      An agitated Crichton moves up the corridor beside D'Argo, 
      followed at a distance by Scorpius and Sikozu. Crichton 
      glances over his shoulder and tries to slow down. D'Argo 
      keeps him moving.                                  CRICHTON
                    I don't like it.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Blame me.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I do blame you. I don't like it.

                                  D'ARGO
                    You're a little too preoccupied to 
                    make a rational decision.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Scuse me? You trust him?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Of course not. But we are flying 
                    through Peacekeeper controlled space 
                    in a time of war, and he is a Command 
                    Carrier Officer.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Among other things... D'Argo -- I have 
                    a baby aboard.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I'll keep him away. But he does know
                    current passcodes; names to evoke...

                                  CRICHTON
                    I know a few names to evoke right now,
                    myself.

      Crichton spins the other way, eluding D'Argo. Crichton 
      fronts up to Scorpius, in no mood for sass back.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (ice)
                    Me. Aeryn. Rygel. Off limits.

      Tense beat. Finally, Scorpius nods. Crichton jerks his 
      head, indicating a side corridor.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You'll find your old cell like you 
                    left it. Even the roaches haven't had 
                    the nerve to return.      Scorpius and Sikozu EXIT down the corridor.

      INT. THE COMMAND/PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT.

      Crichton and D'Argo enter--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Pilot?

                                  PILOT
                    Commander -- we've received a message
                    that appears to have been hailing for
                    some time.

                                  D'ARGO
                    First ... Arnessk?

                                  PILOT
                    I have enough of a fix that we can 
                    begin our journey. I'll refine the 
                    exact location from Moya's data banks 
                    as we grow closer.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Excellent, Pilot. Proceed.

                                  PILOT
                    The message?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Who what where when why how?

                                  PILOT
                      Apparently, the Royal Palace of 
                    Hyneria. Coming from someone named 
                    Bishan.

      Crichton and D'Argo exchange looks. CRICHTON mouths 
      theword: BISHAN?

                                  PILOT
                    Shipwide announcement for our new
                    guests... prepare for StarBurst, 
                    people.

      EXT. MOYA - STARBURST (STOCK)

      Moya banks away as the familiar blue glow engulfs her and       --

      FLASH, she is gone into StarBurst.

      INT. RYGEL'S QUARTERS - MOYA

      Aeryn is helping the uncomfortable and agitated Rygel into 
      his ROBE as he sits on his bed. His belly is now 
        unmistakenly swollen, stretching the buttons of his 
      LONGJOHNS.

                                  AERYN
                    Bishan? Isn't that the one who stole
                    your throne?

                                  RYGEL
                    My cousin. And after all these cycles, 
                    he finally needs me.

                                  AERYN
                    How do you know?

                                  RYGEL
                    Why else would he call now?
                            (composes himself)
                    How do I look?

      Aeryn can only offer a weak smile. Taking it as an 
      encouraging sign, Rygel undergoes an amazing 
        transformation, becoming the Dominar he always was. He nods 
      imperiously toward her and--

                                  AERYN
                    Ready, Pilot.

      THE HOLOGRAM PROJECTOR FLICKERS TO LIFE WITH BISHAN'S 
      IMAGE... an overfed Hynerian in royal dress.

                                  BISHAN
                    Cousin Rygel?

      Emotions rush through Rygel. Primary among them: hatred. 
      Bishan nods in a formal greeting.

                                  BISHAN
                    Greetings and salutations.
                            (Rygel doesn't respond)
                                  (MORE)                                  BISHAN (CONT'D)
                    You have every right to be... 
                      Perturbed, cousin.

                                  RYGEL
                      Perturbed? You had me seized from my
                    imperial chambers in the middle of the
                    night. By morning, I was on a 
                      Peacekeeper prison barge, and you were
                    upon my throne.

      In the b. g. around Bishan, there are URGENT VOICES. Bishan 
      speaks to others O.S.--

                                  BISHAN
                      I understand! We will deal with it! I 
                    am seeking a solution even now!

                                  RYGEL
                    What is happening there, Bishan?

                                  BISHAN
                    It is this damned war. The Scarrans 
                    have already taken our outer 
                      territories. Millions are dead.

      Rygel is breathing hard, equally incensed and horrified.

                                  AERYN
                    Do not let yourself get agitated, 
                    Rygel.

                                  RYGEL
                    Not agitated?!

                                  BISHAN
                    My subjects... our subjects... are in 
                      a panic... there is chaos throughout 
                    the kingdom...
                            (beat)
                    You are a direct descendant of the 
                    royal lineage. If our people will 
                    unite under anyone, it will be under 
                    you.
                            (beat)
                    Cousin Rygel... You are welcome to 
                    return to Hyneria. You must return.      As this sinks in on Rygel -- the Hologram fades.

                                  RYGEL
                            (starts to get up)
                    If Bishan thinks I will return to a
                    shared throne, he is beyond deluded!

      Aeryn forces him back into bed with a military order.

                                  RYGEL
                    Some mother you're going to make...

      Aeryn looks at him. That packed a greater emotional wallop 
      than Rygel ever intended...

      INT. CENTRE CHAMBER - MOYA - CONTINUOUS

      Chiana sits at the table, eating. Pikal sits quietly 
      meditating, facing the windows.

      STARK ENTERS -- and upon seeing Pikal, instantly falls to 
      his knees, slaps his face to the deck.

                                  STARK
                    Blessed Eidelon, may I enter and--

                                  CHIANA
                    Enough.

      She kicks him repeatedly in the ribs.

                                  STARK
                    Oww! Oww!

                                  CHIANA
                    What is it exactly they can do that 
                    has you so fozbot?

                                  STARK
                    Are you serious? The Eidelons are 
                      remarkable mediators -- legendary for 
                    bringing the most intolerant enemies 
                    to common ground.

                                  CHIANA
                    Scarrans aren't going to be reasoned
                    with.                                  PIKAL
                    But they will... if...

                                  CHIANA
                    If what?

      At a loss not only for words, but a way to even explain the 
      concept, PIKAL OPENS HIS FACE.

      Chiana recoils with an "Ugh." Stark is fascinated. PIKAL 
      CLOSES HIS FACE  

                                  CHIANA
                          (to Stark; unsure)
                    Was he propositioning me?

                                  STARK
                    No. That's a very special gland.

                                  CHIANA
                    Small. In a weird place.

                                  STARK
                    It's like an antenna to feelings, an
                    inner eye. Am I right, Pikal?

                                  PIKAL
                    Yes. And -- our history leads us to
                    believe -- substantially more.

                                  CHIANA
                            (wary)
                    It gets bigger?

                                  PIKAL
                            (missing her fear)
                    Not that we know. However, it 
                    vibrates.

                    pray they will somehow show us the way

      Rygel sleeps fitfully. Aeryn at his side; Crichton beside 
      her.

      Crichton studies Aeryn's expression. He rests his hand on 
      her stomach... then his other hand on Rygel's swollen 
      belly. Play the moment, then ---

                                  CRICHTON
                    We still need to get married.

      Aeryn gives him a look. Now??

      Another male hand rests atop another swollen belly. REVEAL 
      Grayza in Maryk's impressive bed, Maryk beside her. 
      Multiple Comms panel LIGHTS BLINK near them.

                            (wistful)
                    She has a good, strong kick.

                    There is nothing to be done at the

                                  MARYK
                    We are outnumbered; outgunned; and our 
                    populace has grown adverse to 
                    hardship. Peacekeeper military alone 
                    will never be able to stand up to the 
                    Scarrans' relentless tactics.

                    the point, what are you not saying?

                    We have now lost every single battle
                    engaged since the start of the war. I
                    seek your opinion... on a truce.

                                  GRAYZA
                    Scarrans accept no truce. Only
                      surrender.

                                  MARYK
                      A surrender, then.

                                  GRAYZA
                    When all is lost. Only.

                    As much as I detest him, being half
                    Scarran, Scorpius was the one 
                    commander capable of matching their 
                      ruthlessness...      And as he EXITS, PUSH CLOSE on Grayza's troubled reaction

                                  AHKNA
                    He seeks the means to end this 
                    conflict.

                    Bishan.

      But Bishan says nothing. The communication is badly 
      distorted, the SOUND garbled.                                  RYGEL
                    What now? Calling to rescind your
                      invitation?

      Rygel stops as Bishan's head begins to move -- but in a 
      very unnatural way.

      Rygel leans closer. Bishan's head rises -- and we SEE: 
      Bishan's head has been severed and is now held on the end 
      of a stick.

      Rygel GASPS; Stark SCREAMS.

      Bishan's head is moved out of frame -- and a wedge of the 
      Hynerian palace is revealed behind him. It is in chaos -- 
      overrun with SUBJECTS in panic. A HYNERIAN SENATOR  
      struggles against ripping hands to bring his face into

                    return. Your people need you!

      And he is torn from view. The distortion worsens, 
        obliterating the image. Rygel just stares.      INT. COMMAND - MOYA

      Crichton waits, the anxious groom. D'Argo is beside him. 
      Sikozu arranges a few pans of goodies and multiple candles.

      Nice, but much simpler than the first wedding. Sikozu 
      'charges' up her hand, it GLOWS, and with a wave of her

                                  CRICHTON
                    Tough concept for 'em.

                    Who knows? If they can't, I say we 
                    find another galaxy to live in.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Maybe your children's children's 
                    children will be alive at the end of 
                    that journey.

                    Of course, you could always--

                    No. I can't... Really, I can't.

                    nothing you can do about that now. 
                    Maybe performing the wedding will take 
                    your mind off of it.

                                  RYGEL
                    For hezmana's sake -- why me?

                                  STARK
                    You're a Dominar. Has to count for
                      something.

                                  RYGEL
                    Carry their baby; marry them off; 
                    what's left-- let them move in?

      Crichton and Aeryn take up position. D'Argo in best man 
      position; Chiana the maid-of-honor.

      Rygel's ThroneSled starts to sink downward. D'Argo and 
      Chiana leap forward on either side and heft it up to the 
      right level. Their hands touch -- they exchange a look.

                                  RYGEL
                            (begrudgingly)
                    So you two really want to do this?

      Aeryn still isn't fully vested in this undertaking. But the 
      sparkle in Crichton's eye certainly speaks to her.

                                  AERYN
                    You honestly want to be saddled with 
                    me for the rest of your life? Willing 
                    to swear an oath on it?                                  CRICHTON
                    If you'll have me.

      Aeryn smiles.

                                  RYGEL
                    Fine. Wonderful. . I'd say that about
                    covers it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Rygel...

                                  RYGEL
                    You really want me to drag this out?

      Crichton takes Aeryn's hand. Rygel1 s attitude softens.

                    quite a while now. Known you since you 
                    first met. Over the cycles, there were 
                    times you looked like you were going 
                    to kill each other. Other times we 
                    couldn't have gotten you off each 
                    other with a Chelsik fire hose. Sounds 
                    like a marriage to me. So...
                            (beat, more officiously)
                    Upon my pronouncement, may these two 
                    be joined as one, and evermore let 
                    nothing come between--

      Suddenly -- AN ENORMOUS HARPOON COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE 
      BULKHEAD. Crichton shoves Aeryn away from himself just in 
      time, as the harpoon flies between them, angling powerfully 
      into Moya's deck!

      Several harpoons, each trailing a hauling line, already 
      piercing Moya's hull.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY/PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT

      The herd moves purposefully -- Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo, 
      Chiana, Sikozu and Stark. All except Stark are locking and 
      loading their weapons as they go.

                                  PILOT
                    DRDs are reporting multiple harpoon
                    strikes. Each with a hauling line
                    attached.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Can Moya free herself?

                                  PILOT
                    There are too many! The Tragin ship is
                    already pulling us in.

                                  CRICHTON
                      "Tragins?" They like the Charleston
                    Tragins? Old money, department stores,
                    foxy daughter won't come across?

                                  AERYN
                    We're still in Peacekeeper territory.
                    More than likely, they're conscripts 
                    for the war.

                                  CHIANA
                    What does that mean?

                                  D'ARGO
                    They'll be much less inclined to take
                      prisoners.

      Scorpius arrives.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    I counted at least seven two-man craft 
                    heading toward us.                                  SIKOZU
                    One way or the other, this will all be
                    over in half an arn.

                                  AERYN
                    She's right. They'll attempt to
                      incapacitate Pilot and simultaneously
                    cripple Moya's vital systems.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hey, Scorp? If they work for the
                      Peacekeepers, ain't that a bell in 
                    your firehouse? Passcodes, names to 
                    evoke, shared atrocities to 
                      reminisce...
                          (to the others)
                    If Fire Chief Bob here can't convince 
                    them we're a Peacekeeper ship, you 
                    better come up with a good Plan B.

      Crichton leads Scorpius away.

                                  AERYN
                            (indicating D'Argo)
                    We're Neural Cluster.
                            (Chiana and Sikozu)
                    Find Pikal and Caa'ta -- keep them 
                    safe.

      As Chiana and Sikozu EXIT--

                                  STARK
                    What about me?

                                  AERYN
                    How best can you help?

                                  STARK
                            (beat)
                    I can stay out of your way.

      Aeryn nods. Stark nods. He melts into the darkness as Aeryn 
      and D'Argo head out...

      INT. MAINTENANCE BAY - MOYA

      AN ALIEN BLOW TORCH completes its job and the Transport Bay       doors open to a rush of steam and the armed TRAGIN BOARDING 
      PARTY emerges. They're huge, brutish creatures with extra 
      large teeth, mouths and vocal boxes.

      They're led by a PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN in full uniform.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY #2 - MOYA

      Crichton and Scorpius on the move.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What's the play, Beelzebub? Are we a 
                    spy ship? Rum runners? What?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    This may not go as smoothly as you 
                    hope, Crichton.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why? Stage fright? Can't do improv?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    When I received the signal you were 
                    still alive, my departure from 
                      Peacekeeper service was... less than 
                      sanctioned.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Meaning ... ?

                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                    You there! Hold position!

      Crichton and Scorpius pull up short to see the PEACEKEEPER 
      Captain and FOUR TRAGINS ahead, weapons leveled.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Do you know who I am?

                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                    Should I?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Scorpius. Peacekeeper Command Code 
                    seven six seven dekka heelon.                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                            (suddenly nervous)
                    Scorpius ... ?

      Though the Peacekeeper Captain is unsure what to do, the 
      Tragins couldn't care less, and don't lower their weapons.

      Tragin #1 (wearing a TRANSMITTER AROUND HIS NECK) nods to 
      Tragin #2, who punches Scorpius' code into a WRIST DEVICE.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    I take it you're sentries for this
                    sector?

                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                    I wasn't informed you were out here, 
                    sir.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Nor do you know it now; lest it cost 
                    you your life. In special service to 
                    the Grand Chancellor, I order you to 
                    release and vacate this ship.

      The Peacekeeper Captain shuffles his feet, unsure.

                                  TRAGIN #1
                            (gruff, deep, brutish)
                    That won't happen.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    And you are ... ?

                                  TRAGIN #1
                    Crew Chief of my vessel. Young 
                      Academy-Bed Wetter here is a recent 
                    addition. Our orders are to commandeer 
                    any ship not broadcasting a 
                      Peacekeeper ident.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    My mission would be jeopardized should 
                      I advertise such a beacon.

                                  TRAGIN #1
                    Your mission is more than jeopardized.
                    It is over.                                  CRICHTON
                    Hate to butt in...
                          (to the Peacekeeper Captain)
                    Captain, if this Leviathan dies, 
                    you're a traffic cop at Screwed Street 
                    and Raw Sewage Lane.

      Scorpius steps forward; drills the captain with a look--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Who's in charge here? Who should I be
                      addressing? And who will take the 
                    blame?

                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                            (nervous beat, then--)
                    Crew Chief... release the harpoons. On 
                    my authority.

      Tragin #1 gives a foul look; he hates serving with this 
      pussy.

      As he shoulders his weapon to use the transmitter, the 
      other three Tragins lower their weapons and assume a less 
      aggressive attitude.

                                    PEACEKEEPER CAPTAIN
                    Scorpius. It is an honour to meet you
                    face to fa--

      BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP -- A WARNING SIGNAL comes from Tragin 
      #2's WRIST COMMS. The tableau freezes.

      Crichton and Scorpius trade a look.

      Peacekeeper Captain and Tragin #1 both look down at Tragin 
      #2's offered wrist. Then they, too, trade looks. Beat. 
      Then--

      EVERYBODY'S FIRING AT EACH OTHER SIMULTANEOUSLY.

      Crichton and Scorpius dive for cover down a side corridor.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY #3 - CONTINUOUS

      Crichton backs up down the corridor, firing as he goes.

      Scorpius strides protectively between Crichton and the       Tragins, using his body armour as cover.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What did you do when you left the
                      Fatherland, steal the sterling?!

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Deserted my posting.

                                  CRICHTON
                    To find me?! I'm flattered.

      LASER BLASTS HIT THE WALLS AROUND THEM. Crichton fires, 
      KILLING A TRAGIN as they dive through a doorway into--

      INT. PILOT'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

      As Crichton and Scorpius scramble across the ramp--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hey, Pilot -- anything you can do?

                                  PILOT
                    Not without killing you, also.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hold onto that one.
                            (beat)
                    Can you duck?

      BLAM BLAM BLAM. The Peacekeeper Captain, Tragin #1, and one 
      other Tragin are in the doorway FIRING AT THEM. As Pilot 
      hunkers down, Crichton and Scorpius dive for cover...

      INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NEURAL CLUSTER - MOYA

      Aeryn and D'Argo are positioning themselves to ambush 
      anyone who comes near. They hear DISTANT PULSE FIRE.

                                  AERYN
                            (taps Comms)
                    Who's taking fire?

      INT. PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT

      The firefight rages.                                  CRICHTON
                    Who's not?

      Crichton KILLS ANOTHER TRAGIN IN THE DOORWAY.

                                  AERYN
                    Are you alright?

                                  CRICHTON
                    As it goes.

                                  AERYN
                    We'll get to you when we can.

      TWO TRAGINS have rounded the corner coming toward Aeryn and 
      D'Argo's position. One... two... three... AERYN AND D'ARGO 
      FIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY, KILLING BOTH TRAGINS.

                                  D'ARGO
                    This is not as difficult as everyone 
                    else makes it.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY #4

      Chiana and Sikozu on the move; hear DISTANT PULSE FIRE.

      Chiana focuses on a bulkhead and--

      CHIANA VISION -- REVEALING THREE "POWER SOURCES" moving 
      several passageways distant.

                                  CHIANA
                    Three of 'em heading parallel to us.

                                  SIKOZU
                    You can see that?

                                  CHIANA
                            (nodding)
                    The energy signature from their 
                    weapons.

      Sikozu's impressed. And they continue on, double time...

      INT. PILOT'S DEN

      FIREFIGHT IN PROGRESS. Crichton gives it everything.      Suddenly, PULSE FIRE is directed at them FROM ABOVE!

                                  CRICHTON
                    You've got to be kidding me.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    They've taken position above us.

      Crichton just rolls his eyes with disbelief. Now they've 
      got a two front battle... Finally, Crichton throws Scorpius 
      his second PULSE PISTOL. Scorpius immediately starts 
      returning fire at the Tragins.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NEURAL CLUSTER

      Aeryn and D'Argo in waiting. TALK QUIETLY  

                                  D'ARGO
                    Never saw you as the kind to have a 
                    child.

      Aeryn gives him a look.

                                  D'ARGO
                    You, either, huh?

                                  AERYN
                    He wants it so bad. So do I, I guess.

      TWO MORE TRAGINS round the corner. ZING, ZING. D'ARGO TAKES 
      A HIT IN THE LEFT SHOULDER before D'Argo and Aeryn each 
      fire once in return, killing them.

                                  D'ARGO
                    You'll come round when you see the 
                    little guy in person.

                                  AERYN
                    I hope so.

      INT. GUEST QUARTERS - MOYA

      Hearing DISTANT PULSE FIRE,Caa'ta is attempting to shove 
      Pikal between two of MOYA'S RIBS.

                                  CAA'TA
                    You must stay hidden.                                  PIKAL
                    And you.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Your sensitivity makes you much more
                    valuable when meeting our ancestors. 
                    My function is to ensure your safe 
                    arrival.

                                  PIKAL
                    But  

                                    CAA'TA.
                    There is no time to argue.

      Caa'Ta can now hear TRAGIN VOICES APPROACHING. Readying his 
      weapon, he takes a breath and spins into --

      INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

      Caa'ta finds himself less than four meters from THREE 
      TRAGINS, however, he has the element of surprise. Caa'ta 
      FIRES, KILLING ONE TRAGIN instantly. But the other two 
      react much quicker than he expected. THEY CHARGE before 
      Caa'ta can fire again. It's now hand-to-hand combat.

      But Caa'ta is strong. He rifle butts one of the Tragins, 
      staggering him back out of the fight.

      As the last Tragin and Caa'ta grapple, it becomes clear 
      Caa'ta is going to win. And then-- BOOM. A PULSE BLAST 
      KILLS CAA'TA.

      The second Tragin has recovered enough to save his friend.

      They position themselves in the doorway to the Quarters -- 
      They exchange knowing looks before Tragin #3 opens his 
      mouth EXTRA WIDE and emits AN INCREDIBLE LOW-VIBRATION 
      RUMBLE OF A PIERCING SCREAM. Ear shattering.

      With a CRY OF PAIN, Pikal topples from his hiding place out 
      onto the deck.

      The Tragins grab and drag him into the Passageway. Pikal is 
      on his knees, scared.

                                  TRAGIN #3
                    You know this species?      Tragin #4 shakes his head.

                                  TRAGIN #3
                    Then dead is okay.

      Tragin #3 places his weapon against Pikal 's head, when--
      SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, Chiana and Sikozu descend upon 
        thesurprised Tragins like rabid pumas.

      Chiana's an acrobat, leaping to kick one Tragin in the 
      throat before he can HOWL/SCREAM again.

      The other Tragin is quick. He spins toward Sikozu and 
      FIRES.

      She surprises him no end by RUNNING UP A WALL! As the 
      stunned Tragin adjusts to aim upwards, Sikozu LEAPS OFF THE 
      WALL, landing PIGGYBACK ON HIM. He thrashes, but she 
      quickly BREAKS HIS NECK and he sinks to the deck.

      Meanwhile, Chiana is fast as lightning, avoiding being 
      struck by her Tragin while delivering HIT AFTER RAPID HIT, 
      eventually felling him. When he attempts to shoot her, 
      Chiana gives A LITTLE YELP and FIRES, KILLING HIM.

      Both Tragins lie lifeless on either side of the shaking, 
      still-kneeling Pikal.

                                  CHIANA
                    Hi.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Sorry we're late.

      INT. PILOT'S DEN

      HELLACIOUS FIREFIGHT. They've still got Crichton and 
      Scorpius pinned from the doorway and above.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Cover me.

      Scorpius FIRES like crazy toward the door as, KILLING ONE 
      MORE TRAGIN as--

      Crichton rolls out onto the walkway, landing on his back, 
      FIRING UPWARDS. We hear A TRAGIN DEATH SCREAM and a moment 
      later, the brute's BODY FALLS PAST to an ugly death below.      A BLAST HITS NEXT TO SCORPIUS, KNOCKING HIM DOWN.

      Crichton is still on his back.

      The Peacekeeper Captain and Tragin #1 use the moment to 
      CHARGE. As they run across the walkway toward Crichton, 
      SCREAMING AND FIRING--

      Crichton is dead meat. Nowhere to hide, no time to aim.

      BUT SCORPIUS CHARGES OUT FROM COVER, COLDLY FIRING.

      The Peacekeeper Captain is HIT IN THE CHEST AND THROWN 
      BACKWARDS, dead. Tragin #1 is hit and  

      FALLS OVER THE EDGE IN SLOW MOTION, still wearing the 
        TRANSMITTER.

      On Crichton as he watches their only hope disappear into 
      the depths of Moya. Scorpius joins him, and they trade 
      rueful looks.

                                  PILOT
                            (seeing their reactions)
                    Is something wrong?

      And off Crichton and Scorpius' reaction...

      INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NEURAL CLUSTER

      Aeryn and D'Argo rise from their positions as--

                                  AERYN
                    That's good news, Pilot.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Then the ship is clear?

      INT. PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT AS NEEDED

                                  PILOT
                    No more Tragins aboard, however...

                                  SCORPIUS
                    They're still reeling us in, and we 
                    can't release the harpoons.      INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE QUARTERS - INTERCUT AS NEEDED

      Chiana and Sikozu are assisting the shaking Pikal up.

                                  CHIANA
                    Why not?

                                  CRICHTON'
                    Because the gargoyle with the 
                      transmitter fell over the edge.

                                  SIKOZU
                    What's it look like? The Transmitter?

                                  CRICHTON
                            (REVISE TO FIT)
                      Triangular, gold, thin...

      As Chiana looks on, puzzled, Sikozu rolls her Tragin over 
      to reveal HE TOO IS WEARING A TRANSMITTER. And as Sikozu 
      snaps the chain freeing it from his neck--

                                  CHIANA
                            (grinning)
                    Love your work.

      EXT. MOYA - SPACE - CG

      As the hauling lines begin snapping free of the harpoons.

      INT. COMMAND - MOYA.

      Crichton, Aeryn and D'Argo come running up to the doorway--

      And she continues on, DISAPPEARING, as Crichton and D'Argo 
      enter. The harpoon still pierces down from ceiling to 
      floor.

      Through the Forward Portal, they see the TRAGIN SHIP FIRING 
      ON THEM as Moya turns away from her.

                                  PILOT
                    All lines disengaged. We're free!

                                  CRICHTON
                    They must know their Captain's dead.                                  D'ARGO
                    Pilot -- can Moya StarBurst?

                                  PILOT
                          (ON CLAMSHELL)
                    The harpoons extending from her hull
                    alter our slipstream profile, making
                    Starburst problematic... but she will
                    try.

      The room is jolted by a tragin hit.

                                  CRICHTON
                    That's our girl.

      As the WHINE OF STARBURST BEGINS TO BUILD.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hey...
                            (off D'Argo's look)
                    You were right about bringing 
                    Scorpius.

      D'Argo nods, and--

      EXT. MOYA - SPACE - CG

      Harpoons angling from her sides, Moya begins to glow blue.

      The glow is irregular, and Moya shudders throughout -- but 
      she manages to complete the procedure, and she StarBursts.

      Leaving the Tragin ship alone in open space...

      EXT. SPACE - MOYA - EXITING STARBURST

      Elsewhere, later.

                                  PILOT (O.S.)
                    I'm terribly upset I failed to detect 
                    the Tragins.

      INT. COMMAND/PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT

                                  PILOT
                    But I was so preoccupied with other
                    duties, they snuck up on us.                                  D'ARGO
                    That's alright, Pilot. You're several
                    thousand mistakes-made behind the rest 
                    of us.

      D'Argo and Crichton are forced to step out of the way as 
      DRDs maneuver while TORCHING THE HARPOON to cut it apart.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How much longer will this delay our
                    getting to Arnessk?

                                  PILOT
                    The answer, Commander, is not at all.

      Sensing the tone, Crichton and D'Argo look out the Forward 
      Portal to see Arnessk in the distance.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Outstanding.

                                  PILOT
                    Thank you. However, we will need to
                    remove these harpoons before Moya can
                    atrempt further travel.

                                  D'ARGO
                    How much time does that require?

                                  PILOT
                    Quite a number of solar days, unless 
                    we electro-charge the hull to 
                      accelerate her healing process.

      Crichton gives D'Argo a look re the "electro-charge" bit.

      D'Argo holds up a hand, staying the question.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Whatever you need, Pilot. And try to
                    contact someone on Arnessk -- see if 
                    Jool is still there, and let them know 
                    we're coming.

      EXT. ARNESSK - DAY

      As the Transport Pod lands.      EXT. ARNESSK - DAY

      Swirling mist. Eerie shadows. Wielding a torch, Crichton 
      forces his way through thorny, painful brush. SOMEONE IS 
      WATCHING; loads a NASTY DART into an ALIEN CROSSBOW. 
      Crichton stops, scans for a bearing. Swats an insect.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (softly, to himself)
                    Nothin' but rose bushes, pea soup and
                    malaria.

      THE CROSSBOW IS AIMED at Crichton. As he starts forward 
      again, A FINGER closes on the TRIGGER, and the DART FLIES!

      It whooshes past Crichton's neck by inches, hitting--

      It's intended target: A KNOT OF ALIEN HEMP wrapped taut 
      around a tree trunk. As the hemp snaps free--

      THE TRAP IS SPRUNG! Sticky alien vines whip around 
      Crichton's legs and torso like tentacles. He pulls at them, 
      but they adhere tightly.

        SPINE-TINGLING, ANIMAL CRY is suddenly moving toward 
      Crichton. He tries to pull Winona -- can't.

      He's ferociously tackled; rolling across the ground with a 
      banshee. AN ALIEN KNIFE FLASHES. His attacker is nimble, 
      and determined. Quickly, Crichton is face down, hair pulled 
      up, knife under his throat.

                                  JOOL
                            (savage hiss)
                    Your business?

      Choking, Crichton has an upside down view of her.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hi, Jool.

      JOOL'S gone native. Hair a sexy rat's nest. Clothes of 
      local cloth and animal hides. Skin darkened. Eyes alive and 
      wild.

      She blinks a beat, then jams the knife into the dirt, and 
      rolls Crichton over, still straddling him.                                  JOOL
                    You--?!

                                  CRICHTON
                    Me, Crichton. You, apparently crazy.

                                  JOOL
                    Crichton!
                              (frantically kissing him)
                    I knew you wouldn't forget me! The 
                    more we were apart, the more I knew 
                    you'd realize you were meant to be 
                    with--

      Boots emerge from the shadows. She looks up to see--

                                  JOOL
                    Aeryn.

                                  AERYN
                    Jool.

      A WHIRRING NOISE as Rygel floats up beside Aeryn.

                                  RYGEL
                    Get another fantasy, driblox -- 
                    they're having my baby.

      Jool looks back down at Crichton, who smiles.

      EXT. TEMPLE HILL - ARNESSK - DAY

      In a valley below, the Great Eidelon Temple rises from the 
      mist. A DISTANT HARMONIC GONG CHIMES. We hear RHYTHMIC 
      CHANTING, a SOFT PURPLE GLOW EMANATING FROM THE TEMPLE IN 
      SYNCH WITH THE PRAYERS. As they crest the ridge, Jool is 
      explaining to Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel--

                                  JOOL
                    Once they go over the shock of being
                    suspended for twelve-thousand cycles, 
                    there was a rededication to calming 
                    those in conflict.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Are they gonna be happy with our 
                    special offer.                                  AERYN
                    Do the Eidelons know there's a war?

                                  JOOL
                    We only just found out. I finally 
                    repaired their primitive 
                      communications equipment.
                            (off Aeryn's look)
                    Yeah, how about that? I've had to 
                    become pretty resourceful.

                                  CRICHTON
                    So it's a no-brainer they'll help?

                                  JOOL
                    Maybe not. Based on everything they've
                    learned from listening to Comms 
                    traffic, they're convinced none of 
                    their progeny survived. Sorry, I told 
                    them as much.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Pikal should set that right.

                                  JOOL
                    I hope. They're peculiar; regimented. 
                    I can never guess what they'll do.

                                  RYGEL
                    So explain it. You must have some 
                    pull. You hunt for them, cook, 
                      repair--(eyes the brevity of the 
                    costume) -- and who knows what else.

                                  JOOL
                    Can I hit him?

                                  CRICHTON & AERYN
                    No.

      Jool stops walking.

                                  JOOL
                    We need to wait here until morning
                      invocations are completed.

      But Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel keep going--                                  AERYN
                    We'll make suitable apologies.

                                  CRICHTON
                    People are dying. They'll be glad we
                      interrupted.

                                  JOOL
                    You don't understand--

      Two steps later, Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel are WRACKED WITH 
      PAIN, CRYING OUT. They've entered a "zone" marked by 
      FIBROUS (CG) ELECTRICAL WEBBING (think walking into a room 
      thick with spider webs). The farther they go, the MORE 
      FIBROUS ELECTRICAL WEBBING ENGULFS THEM. Only by staggering 
      back up the hill to where Jool is can they ultimately get 
      clear.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What the hell is that?!

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel?!

                                  RYGEL
                    I'm alright; baby's alright.

                                  JOOL
                    Baby?

                                  CRICHTON
                    What the hell is that, Jool?

                                  JOOL
                    Each dawn begins by accessing
                    feelings of pain, death and terror 
                    unleashed the previous day. It's like 
                    research for them.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Problem?

      Jool spins to see Scorpius emerging from the foliage. She 
      staggers back -- he's a ghost.

                                  JOOL
                      Scorpius?! You're dead! Your grave's
                    down there. I put a stone on it.                                  SCORPIUS
                    Thank you.

                                  JOOL
                    So you couldn't crawl out.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Next time, bigger stone.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Stark and Pikal are back in the woods.
                    Should I bring them?

      Crichton shoots a look at Aeryn, still displeased.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    They're safe. I have agreed to your 
                    plan, your timetable, your choices. I 
                    ask for nothing in return but to be 
                    close by when you fail.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Go get 'em.

      Scorpius nods and heads back the way he came. As he does, 
      the HARMONIC GONG CHIMES STOP, along with the CHANTING.

                                  JOOL
                    We can descend now. If you put your
                    weapons aside, keep him (Scorpius) 
                    quiet, and follow my lead, perhaps 
                    you'll get what you came for.

      And as Jool begins down the hillside toward the temple...

      INT. PASSAGEWAY - MOYA

      Sikozu futzing in a JUNCTION BOX as D'Argo approaches.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Tier Four's grounded.

      Zzzt zzzt. SPARKS FROM THE BOX; THE LIGHTS DIM.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Done here. We shouldn't even feel the
                      electro-charge.      The following as she finishes up and closes the bcx--

                                  D'ARGO
                    When the Tragins transmitted Scorpius'
                    Ident Code, they also transmitted our
                    location, am I correct?

      Sikozu nods.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Am I also correct to assume the 
                    Scarrans will have intercepted and 
                      deciphered that message?

      Sikozu nods, watching him carefully.

                                  D'ARGO
                    And why would Scorpius be way out here 
                    in the middle of nowhere?
                            (beat)
                    Crichton.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Very impressive reasoning.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (knows what she's thinking)
                    For a Luxan.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Yes. Which means you're
                    probably capable of the next 
                      thought...
                            (disdain for the situation)
                    We... are a motionless target.

      PUSH CLOSE ON D'Argo as she exits down the corridor.

      INT. GREAT TEMPLE - ARNESSK - DAY

      Alien, and yet, unmistakably a house of worship. Glittering 
      metals against alabaster marble. Stain-glass style light 
      everywhere; prisms gone wild. Breathtaking. In the 
      background, ROBED EIDELON PRIESTS confer quietly and pray 
      in small groups.

      Jool is mid-admonition to the tour group as they herd 
      inside.      Crichton, Aeryn, Stark, Scorpius, Rygel, AND NERVOUSLY AT 
      THE BACK OF THE GROUP, Pikal, react in their own ways to 
      the grandeur of the room.

                                  JOOL
                    I think it goes without saying you 
                    show deference and respect. The 
                      Conciliators rarely take audiences in
                    the Great Temple, but for this special
                      circumstance, they've agreed.
                            (beat)
                    Please... don't embarrass me.

                                  CRICHTON
                          (to Aeryn)
                    I'll bet the acoustics in here are La
                    Scala.
                            (softly calls out)
                    Hel-lo...
                    Hel-lo HEL-LO hel-lo HEL-LO

      His voice ECHOES BACK IN A VARIETY OF PITCHES AND VOLUMES 
      HEL-LO hel-lo hel-lo HEL-LO

      The Eidelon Priests all stop praying and look over with 
      annoyance at our group.

      Jool can't believe it; hangs her head. Crichton hangs his 
      head. Aeryn shakes her head. Rygel nods his head. What else 
      did any of them expect? It's Farscape.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Excellent acoustics, are they not?

      All eyes find HIERARCH YONDALAO peering down from a FREE- 
      FLOATING PULPIT. Wearing RICH, PRIESTLY ROBES, his wizened 
      face has the austerity of one who knows too much, has seen 
      too much. Like Pikal, Yondalao's features are defined by 
        segmentation lines. As the PULPIT DESCENDS 

                                  YONDALAO
                    Perhaps you care to lead us in prayer?

                                  RYGEL
                            (under his breath)
                    Just once... "Nice to meet you; how 
                    can I help?"                                  JOOL
                      Apologies, Hierarch Yondalao. I was
                      explaining to them--

      LANDING THE PULPIT, Yondalao waves her silent. As he de-

      pulpits, STARK BOWS AND KNEELS, excessively respectful.

                                  YONDALAO
                    So... you are the pilgrims who purport 
                    to be our heirs.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Not all of us. I'm just here for a
                    brain.
                          (re Scorpius)
                    Tin Man could use a heart.
                          (re Stark)
                    Lion...
                          (re Rygel)
                    Toto'd like an easy pregnancy.
                          (re Aeryn)
                    And Dorothy could use a new pair of
                    shoes.

      As Crichton's been talking, they all step aside to reveal 
      Pikal at the back of the group.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He's your heir.

                                  YONDALAO
                            (instantly intrigued)
                    We understood all of our descendants 
                    to be gone... Recommend yourself to 
                    me.

                                  PIKAL
                    Though we trace ourselves to your 
                    lineage, my people lack the knowledge 
                    --but not the desire -- to influence 
                    peace. We... I... was hoping...

                                  YONDALAO
                      Troubling... and exhilarating.                            (beat)
                    I shall confer with the other
                      Conciliators, and notify you when the
                    matter can be assessed.

      As Yondalao turns back toward the Pulpit--

                                  STARK
                    But venerable Hierarch, there's a 
                    great conflict pressing.

                                  RYGEL
                    Perhaps a healthy currency 
                      contribution from my kingdom...

      Yondalao's look puts Rygel in his place.

                                  SCORPIUS
                          (to Crichton)
                    I told you this was a waste of time.
                    Myths are rarely satisfying upon
                      examination.

                                  JOOL
                    Hierarch, please!

      Yondalao stops at the sound of Jool's voice. Our people 
      react with hope. Jool steps forward deferentially--

                                  JOOL
                    You know me. And I know these 
                      travelers. They are honorable. Why do 
                    you turn them away?

                                  YONDALAO
                    I do not -- I simply require time to
                    examine the issue...

      Head still way down, Stark approaches--

                                  STARK
                    With respects... what is there to
                    examine? Pikal is Eidelon, like you.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Through the ages, many have attempted 
                    to grasp our abilities for their own
                                  (MORE)                                  YONDALAO (CONT'D)
                    purposes. Some have even undergone
                    genetic modification in the vain 
                    attempt to master our skills.

      STARK GRABS YONDALAO'S ROBES, a bit too intense--

                                  STARK
                    But the war- -The deaths 

                                  YONDALAO
                              (commanding, to Aeryn)
                      Peacekeeper! Do your duty!

      Aeryn doesn't understand. On a hunch, she pulls Stark back 
      from Yondalao as the old man enters the Pulpit--

                                  AERYN
                    May I speak?

      Yondalao pauses. Crichton gives a "You go, girl" look.

                                  YONDALAO.
                    The Peacekeeper shall be heard.

                                  AERYN
                    We apologize for invading your 
                      sanctuary. And realize you have reason 
                    for caution. Our transgressions were 
                    the result of enthusiasm for the 
                      possibilities of peace.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Even if he's Eidelon, how can this one
                      supplicant help that cause?



                                  AERYN
                    Because of the atrocity committed here 
                    so long ago, there are but few of you 
                    left. Pikal's people are many, and may 
                    serve in your legion.

                                  YONDALAO
                          (to Pikal, softening)
                    Though the Peacekeeper provides sound
                                  (MORE)                                  YONDALAO (CONT'D)
                    council, I sustain reservations that 
                    must be prayed upon.
                          (to Aeryn, a gentler 
                            command)
                      Peacekeeper -- clear the temple.

      AS THE PULPIT BEGINS TO RISE, Crichton steps to Aeryn  

                                  CRICHTON
                    Baby, I'm proud'a the way you did 
                    that. I thought you sealed the deal.

                                  AERYN
                    Thank you.

      Crichton whips out Winona and FIRES. The bottom of the 
      Pulpit ERUPTS IN SPARKS. It tips and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR.

      Ail the Eidelons in the background react to this violence.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Damn. I always come off the least
                    civilized of the bunch.
                            (kneels next to Yondalao)
                      I normally don't use a firearm in 
                    church. Will you take confession?

                                  YONDALAO
                              (frightened)
                    Are you assassin?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Only in that "ass" appears twice in 
                    that word... Today, I'm Yenta, the 
                      Matchmaker. (NOT
                    Yentyl!)

      Crichton motions for Pikal to come close and kneel.

                                  CRICHTON
                    This here's your great, great, great,
                    great, grandkid. Say hello.

      Now only inches apart, Yondalao's expression changes. He 
      traces a shaky finger along the lines of Pikal's face. 
      Yondalao's voice quavers with disbelief--                                  YONDALAO
                    These are not genetic modifications...

                                  CRICHTON
                    The power of prayer. Hallelujah!

      And off the moment as everyone reacts...

      INT. PILOT'S DEN - MOYA

                                  CHIANA
                    Tier Nine's grounded. Will I be safe
                    with you?

                                  PILOT
                    Up here.

      Chiana hops up on the console where he indicates.

                                  CHIANA
                    You as sick of all this as I am, 
                    Pilot? Being chased? Getting shot at? 
                    Running scared?

                                  PILOT
                    I would venture, more so.

                                  CHIANA
                    Yeah. Maybe time to retire.

                                  PILOT
                    Retire? What would you do?

                                  CHIANA
                    Don't know... I don't do anything now.

      It's a genuine problem that's just surfaced in her mind.

                                  PILOT
                            (echoing through the ship)
                      Attention. Position yourself in 
                    grounded locations. Electro-char. ge 
                    in three...two... one...

      Pilot activates his console and ZZAAAAPPPPPPPPPP!A GIANT 
      ARCING, SPARKING BOLT OF ELECTRICITY APPEARS AROUND THEM!      EXT. MOYA - ORBITING ARNESSK (REUSE OF PREVIOUS SHOT)

      The hull dances with electricity.

      INT. GREAT TEMPLE - ARNESSK - DAY

      Aeryn sits at the back of the room, watching as--

      Yondalao stands inside A RING OF LIT CANDLES. With him are 
      a very nervous Pikal   now wearing ARNESSKAN ROBES -- and 
      Stark.

      Outside the circle are MANY ARNESSKAN PRIESTS. Stately, 
      reverent, religious...

                                  YONDALAO
                    For the first time in twelve-thousand
                    cycles, we welcome... Hora-da-lay.

      Yondalao raises his arms and simultaneously, the OVERHEAD 
      LIGHTS DIM, leaving us in CANDLELIGHT; and the assembled 
      Priests begin A SOFT, REPETITIOUS CHANT. It is simple and 
      primitive, yet soothing.

                                    PRIESTS
                      Hora-da-lay Ah-mo-daa-nay
                      No-ka-oh-tey...
                            (keep repeating)
                      Hora-da-lay Ah-mo-daa-
                    nay No-ka-oh-tey...

      Aeryn watches as Yondalao POSITIONS STARK BEHIND PIKAL.

                                  YONDALAO
                    As youths, we open our faces to the
                    universe, absorbing the joy and 
                    anguish all creatures feel.
                    Then, upon maturation, we step to the
                    altar and receive Hora-da-lay -- the
                    ability to encourage rationality and
                      tranquillity in others.

      Yondalao is now very close to Pikal; face to face.

                                  YONDALAO
                    The capacity to influence others 
                    toward peace carries great 
                                  (MORE)                                  YONDALAO (CONT'D)
                      responsibility. Do you accept this 
                    burden for the rest of your days?

      PIKAL nods.

                                  YONDALAO
                            (deadly serious)
                    Blossom your face.

      Scared to death and excited at the same time, PIKAL OPENS 
      HIS FACE. Aeryn and Stark react respectively.

      THE CHANTING STOPS. Yondalao closes his eyes and 
      concentrates. A PURPLE GLOW EMANATES. BUILDS. Then  ZOOM! 
      IT ENTERS PIKAL'S FACE RAPIDLY. Pikal SCREAMS SO LOUD even 
      Aeryn flinches.

      Overcome, Pikal falls backwards into Stark's arms. Pikal 
      blinks, calms, then, PIKAL CLOSES HIS FACE.

                                  STARK
                            (breathless whisper)
                    Are you okay?

                                  PIKAL
                            (joyous revelation)
                    So much more than that...

      Both Stark and Pikal grin large. Yondalao smiles also.

      THE CHANTING RESUMES; BUILDS. WONDEROUS, JOYOUS.

      On Aeryn, strangely moved by what she's seen. As the 
      celebration continues, she QUIETLY EXITS...

      EXT. TEMPLE GROUNDS - ARNESSK - DAY

      Crichton sits with Jool. In the distance, Rygel GROANS 
      uncomfortably and adjusts in his ThroneSled.

                                  JOOL
                            (awkward about it)
                    Anyway, uh, congratulations on the
                      pregnancy.                                  CRICHTON
                    Yeah, baby shower oughta be somethin'. 
                    You get what you needed from Pilot?

                                  JOOL
                    The war hasn't encompassed my planet 
                    yet. Pilot sent a coded signal for 
                    them to come and get me.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You can always hitch with us...

                                  JOOL
                    I wanna see Chiana and D'Argo -- may 
                    head up with you later -- but think 
                    I'11 stay here when you go. Kinda like 
                    research for me.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You'll have the big bucks lecture 
                    circuit all to yourself. "My Year With 
                    the Eidelons."

                                  JOOL
                    Is it horrible I'm thinking that?

                                  CRICHTON
                    No. You did the hard yards. And it can 
                    only be good people learn the 
                    sheriff's back in town.

                                  JOOL
                    Thanks. I have some things to take 
                    care of. I'll find you later.

      As Jool rises and heads off toward Rygel, AERYN APPROACHES 
      from the Temple.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How's it going in there?

                                  AERYN
                            (moved)
                    You should see. Incredible.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Really? Not many things wind you up.                                  AERYN
                    It's going to work. With training, 
                    Pikal and his kind will be able to 
                    influence peace in others.

                                  CRICHTON
                    No wormhole weapon.

                                  AERYN
                    You know, John Crichton, that's 
                    exactly what I was thinking.

      They share large smiles.

                                  AERYN
                    Moya's been electro-charged. I'll take
                    Rygel and Stark back up. Maybe you can 
                    persuade Scorpius to remain here for 
                    an attitude adjustment.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Wouldn't that be nice?

                                  RYGEL
                            (bad attitude)
                    Good to see you, too. Now, go away.

      They look up to see the uncomfortable Rygel shooing Jool 
      along. As Jool gives Rygel a look and EXITS...

                                  CRICHTON
                    Is it just me, or is he getting 
                    bigger?

                                  AERYN
                    Geometric pregnancy.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Please tell me that means we're gonna
                    have a mathematician.

                                  AERYN
                    Warrior, more likely. But we will have
                    it sooner than you think.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How sooner?                                  AERYN
                    The genetic modifications of someone 
                    born into battle, like myself, rapidly 
                      accelerate childbirth so we can rejoin 
                    the front line quickly.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How quicklier?

                                  AERYN
                    We'll be parents in a matter of solar
                    days.

      Crichton stares, stunned. Sees the nervousness in her eyes.

      Tenderly kisses away her doubts.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He gets your eyes, kid's gonna be a 
                    lady killer.

                                  AERYN
                    I'd prefer he not commit crimes.

      He's about to correct her misimpression when--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Did you just make a joke?

                                  AERYN
                            (straight face)
                    Soldiers have no sense of humour, 
                    John. I intend to pass that along, 
                    too.

      And as she starts toward Rygel, leaving Crichton to wonder 
      how he ever got so lucky...

      INT. TACTICAL CORE - PK BATTLE FLAGSHIP

      Maryk reacts as Lieutenant Jatos hands him battle reports.

      The room carries the weight of repeated bad news.

                                  MARYK
                    Is there nothing they can do?

      Lt . Jatos gravely shakes his head.                                  MARYK
                    Then order retreat from the Lelanto
                    Quadrant. Have Commander Spradek 
                    regroup in defense of our nearest 
                    colonized outposts .

      REVEAL Grayza in the doorway, calculatedly watching him.

                                  LT. JATOS
                    Sir? How can the Scarrans move so
                    quickly through our forward positions?

                                  MARYK
                    Because they have been planning this 
                    for many cycles, Lieutenant.

                                  LT . JATOS
                    But you have a design for turning it
                    around?

      Maryk catches Grayza 's eye--

                                  MARYK
                    Of course. In due time...

      Somewhat mollified, Jatos moves off to comply with the 
      orders.

      Maryk and Grayza maintain eye cont ct a moment, then she 
      turns and EXITS.

      INT. CENTRE CHAMBER - MOYA - DAY

      Rygel (still in Pregnancy Stage #2 and uncomfortably 
      swollen) gorging on PLATES OF SWEETS AND FATS.

      As he holds a half-eaten CREAM-FILLED PASTRY in one hand, 
      drinks A CUP OF ALCOHOL with the other 

      D'ARGO'S HANDS REACH AROUND TO GRAB BOTH OF RYGEL'S, 
      stopping any further ingestion.

                                  RYGEL
                    Hey--!

      As he sits beside him, D'Argo wrests the pastry and cup of 
      alcohol from the Dominar.                                  D'ARGO
                    You cannot be this hungry.

                                  RYGEL
                            (avoids his gaze)
                    The baby is.

                                  D'ARGO
                    For taygrin fats and raslak? Rygel,
                    your consumption threatens the 
                    heartiest of offspring, let alone one 
                      half-human.
                            (gently)
                    What's wrong?

      Beat. Surprisingly emotional--

                                  RYGEL
                    I was a lousy ruler. Capricious. 
                      Rapacious. The pleas of the common 
                    Hynerian were but a din outside my 
                    palace walls.

                                  D'ARGO
                    It's a good start to realize that.

                                  RYGEL
                    When I ascended the. throne, I fully
                    intended to be the greatest leader the
                    Empire had ever known.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What happened?

                                  RYGEL
                    I started to believe I was who they
                    thought I was.

                                  D'ARGO
                    And now?

                                  RYGEL
                      One-hundred and thirty-seven cycles in
                    exile is a great educator. I'11 be
                    different next time.                                  D'ARGO
                    Know what, Rygel? I believe you will.

                                  RYGEL
                            (hushed; great fear)
                    I just have to get home before they're
                    all dead. I have to lead them; rally
                    them; save my people.

                                  D'ARGO
                    We'll get you there as soon as we can.
                    Once Pikal learns the way of his
                      ancestors.

                                  RYGEL
                            (nods, grateful)
                    My offer stands, D'Argo. You and 
                    Chiana can have your own prowsa fruit 
                    vineyard; raise a family in peace.
                            (MOANS from gut pain)
                    Just don't ask me to carry a Luxan 
                    baby.

      Rygel pats D'Argo's hand and EXITS. And off D'Argo's 
      thoughtful reaction...

      INT. GREAT TEMPLE - ARNESSK - DAY

      Crichton stands partially obscured by a pillar (or other 
      obstruction). He's watching Yondalao and several other 
      Eidelon Priests surround Pikal and attempt to engage him in 
      GROUP MENTAL PRAYER. From this distance, the following is 
      clear -- Pikal is having trouble getting it; and Yondalao 
      and the others buck him up with encouragement. As that is 
      happening--

                                  CHIANA
                    Crichton?

                                  CRICHTON
                            (whispers)
                    Yeah, Pip.

                    Everyone wants to get moving. How much
                    longer?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Unsure. It's not something I think we
                    can rush.

      EXT. MOYA - SPACE - ORBITING ARNESSK

      INT. COMMAND - MOYA

      Aeryn alone at a forward console, running diagnostics. The 
      DRDs are still working to remove the Tragin's harpoon.

                                  PILOT
                    Thank you for your assistance, Aeryn.
                      Independent verification of hull
                    integrity is invaluable to Moya and 
                    me.

                                  AERYN
                    It's quite the least I can do, Pilot.

                                  PILOT
                    If you'll close the thermal imaging 
                    ports, I'll begin cycling to 
                      pneumestatic distance calibration, 
                      completing our harpoon repairs.

      At that moment the DRDs sever the harpoon and it crashes to 
      the deck as the DRDs scurry to get out of the way.

      Sikozu appears stepping over the fallen harpoon and walks 
      to the other console beside Aeryn.

                                  AERYN
                    Back so soon? Tell Scorpius,
                      continuously asking won't change my
                    opinion. Peace is still better than
                    trying to build a wormhole weapon.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Not spoken like a true soldier.

                                  AERYN
                    Because I no longer am one.      Moment, then--

                                  SIKOZU
                    May I broach a personal subject...

      Aeryn notes the change in Sikozu's tone.

                                  SIKOZU
                    With all due respect, Crichton is your
                    inferior. Why would you bear his 
                    child?

                                  AERYN
                    You should leave, Sikozu. And I mean,
                    off the ship.

                                  SIKOZU
                    When I first met Scorpius, I naturally
                    assumed I was his superior. My 
                    training and mental capacity not 
                      withstanding, I have since learned 
                    there is a reservoir to his abilities 
                    that continually overshadows mine.

                                  AERYN
                    Same with Crichton.

                                  SIKOZU
                    You view him as your superior?

                                  AERYN
                    My equal... Perhaps your under and 
                    over estimations of your self are 
                      meaningless, Sikozu... Perhaps you are 
                    just meant to be together.

      Sikozu's eye's soften a moment... then she JUMPS SUDDENLY, 
      staring at the console--

                                  SIKOZU
                    Pilot? Pilot?!

                                  PILOT
                    Yes, Sikozu?

                                  SIKOZU
                    There was a contact at the outer rim 
                    of Moya's range. A flash, then gone.                                  PILOT
                    Perhaps whatever it is is moving away.

                                  SIKOZU
                            (hitting controls)
                    No. It was heading toward us.

                                  AERYN
                    We're recalibrating that system. False
                    echo?

                                  SIKOZU
                    I know what I saw.

      A beat. Aeryn can't afford to discount her.

                                  AERYN
                    Pilot. Complete strip and rebuild; 
                    now! I want to know what's out there.

      As Aeryn and Sikozu attack the consoles with urgency...

      EXT. TEMPLE GROUNDS - ARNESSK - DAY

      Crichton exits the temple to see Scorpius in conversation 
      with SEVERAL EIDELON PRIESTS, letting them do all the 
      talking, soaking up information. Scorpius excuses himself 
      and falls in walking beside Crichton.

                                  SCORPIUS
                      Interesting, these Eidelons.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why don't ya tell me, Bob?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Despite the fable that's grown around
                    them, they can only affect peace if 
                    the combatants willingly allow them 
                    near.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Fascinating. Jool's writing a book -- 
                    you could do the foreword.                                  SCORPIUS
                    The Scarrans, for certain, would 
                    destroy peace makers long before they 
                    could get close enough to have any 
                    impact.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm not the expert. They are. Let 'em 
                    do their thing.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Fine. But do yours at the same time.

      Crichton stops, turns to him.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What is it you want, Scorp? Deep down? 
                    Me making weapons, that's just a means 
                    to your ends. What are they? Really?

                                  SCORPIUS
                            (honest beat)
                    Power.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Duh. But why? To pull chicks? What?

                                  SCORPIUS
                      I enjoy... the competition.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (dismissing him)
                    Play with yourself, okay.

      As Crichton starts walking again, Scorpius calls after--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    We've been here too long. I have a 
                    highly developed survival sense, and 
                    it's telling me to leave.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Buh-bye.

                                  AERYN
                    John! There's a Scarran warship 
                    closing on the planet at maximum 
                    speed.      Crichton turns to Scorpius, who shows the barest hint of a 
        supremecy-laden "I told you so" look.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Stryker, or Dreadnaught?

      INT. COMMAND - MOYA - INTERCUT

      Aeryn at one console, Sikozu at the other.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Something new. Much faster. And
                    bristling with armaments.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How much time left?

                                  AERYN
                              (correcting)
                    How little.

      LOSE INTERCUT AS--

                                  CRICHTON
                    D'Argo?

      INT. TRANSPORT POD - STATIONARY INSIDE MOYA - INTERCUT

      Action shot. D'Argo leaping over and into the pilot's seat. 
      As he flips switches and THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE--

                                  D'ARGO
                    On my way to pick you up!

      LOSE INTERCUT as Crichton starts toward the Temple. 
      Scorpius strides with him, them VEERS IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Where you goin'?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    To remove as much of our presence as
                    possible. The Scarrans will be hard
                    enough on these Eidelons as it is.

                                  CRICHTON
                    They ain't gonna be here, Scorp. 
                    They're coming with us.      INT. GREAT TEMPLE - ARNESSK - DAY

                                  YONDALAO
                    That is impossible.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Jool, explain to him what's going on.

      Crichton stands winded before Yondalao and Jool. In the 
      background, Pikal -- now in LOCAL ROBES -- with CONCILIATOR 
      EZRANAN, a stately, serene woman. In the distance, a DOZEN 
      OTHER CONCILIATORS listen.

                                  JOOL
                    He knows.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hierarch Yondalao, with respects, 
                    these are not your average crazed ax 
                    murdering cannibal psychopaths coming.

                                  YONDALAO.
                    We will be alright.

                                  CRICHTON
                    The big hand says, I don't have time 
                    to argue... Pikal, gotta go.

      Pikal looks torn. Glances at Yondalao for leadership.

                                  YONDALAO
                    He is not yet prepared to instruct
                    others. His education must continue.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You need more Conciliators, right? 
                    There's a whole planet of his people 
                    back there. How do we get 'em up to 
                    speed?

                                  YONDALAO
                    I will instruct them.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Fine. Jool, you have to come, too.                                  JOOL
                            (tempted, but--)
                    I belong here, Crichton.

      She stands on tiptoes to gently kiss him.

      Crichton touches her hand. Beat. Then, forcefully grabs 
      Yondalao's arm.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You're about to get some fabulous
                    frequent flyer miles.

      INT. CENTRE CHAMBER - MOYA

      Rygel disdainfully eyes the Tissue Transferal Conductor on 
      the counter amidst all the CAKES AND SWEETS from the 
      previous scene. Stark enters, agitated and just a bit shy 
      of "my side, your side.

                                  STARK
                    This is not good.

                                  RYGEL
                    No dren. I'm swollen like an infected
                      Heeligorous, and this frelling thing 
                    is supposed to get the baby outta 
                    me?... I don't think so.

                                  STARK
                    Not you -- them.

                                  RYGEL
                    Who them? There's only me. What? The
                    Scarrans? Look-

      He indicates out the window, where the TRANSPORT POD can be 
      seen approaching.

                                  RYGEL
                      Crichton's almost back. We'll 
                    StarBurst and be gone. You wanna worry 
                    about someone, worry about my 
                      leaderless subjects.

                                  STARK
                    The Eidelons!                                  RYGEL
                    What about them?

      Overcome with dread, his back to the bulkhead, Stark begins 
      to REPEATEDLY BANG HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL.

                                  STARK
                    They are good, give them peace. They 
                    are good, sleep in peace. They are 
                    good, die in peace...

      Stark's reaction causes Rygel to sense a bigger concern. He 
      looks with sudden trepidation out the window at the 
      Transport Pod again.

                                  RYGEL
                            (very worried)
                    Pilot? Is everything okay?

      INT. COMMAND/PILOT'S DEN - INTERCUT

      EVERYTHING FAST. Crichton and Scorpius rocket into the 
      room, joining Aeryn and Sikozu. Through the Forward Portal, 
      Arnessk glistens, a solitary jewel against black velvet. 
      From the projector on the strategy table a HOLOGRAM of Jool 
      inside the temple, flanked by Pikal, and the rest of the 
        Conciliators in the background.

                                  PIKAL
                            (over his shoulder)
                    Get one of the Conciliators. Hurry!
                            (turns to camera nervous)
                    As Peaceful emissaries, we greet all 
                    with equal welcome, favoring 
                      allegiance to none.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why aren't we moving?

      Aeryn mouths "Pilot" to Crichton.

                                  PILOT
                    The Scarrans are close enough to have
                    targeted us.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Initiate StarBurst. Outrun them.                                  SIKOZU
                    Moya refuses. Before she can fully 
                    power up, we'll be hit.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Any ideas for a diversion?

      In the absence of a Scarran reply, Jool steps forward.

                                  JOOL
                    Scarran vessel... The inhabitants of

                    weapons, and pose no threat. Do you 
                    wish to land?

      And off the spooky silence...

      Listening in on Comms as they go, D'Argo and Chiana rush

      Yondalao to his room faster than the old man would like.

                    Pilot, we can't just sit here. Moya's

                    At this range, Commander, it's

                    Scarran vessel, please respond.

      Ahkna at a console, reporting to Staleek, Charrids and 
      Scarrans manning posts.

                      Coordinate charts show a dead,
                      uninhabited planet.

                                    STALEEK
                    Obviously not.

                                  AHKNA
                      Crichton's presence indicates a
                      Peacekeeper ally. Possibly a trap. I
                    suggest Weapons system Cryaka.

      Staleek nods his approval. Ahkna spins to the others--

                    Prepare!

                    Crichton? Are the Scarrans still here?
                    Have they responded?

      Crichton, Aeryn, Scorpius and Sikozu watch -- with JOOL 
      STILL ON-SCREEN -- as the PROJECTILES IMPACT. TWO TINY 
      EXPLOSIVE FLASHES mushroom on the planet's surface--

      WHUMP! WHUMP! Jool, Pikal and the others react as 
      CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS reach them

                    What was that?!

      Aeryn and Crichton trade mournful looks as they watch--

      A DISTANT FIRESTORM SWEEPS RAPIDLY ACROSS A SECTION OF 
      ARNESSK (think the size of France, not the whole planet).

      In the hologram, Jool and the Eidelons react to a GROWING 
      RUMBLING, LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN COMING CLOSER. Pikal is 
      frightened. The other Eidelons shout, panicked. Jool 
      staresat us, calm--                                  JOOL
                    If you can, let my family know I love

      Very pregnant Rygel (now Stage #3; ready to burst) resists

                    say I'm the first one you rescue.

      Rygel pats his pregnant belly as support. When Scorpius and 
      Stark give him a foul look, he references Aeryn.                                  RYGEL
                    Ask her.

                    How 'bout it? We stride onto the

                    They are a species unfamiliar to me. I
                    must first sense their fears and 
                    desires through proximity.

                    No more than a few arns if they emit

                    Strong emissions are their suit.

                    Yeah, should take at least that long 
                    to get room service sorted out.

      Staleek and Ahkna watch as A LONE TRANSPORT POD exits Moya

      Ahkna nods and sets about the task.

      A shrill alarm sounds.

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      THE SHRILL ALARM is coming from a Sentinal (Scarran DRD) as 
      it SCANS Aeryn. She's just entered the room, armed SCARRAN 
      GUARDS on either side. Weapons are leveled at her. Aeryn 
      stops, perplexed, innocent. The weapons are unwavering.

      Finally, losing the bluff, Aeryn slowly produces A DAGGER 
      hidden in her boot.

                                  AERYN
                    Must've overlooked this.

      The Sentinal's SIREN CONTINUES. The weapons stay leveled. 
      From under her hair at the back of her neck, Aeryn produces 
      A SMALL WEAPON. She trades a look with Crichton, then is 
      roughly shoved into the room, joining Crichton, Scorpius, 
      Sikozu, Stark, Yondalao and Rygel.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I won-der whaaat they want... ?

      As the tension builds, Yondalao turns QUIETLY to Stark 

                                  YONDALAO
                    You lived among the Scarrans?

                                  STARK
                    Most of my life. Assisted their dying
                    rituals -- passage to the other side.                                  YONDALAO
                    Then you know their psyche.

                                  STARK
                    As much as possible. They're 
                      secretive. Primal.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Assist me with the knowledge, that we 
                    may discover their path to peace.

      Stark is about to tell what he knows when the Scarran 
      guards smartly step aside, allowing STALEEK AND AHKNA TO 
      SWEEP INTO THE ROOM triumphantly.

                                    STALEEK
                    Welcome to my flagship.

                                  CRICHTON
                    That was a temple you nuked down 
                    there.

                                    STALEEK
                    An act of precaution. Requisite in 
                    times of war. As is truth seeking.

      Without prelude, Staleek HEAT-TRUTHS AERYN--

                                    STALEEK
                    The Luxan and Nebari who were 
                    traveling with you?

                                  AERYN
                            (instant pain)
                    Gone. A short while before we came.

      Staleek releases Aeryn from the Truth Ray's grip. She 
      staggers and Crichton steadies her.

      Ahkna is near Rygel, whom she notes with curiosity.

                                  AHKNA
                    Strange. I always assumed His Highness
                    was male.

                                  RYGEL
                          (in discomfort)
                    Tumor. Not long to live.                                  AHKNA
                    I would agree.

      As Rygel reacts, Staleek indicates to the guards.

                                    STALEEK
                    Take the Hynerian to separate 
                    barracks.

      As the Guards grab Rygel, Crichton and Aeryn attempt to 
      intervene. The Scarrans violently deflect them.

                                  RYGEL
                    Stop it! Let go of me!

      As RYGEL IS TAKEN FROM THE ROOM, protesting--

                                    STALEEK
                    I find it intriguing Sebaceans and 
                    Humans can propagate together. And 
                      troubling.

                                  STARK
                    How did you know he was pregnant with
                    their child?!

                                    STALEEK
                    The same way I knew to find you here.

                                  SIKOZU
                      A traitor.

                                  STARK
                    But, who? None of us would--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Grunchlk.

      Staleek smiles; moves to Scorpius.

                                    STALEEK
                    They say one traitor can always 
                    recognize another.
                            (fingers Scorpius's 
                            headpiece)
                    If only you hadn't facilitated 
                      Crichton's earlier escape... there 
                    might be peace now.                                  SCORPIUS
                    With you as supreme ruler.

      Staleek ACTIVATES SCORPIUS' HEADGEAR, ASSEMBLY EJECTING.

                                    STALEEK
                      A position I know you dream of, 
                    Scorpius. Perhaps I can facilitate a 
                    return to your fantasy world.

      Staleek VIOLENTLY RIPS THE ASSEMBLY FROM SCORPIUS' HEAD.

      Scorpius howls and drops to his knees, TWISTED WRECKAGE 
      dangling from the hole. As Sikozu rushes to comfort him-- 
      Staleek turns on Crichton with focused malevolence.

                                    STALEEK
                    You are alive for one reason only.
                      Protestations aside, I will have the 
                    wormhole knowledge you possess. If 
                    not, War Minister Ahkna will pleasure 
                    herself torturing the Hynerian and 
                      abomination in his belly.

      Ahkna leers sadistically, punctuating the threat.

                                    STALEEK
                          (to Aeryn)
                    Care to watch?
                          (to Crichton)
                    You have one arn to decide.

      Staleek whirls and exits, followed by Ahkna and the guards. 
      The DOOR CLOSES, a HYDRAULIC DEADBOLT locking them in.

      Scorpius twitches on the ground, rises to a knee. Sikozu 
      moves to examine the door, searching for a way out. Stark 
      whimpers, retreats to a corner. Yondalao sits, deep in 
      concentration, drawing vibes from the encounter.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Peacekeepers have a word for
                      predestination?
                            (off her blank look)
                    You're gonna do it whether you wanna 
                    do it or not, so you might as well do 
                    it with your middle finger in the air.                                  AERYN
                    You can't give him wormhole weapons.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Yondalao 101 isn't ready. They have
                    Rygel. Tell me I'm wrong.

                                  AERYN
                            (conflicted beat, then--)
                    I want that baby, John. But do you 
                    know what you're doing?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Almost never.

      As Crichton starts for the door, Scorpius grabs his boot.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You... give them... nothing.

      As Crichton peels Scorpius' fingers off--

                                  CRICHTON
                    That should be easy.

      Peeling Scorpius' fingers off, Crichton bangs on the door.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Door number one, Stormtroopers -- 
                    let's make a deal!

      INT. BRIDGE - SCORPIUS' COMMAND CARRIER

      Braca faces the forward window. In the distance. THREE 
      DOZEN TINY DOTS -- WARSHIPS -- are moving toward Qujagan.

                                  BRACA
                    Grand Chancellor, I assure you. From 
                    all indications, this is Emperor 
                    Staleek's armada preparing to engage 
                    us.

      INT. GRAND CHANCELLOR'S CHAMBER - INTERCUT

      Maryk is contemptuous. Grayza behind him with interest.                                  MARYK
                      Preposterous. What would he be doing 
                    at such a non-strategic coordinate?

                                  BRACA
                    His ship is not here yet, sir, but--
                            (hesitates, then)
                    They're coming for Crichton.

      Disgusted, MARYK ENDS THE COMMUNICATION; turns to Grayza--

                                  MARYK
                    And now you will tell me this one 
                    human holds such fascination that 
                    Scorpius would desert, the Scarran 
                    Emperor would pursue, and we should 
                    all tremble at the power of his 
                    magical wormholes?

      Grayza ignores the tirade and begins preparing them TEA.

                                  MARYK
                    Did you not tell me Crichton was
                      powerless; his doomsday weapon a myth?

                                  GRAYZA
                    To my belief... But the moment is not
                    without opportunity.

                                  MARYK
                            (proffers a DATA CHIP)
                    Agreed. Knowing the Emperor's 
                      whereabouts allows us to initiate a 
                    peace proposal before our position is 
                    so eroded as to be laughable.

      Grayza pauses. A moment of decision. Then, UNSEEN BY MARYK, 
      she removes one EARRING and drops it in the tea. IT FIZZES 
      AS IT DISSOLVES.

      Grayza approaches, but DOES NOT OFFER THE TEA yet.

                                  GRAYZA
                    It also allows us to surprise the 
                    Scarran leader and decapitate his 
                    empire. Sudden chaos within their 
                    ranks could tip the balance.                                  MARYK
                            (twiddles DATA CHIP)
                    And if that fails? He will never 
                    entertain an overture to truce. I will 
                    not be remembered by history as the 
                    commander under whom Peacekeeperdom 
                    fell...

      Grayza smiles and finally offers him the tea, sure that he 
      is no longer fit to lead. As he SIPS.

                                  GRAYZA
                    No, my love. You will not.

      Maryk reacts, feeling THE FIRST PANGS OF POISON.

                                  GRAYZA
                    Because despite your station, you are
                    weak.

      MARYK CHOKES. DROPS THE TEA. STRUGGLES FOR AIR.

                                  GRAYZA
                    I say that which I have before -- 
                    death is preferable to subjugation 
                    under Scarran rule. They must be 
                    defeated.

      As Maryk sinks to the floor, GASPING NOW, the DATA CHIP 
      slips from his grasp and SLIDES NEAR HER FOOT.

                                  GRAYZA
                    Desperate times... Peace.

      As Maryk TWITCHES, then lies still, Grayza's toe comes 
      downon the DATA CHIP, SHATTERING IT LIKE GLASS. She calmly 
      sips her tea before activating Comms--

                                  GRAYZA
                    Medical to Grand Chancellor's chamber.
                    He's in some kind of... distress.

      And off Grayza's cold reaction to the father of her child 
      lying dead at her feet...

      INT. MEDICAL QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      Rygel lies on a surgical table, moaning, swollen. Ahkna       issues instructions to a FEMALE SCARRAN DOCTOR.

                                  AHKNA
                    The Emperor wants this one maintained.
                    However, I would consider it a 
                    personal favor should he die of 
                      explainable causes.

      The Doctor nods, understanding. Before Ahkna can leave, A 
      SCARRAN OFFICER arrives to hand her DIGI-REPORT. She 
      reacts, darker and more malevolent than we've ever seen.

      INT. NEXUS - DECIMATOR

      Staleek, examining a console, turns when he hears--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hey, Godzilla! Wanna go shopping? 
                    Wormhole Wal-Mart's got low, low 
                    prices every day.

      Crichton is straining forward, literally dragging TWO 
      CHARRID ESCORTS who attempt to restrain his progress.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You win. I surrender. I'll take you to
                    where wormhole knowledge bubbles up 
                    from the ground like Perrier. But you 
                    let Rygel go.

                                    STALEEK
                    Give me the coordinates.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Doesn't work like that. We go in my 
                    ship. Two-door with no back seat. Only 
                    way to get there.

                                    STALEEK
                    I'm not that imprudent as to travel 
                    with you. I shall send--

      Ahkna has just entered with purpose, carrying the DIGI-
      REPORT she received in the last scene.

                                    STALEEK
                    Ahkna.      She stops; glares at Staleek. Crichton turns to her.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Don't look so pale, baby -- I'll make 
                    you more powerful than the Wicked 
                    Witch of the West.

      Ahkna gauges his sincerity. Then, SHE HEAT-TRUTHS HIM.

                                  AHKNA
                    Is this a trick? A trap?

      In pain, Crichton shakes his head. Ahkna releases him from 
      the heat ray with a small smile.

                                  AHKNA
                    I shall accompany him, your Eminence.

      Staleek has reconsidered letting Ahkna grab the power.

                                    STALEEK
                    No. Prepare a course to rejoin our 
                    battle group at the water planet. I 
                    will go.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (grins at Ahkna)
                    Sorry. You stay the dumb Scarran
                    Minister of Funny Hats.

      As Staleek and his guards escort Crichton from the room, 
      Ahkna glares after her superior with contempt. Then, she 
      thrusts the DIGI-REPORT to a Bridge Officer. The Officer 
      studies the report a moment, then reacts: "Holy shit! This 
      is not good."

      She gives him a "Fix it!" Look.

      INT. LOLA - INVISIBILITY MODE - CONTINUOUS

                                  CHIANA
                            (squinting our front)
                    And a final power source two 
                      compartments forward of the last 
                    magnetic relay...

      She shakes off her "alien vision," then examines the fully 
      detailed CG DECIMATOR BLUEPRINT. Points out an error--                                  CHIANA
                    Smaller, more intense. And, here.

      D'Argo hits a few controls and a bright point of orange 
      light on the hologram moves location and intensifies.

                                  CHIANA
                    That's it. That's it!

                                  D'ARGO
                            (enjoys the moment)
                      Excellent. I can stop them cold with
                    three perfect shots.

      She grins and kisses him as he works.

                                  CHIANA
                    Why so many? You usually get me with
                    just one.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Rygel's invited us to Hyneria.

                                  CHIANA
                    They have a great aphrodisiac snail 
                    stew.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I was thinking I'd like to work with 
                    my hands.

      Chiana grins seductively, offering herself.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Maybe plant prowsa fruit. Make wine.

                                  CHIANA
                    Make love.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (turns to her, deadpan)
                    What's on your mind?

      She smiles broadly and begins to peel off her tunic...

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      Having peeled back Scorpius' headgear, REVEALING HIS       MANGLED SKULL BENEATH, Sikozu is now tearing a strip of 
      metal apart with her bare hands to make him a protective 
      cover.

      Across the room, Yondalao sits as Stark paces before him.

                                  STARK
                    Yes, yes, I see... If faced with such 
                    a moral choice, Scarrans would still 
                    choose to slaughter innocents. I must 
                    think...

      And as Stark wanders off, muttering, Aeryn approaches--

                                  AERYN
                    Any progress?

                                  YONDALAO
                    A great deal. I will soon be able to
                    influence their passions.

                                  AERYN
                    Good... Before, in the temple, when 
                    you said, "Peacekeeper, do your 
                    duty..." What did you mean?

                                  YONDALAO
                    I had forgotten that you had 
                      forgotten.
                            (sage beat)
                    At the dawn of our period of 
                      usefulness -- twenty-seven thousand 
                    cycles ago -- we developed need of a 
                    guard. A race no one had quarrel with. 
                    A force to insure harmony prevailed 
                    once negotiations had finished.

                                  AERYN
                            (hushed revelation)
                      Peacekeepers...

                                  YONDALAO
                      Apparently, your forbearers attempted 
                    to carry on once we vanished. However,
                    lacking our mediation abilities, they 
                    kept peace the only way they could -- 
                    at the muzzle of a weapon.                                  AERYN
                    And for that we're hated.

                                  YONDALAO
                    It wasn't such at the beginning. We 
                    took great care to choose a species no 
                    one had met before. We found your kind 
                    -- primitive and barely clothed -- far 
                    removed on the galaxy's outer spiral. 
                    Having brought some of you back, your 
                    evolution was accelerated, with 
                    generous alterations, until you became 
                    our trusted acolytes.

                                  AERYN
                    It is a pleasure to once again serve.

      Yondalao nods, pleased with her understanding. Then -- 

      THE SECURITY DOOR UNLOCKS and Ahkna is revealed in the  
      corridor beyond, flanked by GUARDS. She motions for Aeryn.

      EXT. CRICHTON'S MODULE - DRIFTING IN SPACE

      As we swing around and move closer...

      INT. CRICHTON'S MODULE - DRIFTING - CONTINUOUS

      Emperor Staleek is uncomfortable in the back seat; 
        cramped,neck bent. Crichton scans the blackness before 
      them.

                                    STALEEK
                    I grow weary.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Yeah? What's that like?

      Staleek looks around at the nothingness. Skeptical.

                                    STALEEK
                    This is the source of your knowledge?

                                  CRICHTON
                    And the back of cereal boxes.      INT. EARTH CAR - LIMBO - INTERCUT

      Crichton and Harvey in the front seat, both costumed and 
      made up like CRASH TEST DUMMIES. Noting Harvey's 
      appearance, Crichton checks himself in the mirror.

      During the scene, the car is slowly being RATCHETED 
      BACKWARDS with a series of small, but distinct, jolts.

                                  HARVEY
                    You know what you have to do, John.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Actually, yes.

                                  HARVEY
                    Just fly the module into an asteroid. 
                    No more Staleek.

                                  CRICHTON
                    No more Crichton. No more Aeryn. No
                    more anybody. You think War Minister
                      Psychodrama's gonna be kinder and
                    gentler?

                                  HARVEY
                            (grabbing Crichton)
                    Someone else's problem. But you will
                    have done your duty.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Pass. And take your hand off'a me.

      BACK IN THE MODULE - CONTINUOUS

                                  CRICHTON
                    I said, take your hand off.

      Hand on Crichton's neck; Staleek squeezes harder.

                                    STALEEK
                    We shall return to my ship -- there is 
                    no wormhole here.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We're catchin' the four-fifteen. It's
                    never late.      HARVEY AND CRICHTON IN THE EARTH CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                  HARVEY
                    Last chance. Veer into the wall of the
                    wormhole. It'll be over fast.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Son's gotta have a father, Harv.

                                  HARVEY
                    Could be a girl.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Nah.

      The backwards ratcheting stops.

                                  HARVEY
                    Buckle up.

      They both buckle their shoulder belts and--

      THE CAR ACCELERATES FORWARD, whiplashing them.

      INT. CAR CRASH CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      The Earth Car catapults along a rail -- like footage from 
      every Insurance Institute Safety Study you've ever seen --
      SMASHING VIOLENTLY INTO A WALL. The dummies inside are 
      crunched into the crumpling dash and exploding glass.

      BACK IN THE MODULE - CONTINUOUS

      The WORMHOLE OPENS in front of them.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Cinch up your diaper, big boy -- first
                    time's the worst.

      Crichton angles his craft into the gaping maw of the 
      SWIRLING WORMHOLE. Despite his emperor stoicness, Staleek 
      can't help but show fear as they cross the threshold.

      INT. WORMHOLE - INTERCUT

      The Module corkscrews wildly past. Inside, THE COCKPIT 
      ROTATES INSANELY.                                    STALEEK
                            (way concerned)
                    This... is normal?

                                  CRICHTON
                    No. The module's overweighted. There's 
                    a fat guy in seat Two-B.

      Up ahead, a FORK IN THE WORMHOLE. Crichton fights the 
      stick.

      At the last second - The Module rockets down the left 
      branch like a missile.

      INT. WAR NEXUS - DECIMATOR

      Guards shadowing, Ahkna and Aeryn step up to the window.

      Moya is visible in the distance; no other ships.

                                  AHKNA
                    I have been informed you plot escape.

                                  AERYN
                    We're prisoners, with no weapons.

                                  AHKNA
                    None here. But, perhaps... out there.

      Aeryn looks at the stars. Ahkna studies her coldly.

                                  AHKNA
                      I promise... you will never be 
                    reunited with your baby.

                                  AERYN
                            (buries the fear)
                    I'm sure your mother wished the same
                    thing.

                                  AHKNA
                            (grins)
                    Very brave, you are... No doubt 
                    believing your invisible Luxan ship 
                    will save you.

      Aeryn reacts. She knows. Ahkna knows.                                  AHKNA
                    Ordnance Officer? Fire.

      CANNONS BOOM and Aeryn watches in alarm as SHELLS EXPLODE 
      IN EMPTY SPACE. As the third shell detonates, D'ARGO'S SHIP 
      FLICKERS INTO VIEW, having been hit!

      INT. LOLA - INVISIBILITY MODE - INTERCUT

      D'Argo struggles with the controls, Chiana holding on for 
      dear life as the ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY. ARCS AND SPARKS!

                                  CHIANA
                    D'Argo--!

                                  D'ARGO
                    How the hezmana--?!They know we're
                    here!

      As D'Argo wrestles for control, THEY'RE ROCKED AGAIN.

      BACK INSIDE THE WAR NEXUS

      Aeryn watches in horror as Lola   hit again   FLICKERS ONCE 
      MORE, then RESOLVES, now fully visible. The tail section is 
      FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES!

                                  AERYN
                    Stop it. They can't hurt you now.

                                  AHKNA
                    Agreed. The Luxans are as 
                      Peacekeepers. Soon to be dead or 
                    enslaved.

      A FINAL SHOT TRIGGERS A FIERY EXPLOSION! D'Argo's ship 
      BREAKS APART, pieces ejected everywhere. Amidst the debris, 
      D'ARGO AND CHIANA TUMBLE OUT UNPROTECTED INTO SPACE!

      And as we PUSH CLOSE on Aeryn's helpless reaction...

      INT. WORMHOLE

      The Module slices past, nearly out of control. And then, 
      before our eyes, IT DISAPPEARS!      EXT. LIMBO BLIZZARD

      MASSIVE, SWIRLING SNOWSTORM. HOWLING WIND. The Module sits 
      nearby, enshrouded by snow. Crichton is face down with a 
      mouthful of it. Staleek lays across an icy rise nearby. 
      Both men rouse...

                                  CRICHTON
                            (spitting out the snow)
                    Least it wasn't yellow.

      As they rise, EINSTEIN has appeared where a moment ago 
      there was no one. Black suit; hollow eyes; not happy. 
      Crichton gives a pathetic little wave; Staleek stiffens.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    You have violated our trust.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He has my lady and child.

                                  EINSTEIN
                      Unimportant to the larger agenda.

                                  CRICHTON
                    They are my larger agenda.

                                  EINSTEIN
                            (studies Staleek)
                    Why have you brought him here?

                                  CRICHTON
                    It's Armaggedon on our side of the 
                    fence. Everyone wants wormholes. Think 
                    of this as an educational tour.

                                    STALEEK
                    Who is this creature?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Call him Einstein... Nicely.

      Staleek raises his hand to HEAT-TRUTH EINSTEIN! 
        Anticipating this, Einstein casually flicks two fingers as 
      if brushing a crumb off someone's shoulders, and AS IF 
      VIOLENTLY STRUCK, Staleek's hand is knocked away.

      Staleek growls, again raises his hand and once again       Einstein waves his own, knocking Staleek's to the side.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Staleek... he can twist time around 
                    his little finger. Truth Ray's not 
                    going to work.

                                    STALEEK
                            (ignoring Crichton)
                      Eyen-stine - - do you possess the 
                    knowledge of wormholes?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Yes.

                                    STALEEK
                    Can these wormholes make weapons?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Yes.

                                    STALEEK
                    Then you will give me that power.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    No.

      Now with a fierce roar, Staleek charges Einstein to 
      throttle him. Again Einstein moves his hand through the 
      air, this time freezing Staleek in his tracks.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Humbling, ain't it?

      Staleek struggles to break out of the time warp but 
      ultimately has to bow in recognition of a higher power.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I can find wormholes. Fly through 'em.
                    Right?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    With rudimentary knowledge we have 
                    given you.

                                  CRICHTON
                    But can I make a weapon?                                  EINSTEIN
                    You cannot.

      Crichton gives Staleek a "see" expression.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    No one should have that power.

      Crichton makes a SNOWBALL and holds it in front of Staleek.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Listen up. This is your universe. And
                    this is your universe on wormholes.
                            (crumbles the snowball)
                    Mess with the natural order, you set 
                    off a reaction destroying both our 
                      dimensions. You wanna win the war and 
                    rule the galaxy, be my guest, but you 
                    don't need me to do it.

      Einstein motions for Crichton to follow him on A SHORT 
      WALK.

      Staleek, still in the time warp, can't follow.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Returning here was wrong.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He can't come back on his own. And I
                    needed to save the people I love.
                    You owe me that for putting this crap 
                    in my head.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    It may soon be prudent to remove it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Amen. I wanna be blonde again.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Perhaps when the discord has ended.                                  CRICHTON
                    I don't like being your insurance 
                    policy. Especially when I don't even 
                    know what it's for.

      Einstein drills him with a look, and then -- IS GONE!

      Crichton turns back to Staleek, now released.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Happy?

                                    STALEEK
                    You truly cannot build a wormhole
                    weapon.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (snaps his fingers)
                    How quick are you?
                            (heading to the Module)
                    Stay if you want. Build a snow
                      Scarran...

      With a last look around, Staleek trudges after Crichton...

      EXT. SPACE - D'ARGO AND CHIANA FLOATING

      Drifting amidst the debris of Lola, now some distance from 
      the Decimator. D'Argo has managed to get to Chiana; holding 
      onto her jersey. She is wild-eyed with fear, cheeks puffed, 
      like she's holding her breath.

      After a beat, D'Argo's lungs expand and he places his mouth

      over hers, BREATHING INTO HER to keep her alive...

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

        A solemnness permeates the room. Stark is deep in prayer. 
      With each cadence, he dips slightly and briefly opens a 
      corner of his mask, allowing WHITE LIGHT TO SPILL OUT.

                                  STARK
                    Enshrine their souls. Anoint with 
                    harmony. Dispel all suffering. And 
                    guide the passage of Ka D'Argo and 
                    Chiana to a place of rest...      Across the room, Aeryn and Yondalao--

                                  YONDALAO
                    Cannot a Luxan survive in space?

                                  AERYN
                    For a quarter arn, maybe a little 
                    longer.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Scarran brutality surprises me. They
                    will be difficult to influence.

      And off Aeryn' s "Oh, great" look--

                                  SCORPIUS
                            (weak)
                    The Scarran blood in my veins knows 
                    more than you ever will, Eidelon...

      Off to the side, Sikozu is pulling Scorpius' hood back in 
      place, A TEMPORARY PATCH over his ripped apart ear-hole.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    At the first scent of interference, 
                    you will be as dead as D'Argo and the 
                    Nebari tralk.

                                  SIKOZU
                    There's only one path from this 
                      prison...we fight our way out.

      And off the discord of opinions as to courses of action...

      EXT. SPACE - D'ARGO AND CHIANA FLOATING

      He no longer has air to give. They trade sad, 
        acceptingglances. And as their eyes begin to roll up--

      A SPACE-SUITED HAND grabs D'Argo' s arm and spins him 
      around!

      ANOTHER SPACE-SUITED HAND grabs Chiana. D'Argo 's eyes go 
      WIDE as he (but not us) sees who his rescuer is...

      INT. MEDICAL QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      Rygel is enormously swollen. Colour off, looking terrible,       he shifts continuously, unable to . get comfortable.

                                  RYGEL
                      Oohhhwww... You have to do something.
                    It's time to transfer the baby.

                                  FEMALE SCARRAN DOCTOR
                    When I am instructed.

      This is her opportunity. The Doctor prepares a SCARRAN 
      SYRINGE with a special vial of ORANGE LIQUID. A drop of it 
      hits the counter, MARRING THE SURFACE AS IF ACID.

                                  FEMALE SCARRAN DOCTOR
                    Until then, I can give you something 
                    that will eliminate the pain 
                      completely.

                                  RYGEL
                    That sounds goo--
                            (pain spasm)
                    Hurry!

      As the Doctor prepares to INJECT RYGEL'S STOMACH   
      STALEEK'S HAND grabs her wrist, SNAPPING THE BONE, syringe 
      dropping to the floor.

                                    STALEEK
                    Who's orders override mine?

                                  FEMALE SCARRAN DOCTOR
                            (fear and pain)
                    War Minister Ahkna. I had no
                    choice.

      Staleek swiftly BREAKS HER NECK! As the Doctor slumps to 
      the floor, he turns to the stunned Rygel--

                                    STALEEK
                    You will die when I order it.

                                  RYGEL
                            (softly)
                    Okay.

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      At the back of the room, Stark watches silently as Yondalao       paces, moving as if in A RAPTUROUS TRANCE. Aeryn and Sikozu 
      argue quietly near the door.

                                  AERYN
                      Absolutely not.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Our best opportunity is when -- if --
                    they bring Crichton back through that 
                    door. We have to try and escape.

                                  AERYN
                    Not until the baby is safe. In me.

      Tension between the women as Scorpius approaches--

                                  SCORPIUS
                      A disagreement past it's time.

      He nods toward the cell door. IT SWINGS OPEN and Crichton 
      slips inside. The Guards outside lock it again immediately.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (angry)
                    And how was your day?

                                  AERYN
                    They killed Chiana and D'Argo.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I saw the wreckage on the way in.

      Crichton and Aeryn embrace in sadness.

                                  SIKOZU
                    You should not still be alive.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Staleek's gonna keep his word. I took 
                    him -- we get Rygel.

                                  SCORPIUS
                              (incredulous outrage)
                    You traded ultimate power for an 
                    unborn offspring?                                  CRICHTON
                    I traded bupkis. He can't make a 
                    weapon any more than you. This has all 
                    been for nothing. D'Argo and Chiana... 
                      everything.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Your ranting aside, we still have no 
                    way out.

                                  AERYN
                    Maybe not...

      They follow Aeryn's gaze to where Yondalao stands, eyes 
      closed, face to the ceiling, HEAD ENCASED IN A SOFT PURPLE 
      GLOW THAT EMANATES FROM HIM. Awed, Stark kneels before the 
      holy man.

      And off the others' reactions, PUSH CLOSE ON Crichton and 
      Aeryn, hopeful...

      INT. WAR NEXUS - DECIMATOR

      Ahkna is busy at work when -- THE DOCTOR'S SYRINGE is 
      stabbed into the console beside her. She eyes it without 
      flinching.

      Turns to find the fuming Staleek--

                                    STALEEK
                    If the Hynerian had died, my word is
                    useless.

                                  AHKNA
                    As differentiated from what?! My 
                    father trusted you to lead the army. 
                    You gave your word you would support 
                    him with your life. Then you took his.

                                    STALEEK
                    As you may someday take mine... Not
                    today, though. Explain yourself.

                                  AHKNA
                    The Luxan Stealth Craft I discovered 
                    and destroyed. 
                                  (MORE)                                  AHKNA (CONT'D)
                    The presence of Scorpius, who has 
                    already betrayed you once. And the 
                    overall ability of these creatures to 
                    plague us with resistance. Add them 
                    up, and they
                    should die for our own security.

                                    STALEEK
                    Scorpius is a commander in our enemy's
                    armada; Officer Sun a former pilot. 
                    Who knows what information may be 
                    "coerced" from them.

                                  AHKNA
                    And I say it's not worth the risk.

                                    STALEEK
                    Stop seeing Vitubian Vipers in every
                    shadow.
                            (dark, dark beat)
                    And never countermand my orders again.

      As he EXITS, Ahkna fumes at the reprimand...

      INT. LUXAN STEALTH STRIKER - INVISIBILITY MODE

      A sleek, high-tech cockpit with wraparound windows. Aft, a 
      large jump bay -- seats for soldiers, racks hung heavy with 
      weapons, ammo and gear. EIGHT LUXAN COMMANDOS at various 
      positions. Outside the windows -- which SHIMMER IN 
        INVISIBILITY MODE -- the debris of Lo'La, the Decimator 
      beyond, and in the far distance, Moya.

      D'Argo and Chiana gasp for breath like landed fish. The 
      Commando who rescued them removes his space suit helmet.

                                  CHIANA
                    How...? It's not... possible.

                                  JOTHEE
                    Hi, Chiana. Father.

      Jothee grins at his father and the stunned Chiana. D'Argo 
      greets his son by EXTENDING HIS LEGS, CATCHING JOTHEE IN 
      THE MIDSECTION with both boots, SENDING HIS SON CRASHING 
      into the other Commandos. Tension as the Commandos draw       BLADES.

                                  JOTHEE
                              (recovering)
                    Not quite a traditional Luxan 
                    greeting, but...

      The schism is still raw, especially from D'Argo.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What are you doing here?

                                  JOTHEE
                    Right now? Saving your life.

                                  D'ARGO
                    And I'm grateful.

                                  CHIANA
                            (nervous)
                    Hey, Jothee -- real good to see you. 
                    But shouldn't we be running?

                                  JOTHEE
                    Our Concealment Technology is three
                      generations beyond yours. We could 
                    pull up beside 'em and they wouldn't 
                    know we're here.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (looking around)
                    You're... a Commando?

                                  SERGEANT LEARKO
                    He's our Kliva -- ain't that right,
                    Skipper?

      Learko pats Jothee on the back as he slides past in the 
      tight quarters, dropping into the pilot's seat.

                                  CHIANA
                    Kliva?

                                  D'ARGO
                            (proud)
                    An officer with autonomous field 
                    control.                                  SERGEANT LEARKO
                    Gotta have brains for that. Rest of us
                    just like fighting.

      The Luxans CHORUS A SHOUT OF "ROO-KAH," a morale building 
      cry that binds them together.

                                  CHIANA
                    Why are you here?

                                  JOTHEE
                    We've been tracking the Emperor for 
                    some time -- then, there you were. 
                    They after Crichton and his wormholes?
                            (off D'Argo's nod)
                    That's what I figured. We gotta take
                    Crown Head out, but his ship's pretty
                    well insulated.

                                  D'ARGO
                    One would think.

      D'Argo pulls a DATA WAFER from his tunic and the HOLO 
      DISPLAY OF THE DECIMATOR he and Chiana constructed LIGHTS 
      UP THE DARK SPACE. The Luxans react.

                                  JOTHEE
                    Is this accurate?

      D'Argo nods. Jothee and Learko trade amazed looks.

                                  JOTHEE
                    Looks like we should be able to 
                    cripple 'em with four shots.



                                  D'ARGO & CHIANA
                    Three.

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      Tension. Aeryn, Scorpius and Sikozu.

                                  AERYN
                    Alright, I agree. If it appears 
                    Yondalao will fail, we attack and try 
                    to obtain weapons.      Scorpius and Sikozu nod conspiratorially, the plan set.

      Across the room, as Crichton approaches, Stark gives last 
      minute thoughts to the ultra-centered, calm Yondalao.

                                  STARK
                    And they loathe "compromise." The only
                    way Scarrans can accept one is to 
                    focus on what they gain, minimizing 
                    what they give.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Thank you, Stark -- you have been most
                    helpful.

                                  STARK.
                    An honor.

      Stark nod-bows with respect as--

                                  CRICHTON
                    You ready champ? Fifteen rounds,
                      heavyweight title time.

                                  YONDALAO
                          (he is)
                    This vessel is infused with their 
                    anger and hatred, as well as the 
                      inadequacies that fuel it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    And I just thought that was mildew.

      Just then, THE DOOR UNLOCKS and an angry Staleek ROUGHLY 
      drags the bloated Rygel in. Misshapen by pregnancy, Rygel 
      lays back on his ThroneSled, barely functional, as Staleek 
      SHOVES HIM into the center of the room.

                                    STALEEK
                    Here. Have him.

      Crichton reaches out and grabs Rygel as he lurches past.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hey, easy.                                  RYGEL
                            (softly; agony)
                    Help me.

                                  AERYN
                    Are you alright? The baby?

      As Rygel nods, Aeryn guides him to a private place.

                                    STALEEK
                    This maintains my portion of the 
                    accord. Beyond, I promise nothing.

                                  CRICHTON
                          (as Staleek leaves)
                    Let us go. You have no reason to--

                                    STALEEK
                            (spinning back)
                    I need no reason.
                            (fury in silence, then--)
                      However... though you cannot make a 
                    weapon of one, you nevertheless 
                    predicted a wormhole's presence. For 
                    that alone, you are valuable.

                                  YONDALAO
                            (stepping forward)
                    With deference, Your Dynast... Are
                    weapons the only way to achieve your
                    goals?

                                    STALEEK
                    Who ... are you?

      As Yondalao speaks, THE LINES ON HIS FACE PERIODICALLY GLOW 
      SOFT PURPLE. With each pulse, the HUE INTENSIFIES.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Hierarch Yondalao, Triumvirate 
                    Council, Eidelon Faction of 
                      Neutrality.

                                    STALEEK
                    There is no such thing as neutrality. 
                    You travel with my prisoners, you are 
                      a prisoner.                                  YONDALAO
                    Great Emperor Staleek. You wish power.
                      Acknowledgment of your personal
                      intelligence. And to gain acceptance 
                    in the upper echelon of civilizations.

                                    STALEEK
                              (interested)
                    What do you know of my aims?

                                  YONDALAO
                    Only that there are many paths to
                      accomplish them.

      Crichton is close enough to also be affected by Yondalao's 
      abilities. He's all of a sudden pussycat nice--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Look, I can't believe I'm saying this,
                    but...

      Scorpius has staggered over and PULLS CRICHTON OUT FROM THE 
      PURPLE GLOW Yondalao emanates 

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You're saying nothing, Crichton. This 
                    is Emperor's business.

      From over where she protects the supremely uncomfortable 
      Rygel, Aeryn gives Crichton a seconding nod.

                                    STALEEK
                                (uncharacteristically... )
                    I am listening.

                                  YONDALAO
                    Violence and war lead to imperial 
                    power, continually challenged by the 
                      subjugated. Attractive from afar, it 
                    carries a long-term drain on 
                      resources, and ultimately
                    crumbles, leaving the victor worse 
                    than before the conflict.                                    STALEEK
                    War is our way. At the peace table, we
                    know how we're viewed. Brutish; 
                      ignorant...

                                  YONDALAO
                    Then what greater victory than to 
                    prove them wrong?
                            (drives the deal home)
                    And without the loss of a single 
                    Scarran life...

      Staleek is totally within Yondalao's sway. Intrigued.

                                    STALEEK
                    How?

                                  YONDALAO
                            (indicates the table)
                    If you will join me.

      As Yondalao and Staleek move to sit down, our gang can't 
      help but be frelling impressed with what they're 
      witnessing. Even Scorpius reacts with less skepticism; 
      giving the equally intrigued Sikozu a look. Now out of the 
      PURPLE HAZE and with a bit more of his wits about him, 
      Crichton turns to Aeryn with a look of "Wow."

      INT. LUXAN PENETRATOR - INVISIBILITY MODE

      D'Argo sits silently in the co-pilot seat next to Learko. 
      Chiana is in back, trading war stories with the Commandos 
      as they ready gear. Jothee slides forward, taps Learko on 
      the shoulder and indicates they swap positions.

                                  JOTHEE
                    Can we talk?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Can we listen?

                                  JOTHEE
                    To each other? I'm ready.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I'm not.                                  JOTHEE
                    I've spent two cycles Grafting an
                    apology.

                                  D'ARGO
                    It still needs work -- sit with it 
                    awhile longer.
                          (re uniform)
                    Special forces ...

                                  JOTHEE
                    Just like you.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I never made Kliva.

                                  JOTHEE
                    It's a war, they're promoting
                      underachievers.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (proud beneath it all)
                    Mm-hm.

                                  JOTHEE
                            (awkward moment, then--)
                    I have to attack that Decimator.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (instantly focused)
                    I told you, Crichton will signal us 
                    soon. That's the plan.

                                  JOTHEE
                    We saw him return through the debris 
                    of your ship. He thinks you're dead.

                                  D'ARGO
                    They'll still try and escape. If you
                    strike sooner, we'll have no chance of
                    rescuing them.

                                  JOTHEE
                              (no-bullshit commando)
                    Father... that is not our mission. I 
                    may not be able to destroy that 
                                  (MORE)                                  JOTHEE (CONT'D)
                    vessel's armour, but I'll disable it 
                    until something bigger gets here to 
                    finish the job.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Please... just a little more time.

      And off Jothee's consternation as to course of action...

      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - DECIMATOR

      Swollen to bursting, Rygel is shaking uncontrollably. 
      Holding his shoulders to stabilize him, Aeryn divides her 
      attention from concern for the baby to the amazing ad hoc 
      peace conference across the room.

                                  RYGEL
                            (desperate pleading)
                    Please... I beg you... take the baby 
                    out of me ...

                                  AERYN
                    In a moment, Rygel. Be strong.

      She watches a seated Crichton, Yondalao, Scorpius and 
      Staleek.

      Sikozu stands over Scorpius' shoulder, adjusting his 
      mangled headpiece as she listens. Stark is SERVING 
      BEVERAGES. They're all so calm and familiar with each other 
      they could be playing cards, such is the effect of 
      Yondalao's PEACEFUL PURPLE GLOW.

                                  SCORPIUS
                            (surprising even himself)
                    That sounds... so reasonable.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I gotta agree. It's dot the I's, cross 
                    the t's, we're done.

                                  YONDALAO
                            (calm, soothing, guiding)
                    Is that how you see it, Emperor?

                                    STALEEK 
                    Yes. I believe so...                                  YONDALAO
                    Could you review the accord that you 
                    wish all of us to agree to.

      Yondalao is a master, playing to Staleek1s ingrained sense 
      of leadership and power. Staleek responds accordingly--

                                    STALEEK
                    Of course... The core of the matter is 
                    the perception that Crichton can 
                      manufacture wormhole weapons. If I 
                    submit a proposal of armistice to the 
                      Peacekeepers with Crichton by my side, 
                    they will naturally assume he has 
                    bestowed a military edge upon the 
                    Scarran Empire.

                                  SIKOZU
                    Causing them to quake with fear.

      Staleek looks to Scorpius for confirmation.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    The Grand Chancellor is not a gambler. 
                    He will indeed accept peace over a war 
                    he thinks he will lose.

                                    STALEEK
                            (aware of the humour in it)
                    Being "benevolent"...I will then 
                    propose an accord that favors us
                    in mining rights and trade balance, 
                    while allowing self-rule in 
                      Peacekeeper territories.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I love this, see, cause I'm out of it.

                                    STALEEK
                    You shall be released upon the 
                    signing.

                                  YONDALAO
                    And a great many lives will be saved 
                    by everyone simply-- Aggggggghhhhhh!

        A HEAT-TRUTH RAY strikes Yondalao's face. Everyone reacts,      spinning to find Ahkna -- its source -- in the doorway.

                                  AHKNA
                            (contemptuous)
                    Do you really wish to broker peace 
                    with an enemy you are certain of 
                      defeating?

      Staleek is stunned, like a man coming out of a deep, 
      hypnotic sleep. As the confusion lifts, he VIOLENTLY PUSHES 
      AWAY FROM Yondalao, who REMAINS IN THE GRASP OF AHKNA'S RAY

                                    STALEEK
                    What is this... ? Proposing a treaty 
                    from my position of power is 
                      tantamount to surrendering. And yet..

                                  YONDALAO
                            (encased in pain)
                    It is the proper... course of action.

      Staleek is disturbed by what's happened; not the least of 
      which is that Yondalao DOES make sense. But, after all, 
      Staleek is Scarran, and Scarrans have their way...

                                    STALEEK
                    Does your kind have a prayer for the
                    dying?

                                  YONDALAO
                    We do.

                                    STALEEK
                    Fill your mind with it now, that you 
                    may be comforted.

      Striding toward the door, Staleek motions to Ahkna, who 
      INTENSIFIES HER RAY. Yondalao buckles to the deck.

      Stark cries out in soulful pain. Crichton rises to help; 
      Scorpius restrains him. Aeryn does not dare leave the 
      writhing Rygel. Sikozu bristles with caged tension. 
      Yondalao gurgles in agony and collapses. When Ahkna turns 
      off the ray, YONDALAO' S FACE IS BURNED AND SMOKING.                                    STALEEK
                    Our bargain is kept. I wish you
                    happiness with your offspring.

      PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS inside the room  

                                  STARK
                    The secret of peace is lost! The 
                    secret of peace is lost! The secret of 
                    peace is lost! ...

      Crichton rushes to the fallen Yondalao. Scorpius and Sikozu 
      strike defensive stances, ready to defend themselves.

      Aeryn1 s first instinct is to rush help Crichton, however, 
      Rygel begins gagging and gasping for air--

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel?! Rygel   ?!

      AS THE DOOR CLOSES, we catch a final glimpse of Staleek and 
      Ahkna in the corridor. She's looking pretty damn superior 
      at the moment. Staleek -- still shaken by the encounter 
      with Yondalao -- gives her a look that can only be 
      interpreted as: "You were right. Kill them." And then, THE 
      DOOR IS CLOSED AND LOCKED.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (kneeling with Yondalao)
                    Not good. Stark -- give him last 
                    rites.

                                  STARK
                    I cannot! I am beneath him!

                                  CRICHTON
                          (to Scorpius)
                    Got any tricks I don't know
                    about?

      Scorpius shakes his head. Crichton looks back toward the 
      cowering Stark. Crichton stares for a moment; plan forming 
      in his mind. Then, he rises and approaches Stark--                                  CRICHTON
                    C'mon, Astro Boy -- take his power,
                    protect his gift.

                                  STARK
                      I cannot--!

      Crichton drags the resistant stark toward yondalao.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You can. You're a Stykera. I've seen 
                    you do amazing things. Snap out of it. 
                    Help him. Help us. Help the whole damn
                    universe.

                                  STARK
                    No! No! His knowledge is too great.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm sorry, Starky, I really am, but we 
                    don't have time for psychoanalysis.
                          (to the others)
                    Grab a limb.

                                  AERYN
                    John--?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Before Yondalao dies! HELP ME!

      What follows is horrible. Like rape. Crichton, Aeryn, 
      Scorpius and Sikozu each grab one of Stark's limbs. He 
      resists furiously, like a rabid animal. It's violent, 
      brutal. They hoist him up so he's spread-eagle in the air, 
      parallel to the dying Yondalao, faces a foot apart.

                                  STARK
                    Please   no. Please! PLEEAASSSE!

      As Stark HOWLS with terror, Crichton PULLS HIS MASK OFF. 
      Stark thrashes, tries to turn his head. As Crichton and the 
      others hold him steady, STARK'S LIGHT SPILLS ACROSS 
      YONDALAO'S DYING FACE.

      A PURPLE GLOW begins to RISE UP FROM YONDALAO. After 
      amoment, the PURPLE GLOW IS SUCKED UP INTO STARK'S FACE!

      Stark SCREAMS like death as--      Yondalao dies, a faint, peaceful smile on his face. 
      Crichton replaces Stark's mask and they lower him to the 
      deck, where he curls up in a ball, sobbing.

                                  AERYN
                    What have we done?

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm not sure. It was just worth a 
                    shot.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Not that it does any good. They will
                    never let us go.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (angry; focused)
                    Yeah, well, from this moment on, we're 
                    not gonna ask anymore. We're just 
                    gonna--

      A HORRIFIC BURBLING LIQUID SOUND AS RYGEL THROWS UP LIKE 
      LINDA BLAIR and begins thrashing about as if in the midst 
      of a Grand Mal Seizure.

                                  AERYN
                            (already moving)
                    John!

      Crichton is two steps behind. They get to Rygel and hold 
      him down. HIS EYES ARE ROLLED UP IN HIS HEAD, virtually 
        unconscious. THE BODY JERKS ARE VIOLENT AND INTENSE!

                                  AERYN
                    He's overdue -- we have to transfer 
                    the baby.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Oh, God.

                                  AERYN
                    Do you remember what to do?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Yeah, I think so. Lay him down; lay 
                    down beside him...
                                  (MORE)                                   (CONT'D)
                            (looking around)
                    The first thing I need is--

                                  SIKOZU
                    GAS!

      THICK, DARK-COLOURED, HEAVY GAS BURBLES UP FROM FLOOR 
      VENTS.

      During the scene, the level of gas will rise uniformly, as 
      if it were a liquid threatening to engulf them.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What the hell!

                                  SIKOZU
                    They're entombing us.

      The GAS IS NOW KNEE DEEP. Crichton hauls the whimpering 
      Stark up from the deck where he was being buried and passes 
      him off to Sikozu.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Door?

      Scorpius is at the door. Turns and shakes his head.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Sonofabitch. SonofaBITCH!

                                  AERYN
                    John--?!

      Crichton looks back to see Aeryn using all of her 
      prodigious strength to hold RYGEL DOWN. HE'S IN FULL 
      SEIZURE NOW!

      For the first time in the series, we see PANIC creeping 
      into Crichton's face!

                                  CRICHTON
                    Staleek! STALEEK! Can you hear me?

      INT. CONTROL PANEL - DECIMATOR - CONTINUOUS

      Ahkna's eyes are steel as she primes another control panel, 
      lights blinking. After a beat, she activates the system.      INT. CONTAINMENT QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

      THE GAS SPEWS OUT FASTER. WAIST DEEP NOW. Aeryn picks up 
      Rygel's limp form, holding him out of the gas. Scorpius is 
      silent, rubbing the foam between his fingers.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'll give you anything, Staleek! Name
                    your price. STA-LEEEEEK!
                              (frustrated, re gas)
                    What is this? What's it do?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Paralytic embalming agent. Preserves
                    living tissue without killing the 
                    brain.

                                  AERYN
                    Why?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Scarrans use it on specimens they wish 
                    to dissect while still alive.

      They all react. Aeryn has brought thespasming Rygel over. 
      She and Crichton trade looks. THE GAS CHEST HIGH.

      As Sikozu steadies Stark and Scorpius emits A RUMBLE OF 
      IMPOTENT FURY, Crichton hugs Aeryn, who's holding Rygel up 
      high. She looks into his face, desperate.

                                  AERYN
                    We never say goodbye...

      Crichton shakes his head, tears of frustration streaming 
      down his cheeks. As he wraps Aeryn tighter in his arms--

      THE GAS RISES UP TO ENVELOPE THE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS and 

                                                                      FREEZE FRAME.
