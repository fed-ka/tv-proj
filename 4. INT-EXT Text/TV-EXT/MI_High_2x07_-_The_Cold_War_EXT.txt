      DAISY, BLANE, N/SSECURITY GUARD

      Deserted streets. BLANE and DAISY are now in cleaning 
      uniforms, carrying a bucket and mop. BLANE walks comically 
      along, his legs wanting to go in different directions. 
      DAISY has mastered her Sat Navshoes. As they arrive at the 
      Cold Research Museum BLANE falls over. 

                                  DAISY
                    Look, twinkle-toes, turn off the 
                    shoes if they re toocomplicated. 

    As BLANE bends down and adjusts his shoes, DAISY examines a 
      sign: Museums of Infectious Diseases. Mon-wed10-2.00. An 
      additional sign reads:  Closed today due to sickness . 
      DAISY and BLANE walk up to the museum. Standing before them 
    is a not very alert SECURITY GUARD who breaks off from 
      blowing his nose.  

                                  DAISY
                    Make-it-Sparkle Cleaning Co.

    She shows him an ID card featuring a photo of a very large 
      lady. The SECURITY GUARD does a double take.

                                  DAISY
                    Really gets you fit this job!

      DAISY examines the brass buttons on his uniform, doesn t 
      look happy, then gives them a quick squirt of polish. The 
      SECURITY GUARD nods for them to enter.

      DAISY, BLANE, N/STHEODORE TILBURY, TAXI DRIVER

      DAISY and BLANE manhandle a jerkily-walking TILBURY up to a 
      bus-stop.   

                                  DAISY
                    That was close. Nice work with 
                    the shoes. 

      DAISY looks down - now both of them are shoelessand 
      BLANE s wearing odd socks!

      DAISY, BLANE, TAXI DRIVER, N/STHEODORE TILBURY

                                  DAISY
                    How are we gonnaget him back to 
                    HQ? There won t be any buses.

                                  BLANE
                    Being spies who can t drive 
                    really sucks. 

      Just when all seems lost, a taxi appears. DAISY and BLANE 
      frantically wave it down.

                                    BLANE/DAISY
                    Taxi! Taxi!

    It pulls up and they climb in, propping TILBURY up in the 
      back. TILBURY falls onto DAISY and she pushes him away in 
      revulsion.

                                  BLANE
                    StHope s High.

                                  DRIVER
                    What happened to your mate?

                                  DAISY
                    Nothing. He s just chilled.

    The TAXI DRIVER shakes his head. The cab drives past a huge 
      billboard:  Say no to Super-Flu with WarmsipExtra .

      GESUNDHEIT

      A spaghetti western moment as tumbleweed and then a 
      newspaper blow across the road in front of StHope s. 
      Someone steps on it then picks up the copy. The headline 
      reads:  Britain on its sneeze! Flu-nitedKingdom on verge 
    of collapse!  Reveal it s GESUNDHEIT looking menacingly at 
      StHope s.

      GESUNDHEIT, LENNY, MS TEMPLEMAN, GRANDMASTER

      GESUNDHEIT makes a call on his mobile. We intercut with the 
      GRANDMASTER. 

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    Please let me come back! It s 
                    terrible here... everyone is 
                    sick. And they don t put their 
                    hands over their mouths.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    Our plan has almost succeeded...

    The GRANDMASTER s barometer shows 98% now have flu. A chart 
      marked  Company Profits  shows profits off the scale.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    But if you return without Tilbury 
                    then the doors here will remain 
                    locked. You ll be out there - 
                    forever!

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    No! Please, not that-

    The GRANDMASTER puts down the phone. Back on GESUNDHEIT 
      clearly shaken. LENNY appears at the end of the same 
      corridor, and seeing a stranger, takes cover. He watches 
      suspiciously. MS TEMPLEMAN emerges from the classroom and 
      approaches GESUNDHEIT.

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    I ve handed out the assessment 
                    papers. 

      GESUNDHEIT is dragged back into class by MS TEMPLEMAN. 
      LENNY is reassured and hurries on towards the school 
      kitchen.

      ROSE, N/SYOUNG THEODORE TILBURY, N/SEDWARDIAN PATIENTS

      ROSE hurries down the corridor in a state of panic. The 
      corridors are all tinted red. 

                                  ROSE
                    I ve reached the left hemisphere, 
                    but my mind map s useless. I m 
                    having to guess...

      ROSE begins opening classroom doors at random. A young 
      TILBURY runs towards her, rolling his Victorian play-hoop. 

                                  ROSE
                    I think I ve just seen the young 
                    Tilbury. It must be a childhood 
                    memory...

      Young TILBURY runs off, laughing. As ROSE gives pursuit, a 
      group of Edwardian PATIENTS in nightgowns emerge blocking 
    her path. In the melee, ROSE loses sight of young TILBURY.

      DAISY, ROSE

      ROSEand DAISY wait impatiently at the exit point, the 
      entrance gate where they first entered Tilbury s brain. 
      ROSE is looking at the formula, trying to memorize it. 

                                  ROSE
                    I think I ve got it.

                                  DAISY
                    Rose, you never forget facts. 
                    This would not be a good time to 
                    start! (beat) Where s Blane? 

    The world jitters, DAISY and ROSE are thrown to one side.

      BLANE appears, running hard, pursued by TILBURY and the 
      PATIENTS. 

                                  BLANE
                    Let s go!

      BLANE reaches them just before TILBURY. The TEAM link hands 
    and vanish through the reception.
