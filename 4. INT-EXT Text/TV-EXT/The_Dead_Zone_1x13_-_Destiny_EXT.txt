          A bright spring day.  The Smith house looks the same as
          it always has, and will.  We're outside the house, outside
          the front gate, on the street.  

          An old MERCURY SEDAN enters frame like a rusted out Star
          Destroyer, parks near the gate.  The door opens and out
          steps JAMES STILLSON, 29, a linebacker build in a cheap
          white linen suit, capped off with a crew cut.  He dabs at
          sweat beads on his forehead with a handkerchief, pulls
          out a small white 3X5 card, reads it, and looks up at the
          Smith mansion.  Yep, right place all right.   

          The passenger door opens and a ten year old boy steps
          out, wearing a nearly matching suit, and a junior contour
          haircut that is so good you wonder how it came out of a
          wreck of an old Mercury.  GREG STILLSON takes in the big
          house with curious, piercing grey-blue eyes. 

          James opens the trunk and pulls out a very large valise. 
          He walks over to Greg, sets the bag down, pulls out a
          comb, and rakes it over Greg's already perfect hair. 
          Knocks a speck of dust off his collar.  Then grills him: 

                                        JAMES
                        Look at me.  When rich folks fill
                        out the card, what's it mean?

                                        GREG
                        Means they got religion.

                                        JAMES
                        And if they got religion...

                                        GREG
                        They want to buy. 

                                        JAMES
                        So what do we sell 'em?

                                        GREG
                        The whole set.

                                        GREG
                        Eye contact.  Confidence.  Smile.

          Greg smiles brightly, as if for a picture. 

                                        JAMES (CONT'D)
                                (cold frown)
                        Warm smile.

          Greg adjusts his grin, attempting a "warm smile."

                                        JAMES
                        Don't screw this up.

          Off Greg, warm smile frozen on his face...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          the old Mercury.  



          Present day.  DANA and JOHNNY exit the front door, heading
          down the steps to Dana's car.  Both in a good mood. 

                                        DANA
                        What are you guys reading?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're up to pulp detective novels. 
                        More complex than the Westerns.

                                        DANA
                        Oho, my favorite.  Hard boiled
                        cops.  Femme fatales...

                        Sleazy reporters...

                                        DANA
                        Hey, just remember which sleazy
                          reporter hooked you up with this
                        job.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For which I'm very grateful. 

                                        DANA
                        Bet your ass.

          They stop at her car.  Johnny gets serious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I mean it, Dana.  Even if it's
                        one kid, two days a week... 

                                        DANA
                        You're a teacher again.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I like Johnny the Teacher.  There's
                        no drama there.   

                                        DANA
                        No story for those sleazy
                        reporters.

          Johnny steps close to her. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now I just have to figure out how
                        to deal with the femme fatales... 

          Dana smiles, and just as they're both about to take action,


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT ONE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW    8.

          SARAH'S JEEP comes rolling up the driveway.  Johnny
            involuntarily takes a step back from Dana, who notices. 
          Sarah notices, too, as she pulls up. 

          After an exchange of Hi's... silence.  Sarah just blankly
          sitting there.  Johnny has to speak up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's up?

          Sarah realizes she drove here. 

                                        SARAH
                        Oh.  I was just coming by to get
                        you.  It's Saturday morning. 
                                (Johnny looks confused)
                        Mighty Clams are scrimmaging...
                          remember?

          Johnny now sees JOHNNY JR. in the passenger seat, dressed
          in his soccer uniform. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, gosh, guys, I'm sorry.  I've
                        got my last session with Chuck
                        today.  In ten minutes, actually.

                                        SARAH
                        No problem.  Hop in, we'll give
                        you a ride.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, that's okay, I was gonna catch
                        a ride with Dana...

          Awkward silence again.  Dana eventually breaks it with a
          smile directed at Johnny Jr.

                                        DANA
                        Go Clams!

          Johnny Jr. looks down, blushing.  Sarah fixes Dana with a
            mirthless smile.

                                        SARAH
                          Alright.  Well, the game against
                          Heatherfield is next Sunday. 

          Sarah smiles and drives off, wincing at her banal parting
          words.  She looks in the rearview mirror, which frames
          Johnny and Dana, the image receding into the distance...          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT ONE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW    9.



          A banner over the front door reads, "WELCOME GRADUATES! 
          CLASS OF 2002!"  Underneath it, STEVE CARRICK, owner, is
          arguing with Johnny and Walt.

          Surrounding them are Sarah, Roger and Chuck Chatsworth. *

                                        STEVE CARRICK
                        Look, graduation parties and
                        Cathy's steakhouse are a twenty
                        year old tradition.  I'm not gonna
                        ruin the night for all these kids
                        because some psychic predicts
                        something.

                        SARAHCHUCK
            Mr. Carrick...Johnny.

          But Johnny abruptly holds up his hand, and keeps it up as
          he talks to Carrick.  Low, measured, and very intense. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll say it again.  Tonight your
                        restaurant will be struck by
                        lightning.  There will be a flash
                        fire.  The insulation will burn. 
                        The doors will jam.  They will*
                        find bodies six and seven deep in
                        the exits.  Do you understand?

            Carrick's eyes narrow to slits.  He speaks slowly.

                                        STEVE CARRICK
                        Sick... son of a bitch.  Are you
                          threatening me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm warning you.

                                        STEVE CARRICK
                          Sheriff, I want this man off my
                          property right now.

                        I see things too, you know.  Like
                        a sky with no clouds. 

          Everyone looks up.  The sky is flawless blue.  Walt notices*
            something else.  Clears his throat.*

          A large RV style trailer rolls down the street, painted
          red white and blue.  The white part is a large stripe
          across the center which bears a slogan: "VOTE STILLSON
          FOR CONGRESS!"


          The film stock again hints at a brighter, more ideal past,
          though this is the late 80's, and farmers in America aren't
          doing too well.  Making them excellent targets for bibles.



          The idyllic image is corrupted as Greg Stillson backs out
          of the front door, holding Charlotte in front of him.

          A beat later, Farmer Crow follows, still leveling the
          shotgun.  His wife behind him.

          Greg backs to his Mercury.  Charlotte is scared, yet also,
          in a perverse way, excited.  Maybe at the specter of her
          Father in a state of emotional panic.  Greg opens the
          drivers side door.

                                        GREG
                        We're getting in together so make
                        sure you don't get any ideas. 
                        You'll still hit us both.

          He slides in, pulling Charlotte on his lap.  Reaches around
          her waist and starts the engine.

                                        GREG
                        Close the door, honey.

          She does.  He backs up, hands reaching around her to steer. 
          The car accelerates in reverse, then spins around and
          takes off.  Mrs. Crow screams again.  Farmer Crow runs
          into the dust plume kicked up by the departing Mercury.          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT TWO - 7/02/02 - YELLOW   24.



          Now we're looking at the road outside of Johnny's house. 
          Cars are paralleled down the usually quiet block.  Bruce's
          PT cruiser is one of them.  He gets out and is immediately
          accosted by Johnny GROUPIES.  He ignores them as he
          collects Johnny's mail.  Ignores the packages they try to
          shove into his arms.

          We also notice some MEDIA types outside the house, as
          well as a couple SIDEWALK VENDORS, who have set up bridge
          tables and are hawking crystals, pyramids, etc.  



          Looking down a long, forested road.  In the near distance,
          a luxury sedan approaches.

          LEGEND: "June 6, 1995"

          The morning after the car crash.  A moment we've never
          seen till now.  A tow truck pulls the wreck off the side
          of the road.  Ambulance has long since come and gone. 

          A luxury sedan drives by, not slowing down.



          Greg puts his car in park and steps out into the sunshine.

          He and Sonny head for the building.



          As Greg's oath continues, we find ourselves soaring over
          the countryside, flying/dissolving over small towns across
          Maine, eventually arriving at our signature aerial shot
          of Cleaves Mills.  The sound of an heartbeat QUICKENING...

                                        GREG (V.O.)

                        mental reservation or purpose of
                        evasion...

          Zeroing in on CLEAVES MILLS HOSPITAL, flying inside...



          The Interfaith Rally is in full swing.  The predominating
          deity here is Uncle Sam.  Red White and Blue everywhere. 

          Bruce's PT CRUISER pulls up, and Bruce gets out... with
          Johnny, a baseball cap pulled down low over his eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for taking me, man.

                        Hey, your fans are liable to
                          recognize my car just as much as
                        yours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I mean considering what a bastard
                        I was the other day.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh.  You're welcome.

          Johnny takes it in... his first day out in over a week,
          and its filled with PEOPLE.  Including KATIE, the young
            volunteer who helped Greg get dressed, and her BOYFRIEND,
          fresh-faced and naive. 

          They offer Johnny a STILLSON BUTTON, which he politely
          turns away.  Bruce takes one for the hell of it.    

          Edging along the side of the rally, Johnny searches the
          crowd for something, not finding it.  Then he spots Walt,
          ordering a deputy to patrol a perimeter or something. 

          Walt spots Johnny, and nods to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe this was the wrong day to
                        come...

                        Johnny!

          Purdy makes his way over, delighted to see Johnny.  With
          Purdy are two BODYGUARD/ASSISTANTS.  Purdy and Johnny
          have to speak loudly over the din of the crowd.  

                                        PURDY
                          I didn't expect to see you so
                        soon. 

                                        JOHNNY

                        Have you considered my offer?

          Johnny is distracted by CERTAIN PEOPLE in the crowd who
          have spotted and recognized him, and are making their way
          toward him.  From all sides. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like I'm not taking that
                        trip after all.

                        And I think that, at least on a
                        trial basis, I could use your
                        resources.

          Music to Purdy's ears.  He gives Johnny a bear hug, and
          over Purdy's shoulder Johnny sees the... 


    5353MONOLITH VISION

          The BLACK OBELISK screams toward us at incredible speed
          and then BLACKS OUT THE FRAME. 


  5454JOHNNY

          Jerks back from Purdy's embrace.  Purdy is slightly off-
          put, but Johnny doesn't have time to analyze as he notices
          the "Johnny-ites" getting closer and closer...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I was thinking maybe we could
                        start right now. 

          Purdy now sees what he means.  Nods to his bodyguards. 

                                        PURDY
                        Come on, there's someone I want
                        you to meet. 

          Purdy shelters Johnny, leading him out of the throng and
          into a VIP section.  Purdy's minions move to intercept
          the fans who are getting too close.

          Bruce walks next to Johnny, can tell that he's shaken.

                                        BRUCE
                        You saw something, didn't you?

                                (nods so Purdy can't
                                see)
                        I'm not sure what...



          Greg Stillson and Daddy Joe are both on cell phones as
          Purdy and Johnny mount the steps up the back of the
            platform.  They are in the wings of the giant stage, hidden
          from the crowd.  We also spot Linda, Charlie Richardson's
            ex-secretary, in a sleek pant suit, conferring with a
            bodyguard type.  Johnny slows as he realizes who Purdy is*
          going to introduce him to.  Greg turns to regard Johnny,*
          closing up his phone.

                        Two of the essential people in my

                        Excuse me. 

          And Purdy walks right out on stage, a natural.  The crowd
            applauds, then quiets for him.

          Johnny faces Stillson.  It's an eerie moment for both
          men.  Greg doesn't pour on his usual charisma.  

                                        GREG
                        I've heard of you.

                        Well, any friend of Reverend Purdy,
                        is a friend of mine.

          Greg extends his hand.  Johnny shakes it.

          SPINS 180 Degrees to shoot over Johnny's shoulder, as he
            witnesses the Monolith Vision again - although Greg
          Stillson doesn't vanish for the duration.  Instead the
          monolith swallows Greg a split second before it BLACKS
          OUT THE FRAME. 


  5757JOHNNY

          is truly shocked.  He takes a step back, shaken, and then
          turns to look at Purdy, onstage.  What does it mean?

          The crowd CHEERS as Greg bounds onstage, shaking hands
          with the Reverend, then embracing him (more cheers). 

          Johnny watches the two of them as if they were underwater. 
          His gaze drops to their hands.  Joined hands.

          Before he knows it, Johnny is moving toward those hands,
          which hold the key to the mysterious vision.  He feels
            compelled to touch those hands, to know. 

          Sonny Elliman grabs Johnny by the arm, stopping him. 
          This attracts the attention of Purdy and Stillson, and
          wakes Johnny up to the fact that he has moved onstage,
          where the entire assembly can see him.   

          Purdy smiles waves Johnny forward.  Greg looks at Sonny,
          who releases Johnny.  And before he knows it, Johnny is
          moving forward, torn between the impulse to run off the
          stage and hide, and the desire to touch those hands. 

          Purdy shakes Johnny's hand, for the crowd and for the
          cameras.  And then, without warning, standing between
          Johnny and Greg, raises each of their hands in "victory"
          to the crowd.

          All sound drops out.  Completely.  Pull back to reveal

          Johnny moves his hands down the wall, scraping the black
          off to reveal WHITE STONE underneath.  He looks at his
          hands, palms covered with BLACK SOOT.  Then he looks up,
          and we pull back... and back... and back...  to reveal
          the monolith as a towering black-soot covered obelisk.

          Behind the monument, the Capitol City lies in ruin, flames*
