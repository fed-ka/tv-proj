      Low key on the outside -- just a simple neon sign and a velvet
      rope.


      As Keane ushers Amanda toward his white MG, Amanda's eyes
      follow a couple of CUSTOMERS as they head inside.

                                      AMANDA
                            (distracted)
                    Did you know this was a convent once?

                                      KEANE
                    Next you'll tell me you were a nun.

                                      AMANDA
                    Tempting.  Black is my color.

      The two witnesses disappear out of sight as Keane turns away
      from Amanda to unlock the car.

      He holds the door open for her to get in and is taken
      completely off guard when

      AMANDA

      slams the door hard into his stomach.  He doubles over in
      pain as she pulls her sword out.

      KEANE

      struggles to draw his own sword, barely raises it in time to
      block Amanda's next blow.

      He scrambles away, on the retreat as he recovers his breath.

                                      KEANE (CONT'D)
                    And I thought you were only interested
                    in my body.
                          (beat)
                    Was it something I said?

                                      AMANDA
                    Duncan MacLeod.

      The smile fades from Keane's face, his charming demeanor
      replaced by intensity.

                                      KEANE
                    Where is he?

      Keane attacks with renewed interest, driving Amanda back
      against the car.

      AMANDA

      attacks with grace and a series of acrobatic moves, forcing

      KEANE

      to retreat.

      AMANDA

      drives her blade toward him.  She thrusts will all her
      strength.

      KEANE

      avoids it.  The blade drives into a brick and stone wall. 
      It breaks.

      Amanda retreats.  She can now fight only defensively but she
      doesn't give up.  Keane drives her back.  He grabs her
      swordarm with his free hand, holding it away from him.

      Amanda tries to get a knee in his groin but he avoids the
      blow.

                                      KEANE (CONT'D)
                    Not twice in one night, sweetheart.

      He leans on her, keeps her pinned.  He twists the sword out
      of her hand and his blade goes to her neck.

                          (a little breathless)
                    That makes two of us.

                    Then call MacLeod.

      He hands her the cell phone out of his jacket.  And off her
      trapped look --

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod heads into the church.  On edge as he gets the BUZZ.


      The patchwork of colors of the MacLeod tartan... mud and
      blood adding to the pattern.

      MACLEOD

      on horseback, slogs through the scorched landscape.

      The sound of a grieving WAIL reaches his ears.  He spurs his
      horse tiredly towards the sound.


      A scene of absolute destruction.  The home of a small farmer
      has been burnt to the ground, the remaining timbers still
      smoldering from the blaze.

      An old woman covered in soot sits cradling a mortally wounded
      young man in her arms.  She wails her grief to the sky.

      MacLeod dismounts, starts to water his horse amid the carnage. 
      There is nothing new in the destruction around him.  He's
      seen the same for days.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                          (calling to him)
                    Look!  Look at what they've done to
                    us.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (hollow)
                    I have.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                          (re the lad's body)
                    He was only a lad.  They said they
                    couldn't let him grow into a rebel
                    like his father.
                          (through tears)
                    His father has been dead ten years. 
                    Got the fever in '35.  He never saw
                    the cursed war.
                          (beat)
                    Where are our men?  Where is Prince
                    Charlie?

      MacLeod speaks, his voice as dead as he feels, as he moves
      to her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The war is over.  The men are
                      scattered.  Prince Charlie is fled
                    to France.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                    If the war is over, why are they
                    still killing?

      MacLeod has no answer.

                                      GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
                          (re the house)
                    His mother and his sisters were
                    inside.  I begged the soldiers to
                    let them out.  They laughed.  They
                    said they couldn't let us breed.
                          (beat)
                    They burned them.  On the Earl's
                    orders, they said.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Come away, Grandmother.  I'll help
                    you bury them.

      She looks at him with eyes burning with rage and grief, her
      voice tight with anger.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                    You want to help me?
                          (re his sword)
                    Bury the English bastards who did
                    this.  Make the dogs pay!  Give me
                    my revenge!

      MacLeod reacts, his face hardens.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (Cold)
                    The Earl who gave the order -- what
                    was his name?

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                    Rosemont.

                    God will punish him for this!

                                      MACLEOD
                    He won't have to wait for God.

      (SCENE 31731 FROM "TAKE BACK THE NIGHT")

      MacLeod rides through the woods, reins in his horse.  His
      fade darkens at what he sees.  Grimly he pulls out his musket.

      MACLEOD S POV -- A CAMPFIRE

      and four English soldiers, RUPERT, WILLIE and two others,
      drinking around it.  A MURDERED SCOT and his WIFE hang from
      a tree nearby.  Rupert stokes the fire.  Willie hands him a
      bottle.

                                      RUPERT
                          (beat)
                    When we're finished, there'll be
                    nothing left in this stinking land
                    but oats and sheep.

      From the darkness, a musket is fired.

      WILLIE

      catches a musket ball between the eyes, goes down in a heap,
      the bottle flying from his hand.

                                      RUPERT
                    What the devil?

      MACLEOD

      steps from the shadows with his sword drawn.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    As far as you're concerned
                          (beat)
                    The Devil himself.

      RUPERT

      scrambles for his musket.  He fumbles it, terrified.  Before
      he can fire --

      MACLEOD

      attacks, sword slashing.  With a cry, Rupert drops backward,
      dead, landing across the fire.  He feels nothing.

      THE TWO OTHER SOLDIERS

      attack MacLeod from either side.

      MACLEOD

      Takes them both on simultaneously.  It is a quick but deadly
      battle as one Englishman falls, then the other.

      FOLLOWING MACLEOD

      as he moves to the hanging Scot.  It's a young man.  MacLeod
      looks at him a BEAT, his face going cold.

      As he raises his sword to cut him down, we PUSH IN on the
      sword --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      RICHARD DUNBAR, the EARL OF ROSEMONT, walks the grounds with
      STEVEN KEANE.  A table is set up under a pavillion on the
      lawn; at it, Rosemont's WIFE puts out fruit and cheese.

      Nearby, Rosemont's two sons, MICHAEL, 8, and ANDREW, 4, play
      on the manicured lawns.

      The scene is a picture of domestic happiness.

      Keane looks relaxed and happy, but Rosemont is a bit edgy --
      he's been at war for the last few years, and is still uneasy
      at leisure.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    I lost scouting party after scouting
                    party -- they'd march into the woods
                    and we'd never find so much as their
                    bones.

                                      KEANE
                    I heard it went hard.

                                      ROSEMONT (CONT'D)
                    They were everywhere.  Any man or
                    boy that could raise a sword or a
                    scythe was against us.
                          (beat, with feeling)
                    Scottish devils left me no choice.

                                      KEANE
                    I should have been there, Richard.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    I thank God you were not, Steven.  I
                    trusted you to look after my wife
                    and sons.

                                      KEANE
                    You're my family.
                          (beat)
                    As much as I've ever had.

                                      ROSEMONT
                          (beat)
                    There are days I thought I'd never
                    see them again.  It seemed that damned
                    war would go on for a thousand years.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 11. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

      They've reached the table.  Rosemont's wife hands them wine
      glasses as:

                                      KEANE
                    But in the end you got the better of
                    them.

                                      ROSEMONT
                      Cumberland was ready to march home
                    after the rout, but I convinced him
                    we had to finish it.  We had to leave
                    a mark -- make sure the Jacobites
                    were wiped out.
                          (without pleasure)
                    We cut down every man in tartan we
                    could find.

                                      KEANE
                    If there was another way, you would
                    have found it.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Would I?  Or was I too full of hate
                    to look?

      Keane reacts to a distressed look from Rosemont's wife.

                                      KEANE
                    No more talk of the war.  It's over
                    and you're here.  Josephine prayed
                    for it every night.

      Rosemont turns to his wife.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Now you must have a new prayer,
                      Josephine.  Pray this victory holds. 
                    Pray those Highland bastards got the
                    message.
                            (determined)
                    I won't have my sons called to fight
                    this battle again.

      At this, their attention is caught by the happy SHOUTS of
      Michael as he runs by with a brightly colored kite bouncing
      behind him.

                                      MICHAEL
                    Father, Uncle Steven, look!

      Rosemont looks at his son with joy.

                                      KEANE
                    Very good, Michael!

      The little boy runs off, then turns back to his father.

                                      MICHAEL
                    Come, Father!

      Rosemont turns to Keane.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Walk with me.

      Rosemont and Keane follow Michael onto the grounds of the
      estate.


      Rosemont and Keane walk through a wooded area of the estate. 
      They walk along the path while Michael darts in and out of

      looming above him on horseback.  Haggard and bearded, his
      outfit stained with mud and blood, MacLeod has been on the

      desperate man.

                    No.  Stay.

      And off Keane's surprised look, MacLeod pulls a pistol and
      shoots Keane dead.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    My God!

      Rosemont kneels by his fallen friend.  He checks.  Keane is
      dead.  He looks up at MacLeod.

                    Please.  Don't hurt my son.

      MacLeod looks to him out of hate-darkened eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's what a thousand Scottish
                    mothers screamed when your soldiers
                    murdered their children.

      Rosemont is shaken.  This wild creature is like a nightmare
      come to life.

                    face me.

      There's a beat, then MacLeod shoves the child away from him
      in disgust.

      The boy staggers back, staring, but doesn't leave.  MacLeod
      turns on him, grinning, like the bogeyman.

                                      MACLEOD

      We are in the midst of a skirmish between a small knot of
      Scottish soldiers and their English counterparts.

      MacLeod comes across the bodies of the murdered Scot and his
      wife, hanging from a tree.

      He rides down the English Soldiers brutally, then sinks to
      his knees by the Scottish bodies, haunted and exhusted.

                    So what?  It happened 250 years ago!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda's got a big mouth.

                                      METHOS
                    She's worried about you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (hostile)
                    And you?

                                      METHOS
                          (a shrug)
                    Call it scholarly interest.  I just
                    came by to watch the perfect Immortal
                    die.

      MacLeod hasn't got the patience for Methos' needling.  He
      starts to move past him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm not.

                                      METHOS
                    Not going to die, or not perfect?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos, what do you want?

                                      METHOS
                    I want you to give yourself a break. 
                    I want you to admit you're human.
                          (before MacLeod can
                            answer)
                    Not to me.  To yourself.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Go away!

      MacLeod starts walking but Methos steps in his face.

                                      METHOS
                    None of us are perfect.  Not me, not
                    you, not even Darius.  And not, I'm
                    sure, your friend Steven Keane.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe you should write fortune
                    cookies.

                                      METHOS
                    Just so long as I'm not writing your
                    epitaph.
                          (beat)
                    What Keane hates you for happened. 
                    Nothing you can do will ever change
                    that.
                          (beat)
                    Accept it.  It's part of who you
                    were.
                          (beat)
                    It doesn't change who you are now.

      There's no way MacLeod can hear this from Methos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Are we still talking about me?

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.
                          (in MacLeod's face)
                    What happened after Culloden, MacLeod? 
                    Do you remember?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quiet)
                    I went after innocent men, and
                      slaughtered them.

                                      METHOS
                    That's how Keane tells it.  I want
                    to know how you remember it.
                          (pushing him)
                    They weren't innocent men then, were
                    they?  They were the murderers, the
                    English bastards who destroyed your
                    people.  They deserved to die.  All
                    of them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did they?

                                      METHOS
                          (no letup)
                    You thought so.  You wanted to kill,
                    and you killed.  And Keane's just
                    like you.  Dividing the world up
                    into Good and Evil.  Well it's not
                    that simple.  We're all good and
                    evil.  We feel rage and compassion. 
                    Love and hate.  Murder... and
                      forgiveness.

                    Try forgiving yourself, for once.

      A beat.  Once, this speech might have gotten through.  But
      now, there's too much history between the two men -- MacLeod
      is shutting Methos out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about you try minding your own
                    business, for once.  And tell Amanda
                    to do the same.

                                      METHOS
                    She can't say I didn't try.

      Methos takes a beat, then steps aside with a theatrical bow.

      As MacLeod walks by him, Methos steps in behind him and
        unexpectedly clubs him in the back of the head.

      MacLeod falls unconscious.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    You are such a pain in the ass.


      Steven Keane waits tensely by a marble fountain, scanning
      the area.  Ready for his appointment with MacLeod.

      He gets the BUZZ and turns to see

      METHOS

        approaching, sword in hand.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't think we've met.
                          (without hostility)
                    Steven Keane.

                                      METHOS
                    So I hear.

      He raises his sword in challenge.  Keane pulls his own
        defensively, but steps back.

                                      KEANE
                    I have no fight with you.

                                      METHOS
                    That's true.
                          (beat)
                    If you leave Paris and leave Duncan
                    MacLeod alone.

      Keane goes into a fighting stance at the mention of MacLeod.

                                      KEANE
                    Guy's got a lot of friends.

                                      METHOS
                    Good men often do.

                                      KEANE
                    A good man?  You must not know him
                    very well.

                                      METHOS
                    You'd be surprised.
                          (beat)
                    Leave him be, Keane.  You want to
                    rid the world of Evil, there are
                    better targets.

                                      KEANE
                    You try and stop me, I'll start with
                    you.

                                      METHOS
                    Your call.

      He makes the first strike and the fight is joined.

      Keane is good with a sword, no question about it.  As good
      as MacLeod, and as confident in his own abilities.  He varies
      his style, incorporating moves from different disciplines,
      parrying everything Methos comes at him with.

      But good as Keane is, he's just holding his own.  Every time
      he thinks he has a shot at Methos, Methos has a move of his
      own, dodging and defending.  It's a tough fight between men
      equally matched in ability and determination.

      Then, unexpectedly, Methos hits a slippery patch on the
      ground, stumbling, giving Keane a chance to press the attack. 
      Keane drives in close, ready to finish it --

      And finds a dagger buried in his gut.  The slip was a feint
      to draw him in, and he fell for it.

      As Keane sinks to his knees, he looks up at Methos.

                                      KEANE
                    You bastard.

                                      METHOS
                          (unapologetic)
                    Sticks and stones...

      Keane topples to the ground, "dead."  Methos raises his sword
      to take Keane's head and end it.  As he does, a BUZZ, and

      MACLEOD

      comes running up.  Pissed beyond belief.

      He skids to a stop, takes in the scene before him: Keane
      dead on the ground, Methos with his sword raised.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You do it, and I'm next.

      Methos looks at him in disbelief.

                                      METHOS
                    I am trying to save your head!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't need your help.
                          (no compromise)
                    Kill him, and you face me.
                          (off Methos' hesitation)
                    I swear it, Methos.

      Methos looks at MacLeod a beat.  Sees he isn't kidding. 
      Finally, he lowers his sword.

                                      METHOS
                    Fine.
                          (in disgust)
                    It's your funeral.

      He turns and goes, leaving MacLeod there with Keane's body.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod waits as Keane coughs back to life.  Almost before
      he knows where he is, Keane is scrambling to his knees,
      grabbing his sword, on the defensive.

      He sees MacLeod standing over him sword held loosely.

                                      KEANE
                    What happened to your friend?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with sarcasm)
                    It s Tuesday.  He remembered that he
                    doesn't take heads on Tuesday.

                                      KEANE
                    Then why didn't you take it?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because I don't want it.
                          (a beat, earnest)
                    Look we don't need to be enemies.

                                      KEANE
                    There's nothing else we can be.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You didn't see the women and children
                    butchered on Dunbar s orders.

                                      KEANE
                    Dunbar was a general in a hard war. 
                    People died.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And so did he.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't care what he did.  Only what
                    you did.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Culloden was a long time ago.

                                      KEANE,
                    A hundred years, a thousand, you
                    still have to pay for it.

                    I had a friend who said the same
                    thing to me once.  He was a great

      Keane and MacLeod stand fading each other.

                    I did what he wanted.  I let it go.

                    I heard later that Darius found you,

                          (beat)
                    I let myself believe that Sean was
                    right.  That you were a good man
                    who'd made a mistake.
                          (with barely checked
                            tears)
                    And then you killed him.

      MacLeod says nothing, the pain evident on his face he has no
      answer.

                                      KEANE (CONT'D)
                    What?  Nothing to say?  You going to
                    tell me he deserved it?  That he'd
                    done something dark and depraved to
                    you or yours.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quiet)
                    No.  He shouldn't have died.

                                      KEANE
                    Then tell me.  I can't wait to hear
                    it.
                          (all over him)
                    Tell me why the man who killed Sean
                    Burns is anything but a murdering
                    bastard who deserves to die.

      MacLeod is caught off guard by this, he doesn't have an answer --
      not anything that will satisfy Keane.

      (SCENE 41421 FROM "LEAP OF FAITH")

      The Dark MacLeod has come to Sean for help.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What about the Quickenings? If one
                    of us had... too many?

                                    SEAN
                    Could the evil overwhelm the good? 
                    I've spent years thinking about it. 
                    The truth is, I don't know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I do.

                                    SEAN
                    I see.
                          (beat)
                    Come, we'll talk inside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And when it happens?  Which one is
                    real?  The Immortal you were.... or
                    the one you've become?

      He's going over.  Face hardening.  He draws his sword.

                                    SEAN
                    I could fight you, Duncan, but you're
                    better.  I know it and so do you.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    But you're here because you want me
                    to help you.  I can't do that without
                    my head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That s too bad.

      MacLeod raises the blade --


                                      MACLEOD
                    It was a mistake.  I never meant for
                    it to happen.  I couldn't stop myself.

                                      KEANE
                    Sure.  What was it this time?  You
                    were drunk?  Drugged?  Temporarily
                    insane?
                          (with sarcasm)
                    Maybe you thought he was somebody
                    else?
                          (in disgust)
                    Maybe you just didn't care.

      MacLeod is losing patience with Keane's snide attitude.

                                      MACLEOD
                    it's hot that simple, Keane.
                          (pointed)
                    You weren't there.  You can't know.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't need to know.
                          (cold)
                    I don't judge your reasons, MacLeod. 
                    I judge your acts.

      He raises his blade, ready to fight.  MacLeod raises his in
      response, his expression going hard, putting aside doubt:

                                      MACLEOD
                          (as a last warning)
                    Walk away.

      Keane attacks.  They are interrupted by the WHOOPING of
      sirens.

      Two POLICE CARS approach.

      The two men slip their swords out of sight as the two cars
      screech to a halt and police pile out.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    Duncan MacLeod?

      MacLeod glances at Keane, did he set this up?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm Duncan MacLeod.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I'd like you to come with me, if you
                    don't mind.

      It's not a request.  As MacLeod gets into one of the police
      cars with the Inspector, he locks eyes with Keane -- this
      isn't over.


      To establish.



      Keane is getting out of his car when he gets the BUZZ.  He
      turns to see

      AMANDA

        approaching.

      Keane moves to meet her.

                                      KEANE
                    You want another shot? 
                          (without charm)
                    I warn you, I'll finish it if you
                    make me.

                                      AMANDA
                    I'm not here to fight.  I'm here to
                    talk.


      MacLeod comes up the fire escape and joins Keane on the roof. 
      There's a ceremonial moment as the two opponents face each
      other.

                                      KEANE
                    I've waited a long time for this.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe we both have.

      Keane is the first to attack, closing in on MacLeod with a
      series of rapid feints.

      MacLeod guards against Keane's dancing blade, eyes locked on
      his opponent, waiting for him to commit himself.

      Keane lunges and MacLeod dodges to one side, slashing at
      Keane as he goes past, just grazing him.

      Keane goes on the defensive, blood oozing from the cut.  He
      and MacLeod lunge and parry across the rooftop.

      MACLEOD

      is backing toward the roof's edge, blocking Keane's strikes. 
      He's running out of room.

      He tries a sideways dodge to get away from the edge, but
      Keane anticipates him, cuts hard --

      MACLEOD'S SWORD

      goes spinning off the roof.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 48. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

      ON MACLEOD

      There's no time to panic, only time to react.  Keane rushes
      at him, sword raised to kill.  MacLeod drops to the ground,
      trips Keane, and shoves him from behind, sending him over
      the edge.

      KEANE

      falls the the alley below.


      As MacLeod comes running down from the roof.


      MacLeod scoops up his fallen sword from the ground even as

      KEANE

      staggers to his feet, still hurting from the fall, but not
      giving up.

      He rushes at MacLeod without grace, but with deadly
      determination.  MacLeod barely blocks the blow, and their
      swords lock.

      For a moment it's a struggle of muscle and will, bicep against
      bicep.  Then, with a grunt of exertion, MacLeod overpowers
      Keane.  Keane's sword bounces from his hand and Keane goes
      to his knees, disarmed and exhausted.

      MACLEOD

      raises the katana over his head.  He can end this here.

      But he doesn't.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not this time.

      He reaches down, grabs Keane by the lapels, hauls him to his
      feet, so they're face to face.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let it go.
                          (beat)
                    The war is over.

      He lets Keane drop and, without looking back, strides away.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
