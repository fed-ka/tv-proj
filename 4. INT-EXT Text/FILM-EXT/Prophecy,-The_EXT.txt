It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A
place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting
fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad
drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure
enters.
Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he
pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the
flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican
radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor,
catches his gaze.
There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated
figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the
window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch,
on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.
DISSOLVE TO:
Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve
the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle
perched on the railing. Watching the window.
The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's
movement behind the window.
The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up
to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.
BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW
Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's
been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a
tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets
on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary
column.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body
stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it
EXPLODES into fragments.
The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon
spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two
STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the
back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his
locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING
Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.
The two, across the room for each other, pause.
GARGOYLE
Where is it?
Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now
walking slow circles around each other.
SIMON
Leave me alone.
GARGOYLE
You've found it, haven't you?
SIMON
Fuck you.
The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon,
who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.
The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's
leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon
up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging
his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first
plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even
further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --
-- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over
and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one
side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around
and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame
and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a
shard of glass through his neck.
Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's
sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing
his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the
gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.
The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-
eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.
Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.
The gargoyle's a wreck.
But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every
inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his
feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to
stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-
speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.
The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into
a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly,
bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's
windshield.
THREE FLOORS ABOVE
Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at
the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own
shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing
is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks
that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of
his nose.
At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly
finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an
oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage
beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.
DISSOLVE TO:
The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.
A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being
photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police
investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The
usual.
A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET,
thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple
of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting
to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.
THOMAS DAGGET
Hey.
BURROWS
Hey.
DAGGETT
(looks up at sky)
Thought those clouds this morning
spelled rain for sure, but it's turned
into a beautiful day, wouldn't you
say, Sergeant Burrows?
Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath. Burrows just stares at
him.
BURROWS
I warned you about that cheerful
shit.
DAGGETT
Sorry. I'm working on it.
He eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle.
DAGGETT
What's the word?
BURROWS
Friend here did a half-gainer with a
firebird tuck from the third floor.
DAGGETT
Jumper?
BURROWS
Not unless he decided not to bother
opening the window first.
DAGGETT
Drugs? Alcohol?
BURROWS
Well, he wasn't exactly in a condition
to walk a chalk line when we got
here. You're welcome to try and smell
his breath if you like, that is if
you can find the mouth.
DAGGETT
Ghouls been by?
BURROWS
On their way. Willie promises a white
paper tomorrow. Or Wednesday,
depending on his golf game.
DAGGETT
Firebird driver?
Burrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man
sitting on the curb.
BURROWS
Mr. Jiminez. Was taking a short cut
to his job at a packing plant on San
Pedro. First thing he remembers about
the deceased is several vital organs
bouncing off his windshield.
DAGGETT
Have you had him walk a chalk line?
BURROWS
He's straight. Shook up some.
DAGGETT
(looking at gargoyle)
Anything on him?
BURROWS
No wallet, license, nothing. He is
missing one or two things, though.
DAGGETT
Like?
BURROWS
His eyes.
DAGGETT
(looking at tangled
mess)
Along with everything else.
BURROWS
We've found everything else -- and
what fun that was, let me tell you --
but the eyes are still AWOL. Might
just be stuck in the radiator grill.
Little weird though.
DAGGETT
What?
BURROWS
Both popping out together like that.
Worth a page in my scrapbook.
Here, outside The Town, horizons are distant, faraway things.
The sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning
as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open.
It's Katherine, the teacher. Wearing levis and boots, she
carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral
behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies
impatiently.
KATHERINE
In a minute, in a minute...
Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it
down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs,
begins to heat up the sky.
Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone
walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A
tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked
sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from
anything but the approach of galloping hooves.
Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the
clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls.
Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their
hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.
Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind-
cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain
lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient
buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high
on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen,
staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as
Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of
the canyon, and onto the main plateau.
ON THE PLATEAU
Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots.
She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some
old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand,
greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.
There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered
school bus rattles its way past and stops. The bus driver, a
Navaho, JOHN, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head
painfully walks up to Katherine.
JOHN
You could save my life with some
coffee.
He holds out an empty cup Katherine fills. Sipping painfully,
he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball
cap over his eyes.
KATHERINE
Tough night?
JOHN
You don't want to hear about it.
(peeks out hopefully)
Or maybe you do.
KATHERINE
No thanks.
JOHN
Just checking.
The bus is full of young school kids.
KATHERINE
Shouldn't they be getting to school?
JOHN
Impromptu field trip. I'm broadening
their minds. And sparing them the
sight of their beloved chauffeur
barfing his guts out.
Katherine's horse snorts.
JOHN
I hate horses. How was the canyon?
Honey-suckle out yet?
KATHERINE
Didn't see any.
JOHN
I hate that canyon. I hate this this
whole plateau. Too many goddamn
ghosts. Leave it to them I say. San
Diego, that's where I'm going. Or
Oxnard. I like the sound of that. Ox-
nard.
KATHERINE
I'm happy here.
JOHN
Oh lord protect us, another romantic
pale face in love with the desert.
KATHERINE
Just got to give it a chance.
JOHN
Try growing up here.
(tries word out on
tongue)
Ox-nard.
(sticks out coffee
cup)
Uno mas, see-boo-play.
(she pours)
Speaking of romantic pale faces, the
rumor mill is in high gear again.
KATHERINE
Who this time?
JOHN
That funny looking guy from Window
Rock. The BIA lawyer.
KATHERINE
(non-committal)
Huh.
JOHN
No! Say it isn't so!
KATHERINE
It isn't so.
JOHN
Thank you.
He finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet.
JOHN
Thanks for the joe.
KATHERINE
No prob.
JOHN
You're a credit to the community.
He shuffles back to the bus.
JOHN
All right children, looks sharp!
This is a school day! And no talking
loud!
The bus coughs alive and crawls forward. Katherine waves to
the faces behind glass, then settles back for a last moment
of peace as silence lays again over the land.
Showered and changed into her teaching clothes, Katherine
climbs into a rattling pickup.
Katherine drives to work, passing on the outskirts the closed
copper mine, vast and abandoned. Down beyond the fading main
street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school.
Katherine parks her truck, grabs her leather bag, and walks
in.
DISSOLVE TO:
Katherine's lecturing her students. All twenty-five of them.
There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls
on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being
taught together in one room.
It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on
her lap.
KATHERINE
This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus
was a herbavore, which meant he only
ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly
to himself and never bothered anyone.
The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine
holds up another bone fragment.
KATHERINE
This is a leg fragment that belongs
to the killer of the plateau,
Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious
carnivore, which meant he'd eat
anything that moved, especially nice,
juicy Camposaurs.
The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.
KATHERINE
Both these guys lived together right
here on the White Rock plateau eighty
million years ago, when this area
used to be on the banks of a huge,
shallow sea. Remember how we talked
about how sedimentation fossilizes
bones? That's also what made the
hills out behind our town and put
the copper in the ground.
HIGH SCHOOL KID
Lot of good that did us.
Katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter
and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at
the dino bone.
BOY
It's radioactive! Like Godzilla!
KATHERINE
Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know
why? Uranium, that's the rock they
use in nuclear power plants --
BOY
And bombs!
KATHERINE
And bombs Alex, yes, is all through
these hills naturally. Millions of
years ago the dinosaurs here ate
plants and drank water which had
uranium in it that became concentrated
in their bones, which is exactly
how, with Mr. Geiger counter here,
we're going to find some.
The class CHEERS.
With the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's
class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind
the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with
the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a
shoving match with a little girl.
KATHERINE
(coming between them)
-- Hey. Come on. What's the deal,
Brian?
The girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed,
embarrassed.
BRIAN
She...
KATHERINE
Yes?
BRIAN
...She, she called me a "Dick Head".
KATHERINE
Sandra?
SANDRA
Well, he is.
KATHERINE
All right, Brian. You get one free
insult. Make it good.
Brian concentrates.
PAUL
You... You're a... Cow Demon!
KATHERINE
(beat)
Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied?
(looks at Brian)
Cow Demon?
UP ON THE HILL
Katherine's given the geiger counter to the little Navaho
girl, Mary. Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her,
Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it
begins clicking softly.
MARY
I got one! I got one!
The high school kids come up and help dig.
KATHERINE
Easy... Easy... Don't break it.
Almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust.
As the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine
looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up
onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her.
DISSOLVE TO:
The alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old,
convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse.
It's lunch break. Most of the students sit in loose cliques
around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope,
picking fights.
INSIDE
The recently unearthed skull sits on Katherine's desk. Feet
up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a
dinosaur book. One of her students, a twelve year old boy,
finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.
BOY
I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss
Henley.
KATHERINE
Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.
BOY
(looking at book over
her shoulder)
Find out what it is, yet?
KATHERINE
Well, it's either a 44 million year
old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr.
Sorenson lost last winter.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Slowly, he lets his weight rest against Katherine's shoulder.
She smiles good naturedly up at him.
KATHERINE
Go eat your lunch, Jason.
The boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up, almost
relieved.
BOY
Sure, Miss Henley. Thanks. See ya.
Katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to
the book.
AROUND THE BACK OF THE BUILDING
On the abandoned back stairs, a couple of Mexican boys sit
smoking cigarettes. They whistle and kid with the four young
girls that pass them going up the steps.
UPSTAIRS
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. The four
girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably
half the fun. They run through the crumbling halls, giggling
and hiding from one another. Their cries, the smack of their
shoes, echo off off the peeling halls.
One of them is Mary, running down a hall, banging a stick
with another girl. At a corner Mary peels off from her friend,
runs down a new hall, turns a corner,
And comes on Simon. He's still curled where we last saw him,
in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. The two
stare at one another. Finally,
MARY
Hi.
SIMON
Hi.
MARY
What's your name?
SIMON
Simon.
MARY
You don't look so good, Simon.
SIMON
No, I don't.
MARY
I'm Mary.
SIMON
Hello Mary.
MARY
Does Miss Henley know you're here?
SIMON
No one does, Mary. Can we keep it
just our secret. For a little while?
Mary thinks.
MARY
Okay.
You can hear her friends coming closer.
MARY
I have to go.
SIMON
It was nice meeting you, Mary.
Mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.
MARY
Are you hungry? I could bring
something.
SIMON
That would be very nice.
MARY
Okay. Bye.
She smiles and runs down the hall. Simon grits his teeth,
turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long
day.
DISSOLVE TO:
An old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco,
now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young
man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking
down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's
stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.
THE APARTMENT INSIDE
Hasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the
occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the
floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem
to register his visitor.
GABRIEL
Gee Jerry, you look like shit.
The eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face
eaten with dried sores.
JERRY
Leave me alone, Gabriel.
GABRIEL
Soon, pal. Soon.
Gabriel drops into the chair across from Jerry and pushes
aside with distaste the maggot-ridden plates of food piled
on the table. He reaches his hand out to Jerry.
GABRIEL
Come here.
JERRY
Go away.
GABRIEL
(sing-song, like to a
baby)
Come here...
Gabriel puts his hand under Jerry's chin and turns the face
side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy
eyes.
GABRIEL
Hmmm. Still a little life left in
you. Barely.
JERRY
Fuck you.
Gabriel releases Jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair.
GABRIEL
There's something I want you to do
for me.
JERRY
What a surprise.
GABRIEL
Don't be that way.
JERRY
I just want to... Why won't you let
me...
GABRIEL
I will, I will. Promise.
A dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of
Jerry's pant leg.
GABRIEL
You need some new clothes, son.
A tear wells in Jerry's decomposing face.
GABRIEL
Aw come on, don't start. You know
how I hate that...
JERRY
I'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired.
GABRIEL
Watch the profanity. -- Just one
more favor. Honest.
JERRY
(deep sigh)
What?
GABRIEL
I want you to get something for me.
A few personal effects the cops ripped
off from the lovely Allenwood Arms
on Seventh Street. It'll be sitting
in their property room down on San
Julian.
JERRY
I'm supposed to just go in there?
Like this?
GABRIEL
Give you a bath, put on some decent
clothes,
(beat)
Maybe a very large brim hat, you'll
be fine. Just go in between five and
five-ten, it's a shift change and
nobody'll notice you.
JERRY
How do you know?
GABRIEL
(cocks an eye)
C'mon.
(tosses yellow ID
card onto table)
This should be more or less up to
date.
JERRY
Got a name this stuff is under?
GABRIEL
John Doe.
JERRY
Why doesn't that surprise me.
Gabriel gets up, pats Jerry on the head, and walks to the
door.
GABRIEL
I'll see you tonight.
(flips him silver
dollar)
Here's some bus fare.
CUT TO:
The SLAM of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of
an indoor court. It ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back
glass partition, and is SLAMMED again. Four players, including
Thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. It's
brutal. Shoulders and knees bang off one another.
One of the players falls back, yells to Thomas.
PLAYER
Cover me! Cover me!
Thomas dives into position to make the save, recovers, and
yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner.
DAGGETT
Pop it up!
The player SLAMS it brutally at Thomas, who misses miserably.
DAGGETT
Thanks a lot.
Another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around
Thomas.
PLAYER #2
You're missing the point of the game,
Thomas. You must absolutely trust no
one. Form alliances, but break them.
Lure another to trust you, then betray
him! You play with too much honor.
Sink to the gutter. Use people. Lie
and double-cross them.
Player #2 tosses the ball to Thomas, who serves, and the
scuffling is back on. Shouts to one another. Promises of
support.
PLAYER #2
Come on Thomas, let's take out Sam
together!
Thomas and Player #2 team up on a third player, pressing him
hard. Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and
drives against Player #2. The about-face is too abrupt for
him and Player #2 is eliminated in a double-cross. He smiles
proudly at Thomas.
PLAYER #2
Magnificent decadence.
Thomas walks Bill out to his car.
BILL
So when are you going to get a real
job?
DAGGETT
You mean with the Church?
BILL
You almost did it once. I never saw
a seminary student more called to
the collar than you. Why didn't you
ever become ordained?
DAGGETT
It's a long story.
BILL
You'll have to tell it to me sometime.
DAGGETT
Sometime.
The building is squat and brick. A non-descrip warehouse
that subs as a police evidence storage area.
The sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large-
brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very
well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed
flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He
shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that
gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind
shiny wet footprints like a snail.
There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's
shrunken claws pull it open.
INSIDE
Is a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All
of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and
million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's
all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives
forgotten.
Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works
his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets
looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the
third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box
and walks out.
Katherine drives Mary home, a dusty, tired mobile home slumped
among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town.
On an utterly lonely blacktop, Gabriel shoots by in his top-
down rambler, insignificant in the night's vastness. Jerry's
in the back, feet up on the seat.
JERRY
Why do you need me? I can hardly
walk now.
GABRIEL
Some things are human work, son.
Live or dead, human work. Besides, I
like you.
JERRY
Lucky moi.
Gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler
to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is
instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs
out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled
among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The
Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles.
GABRIEL
I can always smell a graveyard.
Two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in
the dust nearby.
On a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking
headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim
Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked
General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the
headstone over the grave like a winged creature.
JERRY
I hope you're enjoying this.
GABRIEL
I always enjoy watching you work,
Jerry.
JERRY
How did I ever get you in my life?
GABRIEL
Come on, you didn't really want to
kill yourself.
JERRY
But I did it, didn't I? I did kill
myself.
GABRIEL
Well, yes. Technically.
JERRY
And you're just keeping me alive.
GABRIEL
Letting you die slower.
JERRY
I'm so in your debt.
GABRIEL
Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.
Jerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away
the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry
removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel,
pries open the lid.
It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning.
His medals flash in the moonlight.
JERRY
Not much to look at.
GABRIEL
Ah, but it's not what's on the outside
that matters --
Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.
GABRIEL
-- It's what's on the inside.
Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's
forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He
gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens
up.
GABRIEL
(upset)
It's not here.
Gabriel frantically look in the ears. Up the nose.
GABRIEL
It's not here!
JERRY
Oooh, bad news for the war effort.
GABRIEL
(spins wildly on him)
Shut up!!
Gabriel BANGS the coffin lid in frustration. Tries to think.
GABRIEL
Now, if you were a soul, where would
you hide?
JERRY
The hell away from you.
Silent and dead at this hour. Gabriel's boots creak on the
floorboards of the 19th century plank sidewalks. He taps his
finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows.
GABRIEL
Boy, what a dump, huh?
Jerry, limping on a foot that's caving in on itself, wiping
the spinal fluid out of his dead eye, shuffles along behind.
Gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk, grabs a parking meter
and swings himself playfully around.
GABRIEL
Why can't this shit ever go down in
Miami? Or Bora Bora? I feel like
I've spent my whole damn stay in gin
swills like this.
JERRY
Life's a bitch.
Gabriel suddenly freezes. He sticks his nose up, sniffs like
a coyote, then abruptly drops to the ground in a push-up and
smells the dirt. Tastes it with his tongue. Smiles.
GABRIEL
Well well...
The skies above lighten and smear blue and red.
KATHERINE
Finishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and
crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up.
Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through
town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at
the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.
Katherine pulls-up and parks.
INSIDE
Mary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her
grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands
beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch
that he passes slowly back and forth.
KATHERINE
(to grandmother)
How is she?
GRANDMOTHER
Same.
KATHERINE
Did the doctor come by?
GRANDMOTHER
He found nothing. But something is
in her. I know. Something the
Belagaana doctor can't see. The night
people have been around two days
now. It is a warning.
(nods to Navaho man)
So we have called the hand trembler.
To find if she must have an Enemy
Ghost Way.
The old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back
and forth across Mary's body.
Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty
yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare
of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels
it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine
turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of
her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
And winged.
CUT TO:
A huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert
highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one-
horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car
checking a map.
CUT TO:
Small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the
front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department:
SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF.
INSIDE
The Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal,
with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems
newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours
a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he
looks like Barry Goldwater.
SHERIFF
And to what do I owe the thrill of a
visit from a So Cal homicide cop?
He hands the coffee to Thomas, sitting in a chair beside his
solid oak desk.
DAGGETT
Run of of the mill psycho killer
body dismemberment on our end. The
usual.
SHERIFF
Lovely place, Los Angeles.
DAGGETT
Got a lead I wanted to run down
Chimney Rock way. Thought I'd do the
courtesy of telling you first.
SHERIFF
Big of you.
DAGGETT
You're welcome to put a babysitter
on me if you like.
The Sheriff smiles.
SHERIFF
Son, this is the third biggest county
in the country, not even counting
the 25,000 square mile Indian
reservation right next door, and
I've got fewer men than just one of
your little palm tree precincts to
cover all of it. 'Fraid the only
help you're gonna get from me, short
of another shoot out at the OK Corral,
is that cup of coffee in your hand.
A middle-aged secretary enters with
a stack of paper.
SECRETARY
Here's the last week's watch reports.
She hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas.
He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The
secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff.
SECRETARY
Bobby just called this in from Chimney
Rock.
Thomas perks at The Town's name.
SHERIFF
(to Thomas)
Sent a car up there this morning.
Teacher complained some vagrant was
sleeping in her schoolhouse.
The Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads
further.
SHERIFF
(to secretary)
Damn it, get Bobby on the phone,
Clarice. What the hell is this suppose
to be?
DAGGETT
(re report)
May I?
The Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words
like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the
name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the
Sheriff's hand.
DAGGETT
Thanks for the coffee.
SHERIFF
(as Thomas turns to
leave)
Small piece of advice, Lt. Dagget,
that I give free of charge to all
visiting big city policemen: It's
wild country up there. Always has
been, always will be. You come across
anything that snarls, you call me
first, hear?
DAGGETT
I never turn down advice, Sheriff.
Especially when it's free.
DISSOLVE TO:
Thomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land.
FAR ON THE HORIZON
A small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the
earth. The Town.
A former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron.
Couples drift off the building's porch and into the street
to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. John
leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper
bag, and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the
street. He passes the bag to Katherine and Thomas.
JOHN
So how's our star pupil feeling today?
KATHERINE
Mary? The school doctor came by.
Declared it "Non-specific
gastrointestinal disorder".
JOHN
Latin for "I don't have the slightest
fucking idea".
DAGGETT
Will she be able to talk with me?
KATHERINE
That's up to her.
(to John)
Mary's grandmother called a hand
trembler.
JOHN
Uh oh. Hocus pocus time.
DAGGETT
Is that serious?
JOHN
Depends what the hand trembler says.
People call them in when they think
a witch or a Yei is trying to sprinkle
corpse sickness in their hogan, or
if the Night People have been hanging
around too much. Night people screw
around a lot, but they're good at
warning of evil ghosts.
DAGGETT
Who are the Night People?
JOHN
They come as coyotes.
Thomas sits in the truck's bed as they Katherine drives
through town. John, on the near side of royally toasted, has
his boot stuck out the passenger window. Thomas looks up at
the night sky. At its blaze of stars.
DAGGETT
Beautiful stars out here.
John drinks again from his bottle, rests his head on the
open window and looks out.
JOHN
Too much fucking sky in the desert.
It pushes on you.
(sighs)
Sometimes I wonder if anyone in heaven
even knows this place is here...
Katherine pulls up to drop Thomas off.
DAGGETT
Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at
noon? At the little girl's house?
KATHERINE
First trailer on the highway past
town.
Thomas climbs out.
KATHERINE
I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you
don't seem very like a police officer
to me.
DAGGETT
That's what my bosses keep saying.
KATHERINE
I meant it as a compliment.
DAGGETT
So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley.
KATHERINE
Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles.
DISSOLVE TO:
Thomas lying in his hotel bed, flinching through a dream-
filled sleep.
There's glimpses of shattered images: War. Death. And a small,
dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling.
Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is
something dark and winged.
DISSOLVE TO:
The honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of
The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century
miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a
trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets,
junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end
of town.
As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of
her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center,
talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby.
Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to
put his fingers.
GABRIEL
...There, and there. Now pucker your
lips... aim it that way, and just
blow a little bit, this is a special
trumpet.
The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear
note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of
the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.
GABRIEL
Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here,
have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.
As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down
into it. Looking for something...
GABRIEL
Who's next?
Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg
for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second
grade friends, and puts her on his knee.
GABRIEL
And who are you?
SANDRA
Sandra.
She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.
GABRIEL
And did you see the man upstairs,
Sandra?
SANDRA
A little.
GABRIEL
Did you talk to him?
SANDRA
No.
GABRIEL
And who did, Sandra. Who talked to
the man?
SANDRA
Mary.
GABRIEL
And where is Mary, Sandra?
SANDRA
She isn't here. She's sick.
GABRIEL
You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra.
Here, let me see...
He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her
mouth, and gazes in.
Katherine enters the circle.
KATHERINE
What the hell do you think you're
doing?
Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.
GABRIEL
Just talking to the kids, Ma'am.
KATHERINE
Get off his knee, Sandra. Everyone
else, go inside. Now.
The kids reluctantly shuffle off.
BRIAN
'Bye, Gabriel.
GABRIEL
See ya, kids. Be sure to study your
math.
He has the same sunglasses as Simon. The same cold, creepy
air about him.
KATHERINE
Who are you?
GABRIEL
It's a long story.
Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky
red glop that starts running out of his nose.
GABRIEL
Ignore him.
JERRY
Everyone else does.
KATHERINE
I don't know what the hell is going
on, but you both better get out of
here. Right now.
GABRIEL
You're right...
He climbs to his feet and stands close to her.
GABRIEL
...You have no idea what's going on.
He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls
about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he
climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine
watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school
janitor.
KATHERINE
Al! Keep an eye on the children for
me. I'll be right back. And call the
sheriff.
JANITOR
Sheriff? What the hell do I tell
him?
KATHERINE
Just call.
Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.
Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe
of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked
near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.
EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY
As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing
out of his own car.
KATHERINE
You weren't suppose to be here till
noon.
DAGGETT
You're a little early yourself.
KATHERINE
I wanted to check on her.
DAGGETT
That makes two of us.
CUT TO:
On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a
wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are
seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the
little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.
KATHERINE
How are you feeling, pumpkin?
MARY
Better.
KATHERINE
This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like
to ask you some questions. You don't
have to answer if you don't want to.
MARY
It's okay.
There's a dreamy, far-away look in Mary's eyes. It worries
Katherine.
DAGGETT
Mary, when you talked to man up in
the building --
MARY
-- Simon.
DAGGETT
Yes, Simon. What did Simon say?
MARY
(smiles)
That's funny. "Simon says".
DAGGETT
Right. Like the game.
MARY
I'm good at it. I'm very clever.
DAGGETT
We'll have to play together sometime.
MARY
Simon even said so. He also asked if
I could keep a secret.
DAGGETT
And what was that?
MARY
Something he gave me.
KATHERINE
What, pumpkin?
MARY
Then it wouldn't be a secret.
DAGGETT
You're a good friend not to tell,
Mary. But I'm a friend of Simon's
too. So if you ever want to tell,
you can to me. Okay?
MARY
It's a secret...
Mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes.
MARY
...But sometimes it hurts.
Thomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise
again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old
voice:
MARY
Have you ever killed a chinaman?
DAGGETT
No Mary, I haven't.
MARY
They don't bleed. Not the way you
and I do. Or maybe it was just the
cold...
Thomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as
confused as him.
MARY
I've killed them, you know. Lots.
You could always tell when they were
coming. There'd be the trumpets first.
Every note flat. Then those songs...
After that they'd charge. Right down
through the snow. The guns would
freeze and it would be just knives...
It was so cold and there were so
many of them. But I was smarter than
they were. Even at Chosin, I was
smarter...
Mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind
of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a
sob.
MARY
It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate
it. Please, make it stop!
She buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing.
MARY
Make it stop!
KATHERINE
(rocking her)
It's okay... It's okay...
Mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer,
into the arms of her grandmother.
KATHERINE
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --
GRANDMOTHER
It's all right, Miss Henley. We know
you love Mary...
KATHERINE
What are we going to do?
GRANDMOTHER
She's going to have the Enemy Ghost
Way. We leave this afternoon.
The grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer.
DAGGETT
Where will they do the ceremony?
KATHERINE
In the home village. The Hand Trembler
must have found corpse sickness...
DAGGETT
They're taking her away? Shouldn't
she see a doctor?
KATHERINE
She's already seen a doctor.
(then, under her breath)
That son of a bitch...
DAGGETT
Who?
KATHERINE
Gabriel the children called him. The
little shit was hanging around my
kids this morning asking about Mary.
He and his buddy make a real pair.
DAGGETT
Maybe it's time I checked out Mr.
Gabriel.
Katherine turns from trailer and looks at him.
KATHERINE
I know where he parks his car.
Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel
entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair
the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side,
squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.
KATHERINE
What... What was that? Hell?
DAGGETT
...No. The voices. They were screaming
and fighting over... theology. They
don't sweat much about that in hell.
But they do in... heaven.
He squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands.
DAGGETT
The son of a bitch. He carries it
around with him like a photo album.
A big, greasy cloud wherever he goes.
They all do.
KATHERINE
How can that be heaven? Jesus Christ.
How? I don't even believe in heaven.
The tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts
at the endless sky above them.
KATHERINE
You dumb fucking assholes! How could
you have done that!
DAGGETT
That extra chapter by St. John was
right. It's a war... Just like the
first one. Just like when the angel
Michael beat Lucifer and cast him
out. Only now they've turned on each
other... Turned on each other in a
civil war over theology.
He laughs hopelessly at the insanity of it all.
DAGGETT
Oh sweet God, theology.
(sighs)
"God's wild bunch".
(shouts)
God's morons!
KATHERINE
How do you know know so much about
that?
DAGGETT
I just know.
(shakes his head)
Yes folks, the good news is that
there's life after death in heaven.
The bad news is that it's as screwed
up as here.
KATHERINE
They were like us.
DAGGETT
They are us. Aborted children. And
they need us. They need our corrupt,
dark souls for their fight. They
need...
KATHERINE
...Mary.
Katherine climbs abruptly to her feet and walks for the car.
DAGGETT
What are you doing?
KATHERINE
I don't know what this is. I don't
know what I believe. I don't know if
my sanity is lying back in that cave
flopping around waiting for me. But
I know one thing. Those... Those
things aren't taking her!
Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper
mine, it slows down at a junction.
And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the
sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.
Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads
away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.
A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the
weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as
the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup.
Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another
handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.
There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot
from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas
crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches
in some numbers.
TELEPHONE VOICE
County Coroner's office, Assistant
Coroner Raphael speaking.
DAGGETT
Willie?
VOICE
Tom?
DAGGETT
You weren't crazy, man.
And Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for
the first time notices the church it's attached to.
Katherine stands there in the chilly darkness outside the
kiva. Mary's grandmother, passing with some other women,
pauses and squeezes Katherine's arm.
GRANDMOTHER
Now we sleep, Katherine. Tomorrow,
after dark, we begin again.
INSIDE THE KIVA
The fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now
empty room.
OUTSIDE
Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up
her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing
beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind.
It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.
VOICE
Hello, Katherine.
Like the wind, it is low and thin and hoarse. Like the wind
it seems to come from everywhere. And, like the wind, it is
utterly without pity or remorse.
Katherine turns.
Perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure
clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are
hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head,
but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. There are endless
scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are
the eyes.
Katherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria
rising in her throat.
KATHERINE
Oh Lord, I can't do this. I can't do
this anymore...
FIGURE
We must talk, Katherine.
It's takes all her strength to look upon him.
KATHERINE
You're... You're...
(tries to form the
word)
...God?
FIGURE
God is love, Katherine.
The eyes narrow. Rippling pools of unfathomable evil.
FIGURE
-- I don't love you.
There's a crouched silhouette beside the figure. Dimmer.
Skinny. A wheezing sycophant. An afterthought.
Katherine backs away from both of them.
KATHERINE
I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go
away.
FIGURE
I can kill you, Katherine. I can lay
you out and fill your mouth with
your mother's feces. Or I can talk
with you.
Katherine stops. Faces him.
FIGURE
I am here, before you, in a form to
put you at ease.
KATHERINE
Good job.
The sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under
its cloak.
FIGURE
I rarely do this in person. I am,
perhaps, somewhat out of touch.
KATHERINE
Are you one of them?
FIGURE
No.
KATHERINE
You're not an angel?
FIGURE
Oh, I am an angel. A very special
one. The first. The oldest. The naive
eagle scout, he once loved me above
all others, and I him. It was the
only true love for either of us, but
like all true love, it couldn't
possibly last.
The figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them.
The movement makes a liquid, snapping sound.
FIGURE
The winged party boys will come,
Katherine. They'll come to feed on
the guts of your little Mary.
KATHERINE
What do you care?
FIGURE
I have my interests...
He turns back to her.
FIGURE
The naive eagle scout, he has his
interests too. He even has a place
for them, as I do for mine. Big,
shiny place. You'd like it. Only
it's been empty for a long time.
Can't open till after the
resurrection. The problem's with the
hired help. Always had problems with
the hired help. They're arrogant,
boastful little pricks. Not like me.
What I did I did for love. But they,
the winged party boys, even before
the park could open for its first
customer, they started fighting over
the popcorn stand.
The figure shifts his perch on the wall.
FIGURE
You see, Katherine, heaven can't
start accepting guests till this
fight is settled. And without people,
there is no heaven. All those good
and true souls left mouldering in
the ground clutching their H-tickets
and waiting and waiting and waiting...
Some, lying down there with the worms
century after century, they start to
get doubts about the whole program.
That's when, out of sheer boredom,
some of them come to me. Because I'm
always open for business. 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Even on
Christmas.
The figure's face darkens.
FIGURE
Some of the angels cheat. They sneak
a few souls in to help with the fight.
The really dark ones. And now one of
them has found a special soul so
wonderfully sick that it might just
win it for them. And if one side
wins, even the wrong one, then there's
no fight. And if there's no fight,
there can be a heaven.
KATHERINE
And if there's a heaven?
FIGURE
I'd be very unhappy.
(beat)
I am here to help you and the little
bitch not because I love you, not
because I care about you, but because
I want this war to go on and on and
on.
The figure straightens up, stretching its spine.
FIGURE
I bring you the chance to save your
Mary, Katherine. And along the way,
stop the resurrection.
KATHERINE
How?
FIGURE
Listen when I speak. Now go to bed,
Katherine. Tomorrow, I promise you,
is a big day.
Thomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins
fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby
rooftop.
DAGGETT
You could always lend a hand.
Lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that
hideous mouth.
INSIDE THE KIVA
Grey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary
is prepared with paint and oils.
OUTSIDE
Katherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the
horizon.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls
unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have
been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants
of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.
Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into
shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears
a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it
can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.
KATHERINE
He's coming.
Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one
of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.
DAGGETT
Is there any way to speed this up?
VILLAGER
No.
A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking
smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants
to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing
sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in
guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out
of the child.
DAGGETT
Lock the door.
He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.
DAGGETT
Stay inside. It's only one round, so
make it count.
There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches
his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the
kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks
out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.
Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel
roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the
butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving
the land a deathly bluish grey.
The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel
can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the
rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the
blonde on the knee.
GABRIEL
You'll like this, Rachael.
Maybe not.
There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas
at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it
over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the
brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car
STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield
into the dust.
Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron
bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he
cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.
GABRIEL
(breathless)
Nice move.
Thomas's feet crunch softly closer.
GABRIEL
You ought to come work for us.
Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian
in now and then, you know. You'd
like it. Nobody tells you when to go
to bed, can eat all the ice cream
you want. And you get to kill. All
day and all night. Just like an angel.
Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he
carefully steps closer and closer.
GABRIEL
Save yourself, friend. Why go to the
wall with the bitch and her rug rat?
It'll all turn out the same anyway.
Here or in heaven, we're still gonna
tear the kid apart.
DAGGETT
I'm not an angel, heaven or hell.
I'm a man you eyeless puke, which
means I have one thing you never
will. A soul. And though I may,
somewhere inside, believe in a God,
I will never, never, believe in you.
GABRIEL
A little speechy today, aren't we?
(sighs)
Okay pal, have it your way.
Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas,
sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying
as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but
Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest.
Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.
GABRIEL
This is going to really, really hurt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
DAGGETT
...You -- your war...
Gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.
GABRIEL
C'mon, son, out with it. Make this
one count.
DAGGETT
Your war's a lie!
GABRIEL
(pauses)
What?
DAGGETT
Running around acting like this is
really about whether Christ is just
the son of God or if he is God.
Bullshit! That's not what this is
about at all, is it?
GABRIEL
You're wrong.
DAGGETT
Then prove it to me, Gabriel. I
studied three fucking years of
theology before I picked up a gun.
C'mon, you're chief goddamn angel,
I'm just a little man. Prove to me
Christ is just a son and less than
God. Prove it!
Gabriel hesitates.
GABRIEL
I don't have to.
DAGGETT
Because you can't! Because this war
isn't about some obscure medieval
hangup. You're just jealous.
GABRIEL
You're wrong!
DAGGETT
Try me, Gabriel. Go on. Prove to me
the temporal nature of the Trinity.
Show me through logic how the Son of
the Word can be separated from the
Father. Fight me with philosophy,
Gabriel!
GABRIEL
No!
DAGGETT
Because you and your army are wrong!
And you know it. You knew it sixteen
centuries ago.
GABRIEL
We don't have to listen to him! He's
just a son!
DAGGETT
That's it. You're jealous. Jealous
He could love something more than
you...
GABRIEL
(hisses)
Shut up...
Gabriel's becoming unglued.
DAGGETT
If you wanted to know so badly,
Gabriel, why didn't you just ask
Him? Why didn't you just ask God?
A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks
down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.
GABRIEL
Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!
The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself,
suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness.
For the village.
Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --
-- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her
legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails
DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground.
The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face
taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.
Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs
off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard,
BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his
knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee
out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the
way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is
white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls
on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from
shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like
ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into
his scalp.
It's about all one human can take.
Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to
climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back.
Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short
stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over
the wall --
And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.
Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow,
shuddering breaths.
IN THE VILLAGE
Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS
down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second
and KICKS its door down. Nothing.
IN THE KIVA
Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned
the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the
relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost
Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire
we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.
IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE
Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every
few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's
hopeless though. We know it.
IN THE VILLAGE
Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan.
There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be
heard the muffled sound of chanting.
THOMAS
Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches
out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.
GABRIEL
Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles
but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight
into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.
INSIDE
Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears
in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.
GABRIEL
Relax folks, it's just a soul.
From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round,
into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the
kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to
Katherine.
GABRIEL
I'm getting real tired of you.
She stands her ground between him and the child.
KATHERINE
Go to hell.
GABRIEL
Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least
get the zip code right.
KATHERINE
It's all the same, isn't it?
GABRIEL
No. In heaven we believe in love.
KATHERINE
And what do you love, Gabriel?
Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly
pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.
GABRIEL
-- Cracking your skull.
He advances on her.
KATHERINE
That's all it is for you anymore,
Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing
and the burning. You don't work for
God anymore. You don't fight for
love.
GABRIEL
Shut up!
And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to
her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed,
clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a
silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance,
flows through her body.
From somewhere outside, there's a sound.
Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to
smolder around her.
We hear the sound once more, closer, before --
The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup
CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into
Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a
broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets
up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic
Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with
him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire
iron.
Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his
knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare
out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore,
one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor
toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.
GABRIEL
God loves you, Mary!
Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all
her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse,
her eyes wild.
KATHERINE
Finish it.
He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.
KATHERINE
Finish it!
Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice
faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked
pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.
Katherine turns back to Gabriel.
KATHERINE
Go home.
She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high
once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode
his skull.
When a hand stops her.
Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her,
holding the raised bar still.
LUCIFER
No.
Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor.
Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as
they awkwardly try to finish the chant.
LUCIFER
Please. Go on.
Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans
at the sight of him.
GABRIEL
Oh man, this just isn't my day.
Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts
to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid,
chattering warning at her.
LUCIFER
Long time.
GABRIEL
The world's young, man.
LUCIFER
And full of ambition.
GABRIEL
This isn't your war.
LUCIFER
But I remember the last one. Michael's
war.
GABRIEL
You lost.
LUCIFER
But lots of angels were with me.
every one followed their leader out
of heaven.
GABRIEL
Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?
LUCIFER
Except one. Oh, he was with me all
right. He hated the Eagle Scout.
Envied the power He gave to His Son.
But this angel never came out front
during the war. And when it ended he
thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout
didn't notice. So he laid low and
towed the company line till he could
start his own war. It was all just
jealousy.
GABRIEL
You're dreaming.
LUCIFER
But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's
why I'm here.
GABRIEL
-- Stay away from me.
LUCIFER
You've always been a part of me,
Gabriel. And now it's time to come
home.
GABRIEL
Fuck you!
Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into
Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm
half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon
Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical
laughter.
The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting
Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter
as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of
orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the
angel's heart,
And eats it.
At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead,
speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.
Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A
battered, hollow shell.
Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns
to Katherine.
GREY HORSE
The enemy spirit is gone.
DAGGETT
(weak, faint)
Where?
From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded,
savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a
lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony.
Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes
for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal.
Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.
She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to
death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt
out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced
arm.
DAGGETT
More will come... To look for the
soul...
KATHERINE
And they won't find it. Not in Mary.
A few of the village elders appear at the cab.
KATHERINE
Can you help him?
VILLAGER
We have some bandages.
Katherine walks over to where Mary, sweaty and shaken, sits
huddled in a corner attended by Grey Horse.
KATHERINE
Are you all right, pumpkin?
Mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.
MARY
I'm okay.
Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.
KATHERINE
It's going to be okay... We're all
going to be okay...
The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by
the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer
has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid,
yellow eyes on Katherine.
KATHERINE
I can't quite bring myself to say
thank you.
LUCIFER
I understand.
KATHERINE
Then this is done.
LUCIFER
Not necessarily. Maybe I like you.
Maybe I want you to come with me.
He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.
LUCIFER
You owe me, Katherine. And you're
going to ask me to take you home.
KATHERINE
(clutching Mary)
No.
LUCIFER
You will. You will because any other
way is going to be more awful than
you can imagine.
KATHERINE
Are you threatening me?
Just a grinning, twisted stare.
KATHERINE
Then you've picked the wrong person
this time. I've just about had it up
to here with ghosts. So you can put
away the horror movie sneer and the
K-Mart halloween eyes, because we
know you now. We know you all. And
if you want to force the issue then
go ahead because you're just another
angel to me. Take a look at your
buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do
you really, really want to fuck with
us?
The smallest hint of a pause.
LUCIFER
Perhaps another time.
KATHERINE
I'm holding my breath.
LUCIFER
Goodbye, Katherine. For now.
And he's gone. Through the door and into the night.
MARY
Is he coming back?
KATHERINE
I don't think so, honey... I don't
think so...
DISSOLVE TO:
The fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing
glare of noon.
The village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos
from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff
department sedans.
The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas
is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds
properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside
him chewing on a wild oat stalk.
SHERIFF
(to deputy bandaging
Thomas)
Is he going to live?
DEPUTY
With any luck.
SHERIFF
(to Thomas)
I thought I told you to give me a
call if anything snarled.
DAGGETT
There wasn't a phone.
SHERIFF
Hmmm.
He chews some more on his stalk. Looks off at the village.
SHERIFF
This fella, Gabriel...
DAGGETT
Yeah.
SHERIFF
Gabriel what?
DAGGETT
Just Gabriel.
SHERIFF
Pretty violent guy, Gabriel. Even
for out here.
DAGGETT
Yeah.
SHERIFF
Caught up with him at the village?
DAGGETT
He caught up with me.
SHERIFF
What were you doing way up here?
DAGGETT
Enemy Ghost Way for Mary Tsosie.
SHERIFF
Indian stuff.
DAGGETT
Yeah. Indian stuff.
The Sheriff looks over at Katherine's pickup still jammed
into the side of the kiva.
SHERIFF
Did you kill this Gabriel?
DAGGETT
Maybe. I think so.
SHERIFF
Don't have any idea where the body
is I suppose.
DAGGETT
No.
SHERIFF
Well, if he's alive he won't get far
out there. Us or the coyotes, it'll
be the same.
(beat)
I rang your office in LA. They don't
have a warrant out for a Gabriel. Or
anybody else in Arizona.
DAGGETT
I hadn't gotten around to it.
SHERIFF
Sort of an out of pocket thing.
DAGGETT
Yes.
The Sheriff takes his hat off. Runs his finger along the
inside band.
SHERIFF
That woman lying at the bottom of
the arroyo, the one still in her
hospital gown, know anything about
that?
DAGGETT
No.
SHERIFF
Really.
DAGGETT
Really.
SHERIFF
This Gabriel was sure one busy dude.
DAGGETT
Yes, he was.
Beat.
SHERIFF
You'll be going back to Los Angeles
now?
DAGGETT
Yeah.
The Sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside
the oak stalk.
SHERIFF
Don't hurry back.
The deputy finishes his bandaging.
DEPUTY
Don't do much but breathe the next
few days. And get to a hospital.
You're going to need some serious
stitches.
DAGGETT
Thanks.
DEPUTY
Say hi to Hollywood for me.
He follows his boss. Katherine and Mary walk up.
MARY
You look bad.
DAGGETT
Thank you. I feel worse.
(to Katherine re Navaho
cops)
They lean on you much?
KATHERINE
Not really. I think they might have
even understood. One of them's related
to this clan. He'll give us a ride
back if we want.
DAGGETT
Good. I think I've about run out of
hospitality with the sheriff's
department.
The moment drifts into silence.
KATHERINE
Do you think it's really over?
DAGGETT
Till we die.
Her eyes settle on his.
KATHERINE
When I die, I want you with me.
DAGGETT
I want that too.
She touches his cheek, Mary cradled between them.
DISSOLVE TO:
Thomas sitting in the back of the tribal police bronco,
looking out the window to the shimmering sands; red and yellow
and black. To clouds brewing over faraway forgotten mountains.
To the end of the earth.
As the bronco drifts away from us toward the empty, rocky
horizon, as it slowly blends and is consumed by the land,
FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK
