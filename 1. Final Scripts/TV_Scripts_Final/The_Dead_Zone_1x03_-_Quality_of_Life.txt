  11EXT. CLEAVES MILLS - DAY

          Johnny Smith's home town -- a picture post card New England
          village... church bells ringing... as the Maine townsfolk
          go about their business at a leisurely pace... moving to
          find...


          JOHNNY SMITH

          taking in the idyllic setting, it seems like a perfect
          Saturday morning... suddenly a hand reaches up toward him
          from --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA (O.S.)
                        Heed the still, small voice when
                        it comes.

          He turns to see --
























                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: QUALITY OF LIFE - TEASER - 03/11/02 - BLUE  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

          ANGLE - A FILTHY HOMELESS WOMAN IN TATTERS

          sitting on the sidewalk... revealing her to be VERA SMITH,
          Johnny's mother...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mom...?  You're alive...?

          As her hand touches his arm... she looks into his eyes...
          repeating, urgently, just to him --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        Heed the still, small voice when
                        it comes.

          Johnny looks at her, confused, not understanding what she
          means.  But his mother's living on the street and it's
            humiliating... he reaches down to help her up...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get, get up off the street, why
                        are you... 

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                                (urgent)
                        It came to Jeremiah and Daniel
                        and Amos and Abraham.  It'll come
                        to you.  And when it does, do
                        your duty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... what are you doing here? 
                        They told me you were...

          She is up now, calling out for the world to hear about
          her son --

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        His work is great upon the earth!

          Johnny follows her, trying to get her to be quiet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mom... ssshhhhshhh... stop...

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA
                        Praise the lord: we are saved!

          And this is completely embarrassing now... as Johnny looks
          around to see --

            REACTIONS AROUND THE SQUARE

          And this all happens very very fast: a rugged MAN#1 in a
          funny cap loading some lumber into the back of a truck
          turns to the voice... a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN#1 saying a
          cheerful good-bye to a SHOP-KEEPER both look to see what's
          going on... a couple of OLDER FELLOWS playing checkers
          outside the barber shop get out of their chair and move
          toward the sound...

                                        HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA (CONT'D)
                        His work is great upon the earth!

          A YOUNG COUPLE sharing a hot fudge sundae outside the ice
          cream shop... leave their ice cream behind to join others
          who are converging on Johnny...


          JOHNNY

          grabs his mother and tries to end this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, that... that's enough, ma...
                        let's go home...

          But as he grabs her and turns her to him... he recoils as
          he sees --


          HOMELESS WOMAN/VERA - HER EYES ARE BLACK

          and lifeless...


          JOHNNY

            reacts... retreats now as he's being pursued by --


          ANGLE - PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE SQUARE

          are running towards him... pointing at him... and they're
          pointing at him, like they know him... smiling, excited..
          it's like they've just spotted a rock star in their town...

                                        MAN WITH THE FUNNY HAT
                        Johnny!  Tell us the future...

                        Will I fall in love, Johnny?

          And damn, they want a piece of him... a wall of voices:
          "Johnny... Johnny... touch us, Johnny" follows him as
          they chase him...


          DOWN THE SIDEWALK - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          where more people are coming at him... coming out of
          buildings, out doors... people surrounding him are tugging
          at him, each touch is like an electric shock, his clothes
          are being torn... it's a bloody riot right here in Cleaves
          Mills... and all the while there is this wall of sound...
          "Johnny... Johnny... Johnny... touch us, Johnny..."

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... stop... please don't touch
                        me...

          And as it seems he's going to drown in hands...

            a picture of Dodd.  The word 'suicide' should be on the
          page as well.

                                        PURDY
                        As his guardian, I'm naturally
                          concerned about the boy.

          Finding PURDY in the foreground using the light from a
          stained glass window to provide light to the newspaper. 
          He wears half-cut reading glasses which he peers over
          toward DANA BRIGHT, attractive but dressed down as always,
          sitting in a front pew, shapely legs crossed at the knee.

                                (faux curiosity)
                        How much is Vera Smith's estate
                        worth these days? 

          As he moves to her, he keeps his poker face but enjoys
          the gamesmanship with her.

                                        PURDY
                        You're far too cynical for such a
                          beautiful woman.   

          Purdy sits beside her, rather intimately close, takes off
          his glasses... 

                                        PURDY
                        What really happened out there,
                        Dana?  Surely, a cynical girl has
                        some rational explanation.

                                (mind working, to
                                  himself)
                        The kind of story that doesn't go
                        away quickly.

                          newspapers.

                        In that case, can I ask a small
                          personal favor?  Johnny and I
                        don't have the closest of
                          relationships.  I regret that and
                        I hope it will change.  But for
                        the moment, it would mean a great
                        deal if you could... touch base
                        with me now and then about him... 
                        so I know how he's really doing...

                                        DANA
                        Why would I want to spy on him
                        for you?

          And there's more to this line than meets the eye:

                                        PURDY
                        Because we go back such a long
                        way.

          He studies her and despite her bravado there's a fragile
          woman there... for reasons only they can understand, she's
          vulnerable to him...

                                        PURDY
                        I miss the features you used to
                        do for the Saturday religious
                          section.  Now, you don't even
                        come to services any more.

          She stands, grins with a defensive, self-deprecating
          humor... as though it's a badge of honor --

                                        DANA
                        Some people just can't be saved,
                          Reverend.    

          She exits.  Purdy thinks about it.          DEAD ZONE: QUALITY OF LIFE - ACT ONE - 03/11/02 - BLUE  7.


  66EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          A reluctant Johnny coming out of the house with BRUCE
          moving toward Bruce's P-T Cruiser in the driveway.  Mid-
            conversation, fast, overlapping dialogue:

                                        JOHNNY
                        You should've asked me before
                        you...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...sure and you would have told
                        me...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...don't you think it's a little
                        too soon to be...

                                        BRUCE

                        Time to get back on the horse,
                        John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm just not sure I'm ready to
                        walk back into that school...

                                        BRUCE
                        Why?  Because you're afraid people
                        are gonna touch you?  You know
                        what -- they will.  And you're
                        gonna have to deal.  Part of the
                          re-entry process.

          Johnny looks phobic.  But Bruce is full of confidence in
          him, smiles encouragingly.

                                        BRUCE
                        You've got to learn how to be the
                        hero of your own life again, John. 
                        But until you're ready, I'll be
                        the hero of your life... in return
                        for a stock market tip now and
                        then.  Get in the car.

          As they reach the car, Johnny takes a deep breath,
            gathering courage.  He looks at Bruce and nods okay, let's
          do it.   

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me the keys.
                                (off Bruce's look)
                        What?  I want to drive, c'mon...

          Johnny opens the driver's door, ready to take the wheel...

          Bruce sighs and throws him the keys, still nervous.  As
          they get in --

                        I mean if you were going to have
                        an accident, you'd know it before
                        it ever happened... In time to

          Students still filtering out... no one paying much
            attention to Johnny... it's all terribly familiar and to
          Johnny it seems like almost yesterday that he was in this
          hall...


          NEW ANGLE

          as Johnny passes the janitor's closet where he had covert
          liaisons with Sarah.  On a whim, he tries the door.  As
          he touches the knob --


1111A JOHNNY FLASH - SARAH AND JOHNNY

          from the pilot kissing in the closet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I sure hope you're not Lars the
                          janitor.

          The flash ends as we...


  1212RESUME SCENE

          Johnny opens the closet door but it's filled with the
          most daunting array of electronic and computer support
          gear imaginable...

                                        STUDENT#1
                        Are you lost?

          Johnny turns to see a young woman behind him...

                        Hi, no, I was just... I used to
                        be a teacher here... when this
                        was a janitor's closet...

          The student is a little perplexed about why this guy cares
          about a janitor's closet...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...and... and I was looking for a
                        broom.

                                        STUDENT#1
                        Oh... they converted the closet
                        last year when we upgraded to  
                        D-S-L.  This is the LAN hub
                        substation and server for the
                        district's WAN mainframe.

          A beat as Johnny stares at the kid wondering what she
          said.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thanks... for clearing that up. 
                        The office still down this way?
                                (student acknowledges)

          Johnny moves down the hall.  Ahead of him, SARAH carrying
            teacher's materials in her arms, comes hurriedly out of a
            classroom... her face brightens at the sight of him...

                                        SARAH
                          Pelson's waiting for you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I sense a conspiracy.

                                        SARAH
                        Time for you to get back on...

                        Got to admit it feels good to be
                        here again.  Seems like old times,

          A beat as they share the intimate memories of times here...
          raising feelings that are to be avoided, so Sarah avoids
          them:

                        the cleaners before it closes and
                        pick up groceries for dinner...

                                        MR. PALEY
                        Your new guy?

          As Foley turns to see Johnny who sure doesn't look like a
          hockey coach as he walks with his cane...

                                        MR. PALEY (CONT'D)
                                (dubious)
                        You're sure about this?  I heard
                        that he...

                                        FOLEY
                                (overlapping)
                        Dave Pelson knows him.  I checked
                        him out.  It's gonna be fine.

          He gives an encouraging pat on the shoulder to Paley,
          moves away as he yells to the kids... 

                                        FOLEY
                        Okay,  offensive drills... no
                        loafing...

          As the skaters move into drills, Foley moves away from
          Todd's dad to greet Johnny.

                                        FOLEY
                        You must be Smith.

          He sticks out his hand.  Johnny hesitates a second but
          there is no easy way out of it and he shakes Foley's
          hand... nothing happens... Johnny breathes a sigh of
            relief...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for having me, coach.

                        Let's get one thing clear - this
                        ain't about hiring the handicapped. 
                        I don't give a hoot about the

          ANGLE - A DOCTOR (COOPER, 50)

          is rotating the shoulder of a player, pats him on the
          back, he's okay, and sends him back on the ice...

                                        FOLEY
                        Doc Cooper, Coach Smitty.  

          The doc acknowledges but he studies Johnny who turns to
          watch the drills...

                                        DOC COOPER

                        I read about you in the paper.

          It's said evenly, with vague suspicion.  Johnny nods and
          Cooper doesn't pursue it.  Johnny watches with interest
          as...

          TODD 

          moves smoothly on offense as the defense tries in vain to
          stop him... he fakes left, goes right... splits two
          defenders, beats the goalie and scores.  

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impressed)
                        Who's that?

                                        FOLEY
                        My conference championship on two
                        legs.  Todd Paley.  Just signed a
                        letter of intent to go to Princeton -
                        full scholarship.  That's his dad
                        over there.

          Johnny glances over to the father who is several yards
          away watching the action.

                                        FOLEY
                        Todd's the best offensive player
                        in the state.

          But Todd is on defense now... and here he's not so sure
          of himself... an offensive player (CALHOUN) does a mean
          fake and goes by him and scores.  (Note: if we go this
          way, we may want to reprise this in the first hockey game
          to show that he's learned the lesson.)

                                        FOLEY
                                (shakes his head)
                        If he'd just concentrate on his
                          defense, he could make it to the
                        pros.  But all these kids care
                        about is scoring.
                                (yelling)
                        Dammit, Todd.  Make him work for
                        it.

          Todd skates over... takes off his helmet... Calhoun moves
          over a beat later... smiles victoriously, maybe even bumps
            shoulders with Todd, teasing him...

                                        TODD
                        C'mon, Coach, you saw it, Billy
                        gave me a heckuva fake...

                        play...  I don't think so.

          He gives Todd a friendly, teasing push... then returns to
          the ice...


          MOVING WITH TODD AND JOHNNY

          into a defensive position... helmet still off... (note:
          Johnny doesn't touch him here)...

                        You know what a 'tell' is, Mr.

                                (off his dumb look)
                          A 'tell' is a gambler's expression
                        for the unconscious message a
                        player looking at his cards gives
                        you.  He'll tell you everything
                        you need to know to win if you'll
                        just pay attention.

                        You want me to play ice poker
                        with Billy.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something like that.  Just watch
                        his hips, not his head.  That's
                        where you'll see the 'tell.'  You
                        can fake with the rest of the
                        body but you aren't going anywhere
                        without the hips.

          Todd smiles, puts his helmet back on.  His father looks
          on at this counseling session with curiosity.  Johnny
          moves to the sidelines with Foley, leaving the two boys
          on the ice... he blows the whistle...

          WIDER

          as Calhoun moves toward Todd, Calhoun turns his right
          shoulder toward the left board and takes a quick step. 
          As Todd turns with him, Calhoun throws the puck back to
          his right, in-between Todd's feet.  But Todd holds his
          ground and puts his shoulder right into Calhoun's chest,
          and both tumble to the ice.

          as Calhoun whoops and the kids cheer: "All right, Todd! 
          Way to go!"... Mr. Paley is forced to smile... Johnny

                        tree.  That was our tree.  They
                        should be paying us rent.

                                        SARAH
                        Aw, let's let 'em have it for
                        free.  In the name of school
                        spirit.

          Johnny grins but his mind is occupied about Todd.  She
          notices as they stroll slowly toward the school... 

                                        SARAH
                          Something wrong?

          Johnny doesn't answer right away, sighs...

                        Had a very strange vision about
                        him yesterday during practice... 
                        I could see straight into his
                          heart...

                        with it?

          He pauses in his walk, mind trying to unlock the mystery... 
          The bell rings... the kids move quickly inside...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the thing -- I don't know.
                        These visions don't come with
                        footnotes.  I'm not always sure

  2424INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

          Close on GREENBERG, 18, chatting up a pretty girl in the
          back row as Johnny enters...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good morning.  As you may have
                        heard, Miss Rosen won't be here
                        for a few days... my name is Mr.
                          Smith...

          His eyes connect with Todd Paley who is also in the
          classroom.  Student #1 is also in this class.  As he puts
          his name on the board, Greenberg exchanges knowing glances
          with some of his buddies...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Just plain S-M-I-T-H.  But you
                        can call me John, or you can call
                        me Johnny, or if you're more
                          comfortable, Mr. Smith... or even
                        hey 'you'... anything as long as
                        it isn't 'Smitty'. 
                                (Todd smiles)
                        Now, who can tell me what chapter
                        you're studying?

                                        GREENBERG
                        Chapter twelve.

          Johnny opens the book...


          CLOSE ON THE WORLD HISTORY BOOK (FX)

          as he turns pages... and a brief visual effect as his
          hand reaches the page that says Chapter Twelve...


          JOHNNY

          reacts, looks up...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you absolutely certain, Mr...

                                        GREENBERG
                        Greenberg, sir.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ah, Mr. Greenberg.

          Johnny strolls down the aisle toward Greenberg...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because something tells me you
                        studied chapter twelve last week.
                        Which means you'd already know
                        the material and wouldn't have to
                        pay any attention at all today.

                                        GREENBERG
                                (reacts)
                        I meant we just finished twelve.  

          Johnny touches Greenberg's desk...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't your assigned seat, is
                        it, Mr. Greenberg?

                                        GREENBERG
                        We actually don't have...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's see -- right there in front,
                        that's your seat, isn't it?  Away
                        from all the 'distractions' like
                        Miss Carlyle back here.  Who else
                        is not in their normal seat?

          Half the class stands up and switches seats...

                        Excuse me, but wasn't there
                          something about you in the
                        newspaper?

          And of course Johnny knew this would be coming... he's
          thought about how to handle it...

                        How do you feel about that?

          The girl shrugs an I-don't-know...

                        I might just be your worst
                        nightmare, people.  A substitute
                        teacher with extra sensory
                          perception.

          A beat as he walks to the teacher's desk and opens the
          top drawer...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Or... maybe... I checked...
                                (holding the chart up)
                        ...the seating chart... when I
                        came in this morning.

          He holds it up and grins.  The kids laugh and relax.  

                                        GREENBERG
                        Yo, Mr. Smith, do you know who's
                        going to win the super bowl next
                        year?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but I know who won The Hundred
                        Year's War - the question's whether
                        you do.  The answer can be found
                        in chapter thirteen...

  2626INT. CLASSROOM - SAME STUDENTS TOWARD THE END OF CLASS

            unprepared... and is making excuses for his late

                        You think?

            Student#1 is unconvinced.

                        Mr. Bradford, you're certainly
                          creative, not to mention a good
                        dancer.  But lay off the cigars

                        And since Mr. Bradford brought up
                        the subject, who can tell me why
                        beer was so expensive in the middle
                        ages?  Most people back then
                          couldn't afford to get drunk,
                        why?

                          Interesting answer but the last
                        time I checked beer doesn't come
                        from potatoes.  Anyone?

          The bell rings ending class...  the kids slowly rise...

                        Fine.  No big deal.

                        Have Doc Cooper take a look, okay?

                          precaution.
                                (re:cane)
                        Trust me, you don't want to have
                        to use one of these.

          Todd shrugs, okay, exits, calling back.

                                        TODD
                        Mr. Smith.  Good class.

          Johnny nods his thanks.  He moves down the hall; Johnny,
          mind working, watches him go...          DEAD ZONE: QUALITY OF LIFE - ACT TWO - 03/11/02 - BLUE  26.

          Johnny is still thinking about Todd as he walks...
            suddenly, Dana moves up and walks beside him...

                                        DANA
                        How's it feel to be back?

          He's not happy to see her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doing here?

                                        DANA
                        I can't resist a human interest
                        story.  

          Johnny shakes his head in disgust, tries to ignore her.

                                        DANA
                        You and I need to be friends,
                        Johnny.  Reporters like me are
                        going to be a part of your life
                        now...

                        Only for fifteen minutes.  Isn't
                        that how it works?

                                        DANA
                        You're good for at least twenty
                        if my hunch is right.      

          As they turn a corner, they run into Sarah who can't help
          but react to seeing Johnny with a beautiful woman...

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, hi...

                        I've seen you at the station

                          Johnny's on my beat now.

          Sarah's eyes narrow a little.

                        Sarah and I used to teach here
                          together.

          And Dana knows all about them...

                                (dry)
                        Yes.  So I've heard.  Could I ask
                        you a few questions about him?

          Johnny looks to Sarah, shakes his head, no.

                                        SARAH
                        You can ask all you want.

                        A good reporter and her subject
                        can be a team, Johnny... they can
                        help each other... like Cosell
                        and Ali...

          Johnny moves away from Dana in the opposite direction

                        Can I talk to you a sec about

                        Todd plays hard.  Why?  

          Johnny takes a long beat, there's no easy way so he gets
          to the point.

                        Never any... heart problems?

                        Heart?  Has he complained of any
                          symptoms...?  Shortness of breath. 
                          Numbness in...

                        But you think he has heart
                          problems.  

          Cooper begins to suspect where Johnny is coming from and
          doesn't like it one bit.

                                        DOC COOPER
                        Listen, there's something you and
                          I should get straight right now. 
                        I don't believe in this psychic
                          nonsense...

                        Then just think of me as a coach
                        asking you to examine a kid with
                        a sore hip pointer... and as the
                        team doctor, be sure to give him
                        a clean bill of health before he
                        plays tonight.  That's your job,
                        right?

          The two men stare at one another.  After a beat, the doc
          nods and moves on.  On Johnny's reaction...

            encouragement, moves to Johnny, concern in his eyes...
          they're alone...

                        What's this I hear about you and
                        Todd Paley?

                        I just asked the doc...

                                        FOLEY
                        The doc was pretty unhappy, Smitty. 
                        And I am too.  This is a good
                        kid, strong as an ox, and if you're
                          thinking steroids, forget it... I
                        watch these kids like they were
                        my own...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know, coach.

          The doc arriving from the locker room joins them...

                        I listened to his heart, checked
                        his blood pressure, even did an
                        EKG.  I'm recommending him for a
                        medal from the American Heart
                          Association.

          Foley gives Johnny a look that says, 'See?, Everything's
          fine.'

                        Come to me with something like
                        this in the future, okay?   

          Then puts it behind him to concentrate on the game, moves
          to his team... Johnny reacts... not quite able to believe
          there's nothing to worry about.

          reacts but Todd quickly gets himself up and gets back

          Foley yelling at a ref over a call... the ref signaling a
            technical foul on the coach... which only makes Foley

          teaching at the high school, written by Dana Bright, is
          in clear display... Headline: "Teacher By Day, Psychic
          Deputy By Night"...

                        They aren't mental problems. 
                        I've talked to his doctors, there's

          is standing there.  The parents all look at him with
          suspicion.

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny looks around the room.  The parents avoid eye

                        Mr. Pelson, when you have a minute,

                        we're finished here.

          Johnny moves through the parents and most let him pass
          but the spokeswoman deliberately stands in his way and
          just stares at Johnny... Johnny can actually see hate in
          her eyes...

                        Excuse us.

          Pelson deftly moves the woman out of the way and leads
          Johnny into his office and closes the door... as the
          parents react and filter out...

                        last week about the new cheerleader
                          uniforms and the week before that,

                        Or you were wrong.  It's a
                        reasonable conclusion, John.  Can
                        you really trust these visions?

                        You think keeping him off the ice
                        will save his life.  Maybe.  Maybe
                        not.  But I can tell you one thing
                        it would certainly accomplish... 
                        It would cost him his scholarship
                        to Princeton and blow every hope
                        and dream this kid has out of the

          Sitting in the living room with Mrs. Paley and her husband. 
          This is a religious family; there is a Christian icon on
          the wall behind the Paleys, perhaps a simple cross.  Johnny
          has just finished telling them that he fears for their
          son's life.  They are speechless.  And the first oh, maybe
          five seconds of this scene are these two alarmed people
          staring at this strange man in their home.  Finally, Mrs.
          Paley finds some words.

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        He's... he's never been seriously

          completely wrong?... he isn't sure what to believe at
          this point - (note: remember this is only the third
            broadcast week of his powers and he has no idea how
          reliable they may or may not be).  But he has no choice,
          he rises, preparing to leave...

                        Hope you win.

          Johnny glances back at the doctor and exits...

                        We have to beat them to every

                        them and out skate them.

          Johnny and Todd arrive late... Todd quickly puts his skates
          on... Johnny gets a glare from Foley... a horn sounds
          signalling the teams to take the ice...

          A quick cheer... as they move onto the ice, Foley gives
          Johnny an angry look --

          who is with the coach from Princeton, we know this because

          Paley.


          THE TEAM

          on the ice... students cheer... the Husky mascot jumps up
          and down... Todd is the last one on the ice...


          JOHNNY

          steps up onto the bench at the opposite end of Foley.
          Foley ignores him...

          THE GAME BEGINS

                                (screaming at the ref)
                        What are you calling?!  That was
                        clean!  This is hockey, not
                          basketball!  You're allowed to

                        ways!

          The ref points a warning finger at him...

          More scoring... the Eagles are up 2-1 now... cheerleaders
          yell encouragement to the Huskies... Todd pushing himself,

          him... so does Dana... so does Pelson...

          But Todd forces himself back into the action and gets
          back on defense... there are only four minutes left on
          the clock...

          Foley waves his arm, urging his team to take it to them...
          no let down, no fatigue...

                        Todd... keep the legs pumping...

          Todd finds an inner resource and comes down the ice...
            scores... but the referee whistle had blown and the ref
          waves off the Huskies' goal... the ref signals an offside
          call... Foley goes berserk at the ref...

                                        FOLEY
                        You're BLEEPing crazy!  You never
                          BLEEPing saw it!  You were on the
                        other side! 

          The ref calls a technical on Foley...

                                        FOLEY
                        BLEEP you.

          Foley, standing behind his players on the bench, grabs a
          few of the extra sticks to the side and throws them onto
          the ice... the crowd reacts... the ref signals Foley to
          leave the bench area throwing him out of the game.  

          In the stands, Pelson shakes his head...  

          The ref signals to the score keeper he's assessing a bench
          minor, then points to Johnny.

                        The team's yours, coach.

          And as we push into Johnny, he realizes it is in his hands
          now.  And it comes down to the very basic question that
          Pelson asked him:  How much does he trust these visions?   
          The referee blows the whistle and play resumes (one Husky
          in the penalty box for the coach's outburst).  Time on
          the clock starts running down from 3:35...

          in the coach's box... pushing to close ups... as Johnny

          still small voice...


          JOHNNY'S POV - THE CLOCK

          ticking down... rack focus to the crowd... finding one
          woman not cheering... staring straight at him... the same
          woman... perhaps even in the same seat as he saw her in
          the practice... and there's no doubt this time, it is
          Vera Smith and all sound disappears as Johnny sees her
          looking straight at him...  


          JOHNNY

            reacts... his eyes narrow...


          JOHNNY'S POV - SAME AS BEFORE - SOUND RESUMES

          except it's a different woman in the same seat now... and

            chants...


          JOHNNY

          reacts, was his mind playing tricks on him?  He puts his
          hands up to signal for a time out.  The ref calls time
          out.  There is 1:22 left (and the Husky penalty has ended).

          The team moves to him for instructions...

                        Okay guys, I want to dump the
                        puck low and I want the defensemen
                        to pinch the high slot.  Let's
                        get the puck back to the point
                        and create traffic in front of
                        the net.  Calhoun, center.

                        Take a seat, Todd.

          Todd can't believe his ears... the other players exchange

          The horn sounds ending the time out.  Todd starts to go

          Todd in the back seat, out of view...

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        You think he's going to be fired?

                                        MR. PALEY
                        Oh, he won't be showing his face
                        around here for a long time, right,
                        Todd?

          Todd doesn't answer.

                                        MR. PALEY
                        Todd?  Todd!

          The parents turn around and as their eyes react to what
          they see...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  5858THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and Bruce waiting there... down the hall, they see
          the heart doctor still in his surgical gown, walking down
          the long corridor... the long walk builds up the tension
          of what he's going to say... he ignores Johnny and walks
          into --


  A58A58THE POST OP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...and goes directly to the Paleys.  Bruce and Johnny
          stand at the door, outsiders to the scene...

                                        HEART DOCTOR
                        We found a type of paroxysmal
                          tachycardia - an abnormality in
                        the heart's electrical system.

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        He'll be all right?

                                        HEART DOCTOR
                                (nods)
                        It was a moderate cardiac
                        arrhythmia and he's strong.
                        Could have been a lot worse.  If
                        it had struck at the peak of an
                          athletic performance...
                                (he looks at Johnny)
                        ...he might not have been so
                        fortunate. 
                                (beat)
                        He should be waking up any time
                        now.

          As the doctor exits past Johnny, the Paleys' eyes are
          drawn to him... Mr. Paley looks at him, unable to express
          his appreciation in words, and finally a tear runs down
          his cheek and he nods, thank-you.  Johnny smiles, nods
          back, understanding; no words need to be said.

          Todd stirs in his bed... and his parents move to his
          side... she takes his hand... his eyes are still woozy
          from anesthesia... 

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        The doctor says you're going to
                        be fine, Todd.

          And because he owes this (and a lot more) to Johnny --

                                        MR. PALEY
                        There's someone here to see you.

          And he turns to Johnny, motions inviting him in, no longer
          considering him the outsider.  Johnny moves to Todd's
          bedside... looks down at Todd...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, man.  Have I got a physical
                          therapist for you.  Bruce'll have
                        you up and running wind sprints
                        in no time.

          Todd manages a smile.  Grateful tears roll down the cheeks
          of Mrs. Paley as she holds her son's hand and in a whisper,
          says a quiet prayer...

                                        MRS. PALEY
                        Thank the Lord.  His work is great
                        upon the earth.

          Johnny reacts as he hears the echo from his dream...

          Johnny reacts and as Walt guides the way, they turn a
          corner to reveal a huge mob of reporters and townspeople
          waiting for him... they swarm around him... microphones
          are shoved in his face...

          Johnny tries to ignore them... but his eyes are caught by
          a face - Man#1 is wearing the same funny hat but now he's
          shooting pictures with a still camera... and there's
          Woman#1 and the Shopkeeper, holding microphones, and the
          Old Checkers Players and the Young Couple - faces he's
          seen before in his dream - except now they're all media

                        did you know it was going to
                          happen...

          They're on all sides of him now - reaching to touch him...
          and Johnny is very much aware that his dream is being
          realized... some of our shots even match the shots from
