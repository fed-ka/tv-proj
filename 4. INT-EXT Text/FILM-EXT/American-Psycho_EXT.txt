The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,
who looks confused.
McDERMOTT
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask
him if he takes American Express.
PRICE
(Offering card)
You take Amex, dude?
The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,
unhooks the
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.
It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up
to her as she pauses at a red light.
BATEMAN
Hello.
The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing
his smile, smiles back.
The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.
Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns
to leave, he notices someone across the street.
A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies
next to him.
He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.
BATEMAN
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.
The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.
BATEMAN
You want some money?. Some...food?
The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his
mind and holds out a $5 instead.
BATEMAN
Is this what you need?
The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
BATEMAN
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
BATEMAN
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you
get a job?
HOMELESS MAN
(Shivering and sobbing)
I lost my job...
BATEMAN
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
the job?
HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.
BATEMAN
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
The dog starts to whimper.
BATEMAN
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm not...
BATEMAN
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry
BATEMAN
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.
I'm trying to help you.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry.
BATEMAN
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who
do have jobs? From people who do work?
HOMELESS MAN
What am I gonna do?
BATEMAN
Listen, what's your name?
HOMELESS MAN
Al.
BATEMAN
Speak up. Come on.
HOMELESS MAN
Al.
BATEMAN
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.
HOMELESS MAN
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.
BATEMAN
(Petting the dog)
Shhhh...it's okay.
HOMELESS MAN
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist)
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
BATEMAN
(Stroking his face, whispering)
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
HOMELESS MAN
I can't...I can't find a shelter
BATEMAN
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.
BATEMAN
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common
with you.
He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
protect it.
BATEMAN
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?
HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.
EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is
silent.
LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.
BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.
Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the
body left twitching on the ground.
BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.
CARRUTHERS
Patrick? Is that you?
BATEMAN
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
CARRUTHERS
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.
(Looking down at the body)
Where did you get your overnight bag?
BATEMAN
Commes des Garcon.
A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get
Owen's body into the backseat.
Bateman gets into the cab.
CARRUTHERS
Call me please, Patrick.
BATEMAN
Jesus lives, Luis.
Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.
BATEMAN
I haven't seen you around here.
CHRISTIE
You just haven't been looking.
BATEMAN
Would you like to see my apartment?
Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a
tuxedo.
CHRISTIE
(looking away to some dark corner)
I'm not supposed to.
Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now
notices, then takes.
BATEMAN
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
CHRISTIE
I'm not supposed to.
(She pockets the bill)
But I can make an exception.
BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?
Christie is still looking out behind her.
BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?
Christie looks at him like he's crazy.
BATEMAN
I'm joking. Come on, get in.
As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He
reads off a credit card number.
BATEMAN
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.
He hangs up.
BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is
that clear?
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.
DAISY
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand
what I was doing with a yuppie.
BATEMAN
Oh really?
DAISY
He said...
(She laughs)
He said you gave him bad vibes.
BATEMAN
That's...that's too bad.
DAISY
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
BATEMAN
What?
DAISY
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
BATEMAN
(insincerely) No. I really don't.
DAISY
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
She takes his hand as they get into a cab.
The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a
half-opened window.
CHRISTIE
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after
last time...
BATEMAN
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
CHRISTIE
I don't think so.
He hands her a $500 bill.
BATEMAN
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
The driver's here, you'll be safe.
Christie gets in hesitantly.
BATEMAN
Nothing like last time, promise.
CHRISTIE
Alright.
He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.
BATEMAN
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
CHRISTIE
(A little confused)
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
BATEMAN
(Mock shock)
Really?
CHRISTIE
My friend told me I should maybe even get a
lawyer.
BATEMAN
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.
BATEMAN
Bitch.
He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the
limo, she reaches for the money.
He snatches it away.
BATEMAN
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.
She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.
BATEMAN
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?
Christie nods.
Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.
BATEMAN
Here kitty, kitty.
The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.
WOMAN
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?
Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming
to the floor.
Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car
screeches after him.
COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.
Bateman ducks down an alley.
A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away
from him.
Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.
He runs out of the alley.
As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.
COP CAR
Halt. Put down your weapon.
The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.
Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
and dead.
NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.
NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.
Bateman enters the revolving
door of an office building, panicking and breathing
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY
just like him.
GUY
Hey, Kinsley.
Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.
GUY
See you at Fluties, okay?
The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage
cans, etc.
Bateman searches his pockets
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his
face, dialing a number.
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick Bateman's office.
BATEMAN
Jean? Hello? Jean?
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? Is that you?
BATEMAN
Hello? Jean, I need help!
JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?
BATEMAN
Jean-I'm not-
JEAN (O.S.)
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
BATEMAN
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? I can't hear you.
BATEMAN
What are I doing?
JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
BATEMAN
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Pause.
BATEMAN
...to the office this afternoon.
JEAN (O.S.)
Why?
BATEMAN
(Screaming)
Just...say...no!
JEAN (O.S.)
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
BATEMAN
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his
jacket.
