          Johnny jumps out of the car, too, holding a flashlight.

                        Listen.

          Through the pouring rain, they catch glimpses of movement
          in the woods.  Johnny shines his flashlight into the
            darkness, but the people have vanished.  It's eerie.

                        Hello!  Is somebody down there?!

          He gets no answer -- all sound drowned out by the thunder
          of rushing water below.

          Johnny sweeps his flashlight beam down the slope, it
          illuminates something we don't see.

                        There's something down there.

          Johnny hurries down the steep, wooded slope.  Bruce steps
          right into wet mud.

                                        BRUCE
                        There go my party shoes!

          Bruce FOLLOWS him down into the darkness.



          Johnny is making his way through the branches, Bruce behind
          him.

          CAMERA REVEALS A BADLY DAMAGED VAN

          It's nose down, tilted on its side in a rain-swollen
          stream, water up to the passenger side window.  It's caught
          on some rocks, about to be carried downstream and submerged
          by the rushing waters.  Johnny and Bruce wade in, rush to
          the back doors, wedged against a tree stump the van dragged
          as it careened down the slope.  As Johnny touches the van--

                        I've got to get her out.

          The van shifts again, sending Bruce lurching back, holding
          tight to the baby in his arms.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's moving!  John, the water's
                        getting higher!

          But Johnny's already disappeared back inside the van.          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - TEASER - 3/22/05 - GOLD-2  5A.

                        Johnny!

          Every ounce of Bruce is wanting to jump in and pull Johnny
          to safety, but he's holding a baby in his arms.  Horrified,
          he drags his eyes from the sight, clings to the rock to
          steady himself from the raging waters.

          SUDDENLY a drowning Johnny pops up in the fast-moving
          current, his arm outstretched.  Bruce grabs his hand,
          pulls him to the rock.



          Johnny and Bruce hurry to Johnny's car, baby in Bruce's
          arms.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I couldn't get to her.  The seats
                        were crushed and I couldn't...

                        You did everything you could.

          Johnny looks numb, reaches inside and grabs the cell phone.

          Bruce and Johnny stand eye to eye, wet, shivering,

          by what they were unable to do.

                        taken off.  One woman wasn't so
                        lucky.  We found her trapped inside
                        the van.  Had to use the jaws of
                        life to get her out.  We got an
                          anonymous 911 call, but by the

          He picks up a piece of twisted metal and gets a VISION,
          FLASHES in a dark setting --



          The piece of twisted metal from the VAN reassembles itself
          into the all-in-one-piece pre-accident van, its back door
          open as a crowd of illegal immigrants, including the
          mother, holding her baby, are herded like human cattle. 

          Vision Johnny watches as the illegals are pouring out of
          some sort of cramped, darkened space (into the van)-- the
          same type of space Johnny saw in the teaser vision. 


  1919RESUME - CRASH SITE

          Johnny calls over to Walt, who's looking among the rocks
          for other clues.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There were nine, maybe ten people. 
                        They were part of a larger group
                          smuggled in a rail container.

                                        WALT
                          Anything else?

          Johnny looks at the pile of debris from the crash that
          the police have assembled, spots a Bible, the edge of a
          PHOTO sticking out of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.

                                        WALT
                        Thanks for comin' out on such an
                        ugly night.

          As Walt moves off, Johnny crosses to the pile, picks up
          the Bible and slips out the photo   the mother, the baby,
          and a man whom Johnny assumes must be the father.  Johnny
          pockets the photo, and as he does he catches his own
          reflection in a piece of mirror in the dirt.  He picks it
          up and --

            Suddenly, WHOOSH!



          Vision Johnny is in the passenger seat of the van.

          The Driver, Jose, is at the wheel, leaning out the window,
          speaking SPANISH with a neatly dressed COYOTE, who is a
          Latino wanna-be player and the boss, RICKY.  He speaks
          perfect Spanish when necessary, and English when he wants
          to intimidate the migrants in his debt -- which is most
          of the time.

                                        RICKY
                                  (Spanglish)
                        Back here tonight.  And keep the
                        van clean.  No eating.

          Jose nods deferentially, looks up at the gathering clouds.

                                        RICKY
                        Good 'n dark.

          He starts driving, from Johnny's POV we pull out of what
          we see is a parking lot of a seedy bar, its neon sign
            reflected in the windshield.

          On Johnny, as the vision ends --

                                                                                CUT TO:


  2121NEON BAR SIGN

          same one from Johnny s vision.  PULL OUT TO REVEAL:



          Johnny and Bruce get out of the car, start towards the
          bar.

                                        BRUCE
                        Only for you, man.  Outta bed in
                        the middle of the night.  I should
                        be sleepin' like a baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoever coined that expression
                        must have never had one.

                                        BRUCE
                        So what are we looking for, besides
                        the best bean burrito in Bangor?

          Johnny shows him the photo he found at the crash site.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm betting the baby's father was
                        here waiting for the van to show
                        up.  He might still be here
                          waiting.

          Bruce wishes they didn't have such awful news for him.

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you tell a man his wife is
                        dead?

                        We're about to find out.

                                        BRUCE
                                (wry)
                        At least it's nice to know you
                        need me for my muscle.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually I brought you because
                        you habla espanol. 
                                (off Bruce's look)
                        You do speak Spanish, don't you? 
                        It was on your resume when I
                        updated it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh.  Yeah.  Sure. 

          As they head into the bar, Johnny hesitates a beat, stares
          down at the photo of the family he hopes to reunite. 
          What's left of it.  He tears the photo in two, keeps the
          half with the father, and puts the other half deep into
          his pocket.



          Inky blackness, A LITTLE GIRL grasps tightly onto her
          MOTHER s hand with all her might, runs for her life.  As
          she and her mother flee, trying to avoid the blindingly
          bright lights chasing them, we quickly understand this is
          the scene of an illegal border crossing.



          Bruce and Johnny bust through the back door of the bar
          and find themselves in an alley --

          Surrounded by angry looking Mexicans: Jose and a couple
          of other THUGS, but most noticeably -- Ricky, the neatly
          dressed but sleazy COYOTE boss man.  They say nothing,
          they don't have to. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do you say: perhaps there has
                        been some mistake?

                                        BRUCE
                        Hola... amigos...

          In one swift move, a thug puts a steel pipe up against
          Johnny's throat, MATCH/MOVE/MORPH TO:



          Same alley, same thugs, same pipe up against the throat,
          this time, of a Mexican Man, MIGUEL.  The Coyote leans
          into his face.

                                        RICKY
                        I don't want to hear it.

                        My wife, Ricky, where is my wife? 
                        My son...

          He grabs Ricky's shirt and Ricky brushes him off.

                                        RICKY
                        You're a smart boy, Miguel.  A
                        hard worker.  Listen to me.  Like
                        we told you.  An accident. 
                                (shrugs)
                        Your wife and kid are dead. 

          Jose hangs his head.  One of the thugs takes a wad of
          money from Miguel's pocket.

                                        MIGUEL

                          Miguelito... No...

          The thug punches him and Ricky grabs his shirt, looks
          into his crying face.

                        Tell anyone about this and you
                        die!  



          Out of the vision, on Johnny's face as the thug presses
          the pipe tighter against his windpipe, choking the life
          out of Johnny...

          Pick up with Johnny gasping as the thug tightens his grip
          on the steel pipe to Johnny's throat.  Bruce is pinned

                        the place.  Well you don't own
                        me!

          Everyone turns to see Eva, the dancer from inside, walking
          across the parking lot, heels clicking on the pavement.

          Ricky gets out of Johnny's face, one thug lets go of Bruce,
          Jose stops hitting him.  Eva moves right past the thug
          and up to Johnny as if the man holding a pipe to his throat
          were invisible.

                        I want my five bucks.  And I'm
                        not leaving until I get it.

          With barely a glance at Ricky, she shoves him aside.

                        Move -- so he can get to his
                          pockets.

          Ricky laughs.  Eva kicks Bruce with one of her stilettos.

          Ricky, Jose and the smirking thugs go back inside the
          bar.  Bruce stands up, weakly.  Johnny looks at Eva.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.  I think.

                        That was some pretty good advice.

                        white or black.

                                in thanks)
                        We'll take that under
                          consideration.

          As their hands meet, WHOOSH:



          The same little girl crossing the desert with her mother. 
          The sweltering sun beats down on them.  They are exhausted,
          weak, dehydrated.  Suddenly the mother collapses.

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        Mami...

          The little girl tries to revive her, tugs on her skirt,
          but we see in the mother s eyes that she can go no further. 
          She cups her daughter s face in her hands.

                                        MOTHER
                                (in Spanish)
                        Be strong, Eva.  For me.



          Johnny and Bruce get in the car, pull out of the lot.

          ON EVA, watching as they drive off, grabbing a paper and
          writing down Johnny s license plate.  There's something
          else going on behind the make up and false bravado.



          Bruce is pushing a cart full of baby supplies, sore, beat
          up, looking like hell.  He's on the cell.  His tone is
          cranky, impatient, and very domestic.

                                        BRUCE
                        I got 'em.  Yes, the ones with
                        the blue tape not the pink --
                        gimme a little credit, man, I
                        will not mess him up.  Yes, I got
                        the formula... Soy.  Yeah, well,
                        I was up all night, too...

          Bruce turns and finds himself face-to-face with a
          stunningly beautiful black WOMAN.

                                        BRUCE
                          Susanna.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?  I -- I'm so sorry I missed
                        your party last night --

          She notices the stuff in his basket.

                        You're frigging married?

                                        BRUCE
                        I -- what?  No.  I'm not!

                                        SUSANNA

                        Look at you.  You have 'married'
                        written all over you.

                        You are filth. 

                                        BRUCE
                        But --

                                        SUSANNA
                        Never, ever call me again.

          And she's gone.  And every other woman in the parking lot
            unloading her cart is staring at him.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not married...

          They roll their eyes and keep pushing their carts.



          The letter MORPHS and reassembles itself into its original
          state, as Miguel sits outside a freshly-painted PEPTO-
          BISMOL PINK trailer, a Bible and a copy of the photo Johnny
          found, next to him as he writes to his family.  Vision
          Johnny stands behind him, reading over his shoulder.  The
          words on the page are in Spanish, but we hear them in
          English.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reading)
                        Carmen, I am counting the days
                        'til I see you and Miguelito again.
                        My trailer here at the camp is
                        small, but it's big enough for
                        the three of us.  And I painted
                        it your favorite color -- at least
                        it will be now.  The paint was
                        left over from my last job at the
                        Pink Lobster.  Their idea of a
                        tip.

            Johnny/Miguel looks at the trailer which sticks out like
          a sore thumb amongst the sea of broken down, rusted out
            shelters. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only one more month.  I will be
                          waiting.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                          Remember, this is for our boy. 
                        Be safe, my love.          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - ACT TWO - 3/22/05 - GOLD-2  31.



          Johnny's Land Rover stands out like a sore thumb amongst
          the rundown trailers of the migrant workers.  He parks it
          and walks along the narrow dirt roads.  Children play,
          old people sit in front of outdoor fires.

          People look at him suspiciously, wonder why a well-dressed
          white guy is wandering their turf...

          Johnny spots the unmistakably PINK TRAILER from his vision.  
          Goes up and knocks.  No one answers, but he hears noises
          from inside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

          No answer.  He pauses, reaches for the door of the trailer,
          is plunged into a MATCH/MOVE/MORPH --



          Ricky the Coyote's at the door of the trailer, Vision
          Johnny standing next to him.  Behind them, a jacked-up
          pickup truck with lights on top rumbles, thugs in front
          of it silhouetted in the headlights.  Ricky whips the
          trailer door open and inside, several people freeze: an
          OLD MAN, some WORKERS, CHILDREN.  The Coyote grabs the
          old man and drags him out, threatening the others to stay
          away.

                                        RICKY
                        Some white guy came around the
                        bar asking about Miguel.

                                        OLD MAN
                        I don't know anything about it,
                        Ricky!

          As the thugs beat the Old Man, Ricky turns and screams at
          the curious people gathering on the fringes, peering out
          of windows.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - ACT TWO - 1/24/05 - GOLD  33.


    42CONTINUED:42

                                        RICKY
                        You see what happens?  You see
                        what happens when you talk to the
                          gringos?  When I find Miguel, I'm
                        gonna kill him.  You tell him! 
                        All of you!



          Out of the vision, Johnny opens the trailer door.  All of
          the same people are cowering inside, terrified.  The Old
          Man looks like he was worked over pretty bad, his arm in
          a makeshift sling.

                                        OLD MAN
                        We don't know anything.  Please
                        go away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I only want to help Miguel. 
                          Understand?  I want to help him. 
                        And you.

          But they've been scared into silence, give nothing away.
          Johnny turns, shuts the door of the trailer behind him. 
          As he starts walking back to the car, an apparently loony
          OLD WOMAN comes up behind him. 

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        I saw you on TV.  The psiquico.
                        Mi gato is missing.  Can you find
                        my little cat?  Here is his
                          collar...

          Johnny starts to wave her off, but she presses something
          wrapped in a handkerchief into his hand.  He looks down
          at what she has given him.  A Saint's medal.  She puts a
          finger to her lips, mouths "Miguel."  Before he can thank
          her, she's gone.

          Johnny pockets the medal, heads back to his car. 

          ON Eva, the dancer, sitting on the hood.

                                        EVA
                        So why is a rich white psiquico
                        looking for a Mexican?  Your
                          gardener quit?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something like that.  You moonlight
                        as a freelance Salsa teacher?

          She holds her hand out to him to help her off the hood.



          Eva MORPHS into a little girl, she stands over her mother s
          body in the desert, keeping the flies off her.  It s clear
          that the mother is dead, and that the little girl is close
          herself.  She s suddenly lit by a flashlight beam, as a
          large, kind-looking BORDER PATROLMAN  picks her up   and
          she MORPHS into a grown-up agent in uniform.



          Johnny looks her in the eye.  Whispers --

                                        JOHNNY
                        INS.  Excuse me, USCIS.

          Eva raises an eyebrow.  She nods to Johnny to get in the
          car.



          PAN DOWN from the SIGN: OUR LADY OF HOPE to Eva (NOTE:
          ironic comment on Eva being the lady of hope to the
          immigrants) and Johnny walking through the door.



          Johnny stands in the empty alley, watches as Miguel comes
          around the outside of the church.  Eva arrives from the
          other direction as Miguel leaps up onto a fence to scale
          it. 

                                        EVA
                        Pare!  No quiero hacer te dano.

          [Means: Stop!  I don't want to do this, damnit.]  But
          Miguel keeps going.  Her hand shaking, she pulls her gun
          and SHOOTS. 

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Nooooo!

          NOTE: Ideally, HERE'S WHERE WE REALIZE WE'RE IN A VISION
          and this has been Vision Johnny.

          Then Vision Johnny watches himself come running up in
          time to see Eva leaning over a dead Miguel, looking
          distraught.

                                        EVA
                        He went for my gun... There was
                        nothing I could do.

          Vision Johnny can't believe what he's seen and heard... 



          Johnny comes around the corner into the alley.  Just as
          in his vision, Miguel is scaling the fence.  Wanting to
          slow Eva down, thinking fast, Johnny rolls a dumpster
          into her path just before Eva appears so that when she
          does, she has to move around it.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - ACT THREE - 3/22/05 - GOLD-2  45A.

          ON EVA, rushing up to the fence that -- this time -- Miguel
          has successfully scaled.

                        Damn it!

          She jumps on the fence herself, looks over, but he's gone. 
          Before she turns around, Johnny touches the fence.          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - ACT THREE - 1/24/05 - GOLD  46.



          Eva and Johnny are face-to-face.  Now he knows the truth. 
          They're not on the same side.  She's out to kill Miguel. 
          And everyone in that container, too.  And as soon as she
          realizes what Johnny knows, he's dead, too.

                                        EVA
                        You screwed this up.  I should
                        have known better than to trust
                        some bleeding heart head case.

          Off Johnny, sleeping with the enemy...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          Eva, pissed, rails at Johnny as they head to his car. 
          He's trying to think fast, figure out a way to get the
          information he needs to save those people.  And himself.

                                        EVA
                        I had him.  He was this close!

          Johnny reaches for his phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If we call the Sheriff's
                          department, they've got the
                          manpower to search the area --

          Eva reaches for Johnny's phone, clicks it shut with the
          same smiling self-assurance that she showed in teaching
          him to dance. 

                                        EVA
                        I'd rather put my own people on
                        it.  Inter-agency rivalries.  You
                        know, everybody out for themselves.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That could be a problem.

          She's already dialing her cell.

                                        EVA
                                (into phone)
                        The subject just left Our Lady of
                        Hope.



          Eva hangs up, looks at Johnny.

                                        EVA
                        Look, I'm sorry I got so angry. 
                        I just want what's best for these
                        people. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (double entendre)
                        So where do we go from here?

          ON EVA -- she wants to get rid of him.  This is her chance.

          ON JOHNNY -- that'll save his life, but not the others.

                                        EVA
                                  (dismissive)

                        I'll drop you at your office. 
                        After screwing up your plan, it's
                        the least I can do.

          On Johnny, sticking to Eva like glue.

                        I know more than you think.  I
                        know what you went through to get
                        your citizenship.  I know you
                        became an immigration officer to
                        help your people.  But doing your
                        job by the book meant doing things
                        you couldn't live with --breaking
                        up families, sending innocent
                        people back across the border to
                        poverty and death.  So you started
                        working the system, bending the
                        rules.  Turning a blind eye to
                        the coyotes.  But once you opened
                        that door, it was hard to close.

          On Eva, realizing Johnny's powers are for real.

                        What is it, the people in the
                          container in exchange for the
                        father?  A dead woman draws a lot
                        of unwanted attention.

                        It's a numbers game.  One life
                        for twenty.  Even you must see
                        the value in that?

          Eva's gun is trained on him, her voice choked with rage.

                        You don't see what's happening
                        out here.  The bodies that get
                        stepped over like so many grains
                        of sand.

          She's shaking.

                        These people come here to make a
                        better life.  That's why I looked
                        the other way with the coyotes. 
                        But then you came looking for
                        Miguel.  You never should've stuck
                        your nose in, nobody would've
                        gotten hurt.

                        her mother.  A frightened little

          Eva cocks her gun, hand shaking.

                        would save her.

          Johnny pulls out the torn FAMILY PHOTO of Carmen, Miguel
          and the baby, holds the two pieces together.

          do.

          MOMENTS LATER

          This is where, before the trucking era, boats were unloaded
          onto train cars.  We see shipping containers, train tracks,
          old flatbed train cars, rusty old cranes.

          Johnny is marched by Eva at gunpoint along a row of old
          shipping containers.  Looks like Johnny's winning streak
          has come to an end.  Johnny looks up at the rows of
          shipping containers, then at the train cars, is reminded
          of his own toy train set.  And Mikey.

          Ricky, Jose and the thugs step out from behind one of the
          containers.

                                        RICKY
                        What is this?

                        He figured it out.  He knows about
                          everything.

                                        RICKY
                        Doesn't matter now.

                                        EVA
                        I gave you what you wanted, now
                        let the others go free.

                                        RICKY
                        Yes, our agreement.  So why don't
                        you put your gun away.

          Ricky and Eva lock eyes.  She holsters her gun.

                                        EVA
                        You never told me which container
                        it is.

          Ricky nods at the one they're in front of.

          The coyotes unlock it and the the big metal door creaks
          open.  There are CRIES from within as arms reach for help.

                                        JOSE
                        Back!  Back!

          Jose brandishes a gun and the people back away into the
            darkness.  He FIRES A SHOT INTO THE AIR.  We see FACES:
          haggard, starving, dehydrated.  Older people sit on the
          floor.  Women hold small children, crying.

                                        WOMAN
                        Please, please, let us out!

          Ad lib overlapping voices repeating the plea.  ON EVA,
          nerve hit; she responds with anger so as not to scream.

                                        EVA
                        It's okay.  You're going to be
                        fine.  Stay calm.
                                (to Ricky)
                        Let them go now.

          Ricky glances at Eva, then shoves Johnny inside.  He lands
          on top of... Miguel, beaten pretty bad.  Just like in
          Johnny's vision.  Before Ricky can shut the door--

                                        EVA
                        We had a deal.

                        girls.

                        You're making a mistake, Ricky.

                        You made the mistake, chica.

          There's no way she could get to her gun before they would
          fire theirs.

          CLANK!  The door shuts and Johnny and Miguel are locked
          inside.  Just like in the vision.



          Out of the vision.  As Walt begins to swing open the door
          of the container, he is instead bowled over by a rocketing
          Johnny barreling out of the container at top speed.  In a
          single movement, Johnny lunges for Ricky, shouting --

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going for Eva's gun!

          Ricky takes advantage of the distraction to push Roscoe
          aside and grab Eva's gun.  But this time before she can
          wrestle Ricky for it, she's broadsided by Johnny.  As
          Johnny rolls with Eva to the ground, a SINGLE SHOT is
          fired. 

          Reveal Walt, from where Johnny knocked him over, gun in
          hand.

          Ricky lies on the ground, screaming in agony, a hole
          through his shoulder, blood staining his beautiful shirt. 
          Roscoe picks up his fallen gun.

          Eva looks at Johnny as they stand up.  A long look.

                                        EVA
                        For a bad dancer, you've got some
                        good moves.

          As Roscoe and the cops quickly take Jose and his thugs
          into custody, slowly the migrants and Miguel emerge from
          the shipping container, looking dazed but alive.  Welcome
          to America.

          Walt crosses to Johnny.  He checks his watch.

                        Your hour is up.

          Johnny suddenly notices that Walt's shirt is covered with
          orange goo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think that counts as injured in
                        the line of duty.

                                        WALT

                        It was the only way I could find
                        the container.  By the time I saw
                        what Eva was up to, it was too
                        late to stop.

          Johnny looks over to where Eva stands, with Roscoe and
          the other cops and USCIS personnel.  She meets his eye.

                                        WALT
                        What made you think you could
                        trust her?

                        When I saw what she'd been through. 
                        How much she'd lost of herself on
                        that journey.  I knew she wanted
                        to do the right thing, she'd just
                        lost sight of how to do it.

          Eva disappears into a car, taken off for questioning.

          Walt looks across to where a weary Miguel stands talking
          to a few uniformed officers.

          Johnny's look says this part isn't going to be easy.
