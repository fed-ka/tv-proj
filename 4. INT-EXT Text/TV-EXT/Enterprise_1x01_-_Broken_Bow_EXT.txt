               KLAANG, a seven foot tall Klingon Warrior, is running 
               desperately through the rows of corn. We only catch glimpses 
               of him, but we can tell from his breathing that he's running 
               for his life. The BLAST from an alien weapon flashes past 
               him, searing the stalks.

               NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

               Two humanoid FIGURES are chasing Klaang, weapons drawn. 
               We'll come to know that these are SULIBAN --a genetically 
               engineered species with an unusual dappled texture to their 
               skin. They continue to FIRE.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A middle-aged FARMER steps out the front door, looking in 
               the direction of the weapons fire.

               HIS POV (OPTICAL)

               We see flashes of LIGHT and MOVEMENT in the cornfield, as 
               well as a plume of SMOKE from the crashed shuttle.

               THE FARMER

               urgently heads back into the house.

               KLAANG

               breaks into the clear, quickly surveys the scene. He spots 
               a nearby SILO and runs toward it with intent.

               THE TWO SULIBAN

               emerge from the field and see Klaang.

               AT THE SILO

               Klaang quickly opens a large DOOR and steps inside. We hear 
               the door LOCK.

               THE FARMER

               steps out of his house, armed with a 22nd century PLASMA 
               SHOTGUN.

               He runs down the porch steps and heads toward the 
               cornfield...

               THE- SULIBAN (OPTICAL)

               have reached the locked silo door. One of them lowers 
               himself to the ground and proceeds to DISLOCATE his SKELETAL 
               STRUCTURE. His SKULL flattens as his BODY slithers beneath 
               the six inch opening at the bottom of the door.

               THE SILO DOOR

               unlocks from within. The Suliban who crawled inside opens 
               the door and his partner enters.

               WIDE SHOT -THE SILO (OPTICAL)

               Klaang breaks out another DOOR fifteen feet above ground. 
               He LANDS on a nearby SHED, LEAPS to the dirt and draws his 
               DISRUPTOR. He runs twenty feet, spins, and FIRES a single 
               SHOT at the broken door he just came out of.

               BOOOM! (OPTICAL)

               The SILO EXPLODES in a FIERY EXPLOSION!

               KLAANG (OPTICAL)

               who has been blown to the ground, stands and staggers away 
               from the BURNING silo.

                                     FARMER (O.S.) (O.S.)
                         Stop right there!

               Klaang looks up to see the farmer, who is approaching him, 
               shotgun raised.

                                     FARMER (CONT'D)
                              (very nervous)
                         I mean it!

               Klaang, who doesn't understand the farmer, responds in 
               Klingon:

                                     KLAANG
                         Ronuh, t2ag:h oH! Mang: juH!

               The farmer is terrified --he's never seen an alien before, 
               not to mention a Klingon Warrior with a disruptor in his 
               hand.

                                     FARMER
                         I have no idea what you're 
                         saying... but I guarantee you, I 
                         know how to use this.

               Klaang continues to rant as he steps closer.

                                     KLAANG
                         Qag:h DoQ! RIch ghaH!

               The farmer tenses, then FIRES an elongated FLASH of ENERGY 
               which HITS Klaang square in the chest, BLASTING him backward 
               into the corn! OFF the farmer's shaky reaction...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON A STARSHIP HULL (OPTICAL)

               CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly to reveal we're in SPACEDOCK in 
               orbit of EARTH. We only see a small section of what we'll 
               learn is the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE. A tiny ORBITAL INSPECTION 
               POD enters frame and flies along the underside of the hull.


               The orbital pod ROLLS steeply to a 90 degree angle as it 
               continues along the side of the hull.


               The pod gently BUMPS into the hull.


               The 22nd century skyline.


               in orbit of Earth, as before. The Starship Enterprise is 
               docked inside, but just barely visible at this angle.


               A series of futuristic structures set in the Brazilian 
               jungle.


               Twenty or so human college STUDENTS are sitting in an 
               open-air classroom, the lush jungle visible beyond. They're 
               speaking in unison. The refrain they repeat is in a very 
               alien language containing clicks and bizarre guttural sounds.

                                     STUDENTS
                         Ghlungit !tak nekl.ee!c.

                                     HOSHI (O.S.) (O.S.)
                         Very good. Again.

                                     STUDENTS
                         Ghlunit !tak nekleet.

               At this point, we reveal ENSIGN HOSHI SATO, a spirited 
               young woman. Hoshi is an exo-linguist and the Enterprise COM 
               OFFICER. At the moment, she's teaching alien language. On a 
               blackboard behind her, we see alien writing.

                                     HOSHI
                              (prompting)
                         Carlos.

               CARLOS recites the next phrase alone.

                                     CARLOS
                         Ltrunghi !krgltt!

               Hoshi corrects one specific word. She does so with a sound 
               that seems almost impossible for a human to make.

                                     HOSHI
                         !krgltt!

               Carlos attempts to repeat it, but can't quite get it right.

                                     CARLOS
                         !krgltt!

                                     HOSHI

                              (demonstrating)
                         !krltt!

               As Carlos futilely attempts to get the word right, Hoshi 
               notices Captain Archer standing at the back of the class. 
               He's wearing a muted Hawaiian shirt, jeans and tennis shoes.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         Keep trying. You've almost got it.
                              (to all)
                         I'll be right back.

               As Hoshi heads toward Archer...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer and Hoshi are walking along, mid-conversation

                                     HOSHI
                         There's two more weeks before 
                         exams. It's impossible for me to 
                         leave now.

                                     ARCHER
                         You've got to have someone who can 
                         cover for you.

                                     HOSHI
                         If there was anyone else who could 
                         do what I do, you wouldn't be so 
                         eager to have me on your space ship.

                                     ARCHER
                         Hoshi...

                                     HOSHI
                         I'm sorry, Captain. I owe it to 
                         these kids.

                                     ARCHER
                         I could order you.

                                     HOSHI
                         I'm on leave from Starfleet, 
                         remember? You'd have to forcibly 
                         recall me, which would require a 
                         reprimand which would disqualify me 
                         from serving on an active vessel.

                                     ARCHER
                         I need someone with your ear.

                                     HOSHI
                         And you'll have her... in three 
                         weeks.

               Archer removes a small DEVICE from his breast pocket, and 
               taps a button on it. We HEAR the sound of a voice speaking 
               the Klingon language. Hoshi reacts, intrigued.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         What's that?

                                     ARCHER
                         Klingon.
                              (beat)
                         Ambassador Soval gave us a sampling 
                         of their linguistic database.

                                     HOSHI
                         I thought you said the Vulcans were 
                         opposed to this.

                                     ARCHER
                         They are. But we agreed to make a 
                         few... compromises.

               Hoshi listens to the Klingon voice

                                     HOSHI
                         What do you know about these... 
                         Klingons?

                                     ARCHER
                              (seductively)
                         Not much. An empire of warriors 
                         with eighty poly-guttural dialects 
                         constructed on an adaptive syntax.

                                     HOSHI
                         Turn it up.

               Archer taps a control, and the Klingon voice gets louder. 
               As Hoshi listens...

                                     ARCHER
                         Think about it. You'd be the first 
                         human to talk to these people.
                              (beat)
                         Do you really want someone else to 
                         do it?

               Hoshi looks at him, breathes a sigh. They both know she's 
               been hooked.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mooring lines SNAP AWAY in bursts of frozen vapor.


               The great ship is moving out of its berth. On the hull, we 
               see the name ENTERPRISE - NX-01.


               Our first full view of the majestic ship as it clears the 
               dock and moves into open space. Enterprise is lean and 
               masculine, yet its twin warp nacelles suggest the shape of 
               Starfleet vessels to come.


               A crescent of EARTH is seen as the ship BLASTS to WARP.

               REVEAL we're in --


               Streaking at warp. The ship seems to pick up speed and 
               RACES past CAMERA.


               The few remaining lights GO OUT, leaving the ship in total

               This towering, weather-worn, multi-leveled structure looks 
               as though it's been constructed over many decades. It sits 
               among the icy crags of inhospitable ARCTIC TERRAIN. The 
               upper-level is comprised of a series of DOCKING PORTS where 
               ships of varying shapes and sizes are coming and going.  
               Huge plumes of STEAM blast out of GEOTHERMAL VENTS lining 
               the top of the structure.

               CLOSER ANGLE -DOCKING PORT (OPTICAL)

               Enterprise's six-passenger, sub-warp SHUTTLEPOD swoops into

               A ferocious ARCTIC STORM blankets the scene. An ACCESS PORT 
               on the deck OPENS automatically.  We HEAR the roaring sound 
               of the approaching platform. Seconds later, the PLATFORM 
               EMERGES, stopping two feet above the deck.  STEAM blasts out 
               in all directions from the opening below the platform, 
               billowing into the freezing air.

               still covered with sweat from the heat below, react to the 
               frigid wind and snow. Archer jumps off the platform.

                              (over wind)
                         Over here!

                                     T'POL
                              (over wind)
                         No, it's this way!

               Archer quickly weighs the two options, and chooses to go in 
               T'Pol's direction.

                                     ARCHER
                              (pointing, over wind)
                         Come on!

               The four of them start heading toward an obscured shape 
               with two light sources -- what they believe is their 
               shuttle. Archer removes his communicator and flips it open.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (over wind, to com)
                         Lieutenant Reed, this is Archer!

               Come in!

               A beat, then we hear a heavily fritzed voice:

                                     REED'S COM VOICE
                              (unintelligible)
                         ZZZZZZZK-GGGGGGUZZZZZZT

                                     ARCHER
                              (over wind)
                         We're on the roof! You need to get 
                         up here as quickly as --


               Archer and the others still on the move.

                                     REED'S COM VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         gzzzzzzt --zzzzzk

               Archer closes his communicator in frustration as he 
               approaches the two lights. They move closer to the obscured 
               shape... until they see that it's nothing more than an empty 
               DOCKING PORT.

                                     HOSHI
                              (over wind)
                         Great!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (over wind)
                         Like I said, it's over there!

               Suddenly, a Suliban WEAPONS BLAST shoots past them, blowing 
               one of the lights off the docking port!

                                     ARCHER
                         Weapons!

               They draw their pistols and follow Archer across the icy 
               deck...

                                     ANGLE- SILIK (OPTICAL)
                         and two of his men FIRE their 
                         weapons at the distant figures of 
                         Archer and his team, who vanish into 
                         the storm. The Suliban move after 
                         them...

               ARCHER AND HIS TEAM (OPTICAL)

               Running, searching for the shuttle. Suliban weapons fire 
               STRIKES nearby and our team is forced to SCATTER! In the 
               darkened storm, the FIRE-FIGHT takes on an almost eerie 
               beauty. Starfleet pistols firing deep red plasma bullets; 
               Suliban weapons firing hot blue beams; all of it cutting 
               through the swirling snow.


               Our three other people, shivering cold, are looking for 
               cover as

               the Suliban weapons fire strikes around them.

                                     CHARLIE (OPTICAL)
                         ducks behind a low wall, continues 
                         to FIRE back.

               ARCHER AND HOSHI (OPTICAL)

               on the move. Archer has one hand on Hoshi's arm, while he 
               FIRES toward the Suliban.

                                     THE SHUTTLE HATCH
                         is lowering into place

               SILIK AND HIS MEN

               are closing in on our people. Suddenly, a loud ROARING 
               SOUND from

               ABOVE! SILIK LOOKS UP TO SEE -

               ANGLE -A DEPARTING ALIEN VESSEL (OPTICAL)

               is PASSING slowly OVERHEAD! Only its running lights can be 
               seen through the storm. The blast from its THRUSTER EXHAUST 
               blows wildly across the deck!

               SILIK AND HIS' MEN

               squat down and protect their faces

                                     T'POL (OPTICAL)
                         is directly below the passing ship, 
                         caught in its powerful exhaust. 
                         She's KNOCKED OFF HER FEET and BLOWN 
                         ACROSS the slippery deck!

                                     ARCHER AND HOSHI
                         watch the (off-camera) ALIEN SHIP 
                         as it moves away. The roar dies 
                         down. Archer turns to see that T'Pol 
                         is now isolated halfway between the 
                         shuttle and the Suliban.

                                     T'POL
                         is lying on the deck, dazed. She's 
                         alone... unarmed... an easy target.

               SILIK AND HIS MEN

               stand and see the defenseless woman.

                                     ARCHER REACTS (OPTICAL)
                         He turns to Hoshi.

                                     ARCHER
                              (over wind)
                         Get to the ship --now!

               Hoshi moves toward the shuttle. Archer raises his pistol 
               and starts FIRING as he RUNS directly at the Suliban!

               ONE OF SILIK'S MEN (OPTICAL)

               is HIT! Silik and his remaining cohort take cover...

                                     ARCHER (OPTICAL) (CONT'D)
                         reaches T'Pol's weapon and scoops 
                         it up without missing a beat.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (over wind, to T'Pol)
                         Go!

                                     T'POL
                              (over wind)
                         Enterprise needs its Captain! Give 
                         me the weapons!

                                     ARCHER
                              (over wind)
                         I said go!

               Their eyes meet for a brief instant, and T'Pol realizes 
               she's not going to change his mind. She takes off toward the 
               shuttle. Archer provides cover for her, edging toward the 
               shuttle while FIRING

               BOTH WEAPONS!


               Silik and his man are FIRING at the SHUTTLE, which 
               disappears into the storm above. They lower their weapons. 
               Silik turns to his cohort, grim-faced.

                                     SILIK
                              (over wind)
                         We need instructions.

               OFF his concern...


               at warp.

                                     ARCHER (V.O.) (V.O.)
                         Enterprise Starlog, Captain 
                         Jonathan Archer. Date: xxxx.x...


               ENTERPRISE is moving slowly through the orange gas, its 
               running lights cutting through the dense layer.


               ENTERPRISE rapidly ASCENDS into the roiling LIQUID-BLUE 
               LAYER above, vanishing from view. The approaching Suliban 
               CELL SHIP breaks off its pursuit, and heads back toward the 
               distant HELIX.


               THREE CELL SHIPS are patrolling just beneath the LIQUID 
               SURFACE.

               Suddenly, ENTERPRISE BURSTS into the CLEAR! On the hull, 
               two hatches open and a pair of LAUNCH TURRETS emerge, 
               swiveling toward their target. They fire futuristic 
               TORPEDOES, rapid blasts of energy that resemble luminous 
               artillery shells. Their weapons

               STREAK toward --

               THE CELL SHIPS (OPTICAL)

               But our weapons miss their targets. The cell ships return 
               FIRE!


               A CELL SHIP is closing on ENTERPRISE when suddenly --

               DOCKING ARM (OPTICAL)

               is lowering from the Launch Bay on the bottom of 
               Enterprise. Two GRAPPLING DEVICES shoot out of ports on the 
               arm, trailing THIN CABLES!

               THE CELL SHIP (OPTICAL)

               is HIT by the two "grapplers", which magnetically LATCH 
               onto its hull!

               CLOSER ANGLE -CELL SHIP COCKPIT (OPTICAL)

               The cockpit hatch springs open and a SULIBAN PILOT EJECTS 
               from the ship in a blast of vapor! As the pilot TUMBLES 
               through the clear layer below...

               ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

               swiftly ascends into the roiling layer above, REELING IN 
               the cell ship like a spider with its prey!


               Two larger Suliban CELL SHIPS are cruising side by side 
               directly below the blue phosphorous layer. After a beat, 
               they each release inverted DEPTH CHARGES, which slowly rise 
               into the clouds above.


               ENTERPRISE can barely be seen through the murk. The two 
               DEPTH CHARGES rise into frame in the foreground... and 
               DETONATE.


               ENTERPRISE moving slowly through the blue gas. The Suliban 
               CELL SHIP LAUNCHES from the Shuttlebay and heads downward.


               The tiny CELL SHIP descends down past the numerous levels 
               of the HELIX. Other CELL SHIPS, mostly larger, engage and 
               disengage from the huge structure.


               As two CELL SHIPS fly by camera, they each release an 
               inverted DEPTH CHARGE into the clouds above.


               The entire UPPER-SECTION of the HELIX is DISMANTLING. Some 
               sections are huge, comprised of dozens of CELL SHIPS still 
               connected to one another. Other sections are made of only 
               one or two ships. The myriad sections tumble slowly away 
               from the core.


               The tiny CELL SHIP disengages from a large, floating 
               section of the Helix and begins to wend its way UPWARD 
               through the chaos.


               ENTERPRISE is roaring toward us, directly below the roiling 
               blue clouds. Several CELL SHIPS are strafing it, firing 
               weapons. We PAN with Enterprise to see it's heading toward 
               the HELIX, FIRING TORPEDOES as it goes!


               ENTERPRISE veers off, roaring BACK UP into the blue layer!


               Our ship BLASTS into normal space and JUMPS to WARP!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               The gothic towers of the Klingon High Council Chamber rise 
               above the smoggy yellow haze of the teeming capital city.


               in orbit of KRONOS.
