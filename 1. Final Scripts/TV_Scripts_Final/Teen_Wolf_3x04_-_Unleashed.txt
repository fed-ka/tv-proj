                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT11

      THE SHARP TIP of a NEEDLE catches the glare of the overhead 
      light. With a steady hand, Dr. Deaton lowers a SYRINGE to a 
      small TERRIER held still on the table by Scott. 

      The dog s owner, a young man named KYLE, watches with 
      noticeable anxiety.

                                  KYLE
                    It s not going to hurt him, is it?

                                  DEATON
                    Just a little. But, to be honest, I 
                    usually find it s the owners...

      Deaton quickly jabs the needle in. The dog barely blinks 
      while Kyle draws a terrified breath.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    ...who feel the most pain.

      Kyle lets out an embarrassed laugh. Scott picks the dog up 
      off the table, helping him back to the floor.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    All right, we ll let you know if we 
                    find any parasites in the sample. 
                    But my guess is he probably just 
                    ate something he shouldn t have.

      Gently petting the dog as Kyle leashes him, Scott notices the 
      name tag: BULLET.

                                  SCOTT
                    Cool name.

                                  KYLE
                    He s got two brothers at home named 
                    Beretta and Trigger. Military 
                    family.

      Bullet rolls to his back for Scott, exposing his stomach in a 
      submissive pose.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/132.

        CONTINUED:11

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Guess he knows who the Alpha is.

      Scott gives a nervous laugh. He doesn t see Deaton also react 
      to Kyle s coincidental choice of words, but with a look more 
      thoughtful than amused. A look of concern.

      Realizing he s still holding the syringe, Deaton turns and 
      drops it into a bin marked HAZARDOUS.

      EXT. ANIMAL CLINIC/PARKING LOT - NIGHT22

      The door to Kyle s car clicks open. He unleashes Bullet and 
      waits for him to jump into the back seat.

                                  KYLE
                    Let s go, buddy.

      But the dog won t move. Even when Kyle gives him a nudge.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Okay, this part usually happens 
                    before we get to the vet.

      Bullet responds with a soft WHINE. Finally, Kyle picks him up 
      and puts him on the seat. But the moment he reaches to close 
      the door, the dog darts out, racing into the lot.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Hey!

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT33

      Scott pulls the lid off a container marked BULLET and 
      prepares the sample to dilute it. But then he pauses.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey Doc, I think I found something.

      Deaton steps in to look over his shoulder.

                                  DEATON
                    Rinse it off.

      As Scott works, Deaton grabs a tweezer. He uses it to pick up 
      a SMALL, WHITE BERRY from the sample.

                                  SCOTT
                    What is it?

                                  DEATON
                      Definitely poisonous. For the dog, 
                    and actually, you as well.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/133.

        CONTINUED:33

                                  SCOTT
                      Wolfsbane?

                                  DEATON
                    No. Mistletoe.

      EXT. ANIMAL CLINIC/ALLEY - NIGHT44

      A shadow falls across the alley just beyond the Clinic s 
      parking lot. Kyle tentatively approaches, looking about.

                                  KYLE
                    Bullet?

      A SCRAPE turns his head to a DUMPSTER sitting against the 
      wall. Kyle slowly kneels to take a look underneath. Among the 
      shadows, he spots the slightest movement.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    There you are. Come on, little guy.

      He taps the pavement, trying to coax the dog out.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Come on, Bullet.

      With a breath, he finally reaches underneath the dumpster, 
      groping about. Trying to grab hold of the dog when--Kyle 
      snaps his hand back with a CRY OF PAIN.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch. Did you just bite 
                    me?

      He looks at his trembling hand, blood on the palm. When he 
      glances up, however, he discovers an unsettling sight...

      Bullet. Crouched in the far corner of the alley.

      Slowly, Kyle turns his gaze back to the dumpster and whatever 
      it is underneath that just bit him.

      Something moves underneath. A PRESENCE whose shape appears 
      much larger now. It breathes with deep, labored EXHALATIONS.

      Bullet begins to WHINE while the VOICE whispers out from 
      beneath the dumpster, almost inaudible.

                                  VOICE
                    Closer...

      Shivering in the corner, Bullet s cries grow louder. But Kyle 
      doesn t look back. Doesn t even blink.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/134.

        CONTINUED:44

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Come... closer...

      He leans in, seeming almost hypnotized by the pleading voice.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Closer... please...

      Bullet s WHINES escalate to SHARP GROWLS, lips pulling back 
      to bare his teeth. Kyle s eyes remain fixed on the thing 
      underneath the dumpster as he obediently moves--

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    CLOSER.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT55

      A BARKING snaps Scott s head up from his work. It s distant, 
      but alarmingly frantic. Yanking his gloves off, he moves for 
      the double doors, pulling them open and--

      EXT. ANIMAL CLINIC/ALLEY - NIGHT66

      Darting into the alley, Scott barely has a moment to react 
      when Bullet charges toward him. He kneels down and the 
      terrified dog jumps into his protective arms.

      Lifting Bullet, Scott peers about the empty alley. The 
      dumpster pushed slightly out of place. But nothing else. No 
      sign of Kyle. 

      Nothing at all...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY77

      Heels click across the tile floor, the sound echoing 
      throughout the otherwise empty corridor. Nervously clutching 
      the strap of her bag, Jennifer Blake glances behind her.

      After a moment, she starts off again, picking up her pace. 
      Turning the corner with another anxious glance, she moves 
      faster and faster, on the verge of breaking into a run when--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - DAY88

      Blake rushes inside her classroom and slams the door shut. 
      She rests her head against the pane of glass, catching her 
      breath. Then turns around and SCREAMS.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/135.

        CONTINUED:88

      Derek stands right in front of her. Blake grabs a pointer and 
      SWINGS it at his head. He casually ducks out of the way.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    What do you want? You want to 
                    threaten me? Tell me no one s going 
                    to believe me? Try to scare me?
                          (she swallows hard)
                    Kill me?

                                  DEREK
                    I was going to ask if you were 
                    okay.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    Me?

                                  DEREK
                    You.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                      Physically or emotionally? 
                    Although, I guess that presupposes 
                    I was emotionally okay before any 
                    of this and according to my 
                    therapist that s been debatable for 
                    a long time.

      Derek steps toward her, causing her to flinch back. But when 
      he reaches for the pointer, she allows him to take it.

                                  DEREK
                    I think you re going to be okay.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                      Obviously, you ve never taught high 
                    school. In twenty minutes I have to 
                    start two dozen teenagers on The 
                    Crucible and I honestly have no 
                    idea what I m going to say.

                                  DEREK
                    Maybe you should start by telling 
                    them it s an allegory for 
                      McCarthyism.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    Is that a subtle way of suggesting 
                      I shouldn t say anything? Because I 
                    won t.

      He smiles, sets the pointer down and turns to go.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/136.

                                  DEREK
                    I m Derek.

      He opens the door and--

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    Jennifer.

      Derek doesn t turn back. But as he heads out, he does allow 
      himself the slightest of smiles.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY99

      THE HARD TERRAIN-TREADED TIRES of Scott s motocross bike spin 
      to a stop at the racks in the school lot. Yanking off his 
      helmet, he turns when--

      Aiden ROARS in on his motorcycle, pulling up right next to 
      him. Not a second later, Ethan parks on Scott s other side.

      Eyeing their impressive bikes, Scott offers a friendly nod. 
      But it s not returned by either twin. Helmets in hand, Ethan 
      and Aiden head for the school entrance.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY1010

      Amid the rush of boys changing into sweats and shorts, Scott 
      and Stiles whisper at their lockers.

                                  SCOTT
                    We looked everywhere. It s like he 
                    just walked away. Left the dog and 
                    his car.

                                  STILES
                    What if he was a virgin? You think 
                    he was a virgin?

                                  SCOTT
                      Definitely not. Deaton asks me to 
                    have sex with all of the customers. 
                    It s a new policy.

      He smiles, proud of his joke. But Stiles just stares at him.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No, I don t know if he was a 
                    virgin. And why are you talking 
                    about him like he s already dead? 
                    He s missing.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/137.

                                  STILES
                    Missing and presumed dead because 
                    he s probably a virgin. You know 
                    who else is a virgin? Me. You know 
                    what that means? My lack of sexual 
                      experience is now literally a 
                    threat to my life.
                          (starting to unravel)
                    I need to have sex. I need to have 
                    sex like today. Like right now. 
                    Someone has to have sex with me 
                    right freaking now.

      Slamming his locker shut, he turns to face Danny.

                                  DANNY
                    All right, I ll do it.

      Isaac hurries in trying to go unnoticed by Coach.

                    So... work on that.

      Scott notices Isaac s locker is packed tight with clothes.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/FIELD - DAY1111

      THE CROSS COUNTRY TEAM--both boys and girls--gather beyond 
      the fence. Ahead, trails lead into the outlying woods.

      At the STARTING LINE, Isaac kneels to tighten his shoelaces. 
      But then pauses, holding still. Gripping the laces, his hands 
      curl into FISTS as he slowly turns to find--

      Aiden getting into position on his right. Ethan steps in at 
      his left. Both looking on Isaac like an old rival.

      Coach blows the WHISTLE and the twins race forward, moving 
      far faster than any other runner.

                                  COACH
                    Pace yourselves!

      Stunned, Isaac kneels there, motionless. But shock falls away 
      to fury and he rises, bolting forward when--Scott GRABS HIM, 
      yanking him back. Isaac looks at him with eyes GLOWING 
      YELLOW.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/139.

      He shrugs free of Scott s grasp.

                    Isaac, wait--Isaac!

      But he s off, vanishing into the woods ahead. With a 
      frustrated breath, Scott charges after him.

      EXT. WOODS/TRAILS - DAY1212

      Trampling leaves underfoot, Isaac hurtles well beyond his 
      teammates. He spots Aiden up the trail. Then Ethan surges in 
      from the side. Both of them just ahead, just out of reach.

      Isaac races faster, pushing himself to catch up. When the 
      path veers into a fork, however, he slows. Then, finally, he 
      stops. Breathing hard, he glances around and--

      SHOVES FORWARD, hit from behind. Ethan speeds past on his 
      left. Aiden appears, darting off in the opposite direction.

                    Isaac.

      Catching a glimpse of one twin, Isaac starts forward.

                    Still thinking about the girl?

      Isaac whirls again, searching for the voice. But the twins 
      move too fast, disappearing from his peripheral vision.

                                  ETHAN (V.O.)
                    You didn t even know her name, did

      Spinning toward the voice, Isaac launches off a tree trunk, 
      hurtling up. But Aiden grabs him, DRAGGING him to the ground. 
      Ethan yanks him to his feet, easily overpowering him.

                                  ETHAN
                    Aiden, I always forget. How many 
                    bones in the human body?

      Aiden grabs Isaac s arm.

                    I don t know. Let s count.

      Aiden s grip tightens around Isaac s forearm as--SCOTT 
      SMASHES HIS FIST right across the twin s jaw, sending him 
      tumbling to the ground.

                                  SCOTT
                    That s one.

      Isaac wrests free of Ethan while Aiden gets back to his feet. 
      He resets his broken jaw with a painful sounding CRUNCH.

      Isaac retreats back to Scott and the four boys circle each 
      other. CLAWS unsheathe, FANGS snap. A serious werewolf brawl 
      about to go down when--

      SOMEONE SCREAMS.

      They turn their heads at the shrill, terrified sound. Two 
      RUNNERS hurry past, barely noticing them. Hearing others 
      rushing to the scene, Scott moves to follow, pulling Isaac 
      with him.

      They emerge into a CLEARING where the rest of the team has 
      gathered. Among them, Stiles pushes forward to look while 
      Scott steps in beside him.

                    It s him, isn t it?

      Scott doesn t have to see the face to know it s Kyle. Because

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WOODS/TRAILS - DAY1313

      Tearing through the woods, hands pushing aside errant 
      branches, Graeme and other Deputies try to keep up with 
      Stilinski who leads the charge. They breach the clearing 
      where a cluster of teenagers surround the body.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME

      A PANICKED VOICE CRIES OUT from behind them. Heads turn to a 
      girl named ASHLEY frantically pushing her way through.

                    No, no, God no--Kyle.

      Deputy Graeme grabs her before she can get to the body. She 
      struggles, but then finally relents, falling into Graeme s 
      arms in grief-stricken defeat.

      Isaac s gaze remains fixed on Ethan and Aiden who look over 
      Kyle s body with curiosity.   TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1312.

      Hair in a pony tail, sweat dripping from her brow, Cora uses 
      an overhead pipe for pull-ups. Derek watches, impressed but 
      concerned, as she drops to the floor for push-ups.

                                  DEREK

                    them?

      He doesn t answer. So she keeps going, relentlessly pushing 
      herself. Until Derek kicks out one of her arms. Cora hits the 
      floor with a painful SMACK.

      Furious, she s up in a second, swinging her fists at him. 
      Derek blocks each blow with ease.

      Before he can respond, a BEEPING grabs their attention. Derek

                    No, wait--

      She charges the opening door as Ennis BARRELS through like a 
      rampaging bull. He SLAMS Cora to the floor, then looks up at 
      Derek with a fang-toothed smile.

      Kali flips out of the darkness, CLAWED FEET arcing toward 
      Derek. Responding fast, he grabs her ankle and TOSSES her.

      She tumbles through the air, but lands on her feet underneath 
      the PIPE on which Cora was doing pull ups. Ripping it free, 
      Kali swings it around.

      Derek can t dodge it fast enough. Kali CRACKS the pipe 
      against the back of his head, sending him to the floor. When 
      he tries to rise, Kali whips the pipe up and PLUNGES it right 
      through his mid-section, IMPALING him.

      Derek CRIES OUT in agony, causing Cora to struggle uselessly 
      against the more powerful Ennis.

      With a sadistic, sexually charged smile, Kali grips the pipe 
      over Derek who kneels pinned down on all fours.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1315.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/FRENCH CLASS - DAY1515

      Ms. Morrell walks the aisle of her class, sounding out 
      phrases which the students repeat back.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    O  allez-vous?

                    Je vais chez moi.

      Morrell pauses at Allison's desk to find her dead asleep.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                      Mademoiselle? Mademoiselle Argent?

      Allison doesn't stir.

                                  VICTORIA (V.O.)
                    ALLISON.

      Snapping awake, Allison looks up to the white hot glare of 
      her mother, Victoria Argent. But in the blink of an eye, 
      she s gone, replaced by a concerned Morrell.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Allison? Es-tu fatigu e?

                                    ALLISON
                    Sorry.

      She notices the other students staring. Mercifully, the BELL 
      RINGS, sending everyone bolting for the door.   TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1316.

      While Allison packs up her things, Morrell takes the seat in 
      front of her.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    You re starting to concern me, 
                    Allison. Maybe we should chat in 
                    the guidance office sometime.

      Allison waits for the last of the students to clear out 
      before responding.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe you could tell me what you 
                    were doing at the bank the other 
                    night.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Maybe you could tell me what you 
                    were doing there?

      Allison stays quiet.

                                  MS. MORRELL (CONT D)
                    Looks like we have a situation 
                    here. Tell you what. Give me the 
                    French word for it that s the same 
                    in English and you can avoid 
                    lunchtime detention.

                                    ALLISON
                          (thinking)
                    Uh... um...

      Finally, she shakes her head.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Impasse.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/PHYSICS CLASS - DAY1616

      Chalk strikes across the board with swift strokes, revealing 
      the headline for Mr. Harris s class:  Momentum vs. Inertia .

                                  HARRIS
                    All right, being that Inertia is a 
                    subject of which you all know 
                    plenty, why don t we start with 
                    Momentum.

      Scott leans forward to whisper to Isaac seated at the desk in 
      front of him.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1317.

                    There s a reason they re here. Just 
                    give me a chance to figure it out 
                    before you do anything, okay? 
                    Isaac?

      He barely seems to be listening, however. Eyes focused 
      forward while Harris continues.

                                  HARRIS
                    Danny, what do we know about 
                    Momentum?

                                  DANNY
                    It s the product of mass and 
                    velocity. The more massive 
                    something is, the faster it s 
                    going.

                                  ISAAC
                    Mr. Harris, I have to use the 
                    bathroom.

      Harris dismisses him with a wave. Worried, Scott watches 
      Isaac hurry for the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mr. Harris, I have to go too.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY1717

      Barely having gone a few steps from the classroom, Isaac 
      stops. Down the otherwise empty corridor stand Ethan and 
      Aiden. Waiting for him. Waiting for a fight.

      Fully willing to accommodate, Isaac starts forward. Until 
      something odd happens--

      Aiden reels back and PUNCHES Ethan in the face. The twin 
      staggers forward, trying to stay on his feet. While a stunned 
      Isaac watches, Aiden hits his brother again. And again. 

      Grabbing him by the shirt, Aiden SMASHES Ethan against the 
      lockers, bouncing him from one side of the corridor to the 
      other until, finally, he hurls his brother to the floor, 
      sending him rolling to a stop--

      Right at Isaac s feet.

      Classroom doors burst open at the commotion. Harris pushes 
      past students still pouring into the corridor.

                                  HARRIS
                    What is this? What s going on?

      Right behind him, Scott sees Ethan on the floor, bloodied and 
      cowering in front of Isaac. Danny pushes past to help him up.

                                  DANNY
                    You all right?

                                  ETHAN
                    He just came at me.

                    Isaac? What the hell did you do?

      Finding Scott in the crowd, Ethan s bloodied lips part to 
      give him a small, cruel smile while Isaac simply stares back 
      at Harris, utterly helpless.

      Derek kneels on all fours, trying not to move while Kali 
      stands over him gripping the pipe impaled through his chest.

                    Sorry about this, Derek. I asked 
                    Kali to be gentle, but...

                    This is me being gentle.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Sure.

      Deucalion gestures to Ennis who releases Cora. She scrambles 
      back, ready to fight. But Derek s glare stops her.

                    See? We re not unreasonable. But,

                    Feel free to remove her arms. One 
                    at a time.

      Ennis smiles. He likes this idea.

                    What do you want? You want to kill

                                  DEUCALION
                    Kill you? No. You really think I m

                      sociopaths like your uncle. I m a 
                    man with far more vision than

      his glasses and turns his cataract eyes to Derek s.

      Scott follows his look. Down the hall Lydia leans against her 
      locker, flirting with Aiden. Scott s HEARING adjusts, picking 
      up on their conversation.

      In front of the chalkboard on which is written LUNCHTIME 
      DETENTION, Mr. Harris eyes a group of students which includes 
      Isaac and Allison. He points to the first of his detainees.

      Isaac approaches him, trying not to be heard by Allison.

                    Do I have to be with her?

                    not to? Yes, you have to be with

      Isaac turns back to Allison who offers up a weak smile.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY2323

      A GIRL lays a single flower in front of Kyle s locker, now a 
      memorial to the teen. Stiles steps forward, eyeing the 
      various items gathered on the floor...

      Photos of Kyle with Ashley, a perfect looking couple. A 
      picture of Kyle on a skateboard. One in a Raiders jersey. 
      Another with his dog, Bullet.

      returns his eyes to Kyle s locker, still searching for even 
      the smallest of clues.

      Down in the murky darkness of the school s basement, Allison 
      wheels in a cart of boxes while Isaac carries several of his 
      own. They head into the janitor s closet in silence and get 
      to work restocking the shelves. Backs to each other, Isaac 
      bumps Allison with an elbow.

                    you tell anyone I was at the school

                    I d be really happy if you didn t.

                                  ISAAC
                    You being really happy isn t much 
                    of a priority for me. Since you 
                    kind of stabbed me. Like twenty 
                    times. With knives.

                                    ALLISON
                    They were actually Chinese Ring 
                    Daggers, but yeah... sorry.

                                  ISAAC
                    Was that an apology?

                                    ALLISON
                    Would you accept an apology?

      Before he can answer, the door CLICKS shut behind them. They 
      share a nervous look. Isaac grabs the knob and gives it a 
      turn. When he pushes forward, though, the door won t move.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Maybe it locks from the outside?

                                  ISAAC
                    I think something s blocking it.

      Keeping the knob turned, he pushes again. Then turns his 
      shoulder to it, giving a harder shove. But the door won t 
      budge. He steps back, breath tightening noticeably.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1326.

      Isaac SLAMS his shoulder against the door. Then again, harder 
      and harder, anger and desperation taking hold.

      Scott stands at the threshold near a SODA MACHINE pushed

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - DAY2929

      BLACK BLOOD begins to join the RED dripping from Derek s 
      torso, a sight not lost on Cora.

                                  DEUCALION
                    See, the reason I m always invested 
                    in new talent is simple. We all 
                    know a pack is strongest due to its 
                      individual parts.

      He holds the cane broken down to thirds between his hands.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    The stronger the individual parts, 
                    the greater the whole.

      With a flick of his wrist, the cane whips out, extending to 
      its full length.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    When I lost my sight, one of my 
                    Betas assumed I wasn t fit for my 
                    role anymore. He thought he could 
                    take it from me. He was wrong.

      Deucalion pulls the top third of the cane loose.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Killing him taught me something I 
                    didn t know an Alpha could do. His 
                    power was added to mine. I became 
                    stronger, faster, more powerful 
                    than I d ever been. I tested this 
                    new ability to subsume the power of 
                    your own by killing another one. In 
                    fact, I killed them all.

      He breaks down the middle of the cane, reducing it to thirds.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    I took the individual parts and 
                    became a greater individual whole.

      A flick of his wrist. The cane snaps back to its full length. 
      Placing it on the bench, he rises to approach Derek again. 
      Kneeling, he gently touches the young Alpha s face, fingers 
      drawing over every feature.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1329.

                    You ll get to know me, Derek. Like

                    I know you. I know what you are.

      Deucalion pauses at the challenge in Derek s voice.

                    You re a fanatic.

      The word falls on Deucalion like a sour note.

                    Know me? You ve never seen anything 
                    like me. I am the Alpha of Alphas.

      Cane gripped in both hands, his eyes begin to glow behind the 
      dark lenses. His VOICE rises to a DEMONIC RASP, volume almost 
      seeming to shake the walls.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)

                    I AM THE DEMON-WOLF.

      THE RIGHT LENS of his dark glasses cracks under the 
      phenomenal power of his voice. And suddenly, he s perfectly 
      calm again. Gently pulling the glasses from his eyes, his 
      thumb feels over the crack in the lens.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Hate it when that happens.

      He drops the glasses in his pocket and holds out his arm for 
      Kali. She takes it, leading him out with Ennis following.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1330.

      slides shut.

                    So I was thinking what if the 
                    murders come in threes? Ancient 
                    societies love things in threes. So 
                    first it s virgins and then it s--I 
                    don t know--three people who own 
                    little dogs.

                    Maybe it s not your job. You said 
                    it yourself. They were strangled 
                    with a garotte. That s a human

      Allison pushes the start button and the bike ROARS to life. 
      Impressed, Isaac gets on, placing his hands around the grips. 
      Beside him, Allison points to the left pedal.

      Hurrying in behind the other students, Scott raises his cell 
      phone to see the picture of Isaac on the bike. Ms. Blake 
      follows, the last to enter.

                    Okay everyone, I know this is the

                    point. Just--you know--take your 
                    seats.

      Scott grabs a desk next to Ethan. He gives him and his 
      brother, Aiden, a polite nod as he reaches into his backpack 
      to take out a book. He reaches in again for his note pad. 
      Then pulls out a LARGE STEEL FRONT SPROCKET. He sets it down 
      with a CLUNK. 

      Ethan sits up, alarmed. Scott pulls out another GLEAMING

      ENGINE ROARING, Isaac tears down the corridor on the 
      motorcycle. He soars past the locker room, heading right for 
      Aiden who comes hurtling down the stairs. Isaac hits the 
      brakes, SKIDDING towards him. 

      Aiden grabs the handlebars, stopping the bike short. The 
      tires SCREECH and SPIN, kicking up SMOKE.

                    No problem.

      Feet jumping up onto the seat, Isaac flips off the bike and 
      right over Aiden s head. He lands just as the hall fills with 
      teachers and students.

      Blake pushes through the crowd in time to see Aiden turning 
      off the bike, engine sputtering to silence.

      A BLACK PEN sketches out the branches of a leafless tree on 
      the blue-lined page of a notebook. Danny leans over Lydia s 
      shoulder to watch her drawing.

                    Since you re not in Music.

      Danny holds up his trumpet. Confused, Lydia glances among the 
      students, each with musical instrument cases, sheet stands in 
      front of their chairs.

                                    STUDENT (O.S.)
                    Fifteen minutes!

                                  LYDIA
                    What? What s that?

                                  DANNY
                    Fifteen minute rule. The teacher 
                    didn t show up.

      While the rest of the class bolts for the door, Lydia slowly 
      closes her notebook. While Danny follows the last student 
      out, Lydia lingers behind.

      Alone in the empty classroom, she looks over the instruments, 
      the music stands. She spots a TABLET sitting on a table near 
      the piano, still running a program.

      Slowly approaching, she takes a look at the application to 
      find it s been recording for over an hour. Stopping it, she 
      pulls the SLIDER back to listen to a previous moment...

      THE AUDIO WAVES on the application move up and down as the 
      Music Teacher plays. Lydia scrolls forward. More piano 
      playing. She frowns, growing uninterested and reaches to 
      press STOP when--

      THE PIANO NOTES HIT VIOLENTLY. Lydia snaps her hand back from 
      the tablet. The audio drops down. Silence...

      All she can hear now is the sound of her own breathing. She 
      leans closer. Then gently moves the VOLUME SLIDER up.

      Amid the STATIC she begins to hear something strange. VOICES. 
      Like chanting. Musical but plaintive, a chant of desperation. 
      Hundreds of voices becoming louder, rising in pitch, crying 
      out in fear until the chant becomes--

      SCREAMING.

                    from the Celtic Druids. And anyone 
                    who s looked up human sacrifice 
                    knows the Druids had a pretty big 
                    hard on for giving one up to the 
                    Gods. You know who the Lindow Man 
                    is? Two thousand year-old body 
                    found in England? He was strangled, 
                    head bashed in and throat cut. 
                      Three-fold death. They also found 
                    pollen grains in his stomach. Guess 
                    what favorite Druid plant that was?

      BERRIES stuck amid dark green leaves, he sets it down on the 
      examining table for Stiles.

                    to push something away, denying it, 
                    lying about it--it becomes a pretty

                    who should have known better. Do 
                    you know what the word Druid means 
                    in Gaelic? Wise Oak. The Celtic 
                    Druids were close to nature. They 
                    believed they kept it in balance. 
                    They were philosophers and 
                    scholars. They weren t serial

                    Not much, but at least they re not 
                    going to be forming Super-Wolf for 
                    a little while.

                    I still think we should ve just 
                    killed them.

                    We ll kill them next time.

      Isaac smiles, finished stuffing clothes into his bag.

                    How do you get back to Derek s?

                                  ISAAC
                    I walk to the bus stop.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let me give you a ride instead.

      Appreciative, Isaac nods.

      Stiles pulls out a photo of the Music Teacher from an open 
      desk drawer. It s a wedding picture. Arms around his wife, he 
      wears the military dress of an Army Officer.

      with the words:  A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or

      Just past it, alone in the empty room and slashing through 
      tests with a RED MARKER, Mr. Harris glances up as if having 
      heard something.

      VOICES drift toward him. The low and rhythmic sound of voices 
      crying out.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY4242

      Turning the corner in the empty hallway, Isaac follows Scott.

                                  ISAAC
                    I wish I could ve seen their faces. 
                    Did they look seriously pissed?

      Scott stops short.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah. Kind of like that.

      At the other end of the corridor stand Ethan and Aiden. They 
      make a slow, deliberate approach. Ethan casually begins to 
      pull off his shirt.

      Scott throws a worried glance to Isaac. Then looks back to 
      see Aiden STAB HIS HAND into Ethan s back. The two bodies 
      begin to merge, growing in size, bones crunching together, 
      flesh expanding. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Holy...

                                  ISAAC
                    Yeah. It s bad.

      Rising to its full height, the Twin Alpha starts forward. 
      Isaac steadies himself, ready to fight.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    We can take him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you kidding?

      Grabbing him, Scott turns him around to run. But neither 
      moves fast enough. The Twin Alpha lands its powerful hands on 
      both of them, lifting each one right off his feet and 
      SWINGING them together.

      Isaac and Scott SLAM INTO EACH OTHER like crashing cymbals. 
      Then SLAM into each other again. The Twin Alpha whirls about 
      and HURLS them down the corridor. 

      They tumble, sliding to a stop on the floor right near THE 
      TIP OF CANE.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1342.

      CONTINUED:4242

      The Twin Alpha pauses, breath held in fear. 

      Scott pushes himself up to watch the silhouette of the Twin 
      Alpha break back into two bodies while THE MAN WITH THE CANE 
      calmly approaches.

      Pulling the RUBBER TIP from the end to reveal a sharp BLADE, 
      Deucalion raises the cane. Then, in one swift stroke, he 
      whips the blade across both Ethan and Aiden s cheeks.

      They take the cut with only the slightest gasp of pain. 
      Deucalion slips the rubber tip back on the cane and turns to 
      leave. 

      Eyes filled with rage, the twins give a last look at Scott 
      and Isaac. Then follow in silence.

                                  ISAAC
                    Who the hell was that?

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/PHYSICS CLASS - DAY4343

      Deaton glances up from the West Point plaque on Harris s desk 
      to Stiles and Lydia in the otherwise empty room.

                                  DEATON
                    All right, this is just one of many 
                      possibilities. He could ve simply 
                    left for the day.

      Stiles picks up Harris s briefcase from behind his desk.

                                  STILES
                    Not without this.

      Setting it back, his eyes wander to the uncapped RED MARKER 
      atop the tests Harris was grading. One is marked F. One an A. 
      The next a D. But Stiles picks up another paper with a 
      curious look.

                                  DEATON

      Deaton steps between them. He picks up the tests, moving 
      several around to form a word. One with an ominous impact on 
      his expression.

                                  DEATON
                    Stiles, remember I told you Druid 
                    is the Gaelic word for Wise Oak?

                    When a Druid went down the wrong 
                    path, the Wise Oak was sometimes 
                    said to have become a Dark Oak. 
                    There s a Gaelic word for that as 
                    well...

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT4444

      Rain runs down the windows of the loft. Derek concentrates on 
        re-attaching the pipe used to impale him, barely looking at 
      Isaac as the boy questions him.

      Behind one of the broken brick walls, Cora listens to Derek 
      becoming more and more frustrated.

                                  DEREK
                    You re doing something wrong now by 
                    not leaving.

      He grabs a GLASS off the work table and HURLS it. The glass 
      SMASHES against the wall right by Isaac s head. Stunned, he 
      cowers down, hand instinctively moving to his cheek where 
      glass shards may have struck.

      Derek turns away. Finally, Isaac picks up his bag and leaves.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT4545

      At his desk, Scott stares blankly at a textbook. His eyes 
      drift to the window and the rain slipping down the glass. A 
      KNOCK at the door snaps his attention up.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT4646

      Rain sweeps through the trees, pelting down on the head of a 
      shivering figure. He slowly looks up, blinking against the 
      downpour.

      He struggles against the bindings which lash him to a large 
      oak tree. But a thin WIRE tightens against the skin of his 
      neck. It wraps around the tree to a STEEL ROD held by BLACK-

      The hands pause. A moment of consideration. But only a 
      moment. The steel rod makes a final VIOLENT TURN as Harris s 
      eyes widen in shock--

      And the world falls to pitch black.
