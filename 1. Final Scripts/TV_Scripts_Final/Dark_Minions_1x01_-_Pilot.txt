      It s quiet and peaceful -- the curve of KAVNICIA, a 
        luminous pink planet, fills the lower half of the frame.

      An enormous and sinister ship breaks into frame, with 
        appropriate SCARY music accompanying it. This is the GCS 
        EIGHT -- the Galactic Conglomerate Spaceport.


      INT. GCS -- MINION QUARTERS - MORNING22

        We re close on MEL, who s asleep. There s a WEIRD 
        BUBBLING SOUND that wakes him. Across the room, on 
        another bunk, is a GIANT ANT, dressed exactly like MEL, 
        but covered with a blanket. This is ANDY.

                                        MEL
                      Shit! The alarm clock didn t go off!

                                        ANDY

                      Mmmmfr. En ohn.

                                        MEL
                      Yeah. Wait, what?

        Unlike Mel s immaculate area, Andy s side is covered in 
      shit -- band posters, future porn, a schedule of GCS 
        MOVIE NIGHT, etc. 

                                        ANDY

                      No idea what that means...

      Andy removes what we now realize is an enormous HELMET, 
        revealing a pleasantly stoned human face and a cloud of 
        billowing smoke.

                                        ANDY
                      Mel, you gotta try the ant-head. Mission 
                      hot box is go.

                                        MEL
                      You realize we re late for work, right? 
                      (RE: ALARM CLOCK) Wait... No wonder it 
                      didn t go off - why is there raisin bread 
                      jammed in the alarm clock?!       Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    1A.

      INT. GCS -- MAIN HALL -- MORNING33

        The Dark Minions, all dressed in regulation black, are 
        sitting for the morning briefing. DREBNOR, 40s, the 
        ruthless admiral of the Galactic Conglomerate, is 
        addressing his team. Flanking is FELDENBAUM, 40s, junior 
        management for life.

                                        DREBNOR
                      ...make no mistake, the harder those 
                      filthy rebels try to escape our clutches, 
                      the tighter we ll squeeze... and soon we 
                      will crush the so-called League of 
                      Freedom, enslave their planet, and 
                      maintain our rule over the Galaxy. But 
                      only if everyone s giving 110%. 
                      Feldenbaum, that means you. If I ask you 
                      to stay late, I don t want to hear a 
                      story.

        PAN over the Dark Minions -- when we get to the back of 
        the regiment, there is a noticeable empty space where Mel 
        and Andy are supposed to be.


      INT. GCS -- CORRIDOR44

        Mel and Andy hustle down the hallway, pulling on their 
        uniforms.

                      Thursday isn t random inspection, is it?

                                        MEL
                      There s no designated day for inspection. 
                      They re random, Andy. Right there in the

      As before:

                      Those rebel savages down on Kavnicia can 
                      destroy our ships, they can kill our 
                      soldiers, they can spray paint dirty 
                      things on our transports...

                      But they cannot shake our- damn it, why 
                      are you wearing that thing - it s like 
                      you re purposely trying to distract me...

        DREBNOR WALKS OVER TO A SEATED MINION WITH AN ANT HEAD. 
      HE GRABS THE HEAD AND YANKS IT UNTIL IT SNAPS OFF. THE 
        MINION S BODY SLUMPS OVER.

                                        DREBNOR (CONT D)
                      Oh, Jesus Christ, I thought it was a 
                      mask. I just killed an ant guy, didn t I?  
                      Feldenbaum, was he important?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      He ran the Hydrophellium Reactor, sir.

                                        DREBNOR
                      Shit. (HE POINTS TO ANOTHER MINION) You 
                      there... YOU are now in charge of the 
                        Hydro...thing. DON T disappoint me.

                                        DREBNOR
                      Got it, got it, right, shut up. They 
                      cannot shake our resolve ...

                      I don t get it... (referring to a slip of

                      to 0856-C. This is so frustrating...

                      Well, this is 0856-A, so it s probably 
                      next door.

                                        MEL
                      We tried that. That s 0856-C.

                      You re in the wrong sector.

                                        MINION #3
                      Because it s not by sector, it s by 
                      quadrant. So you can have a C room in A 
                      sector as long as it s in the right 
                      quadrant.

                      defeat down on planet Kavnicia. Your 
                      mission is to salvage what you can from 
                      the wreckage of our fighter ships. Un-
                      detonated munitions, spare ammo. Snack 
                      packs. In the event of capture you will 
                      swallow these tablets.

        Using a long, medical tongs, the administrator hands each 
      of them a nasty looking PILL.

                      Yeah, sure. Head down to supplies.


      INT. GCS - SUPPLY DESK88

        A large, gilled, CLERK, with catfish-like whiskers, takes 
        their paperwork, heads to an armored vault and enters a 
        security code. The vault slowly opens to reveal...

        A trove of futuristic plasma guns, high powered lasers, 
        and other alien looking artifacts.

        The clerk comes back to the counter and hands the guys a 
        couple of...

                                        MEL
                      Clip boards? 

                                        CLERK
                      All you need for a recon mission.

                      Can we have something cool? How  bout a 
                      couple of those lasers?      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    7.

                      Work order don t say nothin   bout no 
                      laser. Sign here... and here... and 
                      here...

        Off their utter disappointment...


      EXT. PLANET KAVNICIA - LATER99

        Wreckage from the failed invasion is strewn about. Mel 
        and Andy materialize from thin air.

                                        MEL
                      You okay?

        Andy, hunched over, looks like he may vomit.

                                        ANDY
                      Yeah. Yup. Just need a sec.

                                        MEL
                      Wow. You teleport worse than anybody I ve 
                      ever met.

                                        ANDY
                      I used to get sick in the back seat of 
                      cars. Getting my atoms shot across space 
                      is a perfect storm for esophageal reflux.

                                        MEL
                      You gonna hurl?

                                        ANDY
                      Wait. Can t talk... (THEN) Okay I m good.

      He stands up. And hurls. On Mel s shoes.


      INT. GCS - BOARD ROOM1010

        A dozen executive level minions are seated around a grand 
        conference table. Some humanoid, some alien. FELDENBAUM, 
        a tired, middle-management type, addresses Drebnor.

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      It was a pretty unsatisfying quarter -- 
                      that loss on Kavnicia REALLY hurt us on 
                      the books -- if we don t step up our 
                      devastation and our enslavement numbers, 
                      The Galactic Overlord is going to, erm, 
                         restructure our human resources.       Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    8.



                                        DREBNOR
                      What does that mean?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Business jargon. Most of us will get 
                      sucked through the airlock. Some will be 
                      fed to that weird alien down on F sector.

                                        DREBNOR
                      The one that looks like an octopus with 
                      fangs?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Yeah.

                                        DREBNOR
                      We don t want that. OK. Good to know. 
                      Next on the agenda?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Well sir, our plans to utilize the new 
                      super weapon...

                                        DREBNOR
                      Good! Yes. Is the Planet Buster fully 
                      operational or what?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      The device is ready, sir, but we ve hit a 
                      bit of a snag. It seems... well, sir, it 
                      seems we can no longer refer to it as a 
                       Planet Buster. 

                                        DREBNOR
                      Why not? I like that. I came up with 
                      that.

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Turns out there s a company in the outer 
                      rim that has a device called a Moon 
                      Buster.

                                        DREBNOR
                      Well, that s not the same thing.

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Apparently legal thinks it s close 
                      enough.

                                        DREBNOR
                      So what are we supposed to do, destroy an 
                      entire planet with a generic, unnamed 
                      super weapon? It s an embarrassment.      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    9.

                      Well... how about  World Whacker? 

                                        DREBNOR
                                (unimpressed)
                      Mm-hm.

                                        DREBNOR
                      I don t love it.

                      Eh. Too cutesy. Are we destroying a 
                        civilization or throwing a birthday 
                      party?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      Well sir, the plan was to destroy a 
                        civilization on your birthday.

                                        DREBNOR
                      Didn t we do that last year?

                                        FELDENBAUM
                      No, last year we launched a puppy into 
                      the sun. Per your instructions.

                                        DREBNOR
                      Right, right. Okay, lemme think - 
                      everyone shut up for a second. We ll call 
                      it... the... uh... Apocolytron... no... 
                      the Devastronator - nah, that s a 
                      mouthful... oh, here it is... shh... 
                      shush... here we go...

        Everyone is on the edge of their seats. Finally...

                                        DREBNOR (CONT D)
                      No. Nothing. Damn. DAMN IT! Okay, how 
                       bout this - rev up the device with no 
                      name - aim it right at planet Kav-dick-
                      and-balls and blow it into a thousand 
                      tiny bits... maybe that ll get our

                      just dispatch a reconnaissance team, 
                      should we wait for them to return?      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    10.

                      Eh. They knew the risks. Send the 
                      families a gift card. Now, then. Next

                      Looks like one of ours. Better log it and 
                      fill out the appropriate forms.

                      Sounds like a lot of work. I have a

                      We found these uniforms on some of the 
                      scum that invaded this sovereign planet.

                      Look, if we were bad guys, wouldn t we 
                      have weapons?

                      Exactly. No lasers. No plasma guns. All 
                      we got are these crap clipboards.

                      Well, they wouldn t find anything. 
                      Wreckage. Couple dead bodies.

      He gestures blandly at a corpse nearby. Carly goes over -- 
        gun still trained at our heroes. And she kicks the corpse 
      in the head. We can t see it, but it sounds like a foot 
        going through a canteloupe. Mel and Andy react

        A ramshackle underground lair -- stark contrast from the

      like it smells pretty bad. Not a lot is getting done.

                      It s so easy to get complacent. I used to

                      Oh, and the people we just met will die. 
                      That also sucks.

      INT. GCS -- COMMISSARY - NIGHT1818

      Andy and Mel are in line for food.

                                        MEL
                      I keep thinking about Carly. I wish there 
                      were some way to warn her.

                                        ANDY
                      Aw, dude, look, in a few days we ll be on 
                      the other side of the galaxy. Don t do 
                      this to yourself.

        A CARELESS MINION throws a cup in the trash.

                                        CARELESS MINION
                      Oh, should I have recycled that?

        A SECURITY HORN blows, everyone but the Careless Minion 
      gets on the ground, hands above their heads, prison-yard 
        style. MINION #1 and MINION #2 from earlier appear and 
        place a scary looking SHACKLE-HELMET-THINGY over his 
        head. As they lead him away:

                                        MINION #1
                      Listen, punk, we might be enslaving the 
                      universe, but we RECYCLE on this ship. 
                      It s just common sense.

      They lead him away. Everyone gets up. Business as usual.

                                        MEL
                      I feel like if I could just get back in 
                      touch with her somehow, she can escape 
                      before they destroy the planet. And who 
                      knows, maybe we can ... grab coffee ...

                                        ANDY
                      I don t know man, I ve never had a long 
                      distance relationship that s worked. My 
                      limit is three light years between me and 
                      the girl.

        Mel checks to see no one s in earshot.      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    21.



                                        MEL
                      Andy, you ve gotta help me break into the 
                        communications network and set up a video 
                      conference with her before we re out of 
                      range. You re better at that technical 
                      crap than I am.

                                        ANDY
                      Are you nuts?! Okay, first of all, it s 
                      not like calling the pizza guy - those 
                      networks are monitored 24-7. And second, 
                      she may be adorable, but technically she 
                      is rebel scum. Maybe you didn t get the 
                      memo, but commiserating with the enemy is 
                      grounds for execution. 

                                        MEL
                      Yeah, I got that memo.

                                        ANDY
                      Oh. (THEN) Did you get the one about 
                      turning the thermostat down when you 
                      leave your quarters?

                                        MEL
                      Yeah. It was the same memo.

                                        ANDY
                      We gotta start doing that. Turns out -
                      also punishable by death.

                                        MEL
                      Look Andy, I understand if you don t want 
                      to help me. It s risky, I know. But I ve 
                      spent my whole life playing it safe. And 
                      you know what? I m tired of living in 
                      fear. So if that means breaking the rules 
                      to find just a little happiness, I 
                      welcome the possibility of death. Okay, 
                       welcome  is a little strong, but damn 
                      it, Andy, I intend to get back in touch 
                      with that adorable little traitor one way 
                      or the other!

                                        ANDY
                      Ah, fuck... Come on, I know someone who 
                      might be able to help.

      he makes an on-air announcement. He is half-Pekingese, 
      same mustache and everything.      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    22.

                      is D.J. Wormhole and you re listening to

      D.J. Wormhole takes off his headset and waves the guys 
        in.

                      Hey Andy, that Kathoobatine weed you 
                      gifted me was intense. I wound up 
                      sleeping with a giant insect.

                      The sex was great, but I woke up in a 
                      cocoon. What brings you guys to the cave?

                      I was hoping you could do me a favor.

                      happen.

                      We need to broadcast to a restricted

                      Not a chance. Great seeing you, though. 
                      Lemme know if you need any Plutonian 
                      Reds, I gotta case of the stuff. They 
                      make me drowsy.

                                        MEL
                      Please, Mr. Wormhole, it s an emergency. 
                      The life of someone very dear to me is at

                      Yeah, that s touching and everything, but 
                      the penalty for broadcasting to a 
                      restricted area...

      INT. BRIDGE - DAY2424

        Drebnor holds court -- a bottle of champagne at the 
        ready.

                      Like a lot of you, I was just a little 
                      kid with a dream. I wanted to go places, 
                      meet people, destroy civilizations. And I 
                      stand before you LIVING PROOF that if you 
                      want something bad enough, and can raise 
                      enough capital to hijack a political 
                      campaign and form a space junta, anything 
                      is possible.

        Polite applause from all.

        Everyone chuckles. Feldenbaum looks genuinely moved.

                      wretched hive of losers and send little 
                      chunks of it to other planets as a
