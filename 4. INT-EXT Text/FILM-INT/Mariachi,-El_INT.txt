The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his
PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and
walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so
CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping
peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the
tin cup between the entrance bar.
The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit
up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the
block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and
one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of
scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the
cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while
chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a
small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and
continues writing.
The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his
partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.
Azul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks
business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and
looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.
Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one
has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then
back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around
the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him.
Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El
Moco.
MOCO (V.O.)
Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this
is?
AZUL
(into phone)
Moco... What the hell do you want after
all these years?
Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his
barred window.
AZUL
(into phone)
There's something going on outside. Is
this a double surprise? Are you getting
me out today, Moco?
There is no response from Moco.
The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone
approaching the door.
Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down
the hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the
wall, peering out to see what happens next.
4.
The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge
wad of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner
(still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars.
Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth.
AZUL
(into phone)
There are two men here with guns. Did you
send them?
Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The
Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a
corner.
The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter
Azul's block and scope out the cells.
The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun
from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the
sink. He stands ready to fight.
The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat
cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he
sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them
before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his
buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his
cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them.
The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so
they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin
exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The
Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying
his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty
cell, closing and locking the door.
Azul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number
is automatically redialed.
Moco answers.

AZUL
(into phone)
I'm still here, Moco. And so are your
little friends. But not for long. They
have something they want to scream to
you. Listen close, because you're going
to repeat it to me when I come to visit
you.
The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell.
Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is
holding the phone at arm's length into the cell.
The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming,
they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing.
As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the
magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a
wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.
Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS
as ge makes
his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him
back. He sits
on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying
his guitar
case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks
around the
place, as if sizing it up.
BARTENDER
What do you want to drink?
MARIACHI
Refresco.
The other drinkers stare at him.
Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-
shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.
Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes.
Mariachi is served his drink.
MARIACHI (CONT'D)
No hay musica?
BARTENDER
(cleaning a glass)
Why?
MARIACHI
I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play
beautiful ballads, old classic ballads,
on an old-fashioned guitar.
BARTENDER
So what?
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
MARIACHI
I could add a little class to this place.
I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly
off tips. But I need steady work, and I
can guarantee bringing in more customers.
BARTENDER
(nodding)
Tell me, why would I need one little
guitar player when I've already got a
full band?
Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.
The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small
draped table.
The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on
his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and
rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big
show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...
... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.
The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds
like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses
another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and
waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns
accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.
Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender
who seems to enjoy it.
The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.
BARTENDER (CONT'D)
(nodding with satisfaction)
There you see? Either I can pay one guy
to sound like a full mariachi band...
Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his
full drink. He looks disappointed.
BARTENDER (CONT'D)
... or I could spend the same money only
get one little guitar player...
Understand?
MARIACHI
(walking away)
Thank you, sir.

BARTENDER
You want to earn a living? Get a real
musical instrument.
The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left
behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say
no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES
at the table.
They all shake their heads no.
The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.
Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the
four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa.
The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his
mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom.
The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down.
The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does
the Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh.
BARTENDER
(laughing and rolling his eyes)
What the hell is this, mariachi day?
There is no work for you here!
Azul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down
a bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops
smiling.
AZUL
Bartender... one beer.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
The Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. He begins to
fill up at the tap.
AZUL (CONT'D)
(without looking at him)
In a bottle, wey.
Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full
glass for a moment, then drinks the beer.
Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.
The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.
BARTENDER
Ready.
Azul doesn't pay attention to him.
AZUL
I'm looking for an old friend of mine.
His name is... Moco. Do you know where I
can find him.
MAIN MEAN DUDE
You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place.
AZUL
So you know him?
MAIN MEAN DUDE
We work for him.
AZUL
That's too bad.
Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places
the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused.
AZUL (CONT'D)
Hold it please.
Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two
Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.
The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.
Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the
other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode,
causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly
everywhere.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He
manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes
die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is
smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case.
Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding
the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's
barrel.
The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as
the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll
across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring
out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door
slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the
toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He
takes a deep breath and rushes out the door.
The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper
in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.
The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.
The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-
bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The
camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding
the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops
dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it
with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul,
standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.
Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and
runs back inside the bathroom.
Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another
weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm
like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the
bathroom.
The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass
full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots
ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.
Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks
calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case
and leaves.
A few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and
furiously dials.

The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.
The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the
phone.
Azul walks right up to the Bartender.
The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle
popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty
guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.
CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.
The Bartender glances down at the bottle.
CLOSEUP of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as

A few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there. You

You hear Moco's voice through the phone. The camera dollies
into the Bartender as he screams into the receiver.
The camera dollies in to the corpses...
Mean Dude #5 enters the lobby where an OLD CLERK is sitting
at the counter reading a yellowed newspaper. There is a pit
bull on the floor beside him.
MEAN DUDE #5
Da me telefono.
VIEJO CLERK
(without looking)
Take it.
Mean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He
glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor.
MEAN DUDE #5
Pit bull?
VIEJO CLERK
Yeah, pit bull.
The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He
pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it
on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then
slowly crosses their names out.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
Dead?
The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also
glances up.
MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)
(into phone)
All of them? How long ago? OK, What does
this guy look like?
Clerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still
paying attention, though.
An inside shot looking out of the front glass reveals
Mariachi looking at his wallet as Mean Dude talks to the
phone. No one notices him.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
... carries a guitar case... And what was
he wearing?... all black...
The Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window. Seeing
Mariachi, he gets up and walks to it.
Mean Dude hangsup the phone. He writes a few more things. He
turns to leave.
MEAN DUDE #5
Gracias seor...
As he passes the camera you can see Mariachi still playing
with the dog. Inside view CLOSEUP of Mariachi tapping on

The Mean Dude turns around and looks and looks at the Clerk.
Clerk turns to look at Mean Dude, who is walking back to the
counter.
Mariachi picks his guitar from the ground. He is in full
view, but no one is looking at him.
MEAN DUDE #5
Viejo, if you see anyone new in town,
carrying a guitar case, dressed in
black... you can call this number, OK?
Mean Dude writes down a phone number and the description of
Azul on a little card.
VIEJO CLERK
(nodding sarcastically)
And if I don't call, you'll kill me...
MEAN DUDE
(handing him the card)
No. I won't kill you... he will...
The sarcastic smile fades from the old man. Mean Dude walks
away. The old man reads the card, then glances out the
window. Mariachi is gone.
MARIACHI / MEAN DUDE #5 OUTSIDE HOTEL
Mariachi is turning a corner just as Mean Dude #5 exits the
hotel. The Mean Dude walks off in the other direction.
Mariachi opens his room, tosses his guitar onto the bed and
hangs his jacket in the closet. He has only his white T-shirt
underneath. He glances above the bed to a plaque bearing a
mace and two crossed swords. He checks out the shower and
washes his face in the sink. He sits down on his bed. A few
seconds later he drops back and lays there a minute before
kicking the door shut. He tries to sleep.
The Old Clerk is talking on the phone to the bad guys. He
hangs up the phone, then reaches into the back of his counter
for a gun. He places it on the counter and covers it with his
newspaper and continues reading.
Top shot of Mariachi sleeping. A shot of the mace on the
wall.

holding the ball tight against the chest. Mariachi glances
around to maybe spot more people, before concentrating on the
Boy.
The Boy places the ball carefully on the ground, then gently
rolls it to Mariachi.

Mariachi bends to get the ball which makes the sound of a
screeching truck as it hits Mariachi's foot. Mariachi notices
that it's a man's severed head.
Mariachi bolts up in bed.
The men burst into the lobby and the old men tells them the
room number. They run out into the courtyard with the old man
following. The Pit Bull is uninterested in the action.
Mariachi is sitting on his bed listening to all this. He
bolts to the restroom and turns to the shower.
Mariachi rushes out of the bathroom towards the door.
MARIACHI'S POV
As camera nears the door, doorknob starts
to move. Remembering that he never locked
the door, he jumps to the side of the
door as...

Low-angle shot as men burst in. There is no one in the room.
Mean Dude #5 hears the shower and motions to keep it down and
stalk quietly... They rush into the bathroom and start
blasting.
Mariachi slips out from behind the door and runs out.
The dog watches as Mariachi tosses his keys into the cubby
hole where they belong. Mariachi then jumps over the counter,
banging keys on the register to get it open.
Mariachi, unable to open the register, jumps over the
counter.
CLOSEUP of his feet as he lands, causing the register to
burst open.
Mariachi truns for a second to ponder gettin ghis money or
risking dying, but then he checks to turn and run. Two
seconds later the Mean Dudes run in, one jumps over the
counter to see if he's there.
19.
Camera dollies into the guitar case on Mariachi's bed.
Mariachi enters the lobby and winks at the old Clerk who is
standing over his open register in shock. His eyes widen when
he sees Mariachi. He runs out of the hotel.
VIEJO CLERK
(screaming, pointing inside)
PENDEJOS!!!
Mariachi rushes in, grabs his jacket and puts it on. He grabs
his guitar case and squeezes it tight, his eyes shut. Slow
dolly into him, as his eyes open.
CLOSEUP of plague on wall with mace and swords. He grabs the
mace, swining it around a few times. He feels secure, now. He

Mean Dudes barrel down the hallway reloading the guns.
Mariachi stumbles through city streets, pausing against a
telephone pole as he gazes at Domino's Saloon across the
street.
Mariachi stumbles across, almost getting hit by a few cars,
and drags himself into the saloon.
Mariachi staggers into Amadeus and washes his face in a
fountain by the door. He makes his way to the bar as a patron
pays and leaves.
DOMINO
What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much
refresco?
MARIACHI
I just killed four guys.
Domino turns around and looks at Mariachi, wondering hard is
he's joking. He lifts up a bloody hand, grabs a napkin, and
then seems to ask permission with his eyes before wiping his
hands clean.
DOMINO
Is it true?
Mariachi nods an ashamed yes.

Domino reaches for her gun under the counter.

Wait a minute... what's your name?
DOMINO
Domino.
MARIACHI
Wait a minute, Domino! It was self-
defense.
She cocks the pistol.
MARIACHI (CONT'D)
(frantic)
I'm new in town. I don't know everyone!!!
I have no friends here... and no enemies.
DOMINO
(lowering the gun a bit)
Thieves?
MARIACHI
(nodding)
No way. They were well-dressed men. I
checked into the cheapest hotel in town,
no money, nothing of value, except this
guitar and maybe this coat, which they
could have taken when I left my room, but
they didn't. They were only interested in
killing me.
DOMINO
(lifting the gun back up)
So why do you come here? You want to get
me killed?
MARIACHI
I need a place to stay until I figure
this out. They've got me mixed up with
someone else.
DOMINO
And you've never seen them before? Not
even in another town?

MARIACHI
(long pause)
Are you saying they followed me, a
mariachi, here? What for?
DOMINO
Maybe they hate your music.
Mariachi stares at her expressionless. She stares back at
him.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
Maybe you were singing in another town,
they hated your voice, and now they're
trying to kill you.
MARIACHI
Are you serious?
DOMINO
(nodding)
Yes.
She laughes.
MARIACHI
Are you going to help me, or am I gonna
have to die on your porch?
DOMINO
I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't
touch anything. I'll be up after awhile
and we can call a friend of mine.
Mariachi shakes her hand.
MARIACHI
Thank you. I'll never forget this.
He tries to kiss her hand. She slides it away and
effortlessly slaps him.
DOMINO
This way.
He follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase.
When he enters, the darkness swallows him as she shuts the
door behind him.
Mariachi enters a roomy, luxurious apartment above the main
bar.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
There is a free-standing porcelain tub in the center of the
room. Mariachi places his guitar halfway between the entrance
and the tub. The camera is tracking backwards with him as he
walks, making th room look endless. He removes his jacket as
he makes his way to the tub. He drops his jacket onto the
floor and gently climbs into the tub. The camera faces him as
he settles back. The camera slowly dollies into him as he
lays back, crosses his fingers, and gives a relaxed smile.
Domino is washing a glass. She the then remembers she has the
gun in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back
under the counter. Wounded Mean Dude #5 comes in limping. She
takes out a towel and drops it on the counter.
MEAN DUDE #5
Good morning, Domino.
DOMINO
What happened?
MEAN DUDE #5
Give me the phone. I have to call Moco.
She brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was.
He picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it.
MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)
It's not as bad as it looks. Domino, has
anyone come through here? A stranger,
maybe?
DOMINO
This is a border town. I get strangers
all the time.
MEAN DUDE #5
Dressed all in black, carrying a guitar
case?
DOMINO
No.
MEAN DUDE #5
Well, he shot me... and has killed ten of
Moco's men... all in one day.
Domino looks a little upset. She slides the phone towards him
a bit.
DOMINO
Aren't you gonna call your boss?

MEAN DUDE #5
(nodding)
I have to tell Moco that he got away
again... So, you better give me a drink
first.
Domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. He
laughs and drinks. As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino
as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing
upstairs.
MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm.
Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy
is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I
didn't get a look at him. So, unless he's
still carrying that guitar around and
hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot
him, and I don't think he'll be that
obvious...
MOCO (V.O.)
Don't worry. If there's one thing I know,
it's that he'll always wear black and
he'll always carry that guitar with him.
It's his signature. Besides, that's not a
guitar he's carrying. It's a guitar case
full of weapons. Find him.
Mean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands.
DOMINO
Que paso
?
MEAN DUDE #5
I screwed up. The guy left his guitar
case in the hotel room. We chased him
out, but he came back for the case.
DOMINO
Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably
an antique.
MEAN DUDE #5
It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case
full of weapons that he uses on his
victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And
thanks for the drink.
Mean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand.
(CONTINUED)
26.

MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D)
If you see this guy, call us.
He is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns
back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if
granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and
when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the
stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar,
grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant
to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up
to. She storms upstairs.
Domino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a
bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and
sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and
walks to the counter.
DOMINO
(friendly)
I thought I told you not to touch
anything.
MARIACHI
Sorry. I needed to relax. I can...
DOMINO
(smiling)
No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want
shampoo?
MARIACHI
(laying back, closed eyes)
Yes, please.
Domino turns to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like
she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She
puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious-
looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks
over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one
hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his
eyes wide. The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll.
DOMINO
Who are you?!
MARIACHI
(choking)
I'm a musician!

The shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops.
Domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the
case toward her.
DOMINO
What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?
Mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering
her as if wondering if all this is really happening.
MARIACHI
No! My guitar!
Domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of
the latches with her toe.
DOMINO
We'll see...
She unsnaps another. The latches snap loud and echo in the
quiet room. Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
You're very modest, Mariachi...
She squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
(through gritted teeth)
You told me you killed four men, when you
really killed seven. Or were they still
breathing even after you shot out their
hearts?
Another latch snaps.
MARIACHI
(groing dizzy)
I'm a mariachi...
SNAP!
MARIACHI
... not a murderer...
SNAP!
DOMINO
Aren't you going to watch?
She lifts the lid with her foot. It seems an eternity before
the case is fully open. Domino is looking into the case, but
Mariachi is not. He knows what's in there.
(CONTINUED)
28.

MARIACHI
I told you... I am a musician.
Slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept
classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she
almost believes he is telling the truth.
She rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi.
He catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is
on the other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down
between Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug.
DOMINO
Play it.
MARIACHI
(still choking)
W...w...what?
Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces
horribly.
DOMINO
Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!
Mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses
for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as
if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a
sweet little melody.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
(growing impatient)
SING!
Mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts
over, playing a "Rancho Grande" sounding song with his own
made up words.
MARIACHI
(in a high sweet voice)
What is this place? That treats me like a
murderer? They've all got their heads up
their butts... Even this beautiful girl,
With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss
her or hit her... Or both?
He finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary
audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out
of the water and wipes it off on her apron.

She laughs.
MARIACHI (CONT'D)
Hire me.
Domino looks at him with a silent "what?".
MARIACHI (CONT'D)
I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar.
I'll work mostly from tips. But, I need
steady work.
DOMINO
I couldn't pay you. I have no money.

This fancy place and you have no money?
DOMINO
It's the truth.
MARIACHI
I'll work for room and board, then.
Please, I'm desperate.
DOMINO
(thinking)
Will I have to keep a knife at your balls
to get you to play like that?
MARIACHI
(smiling)
Not if you're paying me room and board.
Please... until I find a permanent job.
DOMINO
(thinking)
You won't find a permanent job in this
town... but OK.

She gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles
back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and
slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on
her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look
of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
You're going to need a better sense of
humor than that, if you're gonna work for
me, kid.
She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She
shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs.
Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips
out of the wall and clangs to the ground. Mariachi jumps
again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture
fades.
Mariachi plays in Amadeus.
Camera tracks past a pool table where TWO RATS are playing
nine ball. They make a few shots, then the phone rings. The
camera continues to track past a small table where Azul's
guitar case lies open. Weapons adorn it, with each knife,
each gun in its pocket, in its own place. The camera
continues tracking to a dresser on which sits Azul's cellular
phone. A delicate female hand lifts the receiver. The camera
is now positioned above the bed as the GIRL answers the
phone.
GIRL #1
(into phone)
Yes? One moment please...
He rolls over and wakes a GIRL sleeping beside her. Girl #2
takes the phone and passes it to a third GIRL as Girl #2
tries to wake Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3.).
Girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for
background conversation.
The two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three
Girls in Azul's bed. They look hungry and deprived. One hits
the other, signaling it's his shot. While one shoots, the
other watches.
Azul awakens and grabs the phone.

AZUL
(into phone)
Yeah.
Domino walks by with a trash can. Mariachi is sitting on a
barstool.
MARIACHI
I need to get my money back from that
hotel. I'll be right back.
DOMINO
Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with
that jacket and that case you could be
killed. Leave that stuff here.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
Mariachi gets up and is about to get his guitar case from
under the stool.
Mariachi leaves it under the stool and takes off the jacket.
MARIACHI
I never go anywhere without it. Take care
of it.
Mariachi leaves. Domino drops the trash can and tells her
assistant to watch the bar. She heads for the staircase.
Domino walks out onto her balcony, peering down into the
street.
POV shot of Mariachi walking through the street.
Domino turns and walks to the phone. She dials a number by
heart and sits in a plush chair.
DOMINO
(dolly in slow, into phone)
Hi. It's Domino.
MOCO
(into phone)
I know who it is...
Dolly into Moco.
The Clerk is reading a paper. He hears a noise and pulls it
aside. Mariachi is standing at the counter smiling. The Clerk
jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets
down his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key.
Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and
makes the money sign with his hand. The Clerk slowly moves
over to the register. He depresses a few keys to open it. It
won't open. He makes a gesture like it's stuck or something
(he is not very convincing). He tries again and again; each
time pretending to get more impatient.Mariachi glances down
at the Pit Bull. The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he has an inside joke with
the dog ("this guy..."). Mariachi climbs over the counter and
stands next to the Clerk. The Clerk things Mariachi is a
lunatic. Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the Clerk
for a demonstration. Mariachi then leaps over the counter
landing firmly back on the other side of the counter.
CLOSEUP of his feet landing hard, just as before.
The register opens. Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into
the register, taking his money out himself. He counts it.
After a brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man
a tip. Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out. The
old man, still standing there with his arms outstretched as
if he was robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men.
The bar Assistant is cleaning the bar. He walks over to grab
a few glasses and when he returns, Azul is sitting at the
barstool Mariachi was on earlier. The Assistant looks around,
wondering where Azul appeared from.
ASSISTANT
Can I get something to drink or eat?
AZUL
One beer.
The Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap.
He fills it halfway when...
AZUL (CONT'D)
In a bottle, wey.
ASSISTANT
(laughs)
Sorry.
He grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug,
toasts and drinks it straight down.
Azul drinks his straight down, too.
AZUL
(looking around)
Isn't there a girl that works here?
ASSISTANT
Yeah, she owns the place.
AZUL
(heading a few bills to the
Assistant)
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
AZUL (CONT'D)
She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's
girl?
ASSISTANT
(looking around)
So-so. She's onto this new musician.
Azul takes out a few more bills and hands them to the
Assistant, and begins to stand up.
AZUL
Thank you.
Mariachi runs inside and checks to see if his case is still
there. Domino comes downstairs.
MARIACHI
I just saw a guy with a guitar case like
mine. It's him they want.
DOMINO
(to Assistant)
Did he say anything?
ASSISTANT
(nodding)
No, he just ordered a drink.
MARIACHI
I don't look anything like him...
Domino, Mariachi, and Assistant are standing at the bar.
DOMINO
Look, as long as you don't carry the case
around, they'll leave you alone. It's
that guy they're after.
MARIACHI
(putting on his coat)
I better put this upstairs...
He grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs, but he
pauses for it feels different to him. He slowly looks down at
it.
Mariachi shakes the case, and puts it on the counter as if to
open it... but he doesn't need to check it. He knows it's not
his guitar.
DOMINO
What's wrong?
Mariachi looks at her startled, then runs out of the bar with
the case.
The camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a
Rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. The other Rat is
pacing back and forth in front of the sitting Rat. Azul
enters the room. Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table
as a grand entrance gesture. The sitting Rat stands beside
the pacing Rat.
RAT #1
I'm sorry we left...
RAT #2
... We didn't know what to do...
RAT #1
... We figured you could defend
yourself!!!
Rat #2 nods in agreement. Azul unsnaps one of the latches.
SNAP!
AZUL
You thought I could defend myself...
SNAP! SNAP!
AZUL
... against three armed men...
SNAP!
AZUL
... using this?
He opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them. The Rats
exchange glances. They look at the guitar then back at Azul.
AZUL (CONT'D)
My case got switched with some maricon
mariachi!
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RAT #1
Where is this mariachi?
AZUL
He's dead by now... So, I want you to go
look for my case.
The two Rats are about to leave.
AZUL (CONT'D)
Leave me a weapon.
Both Rats take out their guns. Azul takes Rat #2's gun.
AZUL (CONT'D)
That was disloyal of you to leave me out
there. You should be as loyal to me as
you are to each other.
The Rats exchange glances, then aim their eyes back to the
floor. Azul turns to Rat #2.
AZUL (CONT'D)
Are you loyal?
RAT #2
(after glancing at Rat #1)
Yes.
AZUL
(to Rat #1)
Are you loyal?
RAT #2
Yes.
Azul gestures to Rat #2.
AZUL
Then shoot him.
Rat #1 turns to Rat #2 who is in shock.
AZUL (CONT'D)
You are loyal, are you not? SHOOT HIM. Or
I shoot you.
Azul aims his gun at Rat #1, who immediately aims his gun at
Rat #2. Rat #2 is sweating bullets. Rat #1 puts his gun down.
RAT #1
I can't.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED: (2)
AZUL
Why not?
RAT #1
You said we should be as loyal to you as
we are to each other. I couldn't shoot
him, for that would be as disloyal as
shooting you.
Rat #2 glances back and forth between Rat #1 and Azul.
AZUL
Very good. Now go find my case.
Azul puts his gun down and motions the rats to leave. They
leave. When they exit, Rat #1 turns to Rat #2 and snaps his
fingers. Rat #2 shakes his hand. They leave.
Domino is dabbing hydrogen peroxide onto a cotton swab. She
applies it to Mariachi's body scars on his back. Mariachi has
his eyes closed. He washes the blood from his face.
MARIACHI
Where were you when he came into the bar?
DOMINO
I was on the phone, talking to a friend
that knows what's going on.
MARIACHI
Did you mention me?
DOMINO
No... He told me the man in black is
Azul.
MARIACHI
If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear
blue?
DOMINO
I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the
men of the town drug dealer. The dealer's
name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco.
MARIACHI
And Moco is sending these men to find
Azul. So, why do they chase me?
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
DOMINO
They have never seen Azul... only Moco
knows him. My friend says the description
Moco gave his men was that he wears
black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds
like you, no?
MARIACHI
Couldn't you tell your friend that there
are two people like that in his town? One
is a killer, and one is a mariachi.
DOMINO
Only special people can talk to Moco.
Besides, you've killed a few of his men,
now. Your best option is to keep out of
sight, stop wearing black, and to hide
that stupid case until this is all over.
Mariachi is about to lay on the floor. She tosses him a
blanket.
MARIACHI
Are you always closed Monday nights, or
did you close since I can't play my
guitar tonight?
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
DOMINO
Mondays are my day off. Want to play a
game?
MARIACHI
Sure.
The phone rings. Domino gets up to answer it. Mariachi
reaches under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his
hair, putting spit in his hair to slick it down. He quickly
stashes the mirror.
DOMINO
(into phone)
Hello?
MOCO
(into phone)
Come see me.
DOMINO
(into phone)
I can't.
MOCO
(into phone)
Please.
Moco is sitting at a table playing cards.
DOMINO
(into phone)
I don't feel well. I've got to go.
MOCO
(into phone)
Have you ridden the bike?
DOMINO
(into phone)
No... I've got to go...
She hangs up.
MARIACHI
Boyfriend.
DOMINO
(quiet as if thinking)
No...
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARIACHI
I can't figure out something. You tell me
you're poor. Poor family. Yet you've got
this place.
DOMINO
(sighing)
This place is a gift.
MARIACHI
From who?
DOMINO
From Mauricio.
MARIACHI
From Mauricio? The man trying to kill me?
DOMINO
He's not trying to kill you, his man had
you confused with Azul.
MARIACHI
Same thing.
DOMINO
Look, you now how if you want to impress
a girl, you send her flowers, candy,
jewelry until you win her love?
MARIACHI
Yes.
DOMINO
If one present doesn't work, you keep
sending bigger and better things until
you win her or you're broke?
MARIACHI
Correct...
DOMINO
Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then
jewelry, then he gave me a job at his
saloon, then he gave me the whole
saloon... etc.
MARIACHI
He's still giving you things?
DOMINO
He'll never run out of money.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARIACHI
And you accept it all? What's the last
thing he sent you?
Domino walks over to the counter and picks up a key.
DOMINO
A motorcycle.
Mariachi laughs.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
He wants me to ride out to his ranch when
I've decided to be his. He thinks he's
close to having me.
MARIACHI
Is he?
DOMINO
(pause)
He was.
She sits next to Mariachi.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
Not anymore.
They kiss. She gets up and is about to turn off the lights.
MARIACHI
So, you really are from a poor family.
CLICK!
DOMINO
(in the dark)
I remember when I was growing up, we were
so poor, that my brothers and sisters and
I all slept on the same blanket stretched
out across the floor. We had to sleep in
a circle, with our fingers in each
other's ears, to keep the bugs from
crawling into them.
MARIACHI
(after a pause)
Ay, wey...
Domino laughs.
46.
Domino hands Mariachi a wad of money.
Mariachi sees the money and looks up at her bewildered.
DOMINO
Here's a little bit I've saved. I want
you to go get a new guitar.
Mariachi starts to put up his hand as if to refuse it.
DOMINO (CONT'D)
Take it, stupid. I'm not saying go by the
best one, just a temporary one so you can
play again tonight.
Mariachi stops and thinks... He looks up at her
questioningly, then he shrugs an "OK" and grabs the money and
jogs out excitedly. Domino is smiling.
Domino is waiting on customers. She glances at her watch. A
few seconds later she glances at it again. She looks very
worried.
Azul's Rats burst into the hideout. FOUR GIRLS pop up over
the partition with guns. The Rats stop in their tracks. The
girls sigh a "oh, it's them" sigh and slink back to bed. Top
shot of them trying to wake Azul. Azul wakes up and looks
over the partition.
AZUL
Where's my case?
RAT #1
We couldn't find it.
RAT #2
We heard they caught you and were taking
you to Moco's ranch.
RAT #1
... so we came to see if it was true.
Azul thinks a moment. He stands up.
AZUL
They caught the mariachi.
Azul dresses, smiling...
Mariachi is in a holding cell at the ranch. He twitches,
finally waking up.
He sees a GUARD outside and finds a way to escape.

He grabs the guard's assault rifle and turns a corner. Two
men grab him. He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the
wind and teeth out of BAD GUY #1, then he kicks down and
breaks the shin bone of BAD GUY #2 who screams out in agony.
Mariachi silences him by karate punching his throat. The Bad
Guy gurgles and hits the ground.
Angle from the ground as Mariachi smashes the guy with is
gun.
He crawls up a wall, trying to escape as quietly as he can.
He sees TWO MORE MEN running towards him since they heard
some noise. Mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue Chevy
parked behind him. He fires and it explodes.
Mariachi jumps Loco, gets him to drive him to the saloon. He
also takes Loco's money.
Azul goes inside and finds Domino tending the bar.
DOMINO
What can I get you?
AZUL
One beer.
She grabs a bottle and slams it down on the counter unopened.
He eyes her admirably and then pops the top with one hand.
He guzzles the drink, slamming it down empty.
DOMINO
Anything else?
AZUL
(nodding)
My guitar case.
DOMINO
Where's Mariachi?
AZUL
Where's my case?
DOMINO
Upstairs.

AZUL
Get it.
Domino grabs another beer for him and runs to get the case.
(In between this time, Mariachi escapes with Loco.)
She returns, slamming it to the floor.
AZUL (CONT'D)
If you want your mariachi back, come with
me.
DOMINO
Why will you help me?
AZUL
Because you know where Moco's ranch is...
I don't.
Domino calls her Assistant.
AZUL (CONT'D)
You help me, I'll help you.
DOMINO
Let's go.
They leave. The Assistant tends to the bar.
ROAD TO MOCO'S
They drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck. Little do
they know, they passed Loco's truck with Mariachi crouched in
the passenger seat. He gets up after the truck passes.
Mariachi didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he
could have turned around and kept her from going to Moco's
ranch.
They arrive at the gate and het out of the truck.
DOMINO
(over the gate)
Mauricio!!
Azul grabs Domino and points a gun to her head. He whispers
to her...
AZUL
Play along...
He kicks at the gate.

AZUL (CONT'D)
Open the gate or she's dead!
The gate opens and we see Moco standing at a three-quarter
stance, flanked with his men on both sides. Azul drags Domino
in and faces her at Moco with a gun to her head.
MOCO
(to Domino)
I'm sorry he used you to get to me,
Domino.
Azul cocks the pistol.
MOCO (CONT'D)
Azul, let her go and you'll get your
money.
AZUL
Moco, give me my money or I ruin your
clothes with her blood.
Moco signals his men to get the money.
DOMINO
What have you done with Mariachi?
MOCO
Who?
DOMINO
The musician your men confused with Azul.
MOCO
(staring at her)
So that's why you were busy that night...
Azul is glancing between Domino and Moco.
MOCO (CONT'D)
... you had that little monkey climbing
all over you.
AZUL
Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!!
MOCO
After all I've done for you, this is how
you treat me?
DOMINO
I never asked you for anything until now.
Let Mariachi go.

Azul is anxious now.
AZUL
I swear I'll kill her!
MOCO
No you won't. I will.
Moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart. She falls
limp in Azul's arms. Azul tries hold her up, but she's dead.
Azul rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering
why it's all come to this.
AZUL
All I wanted was my rightful share. But
you've got to kill everybody.
MOCO
You feel sorry for her, don't you? See,
that's why you can't ever be as big as
me.
Azul slowly looks at Moco.
MOCO (CONT'D)
(aiming gun)
Because you have too much heart.
Moco shoots Azul in the heart. Azul had his hands to his
side, and now he falls to his knees. Moco shoots him again,
and Azul dies next to Domino.
Mean Dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others. No one
seems to be on Moco's side.
Mariachi runs into the bar...

Looking for you.
Mariachi is about to race upstairs.

Mariachi tries to make sense of it all for a minute before
grabbing the gun from under the counter and rushing upstairs.

MARIACHI ON THE ROAD TO MOCO'S
Mariachi barrels down the road on the motorcycle.
