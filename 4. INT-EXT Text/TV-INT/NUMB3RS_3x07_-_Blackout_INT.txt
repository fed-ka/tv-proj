  Empty foyer.  The SOUND OF KEYS in the lock... and the door 
  opens.  DON enters with FBI Special Agent LIZ WARNER.  
  There s a heat, an attraction between them as they hover near 
  the partially-open door, saying good-night.

                                WARNER
                I owe you, Eppes.  You saved my 
                night from being a total disaster.

                              DON
                Blind date s risky business.  Bound 
                to get stood up sooner or later.

                                WARNER
                But let s keep this quiet, huh? 
                Word gets out I use an Internet 
                dating service, I m gonna take some 
                serious crap.

                              DON
                I find it hard to imagine you 
                taking crap from anyone.

                                WARNER
                Take away my badge and gun, I m 
                just like anybody else...
                      (then, sly smile)
                 Course, you try and take away my 
                gun I m likely to kill you.

                              DON
                See?

  A beat of silence.  Thick.  Yeah, there s chemistry here.

                                WARNER
                Thanks for dinner.

  She leans in, kisses Don innocently...  But then they kiss 
  again.  And again.  Then another.  Building momentum...

                                WARNER
                You sure you wanna do this?  You re 
                gonna complicate this settled life 
                of yours...  This prosecutor 
                  girlfriend...

                              DON
                It s already complicated.

  There s no stopping now.  They re kissing, groping.  Don 
  presses her against the door, shutting it.  And we go --


  CAMERA FINDS Don s gun and badge discarded on a chair.  
  Warner s badge and gun lay on the floor...  Reveal Don and 
  Warner on the bed.  Don s on top of her, still in the build-
  up, kissing, groping, the last of the clothes coming off...  
  As the heat builds, a CELL PHONE RINGS on the bedside table.

                              WARNER
                Mine or yours...?

  Don raises to see a blinking light.

                              DON
                Mine...

  He slides out of bed, finds the phone, answers --

                      (into phone)
                Eppes...  Alright.  Meet you there.
                      (hangs up, turns)
                I ve gotta go.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)            NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    4.

  He starts dressing.

                              WARNER
                You got my clothes off, now you re

                      (beat, pulling on clothes)
                What if I come back later...?

                              WARNER
                I have to get up early...

                              DON
                How early?

  She smiles at his persistence, offers him an option.

                              WARNER
                I m locking the door at midnight.

  A charged look between them.  Then Don goes.


  Late, after hours.  Don enters the war room.  MEGAN and COLBY 
  are already here, putting together a FILE.

                              DON

  He puts a PHOTO up on the plasmas, DMV shot of Randy Syles.

  As the Agents get busy, Don checks his watch, reacts -- 
  12:04.  Too late to get back to Warner s house...

  Off Don, as he follows the others into action --


  CHARLIE and LARRY are at the table, assembling a CONTRAPTION 
  out of wire, pencils and aluminum foil - reminiscent of an 
  Erector Set.  

                              LARRY
                You re winding the wire too tight.

                              CHARLIE
                It s not too tight.  You didn t 
                leave enough room with the foil.

  ALAN appears --

                It s not a toy.  It s an

                              LARRY
                There s still some very serious 
                  disagreement as to how exactly it 
                  operates...  Biefeld-Brown effect, 
                  ionization of the corona wire, or 
                simple dielectrophoresis...

                Let s see what happens when we 
                apply a little current...

  Larry turns the dial on the attached transformer.  The 
  contraption levitates off the table, floating in air.

                              ALAN
                Wow, that s amazing...  But unless

  The front door opens.  Don enters.  He sets his things down, 
  notices several partially-burned candles around the room.

                Case I m working; someone blew a

                              ALAN
                Mission Hills?  Seems strange we d 
                be effected way out here, doesn t 
                it?

                              LARRY
                Not really.  It s called a 
                  precautionary broad-line reduction.  
                  Operators shut down the power until 
                they can restore balance.

                              DON
                The balance of what?

                              CHARLIE
                The thing you have to remember 
                about electricity, unlike other 
                  resources, it can t easily be 
                stored.  Generally, it has to be 
                consumed within milliseconds of 
                being produced.

                              LARRY
                Which means for the power 
                  companies, it s a constant game of 
                balance between electricity 
                  production and its consumption.

                              CHARLIE
                When the substation in Mission 
                Hills failed, there would have been 
                a surge in other areas... 

                              ALAN
                      (following)
                So operators strategically shut 
                down large areas until they can 
                restore balance.

                              DON
                What if they didn t?

                              LARRY
                Worst case scenario..?  A cascading 
                failure.

                Remember the game JENGA?  The tower 
                of wooden blocks?  Well, the 
                  substations are just like the 
                  individual blocks...

  AUDIENCE VISION - A JENGA game, blocks stacked along 
  alternate axes, creating a tower.  As a HAND removes one of 
  the blocks, and the tower remains standing --

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                There s enough redundancy that many 
                of the blocks can be removed or 
                knocked out, without a great affect 
                to the system as a whole...

  A HAND selects another block, starts to remove it --

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                But, if the wrong block, or in this 
                case substation, is taken out, 
                  especially after the network s been 
                  weakened...  then the entire system 
                could come crashing down...

  The Tower of blocks collapses into a chaotic heap.

                Exactly.  Fifty million people left

                short time...

                              KARI
                Since the strike.  The pay was so 
                much better than his usual job.

                              COLBY
                Do you know if he received any 
                threats for crossing the picket 
                lines?

                              KARI
                He tried to keep it from me... but 
                he got calls, I know he did.  
                That s why he started working at 
                night.  He figured there was less 
                chance he d run into trouble.
                      (then)
                You really think someone killed him 
                for trying to earn a living?

                We don t know yet.  But emotions 
                run high during a strike.  People 
                see their livelihoods threatened...

                              KARI
                Someone had to do the work.  
                  Otherwise people would be in the 
                dark.  Like the station that failed 
                two nights ago.  Wasn t one of 
                  Robby s... but he said that was 
                just poor maintenance...

  Megan glances to Colby, then back to Kari Syles.

                              MEGAN
                There was another substation 
                  failure...?

                              KARI
                That s what Robby said.  In Boyle 
                  Heights...


  Megan reports to Don --

                              MEGAN
                Night before last, Renault Energy had 
                another substation go down.

                              DON
                What do we know about it?

                              MEGAN
                Renault blamed it on wear and tear.  
                With the strike, they can t meet 
                  maintenance schedules. 

                              DON
                Yeah, well, I don t believe in 
                  coincidence. 

  Charlie, just entering --

                              CHARLIE
                Why not?  Coincidence is, after 
                all, an absolutely valid 
                  mathematical occurrence...

                This one s not math, Charlie.  This 
                one s my gut.  Two substation 
                failures in two nights.  I m 
                willing to bet they re related.

                              MEGAN
                If they are, then Randy Syles 
                wasn t the target last night.  

                              CHARLIE
                They re after the substations...

                              MEGAN
                Doesn t rule out the striking workers 
                as suspects.  Every blackout is bad 
                PR for the power company, helps the 
                union s bargaining position.

                              DON
                PR isn t my concern.  My worry is 
                they ll be able to crash the entire 
                grid?  Charlie, what d you call it?

                              CHARLIE
                  A cascading failure.

                              MEGAN
                But to do that they d have to knock 
                out all the substations, right?

                              CHARLIE
                No.  Just the right one.

  Beat as that sinks in... and Charlie thinks.  Then --

                              CHARLIE
                You know, if a cascading failure is 
                what they re after, I might be able 
                to predict where the next attack 
                will come...

                              DON
                How?

                me usage and current-flow figures 
                from the power company, a Load Flow 
                Analysis could tell us which 
                  substations are the most critical, 
                those that would most likely be the 
                next target...

  Don sees Liz Warner approaching from the direction of the 
    elevators, wraps up the conversation --

                              DON
                Alright, Charlie.  We ll get you 
                what you need. 

  Don turns, as Warner reaches him.  She smiles, holds out a 
  pair of SUNGLASSES.  Like before, there s HEAT between them.

                                WARNER
                You left these last night.

                              DON
                Must ve fallen out of my jacket.

  Don takes the sunglasses, glances over, aware of Megan and 
  Charlie nearby.  As Charlie heads out, and Megan gets to 
  work, Don takes Warner aside.

                              DON
                We ended up being here pretty late 
                last night...

                                WARNER
                You don t have to explain.

                              DON
                In case you were wondering.

                                WARNER
                  I appreciate it... but I really did 
                just come by to return the glasses.
                      (then)
                I ve got a meeting upstairs in 
                about...
                      (checks her watch)
                ...well, about now, really.  So I 
                gotta run.

                              DON
                      (re: the sunglasses)
                Thanks for these.

  She starts to go, then stops, takes a step closer, quietly.

                              WARNER
                Don t get me wrong, Eppes.  I 
                wouldn t say  no  to a rain-check.

  Another look, then she goes.  Don watches her a beat... then 
  moves back toward his desk.  Megan looks up.

                              MEGAN
                Quick visit.

                              DON
                She was just returning my glasses.

                              DON
                  Everything s fine.

  Megan waits for more info.  None comes.  Conversation over.

                Give us a minute, Charlie.  We just 
                found Lyle Donahue.

                        (anticipating)
                And did you talk to him?  Did he 
                tell you?

                He s dead, Charlie.  Somebody shot 
                him.

                              DON
                Which means we re dealing with a 
                larger price-fixing conspiracy than 
                we thought - investors maybe...

                              CHARLIE
                This doesn t have anything to do 
                with price fixing.

                What do you mean, Charlie?  What do

                At first they appeared disparate

                them in the context of set theory, 
                I found they had a lot in common.
                      (off their looks)
                Lemme just show you.

  Close on a large map of Los Angeles as Charlie spreads it out 
  across one of the tables.

                              CHARLIE
                There ve been three substation 
                attacks.  Each of those caused a 
                blackout over a particular region. 

  Charlie lays a clear overlay onto the map - a shaded area.

                              CHARLIE
                This is the area hit by the first 
                blackout - the Boyle Heights 
                  substation failure.
                      (another overlay)
                The second, here.  Caused by the 
                outage that killed the maintenance 
                  worker...  And the third...

  He places the third overlay on top of the others.  

                              MEGAN
                The three blackouts overlap.

                              CHARLIE
                That s right, and to a 
                  statistically significant extent. 

                              DON
                So three nights in a row, this 
                area s been blacked out...

                              CHARLIE
                That was Donahue s objective.

  Don and Megan peel back the overlays, look closer at the map.

                              DON
                Charlie, we re looking at most of 
                downtown here.  Any way you can be 
                more specific, narrow it down?

                              CHARLIE
                This is the best I could do with 
                what I had.

                              MEGAN
                Wait a minute.  What about these?

  She goes and grabs the sheets of calculations recovered at 
  the scene of Donahue s murder, hands them to Charlie.

                              MEGAN
                These were in Donahue s car when we 
                found him.

                area he was trying to black out?  
                If we knew where, it might tell us 
                why.

                              CHARLIE
                I m going to need to go over them.

                figure out who else Donahue was in 
                bed with, who might ve killed him.

  Megan heads out toward her desk.  Charlie rolls up his maps, 
  readying to go.  Don eyes him a moment.  A beat.

                              DON

                Don, I m sorry.  I had no business 
                telling him about Agent Warner.

                              DON
                You re right about that.

                              CHARLIE
                I just thought... I don t know...  
                You and Robin seem to get along.  
                You ve been a lot happier...

  A beat.  Whatever anger Don might ve been holding subsides.

                              DON
                  I appreciate the thought, Charlie.  
                But you and Dad don t really know 
                what s going on...

  Off Don --


  The sheets of calculations from Lyle Donahue s car are tacked 
  up on the boards, Charlie s own calculations beside them.  
  Larry looks on.

                              CHARLIE
                None of the substation attacks 
                directly caused the downtown 
                  blackouts.  They were too far out -
                  Silverlake, Mission Hills, Boyle 
                  Heights...

                              LARRY
                No, the blackouts were due to the 
                  broad-line reductions.  The 
                  operators shut the area down.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    38.

                              CHARLIE
                Right.  So Donahue did all these 
                  calculations in order to predict 
                the human operators  response to 
                his attacks.  Got to admit, it s 
                pretty impressive...

                              LARRY
                  Impressive, yes.  But it doesn t 
                get us any closer to discovering 
                his intended target, does it?

  Charlie sets down his chalk, frustrated.

                              CHARLIE
                I ve done every single permutation 
                I can think of, gone over and over 
                the three substations he attacked.  
                I can t narrow it down.

                              LARRY
                      (then, thinking aloud)
                Charles, what about the other 
                  substations that effect downtown?

                              CHARLIE
                He didn t choose the others.

                              LARRY
                That s precisely my point.  Why 
                not?  Presumably because they 
                wouldn t result in a blackout that 
                included his target.

                              CHARLIE
                      (getting it)
                An exclusionary approach.  Run 
                  calculations on the other 
                  substations, see what area of 
                downtown is omitted...

                              LARRY
                And, I might point out, it s a much 
                more powerful approach than what 
                you ve been working with.

  from earlier (2nd scene, act 3)...

                              CHARLIE
                Turns out there are 12 substations 
                whose failure would directly or 
                  indirectly cause a blackout 
                  downtown...  

  AUDIENCE VISION - As Charlie s map animates.  Downtown and 
  the surrounding area fills the screen.  Three OVERLAYS fall

                  Overlaying the boundaries of the 
                three blackouts gave us an initial 
                target area.

  Where they overlap, the large,  vague  target area from 
  earlier emerges, glowing brightly...

                We re working on that.  As soon as

                What about the power failure 
                scenario we were discussing...?

                              BAKER
                There s no denying it.  Everything 
                here runs off electricity.  Cells 
                open and close electronically.  The 
                locks are automated.  We rely

                the blackouts...  You had no

                So the blackouts were a way to 
                cover a hit, allow another inmate 
                to get close enough to Tabakian to

                And besides, we know the blackouts 
                didn t impact prison operations.

                              DAVID
                They run on diesel.

                Okay, a facility that large...

                empty.  Then a fourth blackout 
                would put them in the dark.

                Yeah, but they d never let the 
                tanks run dry.  They d just order 
                more fuel, get an emergency

  Still undetected, the Gang Soldiers make there way through 
  the corridor until they reach a door at its end.  A silent 
  nod between them, then the first opens the door --


  The Gang Soldiers emerge into a the open corridor, suddenly 
    encountering an unsuspecting Guard.  The Guard, unarmed, goes 
  for his radio.  Before he can get to it, PFFFT! PFFFT! two 
  silenced rounds take him down.  

  As two Gang Soldiers stash the Guard s body, the other two 
  break off in a new direction...


  IVAN TABAKIAN, in wrist cuffs, is escorted down the hall by 
  two Guards, one on each arm.  They re entirely unaware of the 
  eminent danger...


  We find Don and the other Agents as they emerge from the 
  service corridor into a main hallway.  They look back and 
  forth, wary.  Don spots a pair of guards watching over an 
  inmate cleaning crew, runs toward them...

  holster, only to realize it s empty --


  Our Agents, moving fast as the alarm blares.  Don yells to a

  Gang Soldiers #1 and #2 pound up the stairs.  They reach the 
  next landing, and as they go for the door.  BOOM!  A SHOTGUN 
  blast from a level above nearly cuts them down.

  The Gang Soldiers return fire from their automatics, dropping 
  the Shotgun Guard above.  Then they go through the door...


  Gang Soldiers #3 and #4 appears, look around quickly.  No 
  Guards visible.

  Just up ahead is the door marked  Attorney Room.   

  The Soldiers close fast on the door.  They raise their guns, 
  and after a brief look between them, they bang inside...


  The Soldiers enter to find the table has been turned on its 
  side.  Whoever is in the room is clearly hiding behind it...

  The Soldiers enter further, raising their guns, rounding the 
  table.  They re completely unaware that Don and the other 
  Agents are already here, lying in wait behind them.

  BAM!  Colby COLD-COCKS Soldier #3, taking him out as Don and 
  David swarm Soldier #4, quickly driving him to the ground, 
  gun to his face.

                Don t move, you hear me?  Not a

  an anxious Tabakian.

                Alright.  Let s make a move.

  As Warner passes, Don pulls his back-up pistol from its 
  holster, holds it out to her.  As she takes it...


  David and Colby exit the Attorney Room first, guns ready, 
  checking to make sure the area is clear.

  Just then, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE as Soldiers #1 and #2 burst 
  from the stairwell.  Don grabs Verano as --

  Megan turns, takes Soldier #1 out, but not before he gets off 
  a shot that hits Tabakian.  Tabakian goes down...

  tackling her out of the way...

  Colby and David fire on Soldier #2, taking him out...  They 
  approach the downed Soldiers, kick their weapons away...

  reading.  The door opens.  Don enters, surprised to see them.

                              DON
                What is it with you two and staying 
                up all night?

                              ALAN
                Charlie told me what happened 
                tonight.  We were worried.

                              CHARLIE
                Dad was worried.  I just waited up 
                so I could savor an  I told you so  
                moment while it was still fresh.

                              DON
                Didn t we cover this at my office?

                              CHARLIE
                      (playing)
                Did we?  There was a lot going on.  
                  Accusations about my math being 
                wrong...

                              DON
                      (rising above it)
                Alright, Charlie, if that s what 
                you need, fire away.  Say it.

                              CHARLIE
                I told you so.

                              ALAN
                Alright.  That s about as much 
                  brotherly love as I can take.  I m 
                going to bed.

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, I should probably hit it too.

  They turn to go.  Don calls after them --

                              DON
                Before you do...
                      (as they stop, turn)
                This thing with you guys, and who 
                I m dating and not dating...

                              CHARLIE
                Look, Don, we re sorry--

                              DON
                        (interrupting, blunt)
                Robin broke up with me.  Last week, 
                before all this other stuff...

                              CHARLIE
                You got dumped?

                              DON
                I didn t get dumped.

                              ALAN
                Donny, I m sorry.  What happened?

                              DON
                Just because I was ready to think 
                about being in a more serious 
                  relationship, doesn t mean she 
                was...  It s just not what she was 
                looking for right now.

                              CHARLIE
                Well.  Maybe she ll change her 
                mind.

                              DON
                      (not believing it)
                Maybe...

  A beat.  Alan suddenly dons a smile.

                              ALAN
                But this is a good sign though...
                      (off their confusion)
                Donny, you weren t the one who 
                pulled the plug.  You were willing 
                to stick it out, try and have a 
                  relationship.  That s a step in the 
                right direction, isn t it?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    60.

                              DON
                      (shrugs, then)
                Why don t you guys go on to bed...

  Don turns, picks up the remote, turns on the TV.  Alan eyes 
  him a moment, then, coming back in --

                              ALAN
                You know, I m not really that 
                tired.  There s gotta be something 
                good on.  Late night s when they 
                play all the classics...

                              CHARLIE
                If we re staying up, I m popping 
                some popcorn...

                              DON
                You guys, you don t have to do 
                this?

                              ALAN
                Do what?

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, what re you talking about?

                              DON
                Go to bed, seriously.

                              ALAN
                Hey, you don t even live here.  Who 
                are you to start telling us what to 
                do?

  Alan settles down into a chair.  Charlie heads into the 
  kitchen.  Don sighs, sits down.

                              DON
                      (to Alan)
                Thanks.

                              ALAN
                Don t mention it.

  On Alan and Don --
