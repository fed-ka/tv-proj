New York is not a good idea.
KEVIN
Look, how you fixed for cash?
MRS. LOMAX
I have my bad feeling.
KEVIN

I put a couple hundred in here...
MRS. LOMAX
Sounds like more than two weeks.
KEVIN
Mary Ann typed out the numbers for
you -- phone, the flights -- it's
all in there.
MRS. LOMAX
Let me tell you about New York.
KEVIN
(with a smile)
Babylon.
MRS. LOMAX
Forewarned is forearmed.
(half-serious)
'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
great. It has become a dwelling
place of demons.' Revelation

KEVIN
I don't know... looks to me like
that dress is in your way.
MARY ANN
(shocked, stops)
Why, counselor...
(her best drawl)
Surely you don't think a small-
town girl changes overnight just
because a man buys her dinner in
the big city.
KEVIN
No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever
think at all.
MARY ANN
Well, that's different, then.
You're my kind of guy.

Fill in the resume. Tell me about

father do?
KEVIN
I never got to know my father. He
passed away before I was born. My
mom raised me. Just the two of
us.
MILTON
She never remarried?
KEVIN
She wasn't married the first time.
MILTON
That can't be easy in Gainesville.
KEVIN
I don't think it's easy anywhere.
(re the view)
Holy shit...
MILTON
Little different when you're
looking down, isn't it?
(beat)
Tell me about her. Your mother.
What's she like?
KEVIN
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough. She's worked in the
same poultry plant for as long as
I can remember. I think she's up
to eight-fifty an hour. She's got
a church she really likes, so
she's usually either there or they
go out, they do a lot of volunteer
work.

Lotta potential clients down

KEVIN
You don't have to sell me on New
York.
MILTON
You like it here, don't you?
KEVIN
Are we negotiating?
MILTON
Always.
KEVIN
Why do you need a criminal
department?
MILTON
Because our clients break the law
just like everyone else and I'm
tired of sending their business
across the street.
KEVIN
Are you offering me a job?
MILTON
I'm thinking about it. You have
the talent. I knew that before

Sure. Let's go back to Gainesville.
You can keep scrounging for
clients and pumping out the

cars for Akamian. Maybe, if we

What do you think? We're giving

goat's blood? I'm billing you
out at four-hundred an hour, my
friend. I don't see a whole lot
of pro bono work in your
immediate future.
(buzzing here)
Seriously, what I like, you got in
there with him. Inside the cage.
That's instinct. Can't be taught.
You gotta hear that on your own.
It's gotta be in your blood. It's
molecular. I bet I've got five
thousand lawyers working around
the planet. I couldn't name
ten -- couldn't name three --
I'd trust with Moyez.
KEVIN
So what the hell are they doing?
MILTON
What are they doing? They're
corporate lawyers, what do
you think they're doing? They're
busy reducing life and death to
the proper position of a semi-
colon. They're doing needlepoint.
Push button battles. Push button
wars. Armies that get so fucking
far away from each other they
need satellites to tell them
who won. No pain. No sound.
No smell. One big, multinational
circle jerk. You, on the other
hand, you're on the slaughterhouse
floor. You can't help but smell
your clients.

friend -- make yourself small.
Be the hick. The cripple. The
nerd. The leper. The shit-
kicking surfer. Look at me --
I've been underestimated from
day one. Do I look like a
master of the universe? That's
your only weakness as far as I
can tell.
KEVIN

The look. The Florida stud thing.
'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my
boots under your bed?'
KEVIN
Never worked a jury didn't have a

MILTON
You know what you're missing?
What I have? This beautiful girl
she's just fucked me every way
she knows how -- we're done --
she's walking to the bathroom --
she turns back -- and there I am.
It's me. And she smiles -- it's
like a veil coming down across
her face -- and that smile, that's
a question mark, because she's
looking at me, she's wondering,
how did that happen? And see,
right there, from that moment on,
she's got a secret. I'm the hand
up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the
whisper in Nefertitti's ear.
I'm a surprise. They never see
me coming. That's what you're

I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat.
I came up from nothing. From
dirt. I'm warming my hands on

There's a chicken, he's famous, he
plays tic-tac-toe. He never

Hey. Like you. Right?

Look, I'm rambling because I'm

186B
186B
Three women runners -- clear as day -- pass beneath a
streetlight. Team clothes. Machine-like strides. Flat-
out. And then gone.

Barzoon stands from behind the sycamore tree. Relief.
Smiling at his own stupidity. What a jerk. Dusting off.
Heading back toward the path, when --
188
188
Suddenly, there's an arm around his neck -- throwing him
to the ground --
189
189
Standing there above him, a crazed-looking homeless
MAN -- he's white and old and hungry --
OLD MAN
Gimme your watch.
BARZOON
(standing now)
You want the watch, old man?
Come
and get it.

Barzoon moving toward the old guy when -- Crack! -- A
tree branch swings out of nowhere -- catching his
elbow -- snapping it back and --
A second homeless man. He's black and older than the
first guy but just as wild and dangerous and he's winding
up to swing the branch again and --
Barzoon on his knees -- dazed -- blood pouring from his
head -- uncomprehending eyes watching these park
creatures tear at his clothes --

(EFX) Watching them grow more feral and less human by the
moment and --

Mary Ann staring out at the park. Covering her ears
against some horrible sound that she alone can hear.
CUT TO:

Barzoon -- on his belly -- in the dirt -- trying to
move -- crawl -- anything --
194
194
The two men beating Barzoon to death with stones --
195
195
-- transforming with every blow -- (EFX) as their hands
descend they become terrifying, demonic creatures, and as
they rise we see them as men and over and over, as we
hear --

A cab speeds to a stop. Kevin jumps out. Feeney, the
doorman, standing there with Felix, his partner.
FEENEY
She didn't look well, sir. Felix
tried to talk to her, but she --
KEVIN
Where is she?
CUT TO:

Kevin running down the sidewalk and --

A big one. A funereal morning.
Hearse and cortege
parked on the street outside.

Moments later.
Kevin hustling away --
WEAVER (O.S.)
(behind him)
Mr. Lomax?
KEVIN
No comment. I'll have something
for you later.
WEAVER (O.S.)
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.
Kevin turns.
Weaver walking beside him.
WEAVER
Remember me? Mitch Weaver.
Justice Department.
KEVIN
Staking out the funeral?
WEAVER
Looking for you actually.
KEVIN
I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.
I need to talk to my wife.
WEAVER
Just wanted to ask you -- off the
record -- I had a few questions
about Eddie.
CUT TO:
215
216
Kevin walking faster.
Weaver right beside him.
WEAVER
Milton, Chadwick, Waters is a
little more than a law firm, but
then I assume you knew that.
(working him)
Devada Holdings? I'm sure you've
heard of it. London, Kinshasa,
Karachi -- Arms brokering mostly.
You've got Munzer-Dietch, they're
in Berlin and Djakarta -- chemical
weapons, toxic waste. Ivanaco
Limited -- Moscow -- money
laundering for the Eastern Bloc.
(at his ear)
It goes on and on, Kevin.
CUT TO:
217

Kevin really striding.
Weaver right there.
WEAVER
Milton is into everything.
(listen to me)
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He
was gonna testify.

WEAVER (CONT'D)
Desoto and Dibalista, in Panama,
that's a firm that specializes in
opening bank accounts for judges
all over South America. Huge drug
cases. Murder. Everything.
KEVIN
He's a lawyer! What the fuck do
you want?
(stopping there)
Stay off my back.
Weaver left standing there, as Kevin rushes away --
through traffic -- across the street --
WEAVER
This is a first time, last time
offer!
(calling
after him)
I'm learning about you, Kevin. I
talked to some old friends down in
Florida this morning...
(louder now)
The Gettys case. The eighth grade
teacher?
(did Kevin just
slow down)
Found him this morning. He had
the body of a ten-year-old girl in
the trunk of his car.
Kevin, across the street, stops.
CUT TO:

Kevin standing there, across the street -- Weaver smiles,
thinking he'll talk now for sure -- stepping off the
curb and --
TIRES SCREECHING and Weaver turning and --
A car trying to stop and --
Kevin watching as --
WHAMM! -- Weaver ploughed onto the hood and --
A mother at the wheel -- her daughter beside her -- both
screaming and --
The car's WINDSHIELD as it CRUMPLES and --
Kevin watching as the car stops and --
Weaver is dazed but alive -- his face buried in the
windshield -- pulling himself up and --
Weaver's face THROUGH the shattered glass as he looks
down to see --
Mother and child (EFX) -- transforming -- for an
instant -- into monsters and --
Weaver more terrified than hurt -- scrambling off the hood
of the car -- staring back in horror and --
Mother and child -- completely freaked out -- both of them
hysterical and --
Weaver holding his arm -- nose bloodied -- but moving --
backing away -- turning to find Kevin still across the
street and --
It's gonna be okay.
And then, a big flat-nose truck -- out of nowhere -- air
BRAKES BLASTING as it just wipes Weaver OFF the SCREEN
and --
Kevin falling back, flat against a wall -- STAYING ON
Kevin -- as the street comes alive with the SOUNDS of
EMERGENCY and he starts moving away and we --

As Kevin explodes through a fire door.
Pam standing
there, having a smoke.
PAM
There you are...
(all smiles)
Look at you... you're terrified.
Not to worry. He'll take that fear
away. You don't ever have to be
frightened again. Go on, he's
waiting...
Kevin turning and something is very wrong --
249
249
Fifty-seventh Street is empty. No cars. No people.
Just the building and the silence. Turning back and
Pam is gone, and then --
And then a WIDER ANGLE -- it goes on and on... He's alone.
Just now realizing the scale of Milton's power. Starting
to walk, as we --
