      It's dirty and abandoned down here.  An SUV pulls up and
      OLIVIA (30s) steps out.  Stylish but weary, too smart for
      her own good.  People tend to underestimate her.  That's a
      mistake.  STEPHEN (30s) is waiting for her.   STEPHEN's
      handsome and male and brilliant in a way that makes you
      worried you'll do something inappropriate like lick him. 
      The minute she's out of the car, they head for the warehouse. 
      All business, intense.

                    How many guys in the room?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Just the two of them.  Two insane
                    morons.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hey, did you propose?  Weren't you
                    going to ask her marry you tonight?

                                      STEPHEN
                    I was doing this tonight. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    So you bailed. -- Did you give them
                    the money?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Yes.  Which is when the problem
                    started. -- And I did not bail.  I'm
                    working.  For you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you at least buy the engagement
                    ring?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Olivia.  What's going on in that
                    warehouse?  Is not good.  Is, in
                    fact, the opposite of good.  So
                    bugging me about proposing to my
                      girlfriend?  Not on point.  There's
                      a situation in there.  Focus.  Do
                    what you do.

      A beat.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You really should have proposed...

      And Olivia and Stephen swing into the warehouse...


      Stephen and Olivia head for their cars with the basket.

                                      STEPHEN
                    God, I love this job.


      A middle class house in Virginia.  Olivia rings the doorbell. 
      Insistent.  Never stopping until it is yanked open.  DAVID
      (40s) glares at her, bleary-eyed.  

                                      DAVID
                    Why am I not surprised that you're
                    on this?  

                                      OLIVIA
                    You have to give me 48 hours before
                    you arrest or charge Sully Sinclair.

                                      DAVID
                    I was sleeping.

                                      OLIVIA
                    The US Attorney's Office never sleeps. 
                    You told me that once.

                                      DAVID
                    I was being ironic.

                                      DAVID
                    Olivia, you don't have the muscle of
                    the White House behind you anymore. 
                    You're just a private citizen who
                    is, by the way, annoying-

                    you'll get for rushing to judgment
                    on a patriot?

                                      OLIVIA
                      Well...yes.  That's my job.

                    Do you actually have the naive belief
                    that waking me up in the middle of
                    the night and threatening me is the
                    correct path to getting your way?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I wasn't threatening you.  He didn't
                    kill her.  My gut says he didn't. 

                                      DAVID
                    Your Spidey senses aren't evidence. 
                    I've been on the phone with Homicide. 
                    He killed her and ran.

                    48 hours before you arrest or charge.

    He starts to shut the door.  Olivia wedges her body in the
      door's path, keeping it open.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)

                    handicapped, Congressional Medal of
                    Honor winner.  Perhaps because he's
                    a well-known conservative Republican 
                    and you are considering a bid on the

      Olivia walks through the park directly across from the White
      House.  Reaches CYRUS (late 50s), his face betraying
      exhaustion in only the way someone who works too hard can. 
      A few steps away, a man with an earpiece waits for Cyrus. 
      Cyrus and Olivia have the ease of old comrades.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What.

                    Hi, hello, how are you.  What.

                                      CYRUS
                    You working the Sully Sinclair thing?

                                      OLIVIA
                    We're not going public, making no
                    comments yet.  I'm trying to see if
                    I can stamp out the flames before it
                    becomes a wildfire.  If you guys
                    could refrain from commenting...

                    say?

                                      OLIVIA
                    He didn't do it.

                                      CYRUS
                    Your gut's never wrong.

      Olivia studies him.  Gentle.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You look tired.  Too tired.  What.

                                      CYRUS
                          (reluctant)
                    He needs a favor.

      And Olivia's face closes down.  Not liking this.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I don't work for him anymore.

                                      CYRUS
                    He trusts you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I don't work for him anymore.

                                      CYRUS
                    And yet you came when I called.

      A beat.  Then Olivia puts her arm through his, leans on him. 
      Giving in.  But guarded.  Sorry for him, protecting herself.

                    before you had to be on the dais to
                    watch the President of the United
                    States take the oath of office...

                                      OLIVIA
                    Leave me alone. 

      Abby rolls her eyes.

                                    ABBY
                    Same reason why no one's allowed to
                    give you gum...

                                      STEPHEN
                    Hey.  Should I really do it?

      And Abby keeps curiously quiet during the following:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.

                                      STEPHEN
                    I'm talking about asking Georgia to
                    marry me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Because I was thinking I'd buy a
                    ring today but now with Sully...

                                      OLIVIA
                    Stephen, do you want me to talk you
                    into it or out of it?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Into it.  Out of it.  No.  Into it.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Normal lives.  That's the dream. 
                    You love her, she loves you. Normal

                                      OLIVIA
                    I said it's the dream, not the
                    reality.

      Quinn rounds the corner.  Races to them.  A little breathless.

                                      QUINN
                    Huck finally managed to hack Paige's
                    emails.  I've been reading them and
                    I think I found something.  Paige
                    sent an email to a friend, Ariel
                    Masse.  On the night of the murder,
                    they were supposed to meet and attend
                    an embassy party.

      She's proud of herself.  Until:

                                      OLIVIA
                    So how come she didn't go?

                                      QUINN
                    I...I don't know.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Abby?

                                    ABBY
                    I'll find out.

                                      OLIVIA
                          (to Quinn)
                    Go away.

      Disappointed to be dismissed, Quinn takes off.  

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    What do we think of her?

                                    ABBY
                    Does she know why we hired her?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Not yet.

                    She's like a frightened bunny.

    He totally was.  Olivia gets in her car.


      Two MARINES stand guard at the gates of Camp David.  Olivia's
      SUV pulls up.  She rolls down her window.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Olivia Price.

      She gets out.  Hands one Marine her driver's license.  Pops
      the back of the SUV so the other Marine can search her car
      and peer under it with one of those mirrors on a pole thingies
      they use.  There's a conspicuous coffee stain on her blouse. 
      She takes off her blouse, puts her suit jacket on over just
      her bra.  Looks at the Marine who eyes her, confused.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    I spilled.


      Fitz, Cyrus and Olivia stroll the grounds, two Secret Service
      agents following not far behind.

                                    FITZ
                    I can't thank you enough for taking
                    this on.

      Cyrus hands Olivia a packet of papers.

                                      CYRUS
                    Her name is Julia Tannen.  She's 27. 
                    And she's speaking to anyone in the
                    West Wing who'll listen.

                                      OLIVIA
                    And you can't fire her.

                    Not without a nightmare on our hands. 
                    Look, she's yet to go the press. 
                    I'd like to put a stop to it before
                    she does.

                                    FITZ
                    It's not right.  It makes me look
                    like some dirty old man.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I have to ask...

      And Fitz stops walking.

                                    FITZ
                    No.  I never.  I would never.  No.  

      And she looks at him a long beat.  Judging.

                                    FITZ (CONT'D)
                    You've known me for a long time. 
                    Longer than most.  And you've seen
                    me at my best and my worst.  You
                    know I did not fall for some young
                    girl.  You know there's only one
                    person I love.  

      He's earnest.  Needing her to see that he's telling the truth.  

                                      CYRUS
                    Mellie and Fitz are happy together. 
                    He'd have no reason to cheat.  Liv...

      She hasn't taken her eyes off Fitz, weighing him.  But now: 

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'll handle it.  Consider it handled.

      She smiles.  Fitz smiles back.

                                    FITZ
                    You should come back to the White

                    never left your side.  

      And she means it.  Cyrus claps them both on the back.

      Quinn stands in the park with Olivia.  Olivia's watching
      people walk their dogs.  Looking for someone.  

                                      QUINN
                    Can I ask what we're...?

                                      OLIVIA
                    You are acting as my witness.  Just
                    stay by my side, don't say anything.

      Finally, she spots a young woman walking a puppy.  JULIA
      TANNEN (27).  She walks up to her, Quinn close behind.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Cute dog.  A Lab?

                                      JULIA
                    Yeah.  His name's Thomas Jefferson. 
                    Which is lame, I know, but he's very
                      Presidential.  Aren't you, TJ?

      Julia beams at the puppy.  Olivia's voice is even,
      professional and devoid of any warmth. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Julia.  It would be a mistake to
                    think that there will be no
                    consequences to you telling lies
                    about the President.

      Julia stiffens.  Quinn looks at Olivia, surprised.

                                      JULIA
                    Who are you?  

                                      OLIVIA
                    My name is Olivia Price.  And I want
                    to be clear that I'm not here in any
                    official capacity.  I'm here as a
                    concerned citizen.  

                                      JULIA
                    What do you want?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I want to warn you.  Because you
                    seem like a fine person.  So you
                    should know what could happen.  It
                    could become hard for you to find
                      employment, your face would be
                      everywhere, people would associate
                    you with a sex scandal.  All kinds
                    of information about you could easily
                    become available to the press.  For
                    example, you've had 22 sexual
                    partners?  That we know of.  Also
                    there's that ugly bout of gonorrhea. 
                    And your family...Your mother's mental
                    illness.  A psychotic break?  2 years
                    in Bedford Hospital?  I bet that's
                    private.  She's runs a daycare now,
                    right?

      Julia's tearing up, beginning to shake.

                    He said he loved me.  He gave me

                                      OLIVIA
                    See, it's those kind of lies that
                    could hurt you if you said them to

                    Why are you doing this to me?  I'm a
                    good person.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You know who was also a good person? 
                    Monica Lewinsky.  And she was telling 
                    the truth.  But she still got
                    destroyed.  

      Julia grabs her dog's leash, hurries away.  Quinn stands
      there, shell-shocked.  Olivia looks at her.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    If you get subpoenaed in front of a
                    grand jury, you can testify as an
                    officer of the court that I was
                    working on my own, I didn't blackmail
                    or threaten her.  If you don't get
                      subpoenaed, this never happened.

      And she heads out of the park.  It takes Quinn a moment to
      follow her.  Up ahead, Olivia dials her cell.

      Stephen waits outside the bar.  He's staring up at something. 
      Abby comes out of the bar, hanging up her cell. 

                                    ABBY
                    I showed Sully's picture to everyone
                    in the bar.  No one saw him the night
                    of the murder.  And Liv's got cops
                    in the lobby.  He's finished.

      But Stephen's staring up.  An odd smile on his face.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Maybe not.

      And he points.  Abby follows his finger.  And sees that he
    is pointing at a bank.  There's a security camera there,
      pointing down at the street.


      A cadre of reporters have gathered.  Cameras and lights. 
      And in front of them all stands Sully Sinclair in a full
      dress military uniform.  Calm.  Confident.  Strong.  A few
      soldiers stand with him.

                                      SULLY
                    I am honored to have served my
                    country.  I am honored to have been
                    injured serving my country.  And
                    most importantly, I am honored to be
                    a gay man who served my country.

      It's a moment.  A victory.  Flashbulbs go off.  Questions
      are shouted.  The press goes crazy.  And we move through the
      crowd to find, standing near the back...Olivia, Harrison,
      Abby, Stephen and Quinn.  Watching it all.  Proud.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Good work.

                                    ABBY
                    The other soldiers are a nice touch.

                                      STEPHEN
                    You have good ideas.

    He slings an arm around her.  And Abby breathes him in. 
      Olivia moves over to where David stands watching the press
      conference.  Hands him a thick envelope.

                                      OLIVIA
                    That's everything we gathered on
                    Paige's murder.  If it helps.

      Grudging, David takes it.  Then, a little too confident...

                                      DAVID
                    Don't worry, my guys will catch the
                    killer.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I hope so.  For Sully's sake.  

      Harrison looks at Quinn.  Checking her out.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      UNTITLED SHONDA RHIMES PILOT (2010)     12-17-10   66

                                      HARRISON
                    Can I buy you dinner tonight?

                                      QUINN
                    No.

      Olivia looks up.  Sees Cyrus.  Standing a little ways off
      from the crowd.  His Secret Service agent near his side. 
      She moves to him.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What.

                                      CYRUS
                    He wants to see you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Tell him to go to hell.

                                      CYRUS
                    I'm just the messenger.

      And he starts to move away.  But Olivia stops him with:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Cyrus?  You tell him that he better
                    hope to God Julia Tannen doesn't
                    want to come forward with her story. 
                    Because she just became my client.

      Cyrus freezes.  The color draining from his face.  And Olivia
    is moving forward, disappearing into the crowd of reporters. 
      A gladiator in a suit.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
