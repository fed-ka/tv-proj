ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control,
walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.
ABBY
Morning, Freddy.
SECURITY GUARD
Morning, Abby. Another peaceful
day?
ABBY
If you say so...

JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.
JOY
(panicked)
We've got problems.
ABBY
There are no problems, Joy.
Only
solutions.
JOY
The sky-cam on the traffic copter
has a cracked lens and they can't
fix it.
ABBY
Okay, that's a problem.
(thinking, then...)
Call Matt Hardwick down at Media
Services. He's got a few Sky Cams
and he owes me. Now, where are my
weathermen?
Joy opens a door to a waiting area.

Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.
LATINO MEN
Hey there!
ABBY
Hi, guys!
Abby waves back and closes the door.

ABBY
What's with the pot bellies?
JOY
Research shows people like fat
weathermen. It makes them feel
safe.
ABBY
I like the one in the green and the
one in the brown, but I want to see
the one in the green with less
sideburns and the one in the brown
with more, then I'll make my
decision.
LARRY (O.S.)
Abby!
LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to
them. He wears a makeup bib.
ABBY
Morning, Larry.
LARRY
I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
but I don't think I can work with
her anymore. It's bad enough I
have to take her criticism at home.
I can't do it on air, too. A man
can only take so much.
Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done
this before.
ABBY
You're not a man, Larry...
(off his look)
You're a newsman. A newsman isn't
defined by the easy times, Larry,
he's defined by the difficult ones.
Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris
Hansen or Anderson Cooper having
their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,
because they couldn't handle it.
But you can. You've got balls the
size of Volkswagens. Don't think I
haven't noticed.

I've only thought of them as blue

are quite sizeable. But not
disproportionately so.
(with pride)
I like to think of them as
aesthetically pleasing --
Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore
than she has to.
ABBY
I think I've made my point.
Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY
RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...

...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry
news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.
DORI
Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a

crap about trees in Alaska! It's
not newsworthy.
JOSH
Oh, but full coverage on David
Beckham's new tattoo is vital?!
Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the
gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF.
GEORGIA
He's trying to kill me! He knows I
can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it!
(to the room)
Does anyone see this? Is this a
hive?
JOSH
It looks like syphilis to me.
DORI

See that? You wouldn't even know

She doesn't eat crab or beef or

chicken. You don't need a chef on
this show. You need a box of
McNuggets.
Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a
whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.

Cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set.
Georgia and Larry taste samples of what he's prepared.
GEORGIA
I have to tell you, Bruce. This is
the best Chicken Kiev I've ever
tasted.
GUEST CHEF
Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes
an excellent alternative for
chicken, Georgia.
JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.
JAVIER
Can I take home the leftovers?
They all laugh.
LARRY
When we return, our live Skycam

Beckham's hundred thousand dollar
tattoo.

That means he got the numbers.

Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly
general manager.
STUART
Have you seen the ratings for
yesterday? We got beat by all the
network shows, plus a rerun of
"Who's the Boss". The one where
the vacuum breaks.
ABBY
It's a temporary setback. This week
we'll do better.
STUART
The guy with the cable access show
on Channel 83 does better. If we
programed Jerry Springer re-runs,
we'd do a nine share at a quarter
the price.
Abby looks worried.
ABBY
Please tell me you're not thinking
of killing the show.
STUART
I'm not, but I can guarantee you
that's what the new management's
thinking.
ABBY
Stuart, "Sacramento AM" is an award-

Management doesn't listen to

We're not a family-run station
anymore, Abby. You're good at what
you do, but you've got to get me
some numbers. I've got two
daughters in college and a son in
beauty school. I don't know how
much you know about Vidal Sassoon
but that shit ain't cheap.
Abby nods.
ABBY
You can count on me, Stuart.

Abby and Joy stand at the sinks.
Abby compulsively flosses

ABBY
I can't be letting corporate

She rips out an extra two feet of floss.

ABBY (cont'd)

I should cancel my date tonight and

make a list of ideas for sweeps.
JOY
Absolutely not. You should be out,
observing humanity. Humanity's who
watches our show.
ABBY
Yeah, all 2.47% of them.
JOY
You've already rescheduled on this
guy three times. You cancel tonight
and he's gone. He's read more than
a dozen books, he has a 401K and
he's cute.
She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony

them to be symmetrical?
Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy.

ABBY
You printed his profile?
JOY
What? I'm married. I live
vicariously through your dating
life. And I really think that this
could be our next boyfriend. C'mon,
he had nine out of ten items on
your checklist.
ABBY
Well, technically eight and a half.
He said he could cook, but when I
pressed him, he was completely
unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you
think that's a little suspicious?
Off Joy's look, we CUT TO...

Abby approaches the FEMALE HOSTESS, at her podium.
ABBY
Hi. I'm looking for a guy with
sandy brown hair, athletic build,
and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which --
I know what you're thinking -- it's
a little short, but he's read The
Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just
live with it, okay?
JIM (O.S.)
Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.
She turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking.
Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo.
Abby gulps.

Abby and a mildly perturbed Jim follow, clearly not off to a
banner start.

Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.
ABBY
You know what? This is not the best
angle. We should get the table over
there. Then we both get a view,
instead of one of us looking at the
busboy station.
JIM
I'm fine here.
ABBY
No, trust me. It'll be better over
there.
He looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move.

The waiter is now taking their drink order.
WAITER
Can I get you some water for the
table?
JIM
Bottle of flat, please.
ABBY
You know, they've done studies that
show tap water is no different from
bottled water. And they passed a
law recently to have all
restaurants filter their tap water.
So, technically it's not tap water.

WAITER
Can I get you any cocktails?
JIM
Scotch on the rocks.
ABBY
In your profile, you said you liked
red wine.
JIM
I do, I just feel like having a
scotch right now.
She looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.
ABBY
(re the paper)
Was there anything else you changed
your mind about? I mean, just so I
can figure it into the overall
picture.
JIM
You printed out my profile?
ABBY
Actually, my associate producer
did. She likes me to be prepared.
Not that I'm ever not prepared.
Kudos on your comprehensive car
insurance policy, by the way.
JIM
That wasn't in my profile.
ABBY
No, but it was in your background

Good point.
There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out
another piece of paper, and hands it to him.
ABBY
I printed out some talking points
for us just in case this happened.
JIM
I take it it's happened before?
ABBY
No, but since you have nine out of
ten of the necessary attributes on
my checklist, I just wanted to make
sure this goes as smoothly as
possible.
As Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.
JIM
Thank you.
He takes a huge sip, relieved. Abby looks at him.
ABBY
You realize the ice in that scotch
is made from tap water, don't you?
He looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare.

Abby, still in her undies, trudges up the steps. She opens
her front door. Her calico cat D'ARTAGNAN, 9, skeptical and
easily annoyed, stares up at her.
ABBY
Don't ask.

Abby, now in pajamas, flosses her teeth. She hears a noise
coming from her bedroom and looks to see D'Artagnan's paw in
the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish.
ABBY
D'Artagnan! Stop that!
Abby picks up the cat.
ABBY (CONT'D)
How many times do I have to tell
you? Leave Juliet alone. Wasn't
Romeo enough for you?
Abby picks up the remote, snaps the TV on to "Nightline" with
Brian Williams.

Now there's a man. Not some five

She heads into the bathroom.

MOTLEY GROUP
Ugly!
THE THEME SONG for "The Ugly Truth" kicks in over a series of
past scenes: Mike judo-kicking an giant Oprah doll. Several
posters spelling the word "LOVE" are destroyed by Mike with a
variety of weapons. The theme sequence ends and CUTS TO --

"The Ugly Truth", live on air. The look of the show's set is
low-rent cable TV.
MIKE
I'm Mike Alexander and we're back
with the "The Ugly Truth." Tonight,
as always, we're going to talk
about what it is men and women
really want in relationships. I've
been looking through some books...
He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles.
MIKE (CONT'D)
"Smart Women Foolish Choices",
"Women Who Love Men Who Hate Them",
"Hating Men Who Love Women But Hate
Loving Men"...
He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline
and pours it on the books.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Billions and billions of dollars
wasted on self-help psychobabble.
Mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them
ablaze. Then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a
marshmallow. Begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Now listen up, ladies, cause I'm
only gonna say this once tonight
and it's just three little words.
No, they're not "I love you." Here
goes... MEN. ARE. SIMPLE. We can
not be trained. All this "Men Are
From Venus" bullshit is a waste of
your time and money.

You want to be a lonely hag, then
keep reading these stupid books.
You want a relationship, here's how
you get one: it's called a
Stairmaster. Get on it and get
skinny and get some trashy lingerie
because at the end of the day, all
we're interested in is looks. No
one falls in love with your
personality at first sight, they
fall in love with your tits and
your ass. And they stick around
because of what you're willing to
do with them. You want to win a man
over? You don't need ten steps. You
need one. And it's called a blow-
job.
Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.

WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike
continues his rant.
MIKE
Men don't fall in love. Men fall in
"want." We want things. We're
hunters and gatherers. We're the
same as we were when we were
cavemen and a gillion years of
evolution hasn't done squat. Trust
me, there was a Pamela Anderson of
cave women and all the cave guys
were trying to stick their dicks in
her.
Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it.
He crosses it out and writes "LUST."
MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Now girls, if you want to think
lust is the same as love, that's
fine, but you're delusional. Let's
take some more calls.
(picks up the phone)
You're on the air.
Abby is now on the phone.
ABBY
So you're saying men are incapable
of love?
MIKE
Did I burst your little Harlequin
Romance bubble?
Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.

MIKE
Thank you very much. Go on.

He's smart...he's handsome but
doesn't know it...

classical music, Cary Grant
movies...

You're not calling from Europe or
anything.
ABBY
Are you interested in listening or
not?
MIKE
No, please. I'm loving this.
ABBY
He works out, not because he's
vain, because it's healthy. He's
socially liberal but fiscally
conservative. He likes dogs but
he's a cat person. He never gets

Mike scoffs, but he's thrown. He takes a moment, then...

He's got a point of view. We don't

Phillips interviews terrorists,

Albuquerque is 45% Latino.
At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled.
MIKE
Yeah, and as you can tell by all
the screaming rugrats in this town,
Latino guys like to have a lot of

LARRY
Does anyone think my highlights are
too shiny?
ABBY
Larry, listen to me. I want Mike
Alexander to go down in flames. I
want Mike Alexander to be nothing
but a pile of ash on the seat next
to you. I want the janitor to come
in with his Dustbuster and vacuum
up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and
then when he throws the ashes into
the dumpster outside, I want the
rats to vomit and then defecate on
the ashes of Mike Alexander.
She strides off. Larry looks at Georgia.
LARRY
And I thought you were angry and
bitter.
GEORGIA
Uh, no, that would be my untouched
vagina.

For years, there have been concerns
about lowering television
standards. But many believe that
this man and his local public
access show, "The Ugly Truth," have
brought things to a new low. With
that, we welcome Mike Alexander.
Mike gives a cocky wave.
MIKE
How ya doing, guys?
LARRY
Mike, how do you respond to those
who say your show is offensive?
MIKE
It is... but then again, so is the
truth.
GEORGIA
The truth about what, Mr.
Alexander?
MIKE
What relationships are really like.

Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. Cliff
mans the bank of monitors.
MIKE
Take marriage for instance. It's
about mutual benefits, social
pressure, and taxes. It's not about
love and we should stop pretending
it is.
We INTERCUT with Georgia, Larry, and Mike on set.
ABBY
C'mon Georgia, let him have it.
GEORGIA
Sounds to me like no one's ever
loved you and you're taking it out
on the female population.
In the control room, Abby smirks.

Abby nervously gnaws on the straw from her Kombucha drink.

Cliff, let's go to commercial.

Stuart told me to keep rolling, no

Cliff shrugs.
Abby is pissed.
ABBY
This is my show.
CLIFF
Not right now it isn't.
On the set, Mike continues his vivisection of Larry and
Georgia.
MIKE
I mean, come on Larry, I grew up
watching you on TV. You used to be
this cool confident cat. Georgia's
no dumb bunny. She knew the only
way she was getting off the weekend
shift was by hooking up with you.
But then lo and behold, she became
more popular than you and ended up
with twice your salary.

C'mon, Larry. Take him down.

I'm proud of my wife's success.
MIKE
Bullllloney you are. You hate her
success. You feel emasculated by
her and that screws with your head
which inevitably screws with your
manhood.
GEORGIA
What's your point, Mr. Alexander?
ABBY
Good girl, Georgia. Take control.
MIKE
My point? My point is that your
husband hasn't had sex with you
in...I'm gonna say. . .three
months?
LARRY
That's not my fault!
MIKE
I know, it's her fault!
GEORGIA
Why is it my fault?!
In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out.
ABBY
Oh, dear God.
GEORGIA
Well, what am I supposed to do,
give up the money, so he can get an
erection?
MIKE
I agree. You've economically
emasculated your husband to such a
point that he's afraid to desire
you. Sure, you can dump his ass,
but honey, have you seen the
eligible men in Albuquerque? It's
slim pickings out there for a woman
in her forties. You're not going to
do any better than Larry. You just
have to let him be a man. LET HIM
BE A MAN, GEORGIA!

Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set.

It's pitch black. Suddenly a closet door is opened. Joy and

Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet.
STUART
One thousand, one hundred and forty-
seven calls and over three hundred
E-mails. And fifty-three percent of
them were women. This guy's a
lightening rod!
ABBY
(confused)
People liked him?!
STUART
Liked him? They loved him.
ABBY
How is that possible?
STUART
I don't know, but I'm scaling back
the news and giving it to "The Ugly

JONAH, 14, awkward, Mike's nephew, walks in.
JONAH
Dude, you totally hosed me!
MIKE

First of all - don't listen to what

you're supposed to do that to 25-
year-old girls who think they're
hot and can get any guy they want.
Not 14-year-old girls. They're
going through puberty. They have
enough problems.
JONAH
Mom said when she was fourteen, she
was the prettiest girl in the
class.
MIKE
Well, I was there when she was
fourteen and let me tell you
something -- she lied.
Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's
uniform and holding a cake box.
ELIZABETH
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he
was blind from masturbating too
much.
MIKE
Oh, that's a nice thing to tell
your son --
ELIZABETH
It's nothing worse than what he's
heard on your show.
She hands him the cake box.

Let's hope you can clean it up now

ABBY
Keep it clean, keep it moving, and

of using the words "blow" and "job"

scatological.
She fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear.

Just because you look pretty today,
I won't mention the misguided
phallic rage you just displayed.

If you hear my voice in your ear,

Mike is cut off by Cliff in the booth.

Abby slips out of frame just in time. Mike looks to the
camera.
MIKE
I'm Mike Alexander and this is "The
Ugly Truth," where we'll be taking
a few minutes every day to talk
about men, women and relationships.
Let's start with men. Men are
simple. To illustrate my point --
on my left we have the best our
world has to offer.
He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner
placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside
the table, a man plays violin.

Mike plays poker with his

STEVE (30's, Latino), and
GARY(30's, bespectacled). While
Mike tries to concentrate
on the game, but the guys are more
interested in reading his
fan mail.
DWAYNE

"Dear Mike, I know I'm the girl who
can change you and make you fall in
love. Here's a photo of me and my
iguana."
Steve looks at the photo.
STEVE
I thought iguanas only liked dry
places.
He passes it to Gary.

Unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays

Abby's ankle.
ABBY

You're a doctor?
COLIN
An orthopedic surgeon.
She glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and
a half empty wine glass sitting on a table.
COLIN
I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but
I do get the occasional foot. You
seem to be fine. No sprain.
ABBY
Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky
D'Artagnan picked your tree to

Dogs are great, but...well, you're

Abby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and
utter perfection.

Well, I guess I should get going

She remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling
awkward, makes a move to open the door.
ABBY (CONT'D)
Thanks again for saving me.
COLIN
Any time.
She walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he
still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find --
Abby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE. Startled, she quickly
composes herself.

You forgot your cat.

relationships: "Marriage? I'm just

Don't! He'll be expecting you to

How do you know?
MIKE
Because I know men. If you want it

listen to me and do exactly as I
say. You already did irreparable
damage with your psycho-aggressive
control freak phone call. It might
even be too late. Even if you do

I should just walk away right now,
or run.
MIKE
I know you think Colin is above it
all, but he's a guy. If he's even
remotely into you, he's thought
about each one of your orifices at
least ten times.
ABBY
I love how you assume every man is
as perverse as you are.
MIKE
I don't assume. I know.

Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie.
ABBY
I am not getting breast implants.
MIKE
Size isn't everything. Breasts just
have to be friendly. They have to
say, "Hello, everybody! Look at

Abby looks down at her breasts, curiously.

Really? I hate Tolstoy.
A SALESWOMAN passes them.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Excuse me ma'am, but we need some
bras that will make my friend's
boobs say, "Put me in your mouth --
I taste good."
The saleswoman looks disturbed, but hands him a push-up water
bra.

This should do the trick.

Why would I want bedhead?
MIKE
Bedhead is sexy.

A ponytail implies that you are
either operating heavy machinery or
emptying the litter box. Neither of
these things inspires an erection.
The hairdresser shoves her head under the sink and douses her
with water.

NIGHT

Mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.
ABBY (O.S.)
I just don't want to be perceived
as a bimbo.
MIKE
I don't want you to be a bimbo. You
need to be two people, the saint
and the sinner, the librarian and
the stripper. It's a delicate
balance. On one hand, you have to
push the guy away with cold
indifference and yet on the other
hand be a sexually teasing tornado.
Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and
sling backs. Her hair and make-up are sexy but not trashy.
ABBY
Well just don't sit there. Say

Yeah, but we're going for a
stripperlibrarian thing. Right
now, I wouldn't trust you to find
me a book.
Abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses. She puts them
on.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Not bad. Now we need to practice
flirting.
ABBY
I know how to flirt.
MIKE
Do you want to be an old maid?
ABBY
So, if I don't listen to you, I'll
be an old maid?
MIKE

keep me company."
ABBY

Oh, ha ha. That's very funny.

for me to grab it? You're just a
set of orifices and a pair of tee-

MIKE
You're a deeply, deeply disturbed
person.
Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing
her finger up and down his arm.
ABBY
Maybe I'm just a good student.
MIKE
Would you stop doing that?
ABBY
Doing what?
MIKE
Touching me with your finger.
She seductively leans into him.

Why? Am I turning you on?

JONAH

Because this is better.
Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her

ELIZABETH
Hurry, take a picture of me. I'm

MIKE
You really want to go out with a

He's being ironic. Look, he's hot.

Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear.
She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the

Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks
over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for
her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE

AT THE NEXT TABLE
A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his
skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks
it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

This isn't helping.
AGENT
Just do what you always do.
MIKE
What do I always do?
AGENT
Uh --
ABBY
(cutting him off)
You entertain people with your
moronery. And they love you for it.
Mike looks at her, surprised.
MIKE
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.
ABBY
Your welcome.
She smiles at him. Looking a little calmer, he smiles back
at Abby. The Agent rolls his eyes. The handler gives Mike
the nod, as we HEAR --
JAY LENO (O.S.)
And that was Kiku, the penguin that
flies! Next up, here to tell us
The Ugly Truth, is Mike Alexander --
The audience applauds as Mike takes a deep breath and heads
on stage.

Abby now sits in the audience, watching as Jay interviews
Mike on stage.

JAY
So what's your number one piece of
advice to all the people out there
who are trying to find love?
MIKE
Don't do it. Try to find lust
instead. It's a lot easier and a
lot less messy. Blue balls only
last a few hours. A broken heart
can last years.
The audience reacts with hollers and cheers. Abby shakes her
head.
JAY
So, what's her name?
MIKE
Who?
JAY
The girl who screwed you up. She
must have been a doozy.
Mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly.
MIKE
Like I said, better a floozy than a
doozy.
Abby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction.
JAY
Well, what do you say to guys like
me who have been happily married
for twenty-seven years? We can't be
the exception to the rule, can we?
There's plenty of us out there.
MIKE
Well, Jay, let me tell ya --
He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him
an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.
MIKE
Marriage starts off great. She's
cute, you're cute, the world's
cute. Nothing can burst your bubble
of everlasting love.

MIKE (cont'd)
Then, ten years later, she's put on
twenty pounds, you've got nose
hair, you're voting for different
presidents, and one day, the
receptionist at Jiffy Lube
accidentally grazes your hand as
she hands you back your keys and
you realize that's the first time a
woman's touched you in three
months. By year twenty, you've
learned to completely tune out the
sound of her voice and it occurs to
you that ever since you walked down
the aisle, you're living with
someone who can barely tolerate
your presence and, on the rare
occasion that you actually do make
love, she probably thinks about
Jake Gyllenhaal.
Jay looks stricken, going along with the bit.
JAY
You're right. I'm going to get a
divorce. My whole life is a lie.

Sorry, honey.
The audience laughs, as we CUT TO --

Abby fumes -- then does her self hating
spazzy dance.

A festive Cuban place in Hollywood with a live salsa band and
a floor full of SEXY PATRONS salsa dancing.
Abby sits at a table, waiting anxiously. As Mike walks in,
she waves him over.
ABBY
(confused)
Where's Rick?
MIKE
I sent him home. I thought we
should celebrate on our own.
Abby's surprised, then suspicious.
ABBY
What exactly are we celebrating?
MIKE
Uh, hello? Leno? I was just on it.
Maybe you saw?
The waiter arrives with mojitos. Abby looks at him.
ABBY
I know about the offer from NBC.
He looks at her, surprised, then --
MIKE
Okay, well then you know I turned
it down. If it weren't for you, I'd
still be on Channel 83. So don't
worry, I'm not going anywhere.
ABBY
Really?

Relax. Drink. Enjoy. You did your

let's stop talking about work.
Abby sips her mojito, studying Mike.
ABBY
So...who was the doozy?
MIKE
What are you, trying to kill my
buzz?
ABBY
No, I'm interested. In what makes
you...you.
Mike sighs, deciding to level with her.
MIKE
It wasn't just one...it was more
like a parade. By the time I hit
thirty, I realized you can only
have so many bad relationships
before you figure out there's no
such thing as a good one.
ABBY
You can't really believe there's no
such thing as a good relationship.
MIKE
To my very core.
Just then, the waitress walks up.
WAITRESS
Two more mojitos?
ABBY
And some water, please.
WAITRESS
Still or sparkling?
MIKE
Just bring us tap water.
She nods and leaves. Abby stares at him.

So I've been told.
He stands up.
MIKE
C'mon, let's dance.
ABBY
I don't think so.
MIKE
I'm serious. I've seen your spazzy
dance, now I want to see the real
thing.
Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst
dancers are great.
ABBY
I can't dance like that.
MIKE
I can.
Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto --

Mike and Abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor.
ABBY
Mike, no --
MIKE
You'll be fine.
Abby looks at him, sure that he's about to make a fool of
them both.
Then, he takes her in his arms, completely self-assured, and
starts leading her in a salsa dance and...
...he's good. But not just good. Great.

For about five seconds.
Then she looks at her watch.
ABBY (cont'd)
We've got an early flight tomorrow.
We should go.

Mike and Abby ride up the elevator.
ABBY
So the car's picking us up
downstairs at eight. You want me to
call you?
MIKE
I'll get a wake up call.
ABBY
Good idea.
There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.
ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I had a great time.
MIKE
Me, too.
ABBY
Remember, the car's --
MIKE
Picking us up at eight. Got it.
The elevator comes to a stop.

Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby.
And suddenly --
They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER.
In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their
furious groping blocks it, until --
A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at
each other.
MIKE (cont'd)
So, I guess I should --
ABBY
Yeah.
Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked. The
doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned.
ABBY (cont'd)
Wow.
93

Abby sinks down onto her bed, wearing the same expression.
ABBY
What the hell was that? And why do
I want to do it again?
There's a KNOCK at the door. She leaps up, smooths her hair,
checks her reflection, and goes to the door. Opening it with
a smile, she finds --
Standing there, bottle of red wine in hand, is... Colin.
COLIN
Miss me?

COLIN
Since you couldn't come to Santa
Fe, I decided to come to you.
ABBY
How'd you find me?
COLIN
Joy told me. I started thinking
about all the things we were going
to do there and I decided I
couldn't wait.
ABBY
Oh. Okay...
COLIN
What's the matter?
ABBY
Nothing. I'm just so -- surprised
to see you.
COLIN
Well, you told me you were
spontaneous. Guess the proof is in
the pudding.
ABBY

It sure is...
As he opens the wine, some of it splashes on his shirt.
COLIN
Whoops. Looks like we'll have to

He turns and walks the other direction. Then stops and turns
back.
MIKE (cont'd)
Nut up, Alexander. You can do
this...
He KNOCKS on Abby's door. After a second it opens and --
There's Colin, standing there SHIRTLESS.
COLIN
Oh, you're not room service.
(holding out his hand)
How ya' doin', man?
Mike reels, trying to cover his shock.
MIKE
I just came by to tell Abby about
the change in our flight time. But
I can tell her later.
Abby appears behind Colin.
ABBY
Mike, what are you doing here?
MIKE
Just leaving.
He turns and goes.

Mike walks down the hall, freaked out and perturbed. Abby

He starts to walk off.
ABBY
Mike, wait -- tell me what just
happened in the elevator.
They hold eye contact for a very long moment.
ABBY (cont'd)
Should I tell Colin to go?
Mike looks away.
MIKE
Why pull up anchor now? You've
worked damn hard to get him here.
ABBY
Really? That's it? That's all you
have to say.
MIKE
What else do you want me to say?
A lot.
But he's not saying it.

Abby takes the glass and drinks.
And keeps drinking.
COLIN (cont'd)
Whoa --
Abby finishes the glass and looks at him.

Why do you like me?
COLIN
Well, you're beautiful, you're

Abby smiles, pleased, then he continues...
COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You're open, you laugh at my jokes,
you never criticize...
Abby's smile fades.
COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You never try to control the
situation, and I've got to say,
it's a breath of fresh air. A lot
of women I know are total control

Plus, this bed should be facing

STUART
He quit this morning. I got a smug
call from Channel 4 saying they
closed a deal with him. Corporate's

happened?
Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and
abiding hatred.
