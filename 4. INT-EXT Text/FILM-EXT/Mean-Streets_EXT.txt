The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked
side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to
another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.
MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different
neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as
CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and
dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes
and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack
for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.
Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.
MICHAEL
Hey, hurry up with that shit will ya.
MICHAEL gets in the car. Another MAN is sitting in the back.
He is also well dressed. MICHAEL takes a small lens out of
his pocket and tosses it to the MAN.
MAN
What's this? More shit...?
MICHAEL
Naw...that ain't shit...that's a
German lens.
The MAN looks at it carefully.
4.
MICHAEL
A good buy...good two shipments of
them.
MAN
Can't use it...
MICHAEL
Why...? That's a telescopic one...
it's good.
MAN
First, it ain't German...it's
Japanese...and second, this ain't
no lens...it's like a...a...an
adaptor...so you got two shipments
of Jap adaptors with no lenses.
(HE LAUGHS)
MAN hands adaptor back to MICHAEL.
MICHAEL
(DISAPPOINTED)
A Jap adaptor?
TITLE APPEARS on bottom of screen: MICHAEL.
A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in
the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox,
contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.
JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN
CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child
and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut
looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled
from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
several months in reform school. He is reckless,
unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own
and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into
the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little
faster now and smiling a little more.
Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and
blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the
blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:
JOHNNY BOY.
5.
He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he
starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite
literally - like crazy.
JOHNNY BOY is walking along the street. It is rush hour and
the traffic is heavy. A shiny, late model car stops parallel
to JOHNNY BOY. The young boy (SAL) signals him by blowing
the horn. (Note that in the FLASHBACK, JOHNNY BOY'S face is
not bruised.)
SAL
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
JOHNNY BOY
Sal!... fourteen street.
SAL
Come on.
The police switch on their flashing red light and try to get
closer to them but the traffic is too heavy.
13.
SAL manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles
per hour.
JOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp-
post. He has seriously banged his head and blood is running
down his face. But because of the near proximity of the
police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of
dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street.
END FLASHBACK
CUT TO:
The BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness.
The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His
mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body
being stopped by the presence of a stationary object.
19.
He staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed
smashing directly into a parked car.
Everyone (including the two GAYS at the bar) is running out
the back way.
TONY
Don't run...don't run. Everyone
split up.
MICHAEL and JIMMY turn the corner and calmly walk to his
parked car. As they get into the car CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY
turn the corner.
CHARLIE
Michael, give us a lift.
MICHAEL
OK, get in.
As they are getting into the car the two GAYS turn the
corner. One of them, SAMMY, is very drunk and is crying
hysterically. His companion BENTON is trying to calm him
down when he notices MICHAEL.
BENTON
Michael...wait.
It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he
is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly
ushers them into the car.
MICHAEL
Get in, get in.
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY get out of the car first so that by
the time BENTON and SAMMY are out they are already on their
way down the street. MICHAEL drives away.
SAMMY
(SHOUTING)
Going our way?
CHARLIE
(to JOHNNY BOY)
Don't answer.
BENTON guides SAMMY the opposite way.
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are walking down the street on their
way home.
JOHNNY BOY
I don't think I should go home
looking like this. You think I
could stay at your place tonight?
Your mother's not there is she?
CHARLIE
No, she isn't.
CUT TO:
FLASHBACK
CHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side.
A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block.
CHARLIE and TERESA are sitting on the beach which is fairly
deserted. There are rented cottages behind them. TERESA
has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to
write a term paper for CHARLIE'S English class.
TERESA
C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll
call in sick for work.
CHARLIE
No...we can come back in a couple
of weeks. Besides, if we're both
gone for three days it wouldn't
look right.
TERESA
Ok.
CHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady
and tries to read it. He tosses it aside.
CHARLIE
Bore.
TERESA
A paper on that one too?
CHARLIE
Yeah...but don't worry about that
now. The Hemmingway one is first.
TERESA
It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
CHARLIE
Take your time. I don't care.
TERESA
I know you don't. You've been very
preoccupied lately.
CHARLIE
That's the word...preoccupied.
CHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She
playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with
that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions.
39.
CHARLIE
Let's go back inside.
CUT TO:
CHARLIE and TERESA already farther up the beach, walking.
They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in
front of it.
CHARLIE
See that...know who lives there?
The name George Earhardt mean
anything to you?
TERESA
Sure...He lives there?
CHARLIE
No. Of course he lives there.
Would I point it out to you if he
didn't?
CHARLIE is walking along the roadway and looking at the
different cottages. He is carrying a notebook to which he
periodically refers. He stops in front of a luxurious
cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one
in his notebook beside which is listed the name GROPPI. He
remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring
at it. It looks deserted.
FANTASY
42.
CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and
rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately
which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S
back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We
can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened
door.
GROPPI
What do you want kid?
At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears
in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.
GROPPI
What do you want?.......well?
CHARLIE
I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er
a magazines...newspapers...I'm
conducting a survey...I...
GROPPI
We don't want no fuckin' books!
GROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face.
REALITY
CHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly
a little boy of about nine appears.
BOY
There's nobody here mister.
CHARLIE turns in surprise.
CHARLIE
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
BOY
Yeah. But he ain't here now.
CHARLIE
Know where he is?
BOY
Follow me.
The BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area.
43.
CHARLIE
How much farther?
CHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the
BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a
dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out
but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had.
CHARLIE
(CONFESSION)
Now, don't get excited.
CHARLIE is trying to find his way out of the forest.
CHARLIE
(CONTINUED)
'The stone which the builders'
reject will become the
cornerstone'...I think.
MICHAEL
I gave him all the breaks I can give.
46.
CHARLIE
Oh Michael, look...
MICHAEL
Nevamind 'look'...This punk
bastard...I call him at work...I
say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He
doesn't even show up for work
anymore...
CHARLIE
Look...I've talked to him and I've
talked to him...what more can I
do...? Tonight at the party all
three of us get together and we
knock some sense into his head...ok?
MICHAEL
All right...but understand, I don't
like being taken advantage of. I
mean you're in there talking with
your uncle and all...This is
embarassing.
CHARLIE
We'll settle it tonight.
Two YOUNG BOYS about 15 years old walk up to CHARLIE.
BOY #1
Hey, you sell firecrackers?
CHARLIE
Firecrackers! No...no.
BOY #1
You know where we can get some?
CHARLIE
Sure, see that guy over there...
He points to MICHAEL.
CHARLIE
(CONTINUING)
...him. He's got the best.
The BOYS go over to MICHAEL.
BOY #1
Hey - fella...you sell firecrackers?
47.
MICHAEL
Sssh! Quiet.
(He looks around)
Y'know that's illegal.
BOY #2
Well the guy over there said...
MICHAEL
(INTERRUPTING)
Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta
be careful.
BOY #1
We went down to Chinatown but they
don't have any.
MICHAEL
Yeah, well, keep away from those
Chinx. They don't have shit.
BOY #2
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
MICHAEL
(INTERRUPTING)
All right! Quiet! For $40 I could
give you...
BOY #1
Well, I don't know if we want to
buy all $40 worth...
MICHAEL
Hey! You want good stuff, or you
want shit?
BOY #2
Well, we want good stuff.
MICHAEL
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland...
you know what that means?
BOY #1
No.
MICHAEL
That means it's good.
BOY #1
You got sparklers?
48.
MICHAEL
Yeah.
BOY #2
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and
rockets?
MICHAEL
Ok. For another $5.00 a special on
the packs.
BOY #1
No, all we got is $40.
MICHAEL
You sure?
BOYS
Yeah.
MICHAEL
Ok. Wait here.
MICHAEL goes to TONY, who has been standing in front of the
cafe with a group of boys. They talk for a minute, and go
back to the waiting boys.
MICHAEL
(to the boys)
C'mon. Get in the car.
The four of them get into TONY'S car. They drive to
CHINATOWN.
MICHAEL
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here
for me.
BOYS
Why?
MICHAEL
I gotta get the stuff.
BOYS
Can't we come with you?
MICHAEL
Nobody sees where I get the stuff.
That's good business. I'll be back
in thirty minutes.
49.
They start to get out.
MICHAEL
Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash.
BOYS
Uh...can we give you a check?
MICHAEL
A check? What the...hey, where you
kids from?
BOY #1
Riverdale.
MICHAEL
(CONTEMPTUOSLY)
Well, maybe they do that in
Riverdale, but down here we take
cash. Now, you got it or not?
They give him the money.
MICHAEL
Ok. Now wait here...and keep your
mouths shut!
The car pulls away.
TONY
How much?
MICHAEL
Not bad. $20. Here, $5.
TONY
Can you spare it?
MICHAEL
Sure.
TONY
(SARCASTICALLY)
Thanks.
The car pulls up at TONY'S PLACE. TONY yells to CHARLIE,
who is standing outside.
TONY
Hey Charlie. Get in.
CHARLIE gets in.
50.
CHARLIE
What's a'matter?
MICHAEL
Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids.
Don't want'em comin' back and
findin' you...start asking you
questions.
CHARLIE
How much?
MICHAEL
$20.
CHARLIE
Let's go to the movies...on you.
TONY
Yeah.
MICHAEL
Ok guys...have a heart. This is my
business.
BLACK & WHITE
The boys are paying for their tickets.
The two boys from Riverdale are still watching on the
corner, in the dark.
CHARLIE is talking to MICHAEL. The conversation is serious.
CHARLIE has not lost his sense of humor.
CHARLIE
He said he'd be here.
55.
MICHAEL
Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.
CHARLIE
He'll be here. Look, take this for
now.
He hands MICHAEL a twenty dollar bill from under his robe.
MICHAEL
You kiddin. The way it is now this
isn't even interest for two hours.
CHARLIE
(putting the bill
back into his pocket)
How much was the original loan again?
MICHAEL
$500. He borrowed that because he
wanted to pay off his other loans...
now, counting the interest...it's
almost $3,000.
CHARLIE
$3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at
$3,000?
MICHAEL
Charlie, this is business.
CHARLIE
(avoiding the issue)
'But I say to you, love your
enemies, do good to those who hate
you, and pray for those who
persecute...'
MICHAEL
I'll tell you who you can pray
for... Next payday, I'll be at
Tony's Place...Johnny better show
or I find him and break his
legs...and I mean it.
CHARLIE
(in the same manner)
'But I say to you not to resist the
evildoer; on the contrary, if
someone takes thy tunic, let him
take thy cloak as well...to him who
asks of thee, give; and from him
who would borrow of thee do not
turn away!
56.
MICHAEL
(EXASPERATED)
He could at least show some respect
and show his face, even if he
doesn't have the money...
CHARLIE
(more serious now)
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not
come out from it until thou hast
paid the last penny.'
MICHAEL
You said it.
A loud scream is heard from the bathroom.
CUT TO:
APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now
filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and
shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the
next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through
the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and
kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There
is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the
bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the
sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl
remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the
bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She
caresses him and they find themselves kissing. The others
storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE.
EVERYONE
Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ!
Crucify him!!
They drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the
shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are
placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their
own "dog fight". They are flying the planes out the open
window.
CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few
lines over their laughter.
CHARLIE
'Father...forgive them...for they
know not...what they do...'
The doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and
she looks very worried.
57.
TERESA
Charlie...? Charlie here...?
CUT TO:
BLACK & WHITE
CHARLIE and TERESA dash from a tenement doorway. CHARLIE is
still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give
the effect of being a bulky overcoat.
TERESA
(FRANTICALLY)
The building on the corner. That
one! He's been on the roof a half
hour now!
CHARLIE
Now don't get excited. Don't get
excited!!
It is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner
of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends
cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and
TERESA they call out.
FRIENDS
Charlie, stay there...He's crazy...
He's got a 22.
TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the
block and she leaves reluctantly.
CHARLIE
Johnny it's me, Charlie.
JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight
on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand.
JOHNNY BOY
Don't come any closer!!!
CHARLIE
Cut it out stupid. It's me.
JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the
wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run
for the doorway of the building across the street. He
enters the building that leads to the roof.
BLACK & WHITE
58.
CHARLIE has reached the roof.
JOHNNY BOY
Charlie...pssst. Over here.
He laughs with glee.
CHARLIE
What are you...crazy?
He slaps JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
JOHNNY BOY
Hey...don't do that...I'm only
scaring them.
CHARLIE
Stupid bastard...you get your
cousin half-sick over this.
The boys below are still clinging to the walls of the
building. JOHNNY is oblivious to CHARLIE'S statement.
JOHNNY BOY
Watch this.
He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass
cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick
through the top layer of cork. He lights it.
CHARLIE
What the fuck...
JOHNNY BOY tosses it over the building and it blows up in
mid-air. The boys below rush madly away. Lights go on in
the tenements around them. The explosion was quite loud.
CHARLIE
Let's get out of here.
JOHNNY BOY
(LAUGHING)
Did you see them run!
BLACK & WHITE
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are sneaking over a fence in an old
cemetary which is part of their neighborhood. It surrounds
their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th
century. No one is buried there any longer.
59.
It is very quiet and dark. They sit and rest. CHARLIE is
still in his makeup.
JOHNNY BOY
I swear to God Charlie...my arm
still hurts from the car
accident...that's why I didn't go
to work. I swear it.
CHARLIE
(ANGRY)
That's not going to help.
JOHNNY BOY
I'm going to work this week...I
mean it.
CHARLIE
It's impossible for you to catch up
on the loan now...the interest is
going up...$3,000...do you realize
that, flash?
JOHNNY BOY
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
CHARLIE
Big deal...in the meantime, it's
done...I'll still try to help you
out...You know that...but you gotta
show some effort...some respect...
understand?
JOHNNY BOY
Charlie, you know the best way to
take care of this whole mess.
CHARLIE
How?
JOHNNY BOY
(COAXING)
If you had a little talk with your
uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
CHARLIE
That'll help you out fine. That's
the best way for you, not for me!
I swear to God, I'll rip you open
if my uncle ever hears a word about
this. You understand? I don't
care what happens, he doesn't find
out.
(MORE)
60.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I don't get involved with anything,
you understand that? Nothing! I'm
clean as far as you know...right?
JOHNNY BOY
Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
CHARLIE
That's what I get for getting
involved. Look, on pay-day at
least show up at Tony's Place to
meet him, ok? This way he doesn't
think that you're trying to screw
him. If you show good faith and
save his face maybe we can talk and
he'll take off the interest or make
different payment arrangements or
something... understand? I'm not
asking I'm telling you!!
JOHNNY BOY
I understand.
JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and
then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems
totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
the distance.
CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
fire escape.
CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find
JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.
CHARLIE
'Could you not, then, watch one
hour with me?'
He wakes JOHNNY BOY up.
CHARLIE
'The spirit is willing but the
flesh is weak.'
61.
They leave.
CHARLIE bumps into MICHAEL and a friend as he is leaving.
MICHAEL
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight...
here...right?
CHARLIE
We'll be here.
MICHAEL is sarcastic. He points to the parked car in front
of him.
MICHAEL
I tell you, Charlie. If that kid
doesn't show up tonight...
76.
MICHAEL'S plan is seen on the screen as he speaks.
MICHAEL
...I'm gonna find him, drag him
down here, tie one of his legs to
that Ford bumper over here...
JOHNNY BOY is dragged to the car and MICHAEL'S friend ties
his leg to the car.
MICHAEL
...and his other leg to that
Chrysler over there.
JOHNNY BOY'S other leg is tied to the Chrysler.
MICHAEL
...and bam!!!
We see a close-up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal,
twice. One car heads for the West Side--the other to the
East Side. Tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air.
All three laugh.
CHARLIE
Look, Michael, I'll get him here.
What do you want me to do, kill him?
MICHAEL
Whatever.
CHARLIE leaves.
CUT TO:
JOHNNY BOY walking through Greenwich Village looking around
as if being chased.
CUT TO:
JOHNNY BOY is making his way back to the apartment by
sneaking along the sides of the buildings in the darkened
street.
CUT TO:
JOHNNY BOY imagines he is being followed and dashes into the
door of a nearby building and up the stairs.
CUT TO:
78.
JOHNNY BOY is silhouetted against the moonlight. He makes
his way quietly over the roofs of the tenements and climbs
down CHARLIE'S fire escape.
CUT TO:
In the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and
CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door.
CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending
resounding echoes into the street.
CHARLIE
You crazy bastard! What are you
trying to do, ruin me?
JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge
of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again
the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street.
CHARLIE
You...
Again, JOHNNY BOY is thrown up against the door.
CHARLIE
You threaten me with my uncle?
After what I'm doing for you?
JOHNNY BOY
What you're doing for me isn't
worth it...believe me!
CHARLIE slaps JOHNNY BOY and pushes him against the door
again.
CHARLIE
Then don't show up tonight and see
what happens.
CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but
he can't find anything.
CHARLIE
How much have you got for Michael
tonight?
83.
JOHNNY BOY
I only got eight bucks on me.
CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand
into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and
three ones.
CHARLIE
Here, take twenty bucks. With your
eight that makes twenty-eight bucks
you give Michael. I keep the
thirteen for the weekend. Maybe
we'll eat some Chinese food later.
JOHNNY BOY doesn't take it. CHARLIE forces it into his hand.
CHARLIE
Take it. I'm doing it for you,
stupid!
JOHNNY BOY
No you're not...
CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed.
CHARLIE
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
JOHNNY BOY
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is
nothing. The only way to do it is
through your uncle...think about it
will you?
CHARLIE
NO!!! What do you think I am,
crazy???
JOHNNY BOY
No, I just want to help myself,
that's all.
CHARLIE
Come on.
He tugs JOHNNY BOY along.
CUT TO:
JOHNNY BOY is lifting the lid of a garbage pail. He takes
out a brown paper bag and opens it. He takes a small .22
pistol from it and puts it inside his jacket, then replaces
the bag in the garbage pail.
CUT TO:
88.
CHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front
seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving
with no particular destination in mind.
JOHNNY BOY
I think we should see your uncle.
CHARLIE
No.
JOHNNY BOY
This can't be settled any other way
now...I'll take full blame.
CHARLIE
Forget it.
91.
JOHNNY BOY
What are you going to do? Hide me?
CHARLIE
Good idea.
JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock
song.
CHARLIE
(CONFESSION)
I guess you could safely say that
this evening has been so far very
unimpressive as far as my efforts
are concerned...more unproductive.
Now, I'd like to know what you do,
for an encore, Lord? I know
penance is penance but this is
something else.
JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes.
JOHNNY BOY
What are you talking to yourself???
He turns up the radio.
CHARLIE
(SARCASTIC)
Go ahead! Play the radio...play
music...you're going to a party...
louder! Go ahead. Louder. A
party. Lots of fun.
A black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S
car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted.
The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road.
CHARLIE
Hey, what is this guy, crazy?
CUT TO:
BLACK SEDAN - MICHAEL AND ANOTHER BOY.
VOICE
Now, now's the time!
CHARLIE turns his head to look. JOHNNY BOY looks up. They
fire the gun.
CUT TO:
92.
FULL COLOR SHOTS
A barage of bullets (5 gunshots) hit CHARLIE'S car. CHARLIE
is hit in the hand. JOHNNY BOY has been hit in the throat.
He stands up and leans over the windshield of the car,
spewing blood onto it and into the wind. He is screaming.
The black sedan turns onto another street.
CUT TO:
TONY'S CONVERTIBLE
CHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of
control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and
slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water
to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has
been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding
his wrist. He is on the yellow letters "FIRE LANE." JOHNNY
BOY lies against the side of a building--still. CHARLIE
goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand.
The police arrive with their guns drawn.
CUT TO:
Back in the neighborhood, the religious fiesta is ending.
The singers on the bandstand are singing the last song of
the evening, "Vincino Amare." A crowd of elderly Italian-
Americans stand below the bandstand and listen. There are
four singers, their voices projected through a PA system.
MUSIC:
CONTINUES THROUGH ALL CUTS.
CUT TO:
TERESA'S ROOM
TERESA is in bed, asleep. The music can be heard echoing in
the background.
CUT TO:
CHARLIE is still sitting on the curb holding his injured
wrist. The ambulance and the police are going about their
business. A crowd has gathered.
CUT TO:
GIOVANNI'S LIVING ROOM
93.
GIOVANNI is watching the Late Late Show on T.V. (Car
explosion scene from "The Big Heat"). Aside from the light
of the screen, the room is darkened.
CUT TO:
ALL NIGHT VILLAGE LUNCHEONETTE
DIANE is alone, sipping coffee.
CUT TO:
The police are standing around CHARLIE with open notebooks,
questioning him. He doesn't answer. JOHNNY BOY'S body is
being taken into the ambulance.
CUT TO:
TONY'S PLACE - MEN'S ROOM
TONY is relieving himself. He washes his hands.
CUT TO:
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET
The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers
come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian.
SINGERS
Good night...Good night...thank
you...good night!
The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers
throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been
watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go
in.
CUT TO:
MICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED
MICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He
has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing.
CUT TO:
STREET CORNER
CHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb.
The police are still walking around in a businesslike manner.
94.
CHARLIE stares down at his feet. The wrecked car is being
pulled away.
CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to
himself and seems shocked and bewildered.
CUT TO:
There is practically no one on the street. The early
morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits
at the bottom of the steps.
MARIO
(pauses for a moment)
Giovanni says now he done enough.
He got you outta jail. Now...
(reaching in pocket)
he wants you outta the way.
MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.
MARIO
He says use it. Don't sell it. He
says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe.
CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously
uncomfortable.
MARIO
(ABRUPTLY)
Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry.
CUT TO:
95.
The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the
curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter,
and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans
across the seat toward him.
TONY
Listen, try a place with some sun.
Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls
in little French bathing suits.
CHARLIE
(SMILES)
Thanks for the ride.
CHARLIE breaks away from the handshake and grabs TONY
affectionately behind the neck.
CHARLIE
Take care of that tiger.
97.
TONY
(CORRECTING HIM)
Panther...
CHARLIE
Panther! Same thing...
TONY
Hey...no more good times like
before. Until you come back.
CHARLIE
Sure. And you're gonna take the
vows next Tuesday, right.
TONY
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
TONY gives CHARLIE'S hand a last slap, then gets back behind
the wheel.
TONY
See you.
CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks
up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.
