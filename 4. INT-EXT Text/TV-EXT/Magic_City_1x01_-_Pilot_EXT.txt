      The black ocean thuds against the beach twelve stories below. 
      Ike inhales the salt and jasmine-scented Miami air. He lights 
      up a Cuban cigar. A pink stripe blushes the horizon. A new 
      day. The last day of 1958.

      [SUPER ON SCREEN: December 31, 1958 - MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA]

      Ike sighs a cloud of cigar smoke and, leaning over, sees a 
      shape floating in the lit swimming pool.

                                  IKE
                          (grabbing the balcony 
                            phone)
                    Victor? There s a goddamn palm 
                    frond floating in the--
                          (looking closer)
                    Oh, Jesus.                                                                                       2.



      Ike blows out through the double glass doors into a madhouse: 
      hundreds of striking, sign-carrying HOTEL WORKERS, chanting 
      and picketing on the Miramar sidewalk. Ike, still carrying 
      Vera s limp poodle, shoves past a uniformed Miami Beach COP 
      and steps in front of a hulking STRIKER.

                                  IKE
                    Tell Mike Strauss I wanna see him. 
                    Wolfies. Ten am.

      The big Union Guy nods, looks down at the dead dog in Ike s 
      arms.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    And tell him Fluffy says  hi !

      Ike tosses the dead poodle at the huge man. The goon catches 
      it as Ike smashes him in the face. Blood sprays from the big 
      guy s nose. Other STRIKERS charge Ike who leaps like a 
      dervish into the pile. Victor, Danny and a few COPS yank Ike 
      from the fight, dragging him towards his hotel.                                                                                      3.


      Ike, Danny and Victor stand on the top step, looking down at 
      the melee. Ike straightens his clothes, smoothes back his 
      hair -- composes himself. He takes out a wad of crisp bills 
      and snaps off a few twenties, handing the cash to Victor.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Get Vee another white poodle. Now. 
                    Before she wakes up.

      Victor starts for the entrance.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Vic! 
                          (tossing Fluffy s collar)
                    Make sure it s a girl dog.
                          (to Danny)
                    Where s Stevie?

                                  DANNY
                    Sleeping? You check his--

                                  IKE
                    Find your idiot brother. The 
                    Teamsters won t cross the picket 
                    line to deliver my booze. It s 
                    goddamn New Years Eve! I got 
                    fifteen hundred thirsty people 
                    comin  to see Sinatra tonight. Get 
                    Stevie!

      Danny nods and runs back into the hotel. Ike stands on the 
      top step, surveying the wild street scene. He turns back into 
      the Miramar.


      STEVIE EVANS (26), careens an aqua T-Bird convertible down 
      Indian Creek Drive. Stevie, eyes at half-mast, smokes a KOOL, 
      works the power-steering with his index finger. Johnny Otis  
       Willie and The Hand Jive  blasts from the T-Bird stereo. A 
      tousled BLONDE BEAUTY lifts her head from Stevie s lap, looks 
      up at him. 

                                  BLONDE
                    Stevie, slow down.

                                  STEVIE
                    I will if you will.

      Stevie smiles, gently presses down on her head, guiding her 
      back below the dash.  Willie and the Hand Jive  chugs on. 
      Stevie leans back, driving fast. His eyes close.

      BAM!!! The T-Bird crashes through the guardrail, soars high 
      into the air and splashes into Indian Creek.  Hand Jive  
      blares as the car bobs for a beat, then nose-dives beneath 
      the black water. 

      Stevie and the Blonde sputter to the surface unhurt.

                                  BLONDE
                          (spinning in frantic 
                            circles)
                    My car! I lost my car!!

                                  STEVIE
                    It s not lost... 

      Stevie strokes to shore. 

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                    ...It s just holdin  it s breath.

                                  BLONDE
                    What?! Stevie... Stevie!!!


      Ike leans against the coral sea wall watching THIRTY OLD 
      JEWISH MEN, sitting in folding chairs on the lawn, play their 
      balalaikas (mandolins). Their delicate Russian melody drifts 
      over the Ocean Drive traffic and the waves hitting the beach 
      behind them.

      The song ends and a few scattered people, including Ike, 
      clap. An EIGHTY-THREE YEAR-OLD MAN, one of the musicians, 
      sees Ike and waves his balalaika. The old man wears a 
      stained, white skipper s cap.                                                                                       6.


      This is ARTHUR EVANS, Ike s father. Arthur has the pronounced 
      shakes of fully-developed Parkinson s disease.

      Ike crosses to his father but before he can help, a curvy 
      Cuban  NURSE  swoops in and lifts Arthur from his chair. 
      Arthur leers at the nurse s bountiful and exposed cleavage.

                                  ARTHUR
                    That Inez got some rack on her.

                                  INEZ
                    Hush, Arturo.

                                  IKE
                    Yeah. It s lovely.

      The trio (Inez and Arthur arm-in-arm) slowly make their way 
      across the grass towards Arthur s black Chrysler Imperial 
      parked on the curb.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Sounded pretty good out there, Pop. 
                       Tumbalalaika . Mom used to sing 
                    that to me--

                                  ARTHUR
                    You know, Inez gives me a shower 
                    every morning.

      Ike sighs, he s heard this before. Many times.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Sits me on a stool in the shower. 
                    Soaps me up everywhere...

         ARTHUR                               IKE
      Even my privates.                 Even my privates.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Listen smart ass.

                                  IKE
                    You look really clean, Pop.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Heard you re having dog problems, 
                    big shot.

                                  IKE 
                    Good news travels fast.

                                  ARTHUR 
                    Still got a few friends.                                                                                       7.


      They reach the sidewalk. Inez casually hooks Arthur s belt to 
      the parking meter while she fishes for the car keys in her 
      purse. Arthur dangles from the parking meter, barely standing 
      on on his tip-toes. Ike looks over, concerned.

                                  IKE 
                    Dad? Hey, Inez?

                                  INEZ
                          (waving Ike off)
                    Is okay. He likes it.

      Arthur, dangling from the meter, squints up at Ike.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What do you need?

                                  IKE
                    I was wondering, I thought maybe 
                    you d could put a word in with Al 
                    Strauss. He s retired but Mikey 
                    listens to--

                                  ARTHUR 
                    Putz. 

                                  IKE
                    What?

      Inez unhooks the old man and slides him into the passenger 
      seat.

                                  ARTHUR 
                    The union s nothing. Your only 
                    problem is you got some hungry 
                    partners. 

                                  IKE
                    Christ! How many times----

                                  ARTHUR
                    You think they re happy with 
                    crumbs? Those goniffs? They re big 
                    eaters, Isaac, hungry boys.

                                  IKE
                    Don t start this crap again Pop. 
                    Don t. There are no partners. The 
                    Miramar s mine.

      Arthur studies his son, shrugs...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Well. There is one good thing...                                                                                      8.


      Inez comes around and shuts the door. Arthur says something 
      unheard behind the glass window.

                                  IKE 
                    What?

      Arthur rolls down the window, leans out. The Chrysler pulls 
      away.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (out the window)
                    I never liked that faggy dog.


      Ike watches the gleaming black Chrysler cruise north up Ocean 
      Drive, a world of worry etched on his face.

                   
                  

 


                         END OF TEASER

                             ACT ONE




       HOLY JOE , a scrawny, middle-aged, street-preacher dressed 
      in a white short-sleeved shirt, narrow black tie and baggy, 
      soiled dress pants, blocks the Wolfies  entrance, waving a 
      New Testament bible at the mostly Jewish patrons. 

                                  HOLY JOE
                    Repent, pagans! Christ killers! The 
                    New Year is upon us! Find your way 
                    to the Lord! Fear Satan! Repent 
                    before it s too late! 

      A tiny OLD LADY shoves Holy Joe from the front door.

                                  OLD LADY
                      Meshugener!


      Ike eases his black  58 Lincoln Mark II through the mob of 
      strikers. They bang on his pristine hood, slap placards on 
      the doors. A striker hurls a gob of spit on the windshield. A 
      nightmare. Ike pulls into the covered hotel carport. MONTY 
      the aging, hipster valet rushes over to get his door. 

                                  MONTY
                    Mr. E. Sorry about the mob.

                                  IKE
                          (in motion)
                    What mob? Have it washed okay 
                    Monty?

                                  MONTY
                    Done, Boss.



      A FEW BLACK MEN hang outside the two-story hotel. A sidewalk 
      stand sells hot peanuts, burgers and ribs. Stevie s red 
      Corvette shines at the hotel curb.


      FROM ABOVE - HUNDREDS OF STRIKERS block the sidewalk in front 
      of the hotel. WTVJ news trucks, the Miami Herald, shoot the 
      mob.

                                  GIRL (OS)
                    I hate Paul Anka!

                                  VERA (O.S.)
                    Why, honey?

                                  GIRL (OS)
                    Cause he s fat!

                                  VERA (O.S.)
                    That s so mean. And it s not nice 
                    to hate.                                                                                    26.



      The mansion s lit, second story window. Shadows move inside. 
      A woman s piercing, awful scream.

                                  IKE (V.O.)
                    ... He s done it before. 

                                  VERA (V.O.)
                    Done what?


      Ike passes sexy dance instructor BONNIE BELL with her class 
      of leering middle-aged husbands. A cha-cha blares. Bonnie 
      (wearing skin-tight clam-diggers and a tiny blouse tied below 
      her bust) moves one of her students around the sunny patio in 
      a clumsy cha-cha.

                                  IKE
                    Looking good Bon . You seen Stevie?

                                  BONNIE
                          (to the class)
                    One-two, cha-cha-cha!
                          (to Stevie)
                    On the beach.

                                  IKE
                    Thanks.

      Ike circles the olympic-size pool and heads to the beach.


      Ike trudges across the hot sand towards the water. Holy Joe 
      walks through the beach crowd, preaching, handing out flyers.

                                  HOLY JOE
                          (to Ike)
                    You are going to hell!

                                  IKE
                    Tell me somethin  I don t know.                                                                                    32.


      Holy Joe moves down the beach. Ike squints out to sea. Stevie 
      swims parallel to the shore about twenty yards out, stroking 
      like an athlete. Ike walks to Stevie s towel and clothes, 
      takes out a handkerchief, lays it on the sand and sits down. 
      Ike watches his son swim.

      Stevie finishes his swim and runs out of the water to Ike.

                                  STEVIE
                          (panting from exertion)
                      Everything all right?

                                  IKE
                    Yeah. Why?

                                  STEVIE
                    Why? You on the beach? 

                                  IKE
                    You called Judi Silver for me?

                                  STEVIE
                    Yep. She s ours. I m gonna see her 
                    at four.

                                  IKE
                    Good.

      Ike pats the sand beside him. Stevie sits on his towel. They 
      stare out to sea. Ike gestures to the row of bathing-suited 
        grandmothers clinging to the safety line strung out into the 
      ocean.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                      A necklace of bubbies.

      Stevie smiles.

                                  STEVIE
                    That s what mom called them.

                                  IKE
                    Yep.

      Stevie digs through his clothes, finds and lights up a Kool.

                                  STEVIE
                    When you met mom, saw her for the 
                    first time, did you, was it like 
                    that thing? Like in the movies? I 
                    mean, did you know -- bang -- she 
                    was the one?                                                                                     33.


                                  IKE
                    No... That came after. It did come, 
                    she was the love of my life, but 
                    not like that. Not that way. 
                          (looking at Stevie)
                    That only happened with Vera.

      Stevie listens.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    I saw Vera sitting at a bus stop, 
                    up near Pumpernicks. I was driving 
                    home, stopped at a red light. I 
                    don t know why but for some reason 
                    I looked over and there she was. 
                    She looked at me and... I lost my 
                    breath. I actually forgot how to 
                    breathe. But, you know, the light 
                    changed, people started honking so 
                    I drove on. Drove right around the 
                    block. By the time I got back 
                    around she was gone.

                                  STEVIE
                    What d you do?

                                  IKE
                      I followed the goddamn K bus to 
                    Flagler Street. Took an hour but 
                    she finally got off. That was it.

      Stevie stares at his father, understanding.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    You know that feeling?

      Stevie nods.

                                  STEVIE
                    Yeah. Finally.

      Ike pats his son on the leg.

                                  IKE
                      Congratulations...

      Ike stands.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    ...You poor son of a bitch. Call me 
                    before you leave the warehouse.

                                  STEVIE
                    Will do.                                                                                    34.


      Ike slogs back through the sand towards his hotel. Stevie 
      watches him a moment, then turns back to the necklace of 
      bubbies bobbing out in the jade ocean.

                              ACT THREE




      A taxi filled with TOURISTS inches up the curb. The strikers 
      wave it away. Monty, the valet, charges out to clear a lane 
      but he s swallowed up by the mob. The cab turns around and 
      flees.


      Stevie walks down the row of cabanas with burly Barry  Cuda  
      Lansman.

                                  CUDA
                    They re sweet kids. From Savanah, 
                    Mobile. Peaches... Come on.

      Barry stops, knocks on a cabana door. The Everly Brothers  
       All I Have To Do Is Dream  oozes from inside. Girls giggle. 
      A twenty-year old HEARTBREAKER wrapped in a Miramar beach 
      towel, opens the door.

                                  GIRL
                    Barry. Can we get some more 
                    champagne and--

                                  GIRL 2 (O.S.)
                          (from inside)
                    Cold champagne.

                                  GIRL
                    Cold champagne. And Virginia needs 
                    a sewing kit.

                                  CUDA
                    Babe. Yours. All yours. This is 
                    Stevie Evans. Your host for 
                    tonight.

                                  GIRL
                          (purring at Stevie)
                    The host with the most. Come on in 
                    Shug. Say hi to the girls.
                          (opening the door)
                    Everybody indecent? We got company.                                                                                    38.


      Stevie smiles at her and they enter.


      Stevie shuts the door behind him.

                                  CUDA
                    The Bear Bryant of hookers.

      They continue down the row of cabanas. Cuda knock on another 
      door a few cabanas down. The door opens a crack, checks Cuda, 
      then opens to let them in.


      Ike sits in his car looking at the gated estate. He tosses 
      his cigarette and drives to the front gate. Ike pushes the 
      intercom.

                                  MAN S VOICE (OS)
                          (on intercom)
                    Yeah.

                                  IKE
                    It s Ike.

      The gate swings open. Ike drives slowly down the long 
      driveway to the low-slung, modern mansion. Ike parks. A 
      stylish (but lethal) mobster,  DANDY  PHIL HAAS washes a 
      black, 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with a 
      sudsy bucket.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Phil. New car?

                                  DANDY PHIL
                    New girl. New car. You know the 
                    drill.

                                  IKE
                    She s a beauty.                                                                                    40.


                                  DANDY PHIL
                    Yeah. And a bitch... The 
                      raisinette s out back on the deck.

      Ike heads around the house. TWO HUGE DOBERMANS spring from 
      nowhere, snarling and frothing. One bites it s own tongue.

                                  DANDY PHIL (CONT D)
                    Schnell! Schnell!

      The dogs drop into submission.

                                  DANDY PHIL (CONT D)
                    Kraut bitch dogs. Ben s got  em 
                    trained in German. Sorry, kid.

                                  IKE
                    No problem.

      Ike carefully steps around the twin killers. Their eyes 
      follow him.


      A wide, manicured lawn spills down to Biscayne Bay. Ike walks 
      past the sky-blue swimming pool. A woman swims laps 
      underwater, her long body rippling beneath the water. Ike 
      stares down at her. She reaches the end, exploding to the 
      surface, splashing a wave over Ike s loafers. The swimmer is 
      Lily! The love of Stevie Evans life.

                                  LILY
                    Sorry. Soaked your shoes.

                                  IKE
                    Cooled me off. Ike Evans.

                                  LILY
                          (reaching up a wet hand)
                    Lily Augustine... Diamond. 

                                  IKE
                    Pleasure,  Mrs. Diamond. Hope to 
                    see you tonight at our Sinatra 
                    show.

                                  LILY
                          (smiles)
                    Mr. Evans?  Of course. From the 
                      Miramar... Absolutely. Wouldn t 
                    miss it.

      Lily waves and back-turns into another lap.                                                                                    41.


      Ike watches her.

                                  BEN (O.S.)
                          (loudly)
                    Put your eyes back in your head.

      Ben Diamond lies all oiled and shiny on a chaise. The chaise 
      sits on a circular, redwood deck built into the lawn. Ben 
      takes off his yellow plastic sun goggles, reaches over and 
      hits a remote. The deck turns like a lazy-susan. Ben squints 
      up, searching for the perfect sun spot. He stops the lazy-
      susan and reclines. Ben is the color of fine wood.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Sit down. Catch a few rays. You 
                    look like a ghost.

      Ike walks onto the deck and sits on the next chaise. Ben 
      slips the sun shades on and lies back like a basking reptile.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    She s got great lungs.

                                  IKE
                    Sorry?

                                  BEN
                    Lily. She swam up in Weeki Watchi. 
                    Danced underwater without breathing 
                    for four, five minutes at a pop. 
                    Then she d suck on a hose for air 
                    and do it some more. Girl can suck 
                    on that hose.

                                  IKE
                    Hmm.

                                  BEN
                    You got a pool with a window over 
                    at your joint, right? Maybe you 
                    should get some mermaids? Do a 
                    show.

      Lily gets out of the pool and walks across the deck to her 
      towel. She is death in a bikini.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Shotzi needs a walk.

      Lily slathers herself in Coppertone, oiling her long, pin-
      up s legs.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    You hear me?                                                                                    42.


                                  LILY
                    I m sorry. Are you talking to me?

                                  BEN
                    Don t be sorry. Just walk the damn 
                    dog.

                                  LILY
                    Well, can t Phil--

      Ben sits up takes off his sun goggles and glares at her. Lily 
      gets up from her chaise and heads into the house.

                                  BEN
                          (lying back down)
                    Treat  em mean, keep  em keen.

      Ike watches Lily s perfect body stride into the house.

                                  IKE
                    I m, I was sorry to hear about

                                  BEN
                    Yeah. I m still in mourning... 
                    Remember the day you, me and Do 
                    went out to the  Glades, out to 
                    your quarry together?

      Ike nods.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Smart girl, that Doris. She looked 
                    into that hole you were digging out 
                    all that coral--

                      Limestone, right, for the hotel 
                    lobby and she asked you how deep 
                    the water was. And you said, 
                       bottomless .

                                  IKE
                          (repeating to himself)

                    That Doris never missed a trick,

      Ike takes a deep breath, exhales.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                      Limestone. Coral. Marble. You spent

                                  BEN
                    How about this month?

      Ike sits, sweating in the sun.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    How about now? You got sixty-five 
                    g s on you now? It s the end of the 
                    month. I hear you got some union 
                    problems, Isaac. Lotta pressure. 
                    That place is your dream. Be a sin 
                    to lose your dream.

                                  IKE 
                    I m not gonna lose anything.

      Ben reaches over and picks up a pitcher of water and pours it 
      over his sweaty belly.

                                  BEN
                    I think you might still be 
                    dreaming, Ike.

                                  IKE
                    What do you want?

                                  BEN
                    You came to me. What do you want?                                                                                    44.


                                  IKE
                    I want the strike over. I want 
                      everything back to normal. I need 
                    your help tonight.

                                  BEN
                    Why come to me? I m not in the 
                    union?

                                  IKE
                    Right. What ll it take? What do you 
                    want?

                                  BEN 
                    The rest.

                                  IKE
                    No.

                                  BEN
                    What did you say?

                                  IKE
                    No. The Miramar is--

                                  BEN
                    Mine!

      Ben smashes the glass pitcher on the deck, whips up into a 
      sitting position and jabs a finger into Ike s face. A shard 
      of flying glass slashes Ike s cheek. Ike brushes the blood, 
      smearing it across his face.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Mine!

                                  IKE
                    Fine. Take it. But without me. Take 
                    it without me. You know what the 
                    Miramar is worth without me running 
                    it?

      Ike stands.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    It s a pile of silverware and 
                    towels and sand. You d get half 
                    what you put in. Take it. Choke on 
                    it.

      Ike turns to leave.                                                                                    45.


                                  BEN
                    Hey. Hey! Come here. Come here.
                          (handing Ike a face towel)
                    Here.

      Ike takes it, holds it to his cut.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Jesus. You are very, very high 
                    strung these days.

      Ike stares at him.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Hear me? I m serious. You gotta 
                    relax.

      Ike watches the gangster.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Go home. Kiss that pretty shiksa 
                    wife. Have a drink. I ll see you 
                    tonight.

      Ike turns, starts to leave.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Hey Isaac. You ever hear the story 
                    about the frog and the scorpion?

                                  IKE
                    No.

                                  BEN
                    The scorpion begs the frog to carry 
                    it across the river. The frog says, 
                     No. If I carry you, you ll sting 
                    me to death.  The scorpion says, 
                     Come on Froggy. I sting you, we 
                    both drown.  So the frog lets the 
                    scorpion hop on. Halfway across the 
                    river, the scorpion whips his 
                    stinger into the frog s ass. As the 
                    frog is sinking and they re both 
                    gonna drown, the frog says to the 
                    scorpion,  But why?  You know what 
                    the scorpion says?

      Ike shakes his head.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                     It s in my nature ... In the end, 
                    Ike, we are who we are.                                                                                    46.


      Ben lies back down. Ike watches him for a beat and heads 
      across the lawn.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    I want more. Ike. 

      Ike turns to Ben, who lies on his chaise wearing the sun-
      goggles.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    That s what I always want... more. 
                    Think about that as we swim across 
                    the river together.

      Ike lies on his back, catching the day s last sun.


      Ike trudges to his car. Lily stands, smoking a cigarette in 
      her bikini and heels, holding a small dacshund on a leash. 
      The dog pisses on the spotless whitewall of Ben s gleaming 
      Cadillac Biarritz. 

      Lily smiles at Ike. Ike smiles back, gets into his car and 
      motors down the gravel driveway. Lily exhales a cloud of 
      smoke.

 





                          END OF ACT THREE



                                                                                                            47.




                             ACT FOUR




      Ike screeches up to the hospital, parks and runs inside.


      Lily swims to the side as Stevie blasts up from Lounge level. 
      He slows, trying to be cool, walks to her.

      Lily climbs from the water in one graceful move. Stevie 
      reaches her.

                                  LILY
                    Hand me my towel?

      Stevie takes the towel and drapes it over Lily s shoulders. 
      He pulls her closer with it.

                                  LILY (CONT D)
                    I m gonna get you all wet.

                                  STEVIE
                    I hope so.

      Lily smiles. Stevie leans forward to kiss her. Lily pulls 
      away.                                                                                    54.


                                  LILY
                    Not here.

                                  STEVIE
                    Okay.

      Stevie takes Lily s hand as she scoops up her cabana bag. He 
      leads her up the stairs to the second level of cabanas. 
      Stevie stops at the last one and, taking out his master house 
      key, unlocks the door. 

                                  LILY
                    You ve done this before.

      Stevie looks at her for a moment.

                                  STEVIE
                    Nope. Never this.

      Stevie leads her inside the cabana. Sunlight shoots through 
      the slatted door. The towel drops to her feet. They kiss. 
      Lily sheds her bathing suit, hungrily undressing him. 

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                    There s no rush.

      Lily pulls Stevie down to the terry cloth covered chaise.

                                  LILY
                    Yes... There really is.

      Stevie and Lily make desperate love.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Danny sprints past the pool, taking the stairs two at a time.


      Shadowy bedroom. Union lawyer Mike Strauss lies in bed, post-
      coital drowsy. A nude Judi Silver curls against him. BANG! 
      The door kicks open and two THUGS blow in, pistol-whip 
      Strauss in the face and haul him, unconscious and in his 
      underwear, from the room. Judi clutches the sheets to 
      herself, shaking.


      Ike exhales a thick cloud of cigar smoke and turns from the 
      ocean view, heading inside.                                                                                    57.



      Ike, flanked by Victor and Danny, stands at the top step of 
      the hotel entrance, staring down at the churning mob of 
      strikers. 

      HORNS HONK. Three battered Mac trucks chug through the angry 
      crowd. The strikers surge around them, slowing the trucks to 
      a stop feet from the covered hotel driveway. 

      Stevie, behind the wheel of the lead truck, throws open the 
      door and jumps into the sea of picketers. Danny charges down 
      to help his brother. 

                                  IKE
                    DANNY!!!

      Ike and Victor shove into the melee throwing punches at 
      anyone that moves. Grady and his boxers leap from the trucks, 
      throwing combinations like pros... Ike falls to the asphalt. 
        A steel-toed boot rises above his face. BLAM! Ray-Ray, the 
      bell-hop, flies into the striker levelling him and saving his 
      boss. Ike jumps up. A full-fledged riot. Cop cars swerve in, 
      lights strobing. Suddenly a BULLHORN cuts through the battle.

                                  MAN ON BULLHORN
                    IT S OVER! IT... IS... OVER!! 
                    STOP!!!

      Strikers turn in mid-punch. The huge UNION GUY that Ike 
      tossed a dead Fluffy at (now with blackened eyes) wields the 
      bullhorn.

                                  UNION GUY (ON BULLHORN)
                    The strike is called!
                          (waving a paper)
                    Mike Strauss has called the strike. 
                    It... is... over!

      The picketers drop their signs and begin to drift away from 
      the entrance. Ike looks past the trucks and the dispersing 
      mob. 

                                  UNION GUY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                          (on bullhorn)
                    Please. Everybody. Go home. We will 
                    be in contact with you about 
                    further actions, if any.

      ACROSS COLLINS AVENUE - Ben Diamond s shiny Cadillac Biarritz 
      sits at the curb.

      IKE stares after Ben s caddy.                                                                                    58.


      The black Cadillac pulls into Collins Avenue traffic and 
      disappears in a sea of tail-lights. 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      The lifeguard shack rocks on it s stilts. The Miramar hotel 
      shines like a diamond behind it.


      Mike Strauss sits between the two thugs in the back seat of 
      the car, his battered, pulpy face strobed by passing car 
      headlights.                                                                                    61.
