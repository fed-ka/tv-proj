      A behemoth, imposing mansion, sprawling grounds, old money.


      Taking advantage of this mild, early spring day, six CHILDREN 
      are playing hide and seek with a regal, statuesque woman of 

      49, KATHERINE RUMOHR.  She wears a T-shirt and jeans but it s 
      impossible to dress down her class.


                                  KATHERINE

                    Okay, I m starting...

      She covers her eyes.


                                  KATHERINE
                    One!  You guys better get moving!


      The children scatter in all directions, toward the beach, the 
      dock, the dunes and the house.


                                  KATHERINE
                    Two!

      Katherine smiles watching them between her fingers.



                                  KATHERINE
                    Three!


      CAMERA follows a 5 year-old boy, CHARLIE RUMOHR, as he darts 
      toward the residence.


                                  KATHERINE (O.S.)

                    Four...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Katherine is hot on the heels of one of the kids, both of 
      them huffing and laughing, when she HEARS the GUNSHOT. 

      Katherine stops cold and wheels around to the mansion, the 
      color running out of her face until her cheeks mirror the 
      wispy, pale clouds gathering above.


                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

66

      A windy day, gusts sweeping the streets clean.  

      Pick up WILL TRAVERS, a hard 36, his boyish face made coarse 
      and trustworthy by some indeterminate suffering.  There is a 
      faint lavender pall under his eyes from lost sleep.

      Will is dressed in corduroy pants, oxford button-down, 
      sweater, Navy pea coat.  It s his daily uniform donned so he 
      doesn t have to pay attention to his appearance.

      There is a fish delivery truck at the corner.  As Will 
      passes, the DELIVERYMAN watches him go.  Their eyes catch for 
      a split second.

      Will comes to a building with only one tenant.  He pushes the 
      BUZZER for the  AMERICAN POLICY INSTITUTE 

      SHOT of a tiny CAMERA in the corner of the vestibule inside.

      Beat, then it buzzes.

      Will pushes open the heavy door and enters.

      Just inside is a reception desk behind which sits NORRIS 
      SCHOTT, Reyn Spooner Hawaiian shirt, imperturbable eyes, face 
      wizened as beef jerky, possibly retired military.   He has a 
        surveillance monitor in front of him but is more focused on 
      the day s sports page.

      CAMERA follows Will through a second door, this one unlocked, 
      into the American Policy Institute.


      The common area is as austere, clean and nondescript as any 
      law firm.  But every office ringing the common area is 
      actively lived-in, personalized with photos, artwork, plants, 
      crocheted pillows on couches that fold out into beds.

      We get the impression that once someone arrives here, at 
      whatever point in their career, they stay.

      There is a cacophony of phones constantly ringing.  It should 
      be assumed every time we return here, phones are ringing as 
      white noise in the background.

      Bunches of four offices are grouped together with their own 
      conference rooms.

      Will passes a wide staircase leading down to what we SEE is a 
      vast underground LIBRARY.

      He keeps walking.

      Will nods hello to MILES FIEDLER, 40 but could pass for 70, a 
      world-class neurotic with long hair, permanently glassy eyes 
      and yellowed fingers from a two pack a day smoking habit.  

      Fiedler drinks deeply from a cup of black coffee, then places 
      a nicotine patch on his shoulder.  Now he gets up and hurries 
      to keep pace with Will, who doesn t slow.


                                    FIEDLER
                    If a client doesn t know what 
                    questions to ask...

                                  WILL
                    We tell them what questions to ask.

                                    FIEDLER
                    An adversary doesn t know how far 
                    they re willing to bend, I m 
                    thinking we try the same thing.

                                  WILL
                    This for next week s North Korea 
                    session?
                          (Fiedler nods)
                    Has it been done with success?

      Fiedler takes out Nicorette gum and eats a piece.

                                    FIEDLER 
                      Brezhnev s loaded on vodka at an 
                    orgy negotiating SALT II with 
                    Carter.  He refuses Carter s every 
                    ask.  Cy Vance tells Carter to 
                    agree to Brezhnev s asks...

                                  WILL
                    But then repeat them back using his 
                    own instead of Brezhnev s.

                                    FIEDLER
                    Yeah.  Carter shouts louder and 
                    louder over Brezhnev s ladies but 
                    by the time he s done, Brezhnev 
                    says he s glad Carter saw the light 
                    and they had a deal.


      Will lifts his chin at the nicotine patch and the Nicorette.

                                  WILL 
                    Isn t that an either/or type of 
                    thing?  The goal is to diminish the 
                    nicotine in your blood.

                                    FIEDLER
                    Not really.

                                  WILL
                    Then why quit smoking?

                                    FIEDLER
                    Get the wife and kids off my ass.  

      Fiedler heads back to his office.  

      Will walks on.  

      Ahead, he SEES a bow-tie wearing conservative his same age, 
      BOB TEST.  Test is immaculately groomed, arrogant and blue-
      blood calm.  It s not that he s succeeded at everything he s 
      ever tried.  It s that he s succeeded effortlessly. 

      Test waits for Will with a glower in front of offices 
      belonging to VICTORIA LIPMAN (40) and TANYA SOBOTKA (30), 
      colleagues and close friends.

      Victoria is an easy-going soccer mom with a high-end genius 
      IQ, and Tanya, the youngest analyst, with short hair, pierces 
      visible and not, and several statement tattoos.

      Victoria s office is decorated with her kids artwork and 
      family photos.  Tanya s is decorated with cacti, posters of 
      The Damned, Buffalo  66 and James Joyce.


                                  TEST
                    The one and only American movie 
                    Chechen rebels watch before going 
                    into battle. 

                                  WILL
                    Good morning, Bob.

                                  TEST
                    Good morning.  Now cut the shit and 
                    answer.  

                                  WILL 
                    Rocky.

      Test tenses for a second but then breaks into a grin.

                                  TEST
                    So how does it feel, being wrong?  

                                  WILL
                    I wasn t finished.

      Test folds his arms on his chest, bracing...

                                  WILL
                    Rocky III.  Chechens are going to 
                    identify with a persistent 
                    underdog, Rocky, who defeats a 
                    lumbering giant, Mr. T, brought 
                    down by his ego and pride. 

      The exasperated look on Test s face says it all.  Nothing for 
      him to do but change the subject.  

                                  TEST
                          (to Victoria)
                    I need you and Tanya to weigh in on 
                    a few new items.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Namely?

                                  TEST
                      Comparison of public, private and 
                    parochial schools in Ohio.
                          (Victoria rolls her eyes)
                    Subaru wants us to revisit how they 
                    might enter Arab markets while 
                    still maintaining sales in Israel.


      Victoria makes a snoring sound.

                                  TEST
                    And that little something from the 
                    DoD and Navy we ve been expecting.

                                  VICTORIA

                          (Test nods)
                    Is it actually in there?  Softcore 
                    porn on subs slinging hundreds of 
                      nuclear-tipped warheads?

                    Give it a  highly recommend  and 
                    get us some samples.

      Will starts away.  Test keeps pace.

                                  TEST
                    Seen the market since it opened?  
                    Pendry Goss is in free fall.  Rumor 
                    of liquidity problems.  From what I 
                    hear, they have the same business 
                    and cash reserves as yesterday.

                                  WILL
                    Who started the rumor?

                                  TEST
                    Hasn t been nailed down.  

                                  WILL
                    The street would love to see them 
                    eat shit and die.  Could be anyone. 

      Will walks on.

      Victoria follows Test into a

      CONFERENCE ROOM

      where we SEE deep cushioned chairs more akin to Winnebagos 
      than corporations around an octagonal coffee table.

      CAMERA ducks back out and into

      TANYA S OFFICE

      where she is sipping a mug of espresso and cruising through 
      what we SEE is the New York Post crossword.  

      Quickly, she has only one answer remaining, five down.  


      Tanya bolts out of her office and starts running down the 
      corridor to catch Will.

                                  TANYA
                          (re: crossword)
                    Five down!

      Will SEES her but doesn t slow.  Tanya has to hustle.

                    Clover, among other plants.  If 
                    they re lucky...

                                  TANYA
                    Four-leaf clover.
                          (checks)
                    Wait, I need nineteen letters.

                                  WILL
                    Try the Gaelic.

                                  TANYA
                    Which is?

                                  WILL
                    I have no idea.  The only Gaelic I 
                    know is  Pog mo thoin.   Try Latin.  
                    Marsilea quadrifolia.

      Victory.  Tanya blows Will a kiss.

      Will finally arrives at his office, outside of which waits 
      his research assistant, MAGGIE YOUNG (30).  There is an open, 
      optimistic spirit in her.  For too long, her Achilles Heel 
      has been her willingness and desire to trust people.  This is 
      a part of herself she s determined to change.

                                  MAGGIE
                    So, how are we feeling?

                                  WILL
                    Fine.  And you?

      Maggie narrows her eyes, scrutinizes him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    What day is today, Will?

                                  WILL
                      Wednesday.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Yeah...

                                  WILL
                    April 8th.  

      Beat, Maggie closes her eyes and nods.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    It s my birthday.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Get cracking, we re going to lunch 
                    in four hours.

      In contrast to other offices where employees have practically 
      moved in, Will s has no photos, posters or plants.  Nothing 
      of him.  Just books and periodicals, stacked eight feet high.  


      The route to his desk is through valleys and ravines of books 
      (string theory, Harlequin romances, Biblical analysis, 
      Darwin s Origin of the Species, works of Edward R. Tufte and 
      countless  How-To  guides on everything from installing solar 
      panels to the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga) to a desk 
      where no less than fifty documents are waiting for him.

      Will looks out his window across the street at the parking 
      structure where we SEE a MAN (HADDAS) get out of a maroon 
      Volvo and walk toward the stairs, careful to step over a 
      crack in the pavement.

      ANGLE on Will, a small smile watching this.

      Now Will starts into a book.

      CAMERA takes its time circling the room, then...

      Slowly ANGLE up to the doorway where Maggie is knocking.

      Will doesn t hear her for a beat, then finally looks up.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Let s go.  Up and out, lunch.

      Will looks at his watch.  Four hours have passed.

                                  WILL
                    Maggie, can I have a rain check?

                                  MAGGIE
                    I knew it.

                                  WILL 
                    I still have some pressing work.

      PAN the overgrown surfeit of work demanding his attention, 
      splayed across the entire surface area of the desk.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Rain check then.  
                          (starts to leave, pauses)
                    I m not giving up.  

      A last look back at Will and Maggie is gone.  

      Beat of Will at his desk, too much work to even begin.  So to 
      procrastinate, he takes out the Times crossword and dives in.  
      Ink, of course.


      He flies through it as if he had the answer key.

      When he s two-thirds done...

      CLOSE on his face, a glimmer of surprise.  He finishes it 
      then moves on to the crossword for the Washington Post.  

      He s flying through that, too, when he suddenly stops and 
      sets down his pen.  

      He gets up and leaves his office.

      FOLLOW him down to 

      TANYA S OFFICE

      which is empty since she s at lunch.  He enters and picks 
      through her trash to find the crossword he helped her clinch.

      ANGLE on Will, his mind churning.

      Beat, then he exits Tanya s office. 

      FOLLOW him to the stairwell and down into the stacks of the 

      LIBRARY

      where he beelines to the periodicals, hundreds of current 
      magazines and newspapers from People to Pravda.  

      Will chooses several daily papers.

      QUICK CUTS of him doing the crosswords in the...

      1) Houston Chronicle

      2) Atlanta Journal-Constitution

      3) Los Angeles Times

      4) Boston Globe

      6) Chicago Tribune

      He sets them down side by side.  

      First we notice  MARSILEA QUADRIFOLIA  in all papers with the 
      same clue about the lucky larvae.  

      But then...

      CAMERA REVEALS it s not just one.  

      INSERT SHOT of ten answers:  identical in all the papers.

      ANGLE on Will, incredulous, his mind racing.


      He writes down the ten answers.

      SHOT over his shoulder as he starts to work, drawing out 
      possible connections between the words, piecing together 
      their significance.  

      It s trial and error, we SEE him erase several words, false 
      starts, progress is difficult and incremental.

                                                                            CUT TO:

1212

      Walking head down, shielding his face from the cold wind with 
      his collar, Will approaches his building.  He passes an old 
      Norton in shitty condition parked outside.  


      Will climbs his stoop and is about to enter.  He fumbles in 
      his pocket for the keys.

      When he pulls his hand from his pocket he s holding both his 
      keys and the now-crumpled letter from Haddas.

      Will opens the note.  A KEY slides into his palm.  

      He READS the note:   Drive away.  Don t look back.  It s 
      time.  Daniel 

      Will regards the key then looks down the stoop at the Norton.

      He smiles broadly for the first time in a long time.

      He takes out his cell and dials.  It connects.

                                  WILL
                    Your Norton?  Are you crazy, 
                    Daniel?  No way am I keeping this.

                                  HADDAS (O.S.)
                    You re smiling.  I can hear you 
                    smiling.  You re keeping it, Will.  
                    But I should probably show you a 
                    thing or two.

                    Greenwich tomorrow.  Meet me at the 
                    place.

      ANGLE on Will, eyes on the bike, finally nodding.  


                                  WILL
                    I ll see you there.
                          (beat)
                    Wait, Daniel...

      But Haddas is gone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

1414

      Will pulls up and parks.  He s late and hustles inside but 
      doesn t SEE Daniel Haddas.

      Will sits and catches his breath.

      A WAITER sets down a cup of coffee.  Will stirs in sugar.

      Will looks back at the door when he HEARS someone enter but 
      it s not Daniel.

      The waiter watches a TV where we SEE and faintly HEAR CNN.

                                  CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)

                    focused here at home on the needs 
                    of the underprivileged.  

      The anchor suddenly stops and listens to his earpiece.

                                  CNN ANCHOR  (ON TV)
                    I m being told there are reports of 
                    a train crash just moments ago.

      The waiter turns up the volume.

                                  CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)
                    The New Haven line of the Metro-
                    North...

      CLOSE on Will, head whipping up to the TV in time to SEE 
      FOOTAGE appear on SCREEN:  the crash, hell on earth, flames 
      and billowing plumes of black smoke rising from the wreckage.  

                                  WILL
                    Please, God.

      Will stands and starts to back away.

                                  WILL
                    Please, no...

      Will reaches the door and exits out onto the 

      SIDEWALK 

      where he s swallowed up by a tide of strangers, his face 
      contorted with panic and helplessness.

      OVERHEAD SHOT of Will, running against the current of the 
      crowd.

                                  ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

1515

      A storm has just passed, another one threatens in the 
      distance.  The sky crackles with electricity. 

      A large turnout of mourners has come for the funeral of 
      Daniel Haddas, including Miles, Bob, Tanya and Victoria.  

      This is one of the oldest cemeteries in the state with 
      sloping verdant hills and huge mature tree canopies.  

      We join the service as Kale Ingram is eulogizing Haddas.

      CAMERA locates Will, head down, in the back row of mourners.  
      A shade s come down over his eyes, a buffer to keep at arm s 
      length a reality too painful to process.

                                  INGRAM
                      ...devoted husband to Joan, father 
                    to Anna, Kevin and Natalie, God 
                    rest her soul.  Grandfather to 
                    eleven who all adored him.

      As Ingram speaks, Maggie gazes steadfastly at Will.  

                                  INGRAM
                    Daniel had an ingenious, nimble 
                    mind but what I admired most about 
                    my friend was his loyalty.


      CAMERA locates a small cluster of graves behind Ingram 
      adjacent to Haddas s plot.  A black tarp is covering them for 
      the service.  Half a gravestone, flush with the grass, can be 
      seen beneath the tarp.  

      Will slowly lifts his eyes in Ingram s direction, then 
      regards the hole in the earth where Haddas will be buried.  
      He looks heartbroken, but more than that, he looks angry.

                                  INGRAM
                    We all slept a little better 
                    knowing someone with his integrity 
                    and endurance was in our lives.

      Will releases his stare from the covered graves and Ingram.  
      His eyes meet Maggie s.  She looks away.

                    Daniel was an affirming flame for

1616

      The mourners stream away from the funeral.  Will waits his 
      turn to pay his respects to HADDAS S WIDOW.  

      She is still in shock, just going through the motions.  

      When it s Will s turn and he steps up, she snaps to life, 
      reacting uncensored, reaching out and embracing him.

                                  HADDAS S WIDOW
                    Will...

      She cries into him and squeezes him.

                                  WILL
                    I know.

      She doesn t ease her grip.

                                  WILL
                    I know.

      Will is patient and strong for her. 

                                  WILL
                    I ll make sure all of his things 
                    get to you safely.

      Haddas s widow regards Will with even more sympathy than he 
      has in his eyes for her.  She reluctantly lets go and 
      composes herself with as deep a breath as she can manage.

      Will moves away from her.  

      Maggie, who has kept her distance to this point, joins him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m so sorry, Will.  

                                  WILL
                    So am I.

      They SEE Ingram approaching with his conservative, prim WIFE.  
      Ingram steps away from her to talk to Will.

                    I ll catch up.

      Maggie walks off.

                                  INGRAM
                    We have something pressing to 
                    discuss, Will.  Daniel s position 
                    is too integral to leave open, even 
                    for the week or month good decorum 
                    would demand. 

      Ingram glances at Maggie, taking her time sauntering away and 
      frequently looking back at them with curiosity.  When she 
      SEES Ingram s noticed her, she picks up her pace.

                                  INGRAM
                    I know the full scope of your

                    off this conversation, I can t.  
                    Those I answer to, upstairs and 
                      elsewhere, are eager for 
                      resolution.  

      Ingram regards Will, confirming for a last beat what he s 
      about to proffer.

                                  INGRAM
                    Knowing how closely you worked with

                    breadth of his responsibilities.


      Will looks Ingram in the eye and realizes what s coming.

                    I d like you to step into his

      Will shakes his head.

                                  WILL
                    I d say I m better off staying 
                    where I am, but I don t even 
                    believe that s true anymore.  Might 
                    be best for me to leave.

      Ingram doesn t wait for Will s reply.  He rejoins his wife.

      The sun sets, the city exhales, the orange-red ripples on the 
      river turn gray.

                                                                            CUT TO:

1818

      CLOSE on Will as he enters, dazed and shaken, the razor 
        intelligence in his eyes dulled.  Head down, he starts toward 
      his office.

      Just as he does every day, he passes Miles Fiedler, then Bob 
      Test, Victoria and Tanya but today he doesn t slow to talk.  
      His anguish is too raw, too intense. 

      Will finally gets to his office where Maggie is waiting. 

      She wants to say something to comfort him, she wants to help, 
      but she doesn t have the chance.


      He enters his office and shuts the door behind him.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

2020

      Soaked by a bloated rain, Will pulls up to an address in an 
        eviscerated, abandoned neighborhood.  It s a dilapidated 
      hovel, bars on the windows and a heavy steel door in front.

      Before Will can knock, the inner door swings open and DR. ED 
      BANCROFT, 60, triple Ph.D., stands in a stained undershirt, 
      boxer shorts and robe, holding an oversized bowl of cereal.

      Ed doesn t respond.  Instead, he takes a big bite and chews.

                                  WILL
                    Are you Ed Bancroft?

      From his disheveled appearance, the lucidity and conviction 
      in his voice are startling.  

                                  ED
                    What did Daniel tell you about me?

                                  WILL
                    You were among the brightest in a 
                    building full of bright people.  
                    Trusted.  Keys to the kingdom...
                          (beat)
                    Ed, can I come in?

                                  ED
                    Sure.

      But instead of letting Will in, Ed double-bolts the door.

                                  ED
                    Keys to the kingdom.  And then...

                                  WILL 
                    You got confused.  Things 
                      unravelled.

                                  ED
                    Daniel never would ve said that.  
                    Someone else spoke those words.  
                    You believe everything you hear?  
                    Not as advertised.  Not at all.  
                    You were supposed to be sharp. 
                    That s what he told me.  Things 
                    didn t unravel, Will.  I started 
                      comprehending.

                                  WILL
                      Comprehending what?

      He unlocks the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2222

      Will is sprawled out on the couch, an open book on his chest 
      rising and falling with his breath.

      CAMERA arrives at his face, eyes closed, it looks like he s 
      finally sleeping.

      Hold this for a beat, then his eyes flutter open.  He wasn t 
      sleeping, not even close.

      He sits up, the book sliding to the ground.  He drops his 
      head to his chest, runs his hands through his hair.  

      CAMERA closes on his face and we SEE the effects of his 
      worsening insomnia.  

      His skin is pallid, eyes bloodshot and dry, but more than 
      these physical effects, it s his spirit that s fatigued.

      TIME CUT:

      Will sitting at his desk.  The same mountain of material and 
      work waits for his attention but he s staring straight ahead, 
      not even daydreaming, just lost.  

      Beat, then his eyes fall on the book Haddas gave him  BEST 
      ROAD FOOD IN AMERICA 

      Will opens it, flips around and then puts it back down.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...


      Victoria and Tanya appear in his doorway.  We SEE them 
      talking but we HEAR nothing.

      Beat, then they walk away.

      Bob Test comes after them.  We SEE him offer a few platitudes 
      but again HEAR nothing.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...

      Miles Fiedler knocks on the door and starts to talk but again 
      we HEAR nothing.  After a beat, he walks away.

      TIME CUT:

      End of the workday.  Will has not moved.  

      We SEE Maggie in the doorway talking but we don t hear her 
      for a beat.  Finally...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will?

                                  WILL
                          (without looking up)
                      Goodnight, Maggie.

      CLOSE on Maggie, wishing she could say something to comfort 
      him but knowing that s impossible.  Beat, then she forces 
      herself to walk away. 

      TIME CUT:

      Night.

      After twelve hours seated without moving, and still no closer 
      to an answer of how or why this could happen, Will suddenly 
      stands and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2323

      START with a view of a small town, lights twinkling beneath a 
      starless black sky.

      ROTATE to find Will on the 

      PLATFORM

      where we last saw Daniel Haddas alive.

      Will lowers his head and retraces Daniel s steps toward the 
      westbound line, the same steps he took every day, creature of 
      habit that he was.

      Will starts to take a step forward but then keeps his foot 
      aloft when he looks down at the concrete and SEES a crack.

      He walks to the edge of the platform.  No sign of a train in 
      either direction.

      He looks down the platform, clear to the other end, where he 
      SEES a BUSINESSMAN apparently waiting for his train.  The man 
      is looking right back at Will beneath a floodlight.

      Something about this businessman seems familiar.  His 
      exceptionally ordinary face.  Might this be the deliveryman 
      watching Will at the start?  We don t get a long enough look 
      to be sure.

      The businessman takes a step back and is swallowed up by 
      shadows.

      Beat where the silence and stillness become less calming and  
        increasingly unsettling.

      CLOSE on Will, glancing all around him, again in search of 
      some kind of answer and again coming up empty.  At last, he s 
      done trying.  He crosses the platform and heads down a flight 
      of stairs to the gravel

      PARKING LOT

      where he starts toward his motorcycle.

      Something makes him abruptly stop. 

      SHOT of the old, maroon Volvo sedan we saw in the parking lot 
      across from the American Policy Institute.  It s in decent 
      shape for its age and astronomically high mileage.  This is 
      Daniel Haddas s car, orphaned here the morning he died.

      Will approaches and bends down to look through the window.  

      SHOT inside the car, not the tidiest interior, filled with 
      documents, CDs and cassettes, a Buddha on the dash, a 
        dreamcatcher hanging from the rearview mirror.


      A small grin creases Will s face.

      He stands up straight again.

      There, at the far end of the parking lot, Will is surprised 
      to SEE the businessman from the platform watching him.

      ANGLE on Will, still more curious than suspicious. 

      Beat, then the businessman gets in a car and pulls out of the 
      parking lot.

      Now Will looks back down at Haddas s Volvo and SEES the 
      driver s door is unlocked.

      He opens it and leans inside.

      Will SEES a photo pinned to the sun visor by a garage opener. 

      He slides the photo out.

      Will holds it up and regards it. 

      We glimpse the picture only for a split second, just long 
      enough to know that it is a Haddas family portrait with 
      Daniel in the middle.  

                                  WILL
                    Hi, Daniel.

      Will pockets the photo, shuts the door and starts away.

      CLOSE on him as he walks toward his bike.  

      Next to Will, we SEE ascending parking space numbers painted 
      on the concrete wall.

      We SEE:  16 (occupied), 17 (occupied), 18 (empty), 19 
      (occupied), 20 (empty), 21 (empty)...

      ANGLE on Will, eyes flaring wide.

      He faces the concrete wall, then turns and starts back toward 
      Haddas s car. 

      His steps quicken.  He breaks into a run.

      We SEE the descending parking space numbers:  21, 20, 19, 18, 
      17, 16...15...14...


      PULL BACK and reveal Will is standing at space 13...where 
      Daniel Haddas s car is parked.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2525

      Will sits down on Maggie s stoop.

      He stuffs a hand into a pocket and draws out Haddas s 
      birthday note and reads:   Drive away.  Don t look back.  
      It s time.  Daniel 

      Beat, then Will puts it away and gets on his motorcycle.  

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

      FADE IN:

2626

      The sun is rising fast, sending newborn shadows creeping up 
      the sides of skyscrapers and drawn over faces in the street.  
      A light unrivaled in its boundless possibilities.


                                                                            CUT TO:

2828

      Life is returning to a semblance of normal for the Rumohr 
      family.  The KIDS, other FAMILY MEMBERS and several FRIENDS 
      are out playing in the sun, collecting shells and sea-worn 
      glass.  A spread of fine food and wine is laid out.  The 
      period of mourning seems to be coming to a close.  

      But there is no sign of the widow.

      CAMERA angles up to the window Hugh Rumohr stood in before 
      killing himself.

      CLOSE on that window, which is open, and ENTER into the 

      MASTER BEDROOM 

      where we find Katherine on her bed taking her time looking 
      through scrapbooks and drinking a cup of tea.

      CLOSE on her, the ache of each photo like spreading salt in 
      her wound.

      The door opens just a crack.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Who s that?

      Nothing.  Then the door moves again.  


      Charlie Rumohr appears and stands in place.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Hi, there.  Are you having fun?
                          (Charlie nods)
                    Can I get you anything?

                                    KATHERINE(CONT'D)

                          (Charlie shakes his head)
                    Can I have a kiss?

      He nods and comes over to her.  She leans down and kisses him 
      on both cheeks.  He kisses her back.

                                  KATHERINE
                    That is the sweetest kiss in the 
                    world, did you know that?

      He nods and starts to walk away but then turns back.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Oh... 

      Katherine still has a smile on her face when Charlie digs a 
      hand into his pocket and pulls something out.  We don t see 
      what it is.

      He extends his hand to hers.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Poppie said to give you this.

      Katherine plays along and offers her hand.


      Charlie s hand covers hers.  

      STOP MOTION as he pulls it away and we REVEAL a small, 
      engraved note card in a sealed envelope.  It is from Hugh and 
      Katherine Rumohr s stationary.  

      Katherine knits her brow just the smallest bit and opens the 
      envelope.

      She pulls out the folded note card and opens it to find...the 
      brittle, dried up four-leaf clover.

      ANGLE on Katherine, gasping, her heart skipping a beat.  

      She manages to smile for Charlie.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Thank you, sweetheart.

      Charlie runs out of the room.

      Katherine regards the clover in her palm.  She gets up and 
      walks over to the fire.  

      She drops the clover in the flames.
