ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
frozen lake. They SING.
"The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"
ICE HARVESTERS
BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,
THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
SPLIT THE ICE APART!
AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!
A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!
Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.
A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
fight it back.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!
Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING
The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
block of ice out of the water.
ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.
SPLIT THE ICE APART!
BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.
The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
pulls away.
Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
dinky little sled then head off.
We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
snowline...and descend upon...
A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.
Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
trail of ice behind them.
A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
girls, leaving the wake of ice.
KRISTOFF
Ice?
SLAM CUT TO:

FROZEN - J. Lee
Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.
YOUNG KRISTOFF
Faster, Sven!
Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
hide behind a rock and peek out.
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
the still unconscious Anna.
KING
Please, help. My daughter!
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!
But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
unfold, revealing bright faces.
YOUNG KRISTOFF
Trolls...?
The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.
BULDA
Shush. I'm trying to listen.
She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.
BULDA (CONT'D)
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.
Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
determined. He nods respectfully to the king.
GRAND PABBIE
Your Majesty.
(referring to Elsa)
Born with the powers or cursed?
KING
Born. And they're getting stronger.
Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She
does. He examines her.

FROZEN - J. Lee
GRAND PABBIE
(about Anna)
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
The heart is not so easily changed,
but the head can be persuaded.
KING
Do what you must.
GRAND PABBIE
I recommend we remove all magic,
even memories of magic to be
safe.... But don't worry, I'll
leave the fun.
Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
her head.
GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
She will be okay.
YOUNG ELSA
But she won't remember I have
powers?
KING
It's for the best.
PABBIE
Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
only grow.
As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.
PABBIE (CONT'D)
There is beauty in your magic....
But also great danger.
The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.
PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
You must learn to control it.
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
figures to panic and attack Elsa.
PABBIE (CONT'D)
Fear will be your enemy.

FROZEN - J. Lee
Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King
wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.
KING
No. We'll protect her. She can
learn to control it. I'm sure.

Until then, we'll lock the gates.
We'll reduce the staff. We will
limit her contact with people and
keep her powers hidden from
everyone... including Anna.
-The castle shutters close.
-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.
-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new
room. Anna watches, confused and sad.
DISSOLVE TO:

people, beside burial stones.
A new dawn rises over the fjords.
Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.
DOCK MASTER
Welcome to Arendelle!
A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
his bunad jacket.
BOY
Why do I have to wear this?
MOTHER
Because the Queen has come of age.
It's Coronation Day!
BOY
That's not my fault.
They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
nuzzles Kristoff's chest.
KRISTOFF
What do you want, Sven?
Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
Give me a snack.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
What's the magic word?
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
Please!
Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Hey, hey, hey! Share!
Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.
We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
rush towards the castle.
13
FROZEN - J. Lee
PERSI
I can't believe they're finally
opening up the gates!
AGGIE
And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!
They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
behind him.
DUKE
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
trade partner. Open those gates so
I may unlock your secrets and
exploit your riches.
(catching himself)
...Did I just say that out loud?
We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.
IRISHMAN
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
the Queen and the Princess. I bet
they're absolutely lovely.
SPANISH DIGNITARY
I bet they are beautiful.
We move past them, to a particular castle window.
CUT TO:
Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.
She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle
and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.
"For the First Time in Forever"
ANNA
THE WINDOW IS OPEN!
SO'S THAT DOOR!
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.
WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?
-Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.
ANNA (CONT'D)
FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS
WHY HAVE A BALLROOM WITH NO BALLS?
FINALLY, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE GATES!
-She shakes hands with a suit of armor. Breaks it. Hides the
evidence.

FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA (CONT'D)
THERE'LL BE REAL, ACTUAL PEOPLE -
IT'LL BE TOTALLY STRANGE.
BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!
-Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's
pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.
ANNA (CONT'D)
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THERE'LL BE LIGHT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT.
-Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.
ANNA (CONT'D)
DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,
BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE
'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
I WON'T BE ALONE.
(speaking)
I can't wait to meet everyone....
(GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?
-Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She
acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.
ANNA (CONT'D)
TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.
-She notices the bust of a man across the room.
ANNA (CONT'D)
(google-eyed)
I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,
A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR.
(mouth full of chocolate)
I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY
FACE!
-She grabs the bust of the man and swings it around.
ANNA (CONT'D)
BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,
WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.
The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

furniture, and interacts with the paintings.

ANNA (CONT'D)
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE!
Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.
ANNA
Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.
They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.
ANNA(CONT'D)
Okay wait, wait. So you have how
many brothers?
HANS
Twelve older brothers. Three of
them pretended I was invisible...
literally...for two years.
ANNA
That's horrible.
HANS
It's what brothers do.
ANNA
...And sisters. Elsa and I were
really close when we were little.
But then, one day she just shut me
out, and I never knew why.
He takes her hand. Leans in close.
HANS
I would never shut you out.
ANNA
Okay, can I just say something
crazy?
HANS
I love crazy.
"Love is an Open Door"

ANNA
I SEE YOUR FACE.
BOTH
AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER

They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door.
They come out on top of one of the castle's towers.
BOTH (CONT'D)
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
Cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks.
BOTH (CONT'D)
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR

FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S-
ANNA
SANDWICHES!

They slide down the back of the roof out of sight.
We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.
ANNA
I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE-
BOTH
WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME.
BOTH (SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
Jinx.. . .jinx again.
Are they doing the robot? No. They're imitating the

HANS

Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing
shadows across the sails of ships in the docks.
ANNA

HANS
SAY GOODBYE-

FROZEN - J. Lee

They play hide and seek amongst the stable doors.
BOTH (CONT'D)
DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom.
Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his
hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart.

LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE-

FROZEN - J. Lee
Elsa bursts out of the castle door. The CITIZENS CHEER!
CROWD
There she is. Your Majesty! Long
live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come
drink with us.
Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand.
BOWING TOWNSMAN
Queen Elsa.
TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY
Your Majesty? Are you all right?
Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,
grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.
GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.
The Duke and thugs come out the door.
DUKE
There she is! Stop her!
ELSA
(to the Duke)
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away!
Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the
staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.
DUKE
Monster.... Monster!
33
FROZEN - J. Lee
The crowd panics.
A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.
Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.
ANNA
Elsa!
Hans follows closely behind her.
GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to
the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.
Anna calls to her from the gates.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Elsa! Wait, please!
Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Elsa, stop!
Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.
HANS
Anna!
Hans rushes to Anna's side.
Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just
scrambles into the mountains.
ANNA
No.
HANS
(shocked)
Look.... The fjord.
The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking
the ships in place.
Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest
peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches
her breath and sings...
"Let It Go"
ELSA
THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,
NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.
A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION
AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.
THE WIND IS HOWLING
LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.
COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,
HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .
DON'T LET THEM IN,
DON'T LET THEM SEE,
BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
BE.
CONCEAL,
DON'T FEEL,
DON'T LET THEM KNOW.
WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.
Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.
ELSA (CONT'D)
LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.
Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna
when they were children.
ELSA (CONT'D)
LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
SAY.
LET THE STORM RAGE ON.
THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.
Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.
37
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA (CONT'D)
IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.
AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.
IT'S TIME TO SEE
WHAT I CAN DO,
TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.
NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,
NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!
Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.
ELSA (CONT'D)
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.
HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.
Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.
ELSA (CONT'D)
LET THE STORM RAGE ON....
In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on
ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier,
and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.
ELSA (CONT'D)
MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR
INTO THE GROUND.
MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN
FRACTALS ALL AROUND.
AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE
AN ICY BLAST-
Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her
crown and throws it.
ELSA (CONT'D)
I'M NEVER GOING BACK,
(back to resolve)
THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!
She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.
ELSA (CONT'D)
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into
the light. She's free.
38
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA (CONT'D)
THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE.
HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!
THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.
She turns and slams her ice palace door on us.
CUT TO:
Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow. She shivers.
ANNA
(shivering)
Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your
sister who didn't mean to make you
freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's
all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER: Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area.
ANNA (CONT'D)
(hearing a wolf howl)
Of course, none of this would have
happened if she'd just told me her
secret...ha...she's a stinker.
A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna
goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.
Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.
No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.
He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning
conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath,
reaching the top of a hill.

FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Snow, it had to be snow, she
couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical
magic that covered the f-f-fjords
in white sand and warm --
She sees smoke rising up in the distance.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Fire! WHOA!
Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in
an icy stream at the bottom.
ANNA (CONT'D)
(from inside the snowball)
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...
Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She
shakes the snow off a sign and reads:
ANNA
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.
Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Ooh! And Sauna...
Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.
KRISTOFF
Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!
Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.
OAKEN
Bye bye.
Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,
canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.
KRISTOFF
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees
something. He points to a dilapidated barn.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
But I did find us a place to sleep.
And it's free.
Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,
which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits
beside him.
45
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
(trying to scare Anna)
Hang on! We like to go fast!
ANNA
(fearless)
I like fast!
Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.
KRISTOFF
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.
He pushes her feet down.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?
Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back
and hits Anna in the face.
ANNA
(grossed out)
Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.
She wipes off her face.
KRISTOFF
So tell me, what made the Queen go
all ice-crazy?
ANNA
...Oh well, it was all my fault. I
got engaged but then she freaked
out because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day. And she said
she wouldn't bless the marriage--
KRISTOFF
Wait. You got engaged to someone
you just met?
ANNA
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she
got mad and then she tried to walk
away, and I grabbed her glove--
KRISTOFF
Hang on. You mean to tell me you
got engaged to someone you just
met?!
46
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing
is she wore the gloves all the
time, so I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.
KRISTOFF
Didn't your parents ever warn you
about strangers?
Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.
ANNA
Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a
stranger.
KRISTOFF
Oh yeah? What's his last name?
ANNA
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
KRISTOFF
What's his favorite food?
ANNA
...Sandwiches.
KRISTOFF
Best friend's name?
ANNA
Probably John.
KRISTOFF
Eye color.
ANNA
Dreamy.
KRISTOFF
Foot size...?
ANNA
Foot size doesn't matter.
KRISTOFF
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?
What if you hate the way he picks
his nose?
ANNA
Picks his nose?
47
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
And eats it.
ANNA
Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.
KRISTOFF
All men do it.
ANNA
Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's
true love.
KRISTOFF
Doesn't sound like true love.
ANNA
Are you some sort of love expert?
KRISTOFF
No. But I have friends who are.
ANNA
You have friends who are love
experts.... I'm not buying it.
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
KRISTOFF
(to Anna)
Stop talking.
ANNA
No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--
Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.
KRISTOFF
I mean it. SHHH.
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
light reflects off...EYES. Several.
KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
Sven, go. Go!
Sven takes off.
ANNA
What are they?
KRISTOFF
Wolves.
48
FROZEN - J. Lee
Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.
ANNA
Wolves. What do we do?
KRISTOFF
I've got this. You just...don't
fall off and don't get eaten.
ANNA
But I wanna help.
KRISTOFF
No.
ANNA
Why not?
KRISTOFF
Because I don't trust your
judgement.
ANNA
Excuse me?!
A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.
KRISTOFF
Who marries a man she just met?
Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.
ANNA
It's true love!
He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
wolf away.
KRISTOFF
(shocked)
Whoa.
Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.
ANNA
Christopher!
Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.
KRISTOFF
It's Kristoff!
49
FROZEN - J. Lee
A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
AH!
Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.
ANNA
Duck!
Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.
KRISTOFF
You almost set me on fire!
Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.
ANNA
But I didn't.
Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Get ready to jump, Sven!
KRISTOFF
You don't tell him what to do!
Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
I do!
Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
from the sled.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Jump, Sven!
Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.
Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.
Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.
Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.
He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
and burst into flames.
50
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(shocked sadness)
...But I just paid it off.
Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Uh-oh. No, no, no.
To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
AH! NO, NO, NO!
The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.
ANNA (O.S.)
Grab on!
Kristoff grabs on.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Pull, Sven! Pull!
REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.
Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
the burning sled.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and
everything in it.
Kristoff groans.
ANNA (CONT'D)
And I understand if you don't want
to help me anymore.
Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.
KRISTOFF
Of course I don't want to help her
anymore. In fact, this whole thing
has ruined me for helping anyone
ever again.
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
But she'll die on her own.
KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
I can live with that.
51
FROZEN - J. Lee
Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong
way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
But you won't get your new sled if
she's dead.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(knowing he's got a point)
...You know sometimes I really
don't like you.
Sven licks Kristoff happily.
KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
(to Anna)
Hold up. We're coming?!
ANNA
(excited)
You are?!
(catching herself)
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag
along.
DISSOLVE TO:
Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain.
DISSOLVE TO:
As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of
something far below.
ANNA
Arendelle.
KRISTOFF
It's completely frozen.
ANNA
...But it'll be fine. Elsa will
thaw it.
KRISTOFF
Will she?
52
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
(uncertain)
...Yeah. Now come on. This way to
the North Mountain?
She points straight ahead.
KRISTOFF
More like this way.
He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.
DISSOLVE TO:
A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around
weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and
guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.
CITIZEN ONE
No. No. You've got the bark facing
down. The bark needs to be face-up.
CITIZEN TWO
Bark down is drier.
CITIZEN ONE
Bark up.
CITIZEN TWO
Bark down.
CITIZEN ONE
Bark up.
Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.
HANS
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?
GERDA
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your
Highness.
HANS
The castle is open. There's soup
and hot glgg in the Great Hall.
He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.
HANS (CONT'D)
Here. Pass these out.
Just then the Duke approaches Hans.
DUKE
Prince Hans, are we just expected
to sit here and freeze while you
give away all of Arendelle's
tradable goods?
HANS
(tall and confident)
Princess Anna has given her orders
and--
60
FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE
And that's another thing; has it
dawned on you that your princess
may be conspiring with a wicked
sorceress to destroy us all?
Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.
HANS
Do not question the Princess. She
left me in charge, and I will not
hesitate to protect Arendelle from
treason.
DUKE
(flabbergasted, offended)
Treason?!
Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It
returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.
HANS
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.
CROWD
(various)
Princess Anna's horse. What
happened to her? Where is she?
Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees
all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.
HANS
...Princess Anna is in trouble.
(calling out)
I need volunteers to go with me to
find her!
Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush
up to offer their services.
DUKE
I volunteer two men, my Lord!
(quietly to his thugs)
Be prepared for anything, and
should you encounter the Queen, you
are to put an end to this winter.
Do you understand?
His two thugs sneer.
CUT TO:
61
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain.
Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.
KRISTOFF
So how exactly are you planning to
stop this weather?
ANNA
(confident)
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.
KRISTOFF
That's your plan? My ice business
is riding on you talking to your
sister.
ANNA
Yup.
Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where
he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He
stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.
KRISTOFF
So you're not at all afraid of her?
ANNA
Why would I be?
OLAF
(oblivious)
Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.
Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Oh, look at that. I've been
impaled.
He laughs it off.
DISSOLVE TO:
Anna and Kristoff hit what looks like a dead end. The face of
the mountain goes straight up.
ANNA
What now?
62
FROZEN - J. Lee
Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack.
KRISTOFF
...It's too steep. I've only got
one rope, and you don't know how to
climb mountains.
ANNA (O.S.)
Says who?
Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to
climb the cliff's flat face.
KRISTOFF
(finding her ridiculous)
What are you doing?
ANNA
(straining)
...I'm going to see my sister.
KRISTOFF
You're going to kill yourself.
Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
I wouldn't put my foot there.
ANNA (O.S.)
You're distracting me.
KRISTOFF
Or there. How do you know Elsa even
wants to see you?
ANNA (O.S.)
I'm just blocking you out cause I
gotta concentrate here.
KRISTOFF
You know, most people who disappear
into the mountains want to be
alone.
ANNA (O.S.)
Nobody wants to be alone. Except
maybe you--
KRISTOFF
I'm not alone.... I have friends,
remember?
Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.
63
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
You mean the love experts?
KRISTOFF
Yes, the love experts!
Anna realizes she's stuck.
ANNA
...Please tell me I'm almost there.
REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.
ANNA (CONT'D)
...Does the air seem a bit thin to
you up here?
Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.
KRISTOFF
Hang on.
He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.
OLAF
Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is
going to solve the problem, but I
found a staircase that leads
exactly where you want it to go.
ANNA
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!
Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust
exercise.
She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.
Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.
Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.
ANNA
Whoa.
KRISTOFF
(in awe)
Now that's ice. I might cry.
64
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Go ahead. I won't judge.
Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His
hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.
Kristoff runs to his aide.
KRISTOFF
All right, take it easy. I gotcha.
Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
You stay right here, buddy.
Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his
tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
...Flawless.
Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.
OLAF
...Knock....
(she doesn't)
Just knock....
(she doesn't. To Kristoff)
Why isn't she knocking...? Do you
think she knows how to knock?
Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors
slide open.
ANNA
Ha. It opened. That's a first.
Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,
stops him.
ANNA (CONT'D)
You should probably wait out here.
KRISTOFF
What?
ANNA
Last time I introduced her to a
guy, she froze everything.
KRISTOFF
But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice
is my life.
65
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF
Bye, Sven.
Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.
ANNA
You too, Olaf.
OLAF
Me?
ANNA
Just give us a minute.
OLAF
Okay.
As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.
OLAF (CONT'D)
One...two...
Kristoff joins in.
OLAF AND KRISTOFF
Three...four...
Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.
ANNA
Stop. Put us down!
OLAF
(to Marshmallow)
You are a lot stronger than I think
you realize.
Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
72
FROZEN - J. Lee
MARSHMALLOW
(like a bouncer)
Go away!
Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck
to the ice railing.
OLAF (O.S.)
Heads up!
Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.
ANNA
Olaf!
OLAF
Watch out for my butt!
Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
snowbank.
Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.
Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.
ANNA
It is not nice to throw people!
Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.
KRISTOFF
ANNA
All right feisty pants. Calm
Let me at him. I want to get
down. Woaw. Just let the snow
him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.
man be.
Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
throws it at Marshmallow.
The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.
KRISTOFF
Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
OLAF
...I'll distract him. You guys go.
Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.
OLAF (CONT'D)
No, no, not you guys.
73
FROZEN - J. Lee
Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's
head falls and lands face down in snow.
OLAF (CONT'D)
(muffled)
This just got a whole lot harder.
Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
right behind them.
They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.
KRISTOFF
This way!
Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(impressed)
Ho-ho-ho!
ANNA
I got him!
Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.
KRISTOFF
Whoa, stop!
ANNA
It's a hundred foot drop.
KRISTOFF
It's two hundred.
Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.
ANNA
Ow.
He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
snow with a pick axe.
ANNA (CONT'D)
What's that for?
KRISTOFF
I'm digging a snow anchor.
74
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
(not trusting)
Okay. What if we fall?
KRISTOFF
There's twenty feet of fresh powder
down there; it'll be like landing
on a pillow.... Hopefully.
They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Okay, Anna. On three.
Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.
ANNA
Okay. You tell me when...
KRISTOFF
One...
ANNA
...I'm ready to go....
KRISTOFF
Two...
ANNA
(pumped up)
...I was BORN ready! Yes!
KRISTOFF
Calm down.
A huge tree flies through the air toward them.
ANNA (O.S.)
TREE!
Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
their fall.
KRISTOFF
Whoa! That happened.
Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete
mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs
and puffs, struggling to run.
OLAF
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
75
FROZEN - J. Lee
He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.
OLAF (CONT'D)
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!
Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost
Marshmallow back there!
Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.
OLAF (CONT'D)
(happily)
Hey. We were just talking about
you. All good things, all good
things.
Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.
OLAF (CONT'D)
NO!
Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not
making much of a difference.
OLAF (CONT'D)
This is not making much of a
difference!
Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.
OLAF (CONT'D)
WHOA!
Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.
ANNA
Olaf!
OLAF
Hang in there, guys!
Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.
ANNA
Wait, what?
Kristoff's head hits the cliff.
KRISTOFF
Aargghh!
Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.
ANNA
Kristoff!
76
FROZEN - J. Lee
Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all
over them.
MARSHMALLOW
Don't come back!
ANNA
(grossed out by his snow
breath)
Ugh. We won't.
Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to
just as they fall. They both SCREAM!
SLAM!
REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Hey, you were right. Just like a
pillow.
She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's
boots, which are sticking out of the snow.
OLAF
(shaking the boots)
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel
my legs!
Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.
KRISTOFF
Those are my legs.
Olaf's bottom goes running by.
OLAF
(to Kristoff)
Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
butt.
Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Oh, that feels better.
Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Hey, Sven!
77
FROZEN - J. Lee
Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off
his nose -- and misses.
OLAF (CONT'D)
He found us.
(to Sven, funny voice)
Who's my cute little reindeer?
KRISTOFF
Don't talk to him like that.
Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Here.
He lifts her out easily.
ANNA
(impressed)
Whoa!
KRISTOFF
You okay?
ANNA
Thank you.
They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?
ANNA (CONT'D)
...Um.... How's your head?
She touches the spot where he banged his head.
KRISTOFF
(in pain)
Ah! Ooh!
He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.
Ha. I've got a thick skull.
OLAF
I don't have a skull.... Or bones.
KRISTOFF
...So....
The awkwardness is killing him.
78
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(shy)
Now what?
ANNA
(shy)
Now what?
(then...panicking)
Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?
She threw me out. I can't go back
to Arendelle with the weather like
this. And then there's your ice
business--
KRISTOFF
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice
business...
(noticing something)
Worry about your hair?!
She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.
ANNA
What? I just fell off a cliff. You
should see your hair.
KRISTOFF
No, yours is turning white.
She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.
ANNA
White? It's what?
KRISTOFF
It's because she struck you; isn't
it?
ANNA
Does it look bad?
KRISTOFF
(thinking)
...No.
Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to
join the conversation.
OLAF
You hesitated.
KRISTOFF
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.
Now, come on.
79
FROZEN - J. Lee
He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.
OLAF
Okay! Where are we going?
KRISTOFF
To see my friends.
ANNA
(catching up)
The love experts?
OLAF
Love experts?!
KRISTOFF
Yes. And don't worry; they'll be
able to fix this.
ANNA
How do you know?
He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls
heal her as a child.
KRISTOFF
...Because I've seen them do it
before.
As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.
OLAF
I like to consider myself a love
expert.
CUT TO:
The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as
he rides on Sven's back.
OLAF
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.
Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.
KRISTOFF
Are you cold?
ANNA
...A little.
He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides
against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,
then gets a thought.
KRISTOFF
Wait. Come here.
He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
lined pass.
Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.
He holds her hands over one of them.
ANNA
Oooh.... That's nice.
They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.
KRISTOFF
(taking a deep breath)
So, about my friends...well, I say
friends, they're more like
family.... Anyway, when I was a
kid, it was just me and
Sven...until they took me in.
ANNA
(moved)
They did?
KRISTOFF
(nervous ramble)
Yeah. I don't want to scare you,
they can be a little bit
inappropriate...and loud...very
loud...they're also stubborn at
times, and a little overbearing.
And heavy. Really, really heavy.

81
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
But they're fine.. You'll get it.
They mean well.
Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.
ANNA
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.
KRISTOFF
Okay then....
Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave
of the arms announces--
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Meet my family.
REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(to the rocks)
Hey, guys!
As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and
greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.
ANNA
(to herself)
...They're rocks.
OLAF
(realizing)
He's crazy.
(covertly, to Anna)
I'll distract them while you run.
(Loud and slow to a rock)
Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to
meet you!
(quietly to Anna)
Anna, because I love you, I insist
you run.
(to the rock)
I understand you're love experts!
(to Anna)
Why aren't you running?
Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.
ANNA
Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--
Just then the rocks around her start rolling.
82
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA (CONT'D)
(panicking)
Kristoff!
Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff
and unfold as trolls.
BULDA
KRISTOFF'S HOME!
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's
been too long! Kristoff's home!
Olaf jumps around all excitedly.
OLAF
(excitedly)
Kristoff's home.
He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Wait? Kristoff?
Anna watches, shocked and confused.
The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him
down with a boulder's strength.
TROLL ONE
Oh, lemme look at you!
Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.
TROLL TWO
Oh, take off your clothes,
Kristoff; I wash them.
KRISTOFF
(holding up his pants)
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes
on, thank you.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Great to see you all. Where's
grandpa?
MUSHROOM KID TROLL
He's napping. But look, I grew a
mushroom.
TROLL SCOUT KID
And I earned my fire crystal.
83
FROZEN - J. Lee
KIDNEY STONE TROLL
I passed a kidney stone.
PICK ME UP TROLL
Pick me up.
The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks
under the weight of him.
Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...
ANNA
Trolls? They're trolls.
Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.
BULDA
...He's brought a girl!
TROLLS (TOGETHER)
He's brought a girl!
Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll
Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.
ANNA
What's going on?
KRISTOFF
I've learned to just roll with it.
Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look
at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.
BULDA
Let me see. Bright eyes. Working
nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.
She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.
ANNA
Wait. Oh. Um. No.
KRISTOFF
You've got the wrong idea. That's
not why I brought her here.
ANNA
Right. We're not. I'm not--
Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.
84
FROZEN - J. Lee
BULDA
(to Anna)
What's the issue, dear? Why are you
holding back from such a man?
Bulda SINGS.
"Fixer-Upper"
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
IS IT THE CLUMPY WAY HE WALKS?
OR THE GRUMPY WAY HE TALKS?
OR THE PEAR-SHAPED, SQUARE-SHAPED
WEIRDNESS OF HIS FEET?
AND THOUGH WE KNOW HE WASHES WELL
HE ALWAYS ENDS UP SORTA SMELLY.
BUT YOU'LL NEVER MEET A FELLA WHO'S
AS SENSITIVE AND SWEET.
TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)
SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS-
HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR.
HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER
THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S
LAWS.
SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF-
YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE.
KRISTOFF
Can we just stop talking about
this?! We've got a real, actual
problem here.
BULDA
I'll say--
(To Anna)
IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED?
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED?
KID TROLL
OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN
THE WOODS?
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS
DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS?
OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S
THE HONEST GOODS?
85
FROZEN - J. Lee
TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)
HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER-
HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS.
KRISTOFF
No, I don't.
TROLLS
HIS ISOLATION
IS CONFIRMATION
OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING
HUGS.
SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER
IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU.
The girl trolls sweep Anna away. The boys take Kristoff.
KRISTOFF
(to the male trolls)
Enough! She's engaged to someone
else. Okay?!
TROLLS beat. Blink. Blink. The boy trolls turn, huddle...
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
THAT'S A MINOR THING.
THIS QUOTE "ENGAGEMENT"
IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT.
KID TROLL
AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO
RING.
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT.
GET THE FIANCE
OUT OF THE WAY
AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED!
GIRL TROLLS
WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM
TROLLS (VARIOUS)
'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE.
WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A
FORCE
THAT'S POWERFUL AND STRANGE.
PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES
IF THEY'RE MAD OR SCARED OR

86
FROZEN - J. Lee
TROLLS (VARIOUS) (CONT'D)
BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY
(THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY)
AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST!
TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST!
Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly
beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.
ALL TROLLS
EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER
WE NEED EACH OTHER
TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT
By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit
by the sheer force of numbers.
TROLLS
EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE-
THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN
FIX A FIXER UPPER IS
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
LOVE
During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each
other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right?
Sparks! Chemistry!
TROLL PRIEST
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be
your trollfully wedded--
ANNA
Wait, what?!
TROLL PRIEST
You're getting married.
TROLLS
LOVE!
Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's
shivering something fierce.
KRISTOFF
Anna?
He pulls off her cape and hat.
87
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
She's as cold as ice.
Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.
Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the
pit.
GRAND PABBIE
There's strange magic here!
KRISTOFF
Grand Pabbie!
GRAND PABBIE
Bring her to me, Kristoff.
Kristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes.
GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
Anna, your life is in danger. There
is ice in your heart, put there by
your sister. If not removed, to
solid ice will you freeze, forever.
ANNA
What...? No.
KRISTOFF
So remove it, Grand Pabbie.
GRAND PABBIE
I can't. If it was her head, that
would be easy. But only an act of
true love can thaw a frozen heart.
ANNA
An act of true love?
BULDA
(googley, to her hubby)
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
A bunch of trolls give each other kisses.
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of
her hair turns white.
KRISTOFF
Anna, we've got to get you back to
Hans.
ANNA
(still weak)
...Hans.
88
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
Help us out, Sven.
Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out.
Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Come on, Olaf!
Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.
OLAF
I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who
is this Hans?!
CUT TO:
ELSA'S PALACE - DAWN
Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle.
HANS
We are here to find Princess Anna.
Be on guard, but no harm is to come
to the Queen. Do you understand?
The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow
rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's
snow guard.
MARSHMALLOW
Go away!
He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of
the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,
who quickly knocks them over.
Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple
over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but
Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,
leaps, and grabs it.
Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.
The Duke's two thugs see her.
DUKE'S THUG
The Queen.
The thugs charge up the stairs.

FROZEN - J. Lee
Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his
back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style.
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff
takes off his hat and puts it on her head.
KRISTOFF
Just hang in there.
(to Sven)
Come on, buddy, faster!
They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them,
out of control.
OLAF
I'll meet you guys at the castle!
92
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
Stay out of sight, Olaf!
OLAF
I will!
He disappears into the village streets.
OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Hello!
TOWNSWOMAN (O.S.)
Ah! It's alive!
CUT TO:
Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching.
GUARD
It's Princess Anna!
Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off,
holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.
KRISTOFF
I've got you.
Anna looks up at him, gratefully.
ANNA
...Are you g-gonna be okay?
KRISTOFF
(touched, reassuring)
Don't worry about me.
Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid
rush to help Anna.
GERDA
Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.
KAI
My Lady. You are freezing.
GERDA
You poor girl, you're freezing.
Let's get you inside.
93
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
Get her warm and find Prince Hans,
immediately.
KAI
We will. Thank you.
Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.
KRISTOFF
Make sure she's safe!
Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him.
Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with
worry at the closed gates.
Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly
follows.
CUT TO:
Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not
wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes
his head. Enough.
He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts
and grunts.
KRISTOFF
What is it, buddy?
Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Hey, watch it. What's wrong with
you?
Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(avoiding)
...I don't understand you when you
talk like that.
99
FROZEN - J. Lee
Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
lift Kristoff off the ground.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!
Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
No, Sven! We're not going back!
Sven shakes his head, angrily.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
She's with her true love.
Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
he's made his point.
Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Anna.
Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
jumps onto his back.
CUT TO:
Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.
Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it
sweeps the window panes away.
OLAF
Slide, Anna.
It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?
They slide down the iced-covered building.
Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers
snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant
snowball.
OLAF (CONT'D)
We made it!
He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.
Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across
the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the
storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight
through.
KRISTOFF
Come on, buddy, faster.
CUT TO:
Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.
ANNA
Kristoff!
The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling
off into the storm.
OLAF
Keep going, Anna!
Anna struggles on.
104
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Kristoff!
PAN TO:
Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven
struggles over the uneven surface.
KRISTOFF
Come on! Come on!
Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes
over them.
They give it all they've got as debris falls all
around them
and the mast shatters. They make it past just as
the entire
ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath
their feet.
The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too
wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing
water and disappears below.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Sven? Sven!
At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy
water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a
floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to
go on.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Good boy.
CUT TO:
Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over
an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running
out of time.
She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the
inevitable is coming.
CUT TO:
Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to
turn. But then he hears a faint--
ANNA (O.S.)
Kristoff.
KRISTOFF
Anna...? Anna!
WHITE OUT TO:
105
FROZEN - J. Lee
Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is
consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.
HANS
Elsa. You can't run from this!
Elsa backs away from him.
ELSA
...Just take care of my sister.
HANS
Your sister? She returned from the
mountain weak and cold. She said
you froze her heart.
ELSA
What? No.
HANS
I tried to save her, but it was too
late. Her skin was ice. Her hair
turned white...
Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.
HANS (CONT'D)
Your sister is dead... because of
you.
Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,
the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,
hangs suspended, trapped in grief.
Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out
to see...
Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the
fjords to...
ANNA
(a whisper)
Kristoff.
KRISTOFF
Anna.
Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards
her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is
giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.
But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from
its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he
raises his sword over his head.
106
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Elsa.
Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him
a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...
Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword
down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.
ANNA (CONT'D)
No!
In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits
her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force
of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.
ELSA
Anna!
Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.
ELSA (CONT'D)
Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.
Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.
OLAF
(confused, sad)
Anna?
Elsa hugs Anna and cries.
Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his
side.
Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.
All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.
But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.
Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.
Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.
ELSA
Wha-? Anna?
Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.
ANNA
Oh, Elsa.
They embrace.
107
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA
...You sacrificed yourself for me?
ANNA
(weak)
...I love you.
Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--
OLAF
An act of true love will thaw a
frozen heart.
ELSA
(processing)
Love...will thaw...
(realizing)
Love.... Of course.
Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.
ANNA
Elsa?
ELSA
Love.
Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.
Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.
The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.
The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.
In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
summer day.
ANNA
I knew you could do it.
OLAF
(melting, good-naturedly)
Hands down, this is the best day of
my life...and quite possibly the
last.
ELSA
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
108
FROZEN - J. Lee
Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.
OLAF
Hey, my own personal flurry.
Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
stops him.
ANNA
Uh. Uh. Uh.
She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.
HANS
(confused)
Anna? But she froze your heart.
ANNA
The only frozen heart around here
is yours.
She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.
HANS
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
He falls overboard.
Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.
DISSOLVE TO:
It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
repaired and are sailing away.
On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.
FRENCH DIGNITARY
(to Kai)
I will return this scoundrel to his
country. We shall see what his
twelve big brothers think of his
behavior.
KAI
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
109
FROZEN - J. Lee
Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
thugs to their ship.
DUKE
This is unacceptable. I am
innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.
(bad acting)
Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a
doctor I could...No? And I demand
to see the Queen!
Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.
KAI
I have a message from the Queen.
(reading a scroll)
Arendelle will henceforth and
forever no longer do business of
any sort with Weaseltown.
DUKE
Weselton. It's Weselton!
The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.
Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.
ANNA
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
She runs him right into a pole.
KRISTOFF
Pole.
ANNA
Oops. Sorry.
Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.
ANNA
(stopping)
Okay. Okay. Here we are.
110
FROZEN - J. Lee
She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
front of it -- Vanna White-style.
ANNA (CONT'D)
I owe you a sled.
KRISTOFF
(blown away)
Are you serious?
ANNA
Yes. And it's the latest model.
KRISTOFF
No. I can't accept this...
ANNA
You have to. No returns. No
exchanges. Queen's orders. She's
named you the official Arendelle
Ice Master and Deliverer.
Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
king of the bucks.
KRISTOFF
What? That's not a thing.
But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.
ANNA
Sure it is. And it even has a cup
holder.... Do you like it?
KRISTOFF
Like it?
He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
I love it.... I could kiss you!
He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
...I could. I mean I'd like to.
I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may
we? Wait, what?
She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.
ANNA
We may.
111
FROZEN - J. Lee
He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.
We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.
With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.
Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.
Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.
CUT TO:
The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
stands Elsa.
ELSA
Are you ready?
Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.
Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
some snow flurries for atmosphere.
Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.
ANNA
I like the open gates.
ELSA
We are never closing them again.
Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
made of ice) form on Anna's boots.
ANNA
What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't ska--
Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
slips and slides, but laughs in delight.
Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.
KRISTOFF
Look out. Reindeer coming through!
112
FROZEN - J. Lee
Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.
OLAF
That's it. Glide and pivot and
glide and pivot.
We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
repaired with a ice.
All is right in Arendelle.
FINAL FADE OUT.
THE END
