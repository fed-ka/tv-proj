                        I swear to God, I saw him!  I saw

                        Johnny, he died 18 years ago. 
                        His car dropped 100 feet into the
                        ocean.

                        They never found his body.

                        That's true.

                                        WALT
                        Let's assume this guy is still
                        alive, why do something like that? 
                        Why not just quit?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's a good question, maybe
                        I'll ask Roy when I find him.

                                        SARAH
                        You really think we could?

                        We?  You're not seriously thinking
                        about doing this?

          Off Johnny and Sarah.  The possibility is exciting...

                        'Crystal'.  It seemed personal.

          The morning sun creeps up over the horizon.  The Corvette
          KICKS up dirt.  Johnny sits in the passenger seat as the
          car RACES towards the edge of the cliff!

          Freaked, Johnny looks over - no driver!  There's a

          just as the Corvette does a 'Thelma and Louise' DROP over
          the cliff!



          Johnny and Sarah walk and talk.

          The cold evening becomes a sunny afternoon.  PEOPLE fill

                        Are we allowed back here? 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        It's cool.  Just stay with me.

          Nathan rushes up. 

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        You're late!

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I'm here now.  Nathan, this is... 

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        Do you know how much money it
                        costs to pay security overtime?    

          Stephen rushes past, bass guitar in hand. 

                                        YOUNGER VICKINGS
                        Come on, man!  Crowd's goin' crazy!    

          Roy pulls Aubrey towards the stage entrance, and before
          they go through -  Roy wraps a TURQUOISE BRACELET around
          her wrist.

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I don't even know your name?

                                        AUBREY
                        Aubrey. 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        No, that won't do... Crystal.

                                        AUBREY
                        What? 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Anybody with eyes like those has
                        to be named - Crystal.  Wait here. 
                        And don't talk to that guy over
                          there... he's the Devil.

          Roy gestures towards Nathan, who just scowls.  Roy walks
          out ON-STAGE grabs his Fender as the crowd reacts.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT TWO - 2/16/05 - WHT-2  27.



          Johnny snaps out of the vision, back in the junkyard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The girl we've been looking for. 
                        Her real name is Aubrey.

                                        SARAH
                          Aubrey... I know that name...



            Establishing.  A rundown 12 unit motel.  6 up and 6 down. 
          Johnny and Sarah stand in the mostly empty parking lot.

                                        SARAH
                        How are we supposed to know which
                        room they stayed in?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We could go ask Sid and Bonnie.

                                        SARAH
                        We've already got one reporter
                          following us around, how long
                        would it be until everybody knows
                        what we're doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you suggest then?

          Sarah gives Johnny a knowing look...



          Roy and Aubrey rush up the hallway hand in hand towards
          Johnny, they stop outside ROOM 3.

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Maybe someday we can unlock the
                        door to our own little house?   

                                        AUBREY
                        Roy Foldes, are you asking me to
                        marry you? 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Only if you promise not to tell
                          anybody.  A happily married rock
                        star is bad for business.

          They kiss.

                                        AUBREY
                        Have you told anybody?

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                          Stephen.

                                        AUBREY
                        And Nathan?

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        That's going to be a little bit
                        harder. 

                                        AUBREY
                        Are you sure you want to give up
                        the life of a rock 'n' roll star?

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Can I get back to you on that?

          He picks her up, kicks the door open and carries her
          inside.



          Johnny and Sarah walk up to the velvet ropes - a sign
          says, SHOW CANCELED.  The MANAGER unhooks the ropes.

                                        SARAH
                        Show's been canceled?

                                        MANAGER
                        That's what the sign says.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?

                                        MANAGER
                        Jack Daniel's, Johnny Walker,

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was drunk?

                                        MANAGER
                        Looked like he'd been up all night.

                                        SARAH
                        In a way.

                                        MANAGER
                        Well, if you see him, tell him
                        he's not getting paid.  And give
                        him back this -

          The Manager SHOVES Darren's EMPTY GUITAR CASE into Johnny's
          chest:



          The Corvette KICKS up dirt!  Johnny's behind the wheel,
          driving towards the edge, swigging a bottle of bourbon. 
          The car does a massive DROP into the ocean.  The Fender
          Strat GUITAR is in the passenger seat...



          Johnny comes out of the vision, confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was in Roy's Corvette again, as
                        it was going over the cliff. 
                        Only it was different this time. 
                        I was driving and Roy's guitar
                        was in the passenger seat.

          Sarah thinks for a moment, something's puzzling her.

                                        SARAH
                        Where's Darren playing tomorrow?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know. 

                                        SARAH
                        The box.

          She hurries away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?

          Sarah has the tailgate down as she rummages through her
          open suitcase.  She digs out a mangled shoe box.

                                        SARAH
                        Got it.

          It's been written and drawn all over and is kept together
          with scotch tape and hair ribbons.

                                        SARAH
                        I've had this since I was thirteen. 
                        Everything important to me I put
                        in this box.

          Sarah opens the box and digs through it, setting various
          objects on the gate as she searches.  Maybe some photo
          booth pictures of her and Johnny, etc. 

                                        SARAH
                        It's been gnawing at me ever since
                        we first started on the trip. 
                        Here they are!

          She picks out a bundled wad of multi-colored tickets.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        SARAH
                          Memories.  Every ticket stub,
                        from every concert I ever saw.

          She starts sorting through them, setting the Roy Foldes
          ticket stubs in a separate line.

                                        SARAH
                        We started in Portland.  Then to
                        Philly.

          She lays each stub in order of date and city.

                                        SARAH
                        Then New York.  And finally,
                        Boston.

          The stubs line up perfectly, by date and city, only from
          20 years ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (realizing)
                          Darren's touring the same cities
                        in the exact sequence Roy did
                        before he died.

                                        SARAH
                        It gets even weirder.  Do you
                        know what tomorrow is?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but I have a feeling it's not
                          something good.

                                        SARAH
                        Tomorrow's the anniversary of
                        Roy's death.  Johnny, I don't
                        think your vision was Roy's
                          death... I think it was Darren's.

          Johnny and Sarah RACE through the twisty roads.  Sarah's
          got a map spread out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How much farther?

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe 30 miles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roy's car took a dive just after
                          sunrise.  If Darren's recreating
                        his father's death...

          Johnny notices the sun peaking over the horizon.

                                        SARAH
                        We're never gonna make it.

          Johnny suddenly notices Darren's napkin with his cell
          phone number sticking out of the glove compartment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we don't have to.

                                                                              INTERCUT:



          A cell RINGS.  On a quiet bluff...

          The Corvette idles.  Darren looks out over the ocean. 
          Guitar by his side.  The sun rising.  A peaceful moment,
          except that really annoying cell phone RINGS.  He takes
          another swig of liquid courage, then answers it.

                                        DARREN
                        I'm busy... call back later.

          Darren starts to shut off the phone, but...

                        Darren!  Don't hang up!  It's

                        You have no idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then tell me.  Tell me how it
                        feels?

          Darren takes a big hit off the bottle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren?  You still there?

          Darren lifts the phone to his ear.

                                        DARREN
                        I love the music.  That feeling
                        when you're able to reach out and
                        touch somebody's soul.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That must be a great feeling.

                                        DARREN
                        Except nobody wants me, not the
                        real me.  They want that thing,
                        that part of me that doesn't exist. 
                        They want him.
                                (beat)
                        If that's what they want, that's
                        what they'll get.

                        Darren, if you drive off that
                        cliff, you still won't be your
                        father.  You'll just be a Rock'n
                        roll footnote.  A bad joke somebody
                        makes at a party. 

          Darren swigs his bottle of bourbon.

                                        DARREN
                        That's the problem, bro.  I am a
                        joke.  I always have been.

          Darren hangs up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren?  Dammit!

          Johnny looks at Sarah and shakes his head.

          Darren swigs.  A glance in the rear view shows us he's
          crying.  He cranks up the powerful engine. 

                                        SARAH
                        What did he say?

                        I think we're too late.

          Shaking, Darren CLUTCHES into first.  He takes a deep
          breath, then GUNS the engine, the Corvette KICKS UP dirt
          as he SPINS THE WHEELS, then drives fast towards the edge
          of the cliff!



          WIDE SHOT of the car tearing towards the edge at top speed.

          Darren grips the wheel, his eyes filled with tears.  He
          glances over at the guitar.  It's now or never.



          Johnny's SUV races up to the edge of the bluff.  Johnny
          and Sarah hop out.  They rush to the edge and...

          They can't believe what they're looking at, then...

                                        DARREN (O.S.)
                          Headline reads!

          They SPIN to see Darren sitting against a tree, drunk. 
          Guitar by his side.  Bottle of bourbon nearly gone.  He's
          all dirty and scuffed up.

                                        DARREN
                          "Struggling musician commits
                          suicide, album goes gold and nobody

          Sarah MOVES to him.

                                        SARAH
                        Are you okay?

                                        DARREN
                        I don't know.  I'm drunk.  Which
                        is probably a good thing to be if
                        you're gonna throw yourself out

                        I'm just glad you changed your
                        mind.

                                        DARREN
                        There's one thing I still can't
                        seem to figure out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        DARREN
                        Who ARE you people?

                        Fans.  We're big fans.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like you dropped some fan
                        mail.

          Johnny notices some dirty looking envelopes scattered on
          the ground a few feet away from the kid.  One of them
          just has DARREN, written on it.  Johnny picks it up as is
          thrown into a vision:          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT FOUR - 2/11/05 - GREEN  47.



          Johnny comes out of the vision, pulls Sarah aside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think I know where Roy is.



          It's the same diner from Johnny's vision.  Same neon sign. 
          Johnny's SUV sits in the parking lot.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is the place.  How's our boy
                        doing?

          Sarah glances into the back seat where we SEE Darren passed
          out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Eight hours on the road and he
                        hasn't budged.

                        us.

          Sarah's attention is drawn across the lot.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, my God.

          She realizes what Johnny already knows... this journey
          has been hers and she needs to finish it herself.

          Roy tosses the garbage bags into a dumpster.

                        You look just the way I remember.

          Roy TURNS to REVEAL SARAH.  She stands behind him.

                        You've put on few pounds and you

          Roy takes a second, then HEAVES a few heavy trash bags.

                        It wasn't your fault, you know.

                        She was murdered.  By somebody
                        close to you.

          He can hardly believe what he's hearing, as tears well up

                        dust in the wind.

          Roy walks off.  Sarah is stunned.  Until she blurts out:

                        He nearly killed himself a few
                        hours ago.  I imagine he'll try
                        again unless... unless somebody
                        tells why he shouldn't.

          SUV and looks around...

                        You sure this is what you want? 
                        There's no turning back after
                        this...

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        The world can deal with one more
                        dead rock star.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        Okay. 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Thank you, Nathan.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        If you can't trust a friend to
                        kill you, who can you trust?  



          Johnny reels from the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You knew the whole time?

                                        NATHAN
                        This is none of your business!

                                        ROY (O.S.)
                        Nathan!

          Nathan and Johnny turn to see Roy, Darren and Sarah.

                                        ROY
                        Let him go.  It's over.

          Nathan lets go of Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You helped Roy stage his death.

                                        NATHAN
                        For a psychic it takes you a long
                        time to catch on.

                                        SARAH
                        If it wasn't Nathan that killed
                        Aubrey, who was it?

          Johnny recognizes the turquoise bracelet on Roy's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That bracelet belonged to Aubrey...

                                        ROY
                        That's right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you mind?

          Roy hesitates, then slips it off and hands it to Johnny,
          WHOOSH! -- just as a ROCK LIFE VAN whips into the far
          side of the parking lot.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think it might be better if you
                        finish this inside.

          Off the moment....

          ANOTHER ANGLE - VAN - MOMENTS LATER

          Doug Driscoll hops out of the back door, clumsy CAMERA*
          MAN in tow.  Driscoll approaches Johnny with a knowing*
          grin.

                                        DOUG
                        You found HIM?!  I knew you would.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Found who?

                                        DOUG
                        Right.
                                (to his cameraman)
                        Make sure you got film in that
                        thing, we're about to make music
                          history.

          Driscoll starts past Johnny and Sarah towards the front*
          door of the diner.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How would you like to have that
                        byline on the front page?

          Driscoll TURNS.  He seems interested...*

          LATER

          Vickings is wheeled into the back of a police van.  He
          glances back to see Roy standing with Darren, Sarah, Doug
          and Johnny.  He looks stunned, like he's seen a ghost.

                                        ROY
                        All those years, you think you
                        know what's real and what's not. 
                        Then you find out it was all a
                        lie.

                                        DARREN
                        Not all of it.

          Roy realizes exactly what he's been given -- a second
          chance.

                                        DOUG
                        I know I promised not to spill
                        the beans about you and, you know,
                        all of this.  But would you do me
                          a favor?  Would you call me first
                        if you ever change your mind?

                                        ROY
                        You got a deal.

          They shake hands as Doug walks away.

                                        SARAH
                        What happens now?

                                        ROY
                        I don't know.  Seems like a waste
                        of energy to step back into the
                        spotlight.  Besides, I think I
                        might know somebody who can do it
                        better.

                                        DARREN
                        Only if you teach me how play
                        those guitar riffs off your first
                          record...

                                        ROY
                        We might be able to work somethin'
                        out. 
                                (beat, to Johnny and
                                  Sarah)
                        I don't know exactly what to say
                        to you people.  Thank you seems a
                          little... weak.

                                        SARAH
                        Just promise me you'll never
                          disappear again.

                                        DARREN
                        I'll make sure of that.

          They all shake hands as Darren and Roy walk away.

                                        SARAH
                        I hope we did the right thing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They'll be okay.

          A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, don't cry.

                                        SARAH
                        I was just thinking about the
                        choices we make in life.  How we
                        can never really be sure what's
                        right and what's wrong.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Regrets?

                                        SARAH
                        I have a husband who loves me
                            unconditionally, a little boy
                        that makes everyday seem new and
                        a dear friend that would do
                          anything for me.  What's to regret?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... what's to regret?

          They hesitate as if they both might have something else
          to say, then Johnny slips his arm around her shoulder and
          they walk away as the SHOT PUSHES TIGHT on a vintage poster
          in the store window.  A poster of Roy Foldes.

          OVER THE SHOT, we HEAR Roy Foldes sing "6 Feet Under" (or*
          "Free")...*
