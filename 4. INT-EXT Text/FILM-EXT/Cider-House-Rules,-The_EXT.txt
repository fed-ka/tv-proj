An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an
overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A
train arrives and departs.
LARCH (V.O.)
In other parts of the world, young
men of promise leave home to make
their fortunes, battle evil, or solve
the problems of the world.
Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St.
Cloud's orphanage.
LARCH (V.O.)
I was myself such a young man, when
I came to save the orphanage in St.
Cloud's... many years ago.
A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main
entrance of the large brick building.
LARCH (V.O.)
Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to
understand that promises are rarely
kept, that the battle isn't so much
against evil as ignorance, and that
being successful can't hold a candle
to being of *use*.
The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of
babies.
LARCH (V.O.)
Nor have I solved the problem I came
here to solve.
At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-
bye to Homer, they close the door.
The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple
is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as
Nurse Edna lets them in.
Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old
Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and
watches the family head down the hill.
LARCH (V.O.)
The second family has an unfortunate
gift for getting sounds out of Homer.
Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.
LARCH (V.O.)
Here is St. Cloud's, I try to
consider, with each rule I make or
break, that my first priority is an
orphan's future.
The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming
and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits
the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older
then Homer.
LARCH (V.O.)
I told the third family to take good
care--this was a special boy.
From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house
carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to
the street.
It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to
the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN
arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each
other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is
crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.
HOMER
Don't be frightened. Everyone is
nice here.
PREGNANT WOMAN
Do you live here?
HOMER
I just belong here.
The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse
Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.
LARCH (V.O.)
What could I do with him? He kept
coming back!
Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He
looks inside the pail; he stops.
LARCH (V.O.)
God forgive me. I have *made* an
orphan by loving him too much. Homer
Wells will belong to St. Cloud's,
forever.
Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the
contents of the pail.
END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an
old phonograph.
Buster and Homer tramp through the snow toward the
incinerator. Homer still carries the pail.
BUSTER
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen
him do it!
HOMER
It's because he's too tired to sleep.
He has to.
BUSTER
He *smells* like he could put you to
sleep!
HOMER
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell
like ether.
BUSTER
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't
smell like ether.
HOMER
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been
to medical school--I haven't even
been to high school!
BUSTER
But you've studied with the old man
for *years*!
HOMER
I'm *not* a doctor!
BUSTER
I'm sorry, Homer.
Buster stands watching as Homer empties the pail into the
incinerator.
The building of St. Cloud's is silhouetted against the sky.
Carla, the woman we saw deliver the baby, is heading down
the hill alone, she sobs, not looking back.
EDNA (O.S.)
"...until the shadows lengthen and
the evening comes, and the busy world
is hushed, and the fever of life is
over, and our work is done."
The girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage,
towing a sled piled high with snowballs.
MARY AGNES
Buster is mine. You two get
Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches
Fuzzy.
They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws
two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or
nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks
his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes,
escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs
as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to
the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly
in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of
the orphanage.
EDNA
Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the
snowballs!
BUSTER
(mouth full of snow)
They're *our* snowballs! They *stole*
them!
MARY AGNES
They attacked us--just like the Japs!
Fuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath.
EDNA
Listen to you, Fuzzy! You've been
running. You get to the shower!
A NEW COUPLE comes up the hill. The orphans stop and stare,
brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves
look presentable. Curly is desperate to look his best. Mary
Agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself. She whispers to Clara
and Hazel.
MARY AGNES
I know the type--they'll take one of
the babies.
Faces in the windows; the orphans watch Hazel walking across
the snowy lawn with her new parents.
The front door opens. The orphans excitedly run outside onto
the green lawn, into the warm weather of spring.
Homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks.
Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock.
BUSTER
Do you ever think about leaving this
place to go find them?
Homer makes no response. As the train approaches, Homer and
Buster go sit on a loading cart. They see the distraught
woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few
nights ago; she is leaving St. Cloud's without her baby,
waiting for the approaching train. Her face is a mask. The
DISAPPROVING STATIONMASTER gives her a hard look.
BUSTER
I mean your parents.
HOMER
I know who you mean. I think about
leaving here, but not to find *them*.
BUSTER
Why not?
HOMER
Whoever they were, they didn't *do*
any of the things parents are supposed
to do. Dr. Larch did those things,
and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
BUSTER
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could
meet mine, anyway.
HOMER
What for, Buster? What would you do
if you met them?
BUSTER
Uh... I'd like to show them that I
can cook, a little.
HOMER
You cook very well!
BUSTER
And that I can drive a truck!
HOMER
(laughing)
Better than I can!
BUSTER
Sometimes I want to meet them so I
can kill them. Just sometimes.
Buster is ashamed; he knows he's said the wrong thing.
BUSTER
Homer, you know I would never kill
anyone--you know I wouldn't.
HOMER
I know.
The slowly moving train has stopped. There are SOLDIERS
leaning out the windows. Buster turns to see Mary Agnes
walking past the train--she's doing her best to look grown-
up, sophisticated. One of the soldiers reaches out and gently
tugs on
her hair. Mary Agnes is enraged; she spits at the
soldier.
BUSTER
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
HOMER
I doubt it. She's just an...
Mary Agnes spits at *all* the soldiers.
HOMER
...emotional girl.
The soldiers roll up the windows as Mary Agnes improvises
some verbal abuse.
BUSTER
What's she so emotional about?
HOMER
(shrugs)
I don't know. She got left here,
like the rest of us, didn't she?
Camera closes on Homer.
The orphanage in moonlight. Not a sound.
The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator.
A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying
next to the incinerator.
Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear.
EDNA
No one's going to hurt you, dear.
Have you come to visit us? We have
beds, you know. Have you had any
breakfast? What's your name?
The girl won't speak; when Edna touches the girl's forehead,
she pulls back her hand in alarm.
Buster and Homer are digging the pit. Larch paces by the
coffin of the 12-year-old girl.
BUSTER
What'd she die of?
LARCH
(inhales deeply)
She died of *secrecy*, she died of
*ignorance*...
Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.
LARCH
(to Homer)
If you expect people to be responsible
for their children, you have to give
them the right to decide whether or
not to *have* children. Wouldn't you
agree?
Buster doesn't get it. Homer has heard this too many times;
he rolls his eyes.
HOMER
How about expecting people to be
responsible enough to control
themselves to begin with?
LARCH
How about this child? You expect
*her* to be responsible?
Homer looks away.
HOMER
I didn't mean her. I'm talking
about... adults.
(annoyed)
You know who I mean!
Larch studies him.
Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and
a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab,
they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild
driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious
smile.
HOMER
What?!
Larch says nothing. Homer gives him a look.
LARCH
(smiling)
It's just a marvel to me that you
still have such high expectations of
people.
HOMER
I'm happy I amuse you.
LARCH
(to Homer)
Try to look at it this way. What
choice does Buster have? What are
his options? Nobody will ever adopt
him.
(Buster considers
this)
HOMER
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster
and I are sitting right here beside
you. We could have ended up in the
incinerator!
(Buster grins)
LARCH
Happy to be alive, under any
circumstances--is that your point?
Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and
it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on
the road again in a few seconds.
HOMER
Happy to be alive... I guess so.
They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that
overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is
driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--
a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.
The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the
orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the
beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car;
they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they
are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to
the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster
(in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the
truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.
CANDY
So many children. Are they all
orphans?
WALLY
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
The kids climb into Wally's car.
CANDY
Oh, they're getting into the car...
watch your fingers!
Curly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face
already smeared with chocolate.
CURLY
I'm the best.
CANDY
(sweetly)
You are?
WALLY
(good with kids)
The best? Wow! The best at *what*?
CURLY
I'm the best one.
Curly's nose is streaming snot. Candy kneels beside him and
holds her handkerchief to his nose.
CANDY
Here, blow...
Curly tries to talk while she's holding his nose.
CURLY
I really *am* the best, I just have
a cold.
CANDY
Blow! There, I bet that feels better.
CURLY
(sniffs)
Yeah.
The other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful.
(Some, like Buster, are torn between Candy and the car.)
LARCH
Curly, come here!
CURLY
(to Larch)
*Tell* them! I'm the one.
Virtually all the orphans have climbed into Wally's car.
HOMER
(to Wally)
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing
a car like this.
WALLY
It's okay--I don't mind.
Larch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple.
WALLY
We brought some chocolates for the
kids.
LARCH
(witheringly)
Chocolates. How *thoughtful*.
Larch picks up Curly and carries him toward the boys'
division.
CURLY
I'm the best! *Tell* them!
LARCH
You're the best, Curly.
Homer approaches the flashy car, where Wally is still pacing.
HOMER
Has anyone offered you anything to
eat?
WALLY
Actually, someone did. I just didn't
think I could eat anything.
An awkward silence, which Homer covers by examining the car.
HOMER
(trying to sound casual)
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
WALLY
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
HOMER
(unprepared)
Where are you going?
WALLY
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Homer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is.
HOMER
Cape Kenneth...
Wally nods.
HOMER
That sounds fine.
As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela
can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak.
From a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer
saying goodbye to the children, embracing them.
From another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's
coughing.)
We see Wally carrying Candy to the car.
CANDY
(groggy)
I'm okay--I can walk.
WALLY
I don't want you to walk--I want to
carry you. Should I put the top up?
It might get cold.
CANDY
No--keep it down. I want to feel the
air.
She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy
person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat.
CANDY
(still groggy)
Coming with us? It's always a good
idea to have a doctor along for the
ride.
Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts
the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly,
who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to
the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing.
HOMER
I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry.
(to Edna)
I couldn't find Buster. Will you
tell him...
He can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good-
bye.
From the window, Larch watches the car leave.
Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.
There is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps
glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant,
lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed,
the road, the wind in his face.
The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half-
hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the
car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to
hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.
CANDY
I couldn't have a baby with someone
who's leaving me--I didn't know what
else to do!
Homer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions.
HOMER
I know.
CANDY
He's going to be dropping bombs on
Mandalay! They're going to be shooting
at him!
HOMER
Where's Mandalay?
CANDY
Burma!
HOMER
Oh...
CANDY
I can't have a baby alone. I don't
even know if he's coming back!
HOMER
I understand.
He doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to
hug her.
WALLY
Honey, honey... of course I'll come
back.
Candy pounds on his chest with her fists.
CANDY
You don't *know*, Wally. You have no
*idea*!
Wally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably.
CANDY
Stay away from me!
Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car.
Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing
Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously.
HOMER
(strictly medical)
This is all normal. Don't worry. The
abortion procedure... it affects
you. It's the ether, too. It'll take
a little time.
WALLY
I don't *have* any time. There's a
*war*!
HOMER
It's all very normal.
Wally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his
cigarette.
WALLY
You ought to cut that shit out--it's
terrible for you.
Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes.
Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot.
They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy
asleep in the backseat.
The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio
are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark
highway.
The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds
of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets
out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There
it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun
glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the
sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it
all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her.
CANDY
I'm a little worried about the...
(she gestures below
her waist)
...about how much bleeding is okay.
HOMER
It should taper off tomorrow, but it
can come back again. You have cramps?
(Candy nods)
They'll ease up, almost entirely. As
long as the bleeding isn't heavy,
it's normal.
WALLY (O.S.)
Catch!
A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it
bounces off his chest. Wally laughs.
WALLY
(meaning the football)
Give it here!
Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one
before.
WALLY
What was *that*?! Come over here!
Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to
pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy,
who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it
rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes,
like that!"
Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's
blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her
direction before he speaks to Homer.
WALLY
It's called the Burma run. It's about
a seven-hour round-trip flight between
India and China.
Wally draws a crude map in the sand.
HOMER
"Burma run" because you fly over
Burma...
WALLY
*And* over the Himalayas. That's
called flying over the hump.
On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.
HOMER (O.S.)
At what altitude?
WALLY
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb
to fifteen thousand feet--that's the
first mountain pass.
Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully.
HOMER
What lousy luck--I mean your orders...
to draw an assignment like that!
WALLY
(conspiratorially)
Actually, I volunteered.
Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice.
HOMER
It's the flying, right? You love to
fly, don't you?
Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before
he responds.
WALLY
I love the bombing, too. But there's
also the Himalayas--they have the
most wicked air currents in the world.
I wouldn't miss flying there for
anything.
Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he
wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs
and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.
WALLY
Uh, look... if you're serious about
wanting a job, picking apples isn't
that boring.
HOMER
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car
watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands
outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand.
CANDY
I guess I'll see you around the
orchards. Thanks for everything.
HOMER
Sure... I'll see you around.
Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally.
A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY,
Candy's father. Candy waves. "Hi, Daddy!" Homer glances at
Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye.
CANDY
(whispering)
I love you, Wally.
WALLY
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Wally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the
car. Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse.
WALLY
Come on. You have to meet my mom.
(conspiratorially)
If it comes up, I've been at a
wedding. That's where I met you, at
the wedding.
Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a
barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line
after line of trees--the apple orchards.
Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are
showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's
occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH
BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house
and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.
JACK
You already used up the hot water!
MUDDY
You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
JACK
I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold
to bother with soap!
MUDDY
There ain't never enough hot water,
soap or no soap.
WALLY
They're migrants.
HOMER
(no clue)
Migrants?
WALLY
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds.
They travel up and down the coast
with the seasons.
(leaning close to
Homer)
The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have
to let him be the boss.
Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door
of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young
black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her
hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting
Homer and Wally.
ROSE ROSE
That sink's backed up again, Wally.
I thought you was gonna get me a
plumber.
WALLY
Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is
Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.
HOMER
Rose Rose?
ROSE ROSE
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
WALLY
No, no--Homer is a new *picker*.
He's going to stay here with you.
This gets the attention of the men on their way from the
showers. They walk over, towels around their waists.
ROSE ROSE
(suspiciously)
He's stayin' *here*?
The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them
all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house.
MR. ROSE
That daughter of mine sure is Miss
Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?
Grinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back
inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer
introduces himself.
MR. ROSE
You got lots of experience pickin',
I suppose.
WALLY
Homer's got no experience, Arthur,
but he's smarter then I am. He's a
fast learner.
Mr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.
MR. ROSE
This is history. Ain't that what
you're sayin', Wally? I guess we
makin' *history*... havin' this young
man stay with us!
Wally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house
to help Rose Rose with the plumbing.
WALLY
(over his shoulder)
See you later.
Homer looks at Mr. Rose for instructions. Mr. Rose stares
back at him with his enigmatic smile.
HOMER
So. What should I do now?
MR. ROSE
Out back, there's a shed. It's just
a mess. If that shed was better
organized, I could put my truck in
there.
Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.
MR. ROSE
If you're as smart as Wally says,
you know you sometimes gotta do one
job before you do another.
Homer thinks that over.
Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed.
The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table.
Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers.
Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he
pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so
fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to
peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is
riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel
dangling from it.
MR. ROSE
You did a good job with that shed,
Homer.
Peaches breaks the awkward silence.
PEACHES
What kind of a name is Homer?
HOMER
It's the name of a cat. Originally.
Well, not *originally*.
Homer decides to stop. Another silence.
MR. ROSE
Now, now--we all got names, sensible
or not.
(to Homer)
Peaches is from Georgia, where we
met him pickin' peaches. He's still
better with peaches than hs is with
apples.
(Peaches grins)
Jack here is new. And this here is
Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some
kind or other once. Ain't that right,
Hero?
There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers
concerning what his heroism might have been.
MR. ROSE
And this here sensitive-lookin' fella
is Muddy. The less said about Muddy,
the better. Ain't that right, Muddy?
Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr. Rose.
The cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight.
Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is
racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in
the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life.
WALLY
Remember this! In the morning, when
the tall grass is wet, you can make
the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you
feel it?
Homer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and
faster.
WALLY
It's almost like flying.
HOMER
What about the trees?
WALLY
The trees are flak--antiaircraft
fire from those geeks on the ground.
Wally brakes hard. The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing-
house area.
Candy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers
are working in the background.
WALLY
(defensively to Candy)
I was just showing Homer the
orchards... kind of a geography
lesson.
CANDY
(good-naturedly)
I know what you've been doing.
She pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the
vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front -
bumper or headlight area. Candy playfully starts poking Wally
with the branch.
CANDY
(to Wally)
You've been giving him a *flying*
lesson!
WALLY
(teasing her)
He *loved* it!
(to Homer)
Didn't you?
HOMER
Yeah, it was great.
Wally gets the apple branch away from Candy. He pins her
arms at her sides--he hugs her, kisses her. She doesn't
struggle.
CANDY
(laughing to Homer)
He thinks people *like* to get whacked
by branches.
WALLY
*Homer* liked it!
(to Homer)
Didn't you?
HOMER
Yeah, sure. There's no stress or
strain around here...
They all laugh. Homer observes the happy couple.
Homer is walking with Wally and Candy. The orchards are
beautiful.
Much activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a
full flatbed trailer. An angry-looking VERNON gives Homer an
evil glare. Homer spills some apples lifting the crate to
the loading platform.
VERNON
What's wrong with you?
Mr. Rose takes Homer aside.
MR. ROSE
That's Vernon. You best stay away
from him until he gets to know you
better--then you best stay away from
him *more*!
Wally, in full uniform, appears from inside the packing house;
he calls for Homer.
MR. ROSE
Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer.
Mind your ass.
Homer smiles are runs toward Wally.
Homer and Wally walk through the packing house, where the
HEFTY, LOUD WOMEN sort through the apples rolling by on the
conveyor tracks. Wally snatches an apple from one of them,
giving it to Homer.
WALLY
(to Homer)
You getting along okay?
Before Homer can answer, the women interrupt.
BIG DOT
Where is that Candy?
FLORENCE
Did she leave you, Wally?
DEBRA
Who's the boy?
Wally makes an effort to introduce Homer, but he's
interrupted.
FLORENCE
Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy
leaves you!
BIG DOT
Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy
leaves him!
DEBRA
You can marry all three of us, Wally!
FLORENCE
We can take turns.
Wally puts his hand to his heart.
WALLY
You girls make it hard for a guy to
go off to war.
(points to Homer)
But I'll leave my best man here to
pinch-hit for me.
As the women are left behind giggling, Wally continues talking
to Homer.
WALLY
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I
thought. I just wanted to be sure
you were settled in--and happy enough,
considering...
(grabbing another
apple from a crate)
Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick
it out for a bit?
HOMER
Uh... actually, picking apples is as
much excitement as I want for a while.
I'm grateful for the job.
WALLY
(his hand on Homer's
shoulder)
You're the one who's helping *me*,
Homer. You're going to give my mom a
little peace of mind while I'm gone.
Candy, too.
HOMER
Well, sure... that's good, then.
(awkward pause)
All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
WALLY
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the
lucky one.
Homer shakes his head. Wally stops walking; they both stop.
WALLY
(more serious)
You want to fight about it?
Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at
first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too.
They shake hands.
Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers
are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going
back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them.
He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.
High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and
Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with
high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he
drops an occasional apple to the ground.
MR. ROSE
You pickin' more cider apples then
anythin' else. Them drops is good
only for cider. And you pickin' the
stems with the apples only half the
time. They good only for cider, too--
if you don't pick them stems.
(Homer watches him)
The rule is, you wanna pick the apple
*with* the stem, Homer. And see
here... see that *bud* that's just
above the stem? That's the bud for
*next year's* apple--that's called
the *spur*. You pick the spur, you
pickin' two years in one--you pickin'
next year's apple 'fore it have a
chance to grow. You leave that on
the branch, you hear?
Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.
MR. ROSE
(approvingly)
That's better. I can tell you got
yourself some education. Them's good
hands you got, Homer. Them hands you
got, they know what they're doin'--
ain't that right?
HOMER
I guess so...
Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top
of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house,
where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally.
Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr.
Rose observes with a wry smile.
ANGELA (O.S.)
Wilbur! Wilbur!
ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
Where's that Homer?
Homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the
cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring
voices, the soft laughter.
JACK (O.S.)
Who cares?
MR. ROSE (O.S.)
Now, now. He's a good boy.
JACK (O.S.)
Shit. We don't know what he is.
MR. ROSE (O.S.)
Jack, you gotta watch your language
'round my daughter.
Homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long
plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof--obviously a
popular spot.
MR. ROSE
Here he is.
No one moves.
MR. ROSE
Where's your manners? Make room for
Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
MUDDY
What view?
Peaches slides over and Homer sits down.
HOMER
Are we supposed to be up here? The
rules said...
MR. ROSE
Homer, you the only one who's read
them rules, so you the only one who
feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
The others laugh.
MUDDY
*What* view?
MR. ROSE
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these
angry stars Homer's been readin' to
us about.
More laughter; Homer smiles, enjoying the teasing.
JACK
(gesturing toward the
Worthington farmhouse)
I bet the view looks better from the
Worthin'tons'.
MR. ROSE
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't
want to be in that Wally's shoes
tonight.
ROSE ROSE
(playfully, teasing
him)
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's
shoes *every* night.
MR. ROSE
(teasing her back)
You lucky you in your work boots
tonight, girl...
ROSE ROSE
What's lucky about that?
Rose Rose is being physically affectionate with her father--
lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head.
MR. ROSE
You know where that Wally is tonight,
darlin'? He's up there in them angry
stars.
(gesturing at the
dark sky)
He's flyin' all around up there...
with them Japs shooting at him.
They all look up, imagining that. Homer more than the others.
Rose Rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's
shoulder. They are completely natural together.
Homer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a
shipping truck. Olive and Candy are consulting some papers
(the shipping tally) on a clipboard; Mr. Rose is standing
beside them.
MR. ROSE
They all on board, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
OLIVE
Thank you, Arthur.
(see is looking at
Homer)
And how is our Homer working out?
She catches Homer's eye; he smiles, then joins them. Mr.
Rose puts his arm around him.
MR. ROSE
Oh, he's a smart young man, most of
the time--Wally was right about him.
Olive is looking over the rest of the picking crew.
OLIVE
No rotten apples?
MR. ROSE
(it's an old way of
speaking that they
have)
No, no--not this year. Well... maybe
we got *one*, but it ain't Homer.
He means Jack, who gives Olive and Candy and Mr. Rose a
furtive look. Olive smiles at Rose Rose, who comes up to her
and Candy. Olive touches Rose Rose with affection.
OLIVE
Rose... dear girl, I'm sure I can
find you some other clothes.
(to Candy)
You must have some things that would
fit her.
Candy takes Rose Rose by the shoulders and turns her around.
Rose Rose is enjoying this.
CANDY
I have a *ton* of things that would
fit you.
MR. ROSE
Now, now, Candy--this girl don't
need no more clothes, not for pickin'.
He starts leading his daughter away.
OLIVE
(charming)
Arthur, there's no such thing as a
young woman who's got all the clothes
she needs.
Olive waves good-bye as she moves toward her car. Candy turns
to Homer.
CANDY
So. Not bored yet?
HOMER
I'm *never* bored! It's all very...
different for me... here.
Homer has the hardest time looking at Candy.
HOMER
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
CANDY
When I'm not thinking about Wally.
I'm not good at being alone.
(realizing)
Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm
fine. I...
(struggling to change
the subject)
...I don't suppose you've seen a
lobster yet.
Homer shakes his head. He looks at the tractor and the empty
trailer. Mr. Rose and the pickers are just watching them.
CANDY
(more seriously)
You have to come to my dad's lobster
pound and see one, then.
HOMER
Okay...
Homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when
he hears the tractor start. Candy follows his gaze.
HOMER
I better go.
CANDY
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave
without you.
Mr. Rose gestures for Muddy to drive off; the tractor trailer
pulls away.
CANDY
(laughing)
Sorry!
Homer has to run to catch up.
CANDY
(calling)
Come next week!
He jumps on the back of the departing flatbed between Mr.
Rose and Rose Rose, as Candy watches him.
Homer pedals a bicycle down a dirt road.
Ray holds a lobster up to the camera. We see the old-fashioned
wooden pens, floating dockside.
RAY
Hungry?
Homer looks uncertain.
Homer and Ray and Candy go up the gangplank from the dock to
the lobster pound.
RAY
They're the garbage-eaters of the
ocean's floor. The seagulls clean up
the shore. The lobsters clean up the
bottom of the sea.
HOMER
They eat everything?
RAY
Everything that falls to the bottom.
CANDY
It's time somebody ate *them*.
RAY
(to Candy)
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I
was gonna show it to Homer...
(to Homer)
They made him a captain already--
*Captain* Worthington!
CANDY
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
RAY
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
CANDY
(awkwardly)
Wally said to say, "Hello."
HOMER
(equally awkward)
Oh! That's... nice.
RAY
(to Homer)
Wally said the most spectacular hits
were in the oil fields at Yenangyat.
Later, through the window of the lobster pound, we see them
eating lobster around a kitchen table. Laughter and some
unclear dialogue drift to us.
With the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer
back to the cider house. They pass a drive-in movie theatre,
the marquee announcing "CLOSED FOR THE SEASON." Homer stares
in awe at the giant blank screen.
HOMER
A movie *outside*?
CANDY
Yes. But it's closed all the time
now, because of the blackout.
HOMER
People watched the movies in their
cars?
CANDY
(smiling)
When they watched at all. Do you
like movies?
HOMER
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
Candy looks at him; he isn't joking.
CANDY
You've seen only one movie? Which
one?
HOMER
"King Kong". It's really good.
Candy laughs.
CANDY
I haven't seen "King Kong" since I
was a kid!
Homer laughs a little self-consciously; around her, he feels
like he's *still* a kid.
Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee
and past the poster for "Wuthering Heights."
CANDY
(disappointed)
But you looked as if you liked it.
HOMER
(smiling)
I *did* like it. All I said was,
"It's not 'King Kong'."
Candy makes a face, but in good fun.
HOMER
First she loved him, then she didn't,
then no one else could have him...
CANDY
She *did* love him!
(teasing him)
How many women have you known?
Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.
HOMER
And what did she die of, exactly?
CANDY
She was torn apart! She died of a
broken heart.
HOMER
Oh, sure!
Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh.
HOMER
What's the *medical* explanation?
CANDY
Well, she was in a weakened
condition...
(laughs)
I don't know! What about "King Kong"?!
Is that medically possible?
Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.
HOMER
(mock serious)
At least King Kong knew what he
*wanted*.
Candy pushes him playfully. They're both having a good time,
*too* good a time.
Homer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a
ladder in the tree right beside him. She's picking about
twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples. In
another tree, Muddy is watching.
ROSE ROSE
What is you *doin'* with that Candy,
Homer?
MUDDY
(imitating Mr. Rose)
He's makin' history, I suppose.
From the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh.
ROSE ROSE
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I
hope.
HOMER
No trouble.
In adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples;
they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too. (So can Mr. Rose.)
PEACHES
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I
know!
MUDDY
She's about the most beautiful girl
I ever seen--I don't know if she's
the nicest.
HOMER
She's the nicest *and* the most
beautiful girl I've ever known.
The men *oooh* and *aaah* at Homer's announcement--Mr. Rose,
too.
ROSE ROSE
That sounds like you is in trouble
already, Homer.
MR. ROSE
That's right--that sounds like trouble
to me.
HOMER
I'm not in trouble.
ROSE ROSE
Yeah, you is. I know when people is
in trouble, and you is.
Camera closes on Homer's face; he keeps picking.
LARCH (O.S.)
His name is Homer Wells...
The rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet
as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr.
Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.
Buster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave.
The tiny gravestone says "F.S."
BUSTER
What are you going to tell the little
ones?
LARCH
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
BUSTER
Why would the little ones believe
that *anyone* would adopt him?
LARCH
They'll believe it because they want
to believe it.
BUSTER
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
LARCH
If Homer wanted to know what was
happening here, he could pick up a
telephone and call us.
As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread,
Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road
toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin',
Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing
and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to
Homer.
OLIVE
Some mail for you, Homer.
Homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the
table, unopened. Olive turns to Rose Rose.
OLIVE
And some clothes for you, dear--
(nodding to the cider
house)
let's go see if they fit.
Mr. Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider
house. The other men view Homer's package with curiosity,
especially Peaches.
PEACHES
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
MR. ROSE
Mind your own business, Peaches.
PEACHES
Sorry, Homer...
The beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler
weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag,
Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of
broken glass.
HOMER
Aren't you worried that people will
cut their feet?
CANDY
Nobody will swim here until next
summer. By then, the water will have
rubbed the glass smooth against the
sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells
at the high-tide mark.
CANDY
See? That's last year's glass, or
from some year before. I put glass
here every year. The ocean makes it
beautiful.
Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look
at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade
of green.
CANDY
Give me your hand.
She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then
throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves
it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from
the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around
her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her,
then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller
then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates
the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make
love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.
They come out of the woods, walking toward the car, Candy
leading. We hear Candy talking just before we see her and
Homer.
CANDY
(increasingly upset)
*Nobody* volunteers for the Burma
run--he said so himself. And nobody
knows *me* better than him! So how
am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber
pilot and I'm just selfish, I know.
Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl
and I'm *not* sorry.
She sits in the passenger seat, Homer in the driver's seat.
CANDY
I *know* this was right.
(pause)
I told you. I'm not good at being
alone.
(pause; in a whisper)
I told him, too.
Homer concentrates on starting the car.
CANDY
(repeating herself)
I *know* this was right.
HOMER
Right.
Their expressions, as the car pulls away, belie their words.
Homer and Mr. Rose sit opposite each other at the picnic
table. Rose Rose stands behind her father, her hands on his
shoulders, watching Homer snip out Mr. Rose's stitches--very
quickly.
MR. ROSE
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a
big hurry.
HOMER
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
MR. ROSE
You still doin' it too fast!
Job done, Homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle,
pedaling away. Rose Rose watches Homer go, as Mr. Rose flexes
his healed hand.
ROSE ROSE
He's in a big hurry, all right. I
told you he's in trouble.
Candy and Homer sit on the dock. Candy still seems to be
wrestling with her conscience. Homer throws snails in the
sea. It's cold.
HOMER
Just tell me. Do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay?
CANDY
It will be okay.
HOMER
*What* will be okay?
CANDY
We have to wait and see. I think
that, for *everything* in life, you
have to wait and see.
Homer throws a snail with more force.
HOMER
I'll just move on, get another job
somewhere.
Ray comes out onto the dock; he sees Homer throwing another
snail.
RAY
Every time you throw a snail off the
dock, you're makin' someone start
his whole life over.
Candy throws a handful of snails into the water.
CANDY
Maybe we're doing the snails a favor,
Daddy.
Ray looks at the two of them; he sighs.
RAY
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack
it in.
CANDY
Good night, Daddy.
Ray nods good night; he leaves. Homer looks expectantly at
Candy.
CANDY
We'll just have to wait and see.
The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and
Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't
hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk
past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck.
Olive and Homer walk over to the truck.
OLIVE
Good-bye. Have a safe trip home.
Thank you, again, for all your hard
work.
MR. ROSE
You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
They shake hands.
OLIVE
Good-bye, Arthur.
(she hugs Rose Rose)
Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
HOMER
Right.
Olive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off.
The truck is packed. Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the
load.
MUDDY
(to Mr. Rose)
We all set, I think.
Mr. Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel. Rose Rose and
Muddy get in next to him. The others are bundled up for the
ride in the open back of the truck.
As they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling
out to him.
MR. ROSE
You all take care of yourself, too,
Homer!
PEACHES
We see you next harvest.
MUDDY
Don't freeze to death, Homer.
JACK
Go on and freeze to death if you
want to, Homer.
MR. ROSE
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
ROSE ROSE
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Homer stands looking after them, after they're gone.
Homer, drinking coffee, is writing a letter on a note pad.
HOMER (V.O.)
Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your
doctor's bag...
Homer is learning how to "haul" a lobster pot with Ray and
Candy's guidance.
HOMER (V.O.)
...although it seems that I will not
have the occasion to use it.
Following Ray's example, Homer is trying to "disarm" the
lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little
wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As
Candy watches, Homer gets pinched.
HOMER (V.O.)
Barring some emergency, of course. I
am not a doctor. With all due respect
to your profession. I am enjoying my
life here.
Vernon and Homer are working under an apple tree; they are
poisoning mice.
HOMER (V.O.)
Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning
here may not be as important as what
I learned from you, but everything
is new to me. Yesterday I learned
how to poison mice. You use poison
oats and poison corn.
Homer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee.
LARCH (V.O.)
Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for
anything I've done. I'm not even
sorry that I love you!
Mr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of
the truck, grabbing their gear.
The pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a
good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped
against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an
argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr.
Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.)
MR. ROSE
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples,
Peaches--I hope you understand that.
PEACHES
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off
the tree!
MR. ROSE
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they
ain't no better than drops to me.
See that bruise, and that one? *Half*
of these is bruised! Look at this
one! It ain't got no stem! You might
as well *step* on 'em, too--they
only good for cider.
In the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing
in one of the work vehicles.
CANDY
Do you think I'm having a good time?
Do you think I'm just *teasing* you?
Do you think I *know* whether I want
you or Wally?
HOMER
So we should "wait and see." For how
long?
CANDY
I grew up with Wally. I began my
adult life with him.
HOMER
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
CANDY
No! That's not all there is to it! I
love you, too--I *know* I do.
HOMER
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
CANDY
(bitterly)
It's a good thing I didn't have that
baby, isn't it?
Her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their
separate ways. Candy drives on.
Breakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself,
away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly
goes back inside the bunkhouse.
PEACHES
(calling after her)
Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose?
(to the men)
She used to eat with us. Now we ain't
good enough for her, I guess.
HERO
She ain't hungry, maybe.
MUDDY
She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause
she's sick every mornin'.
Homer gets up to take his dishes inside.
Homer and Candy are sitting at the dock.
CANDY
We should take her to St. Cloud's.
That much is obvious, isn't it? Let
her make up her mind when she gets
there...
HOMER
I told her! She doesn't feel she can
do that. Something about her father
not letting her go anywhere...
CANDY
Well, we have to help her!
Homer doesn't respond.
CANDY
We have to do *something*. Don't we?
(beat)
Homer?
Homer looks out over the ocean; he remains unresponsive.
Rose Rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when Candy
arrives.
CANDY
Hi...
ROSE ROSE
Hi...
She keeps setting the table.
CANDY
I've got some more clothes for you--
I just keep forgetting to bring them
with me.
ROSE ROSE
I don't need no more clothes, thank
you.
CANDY
(softly)
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer
told me. I got pregnant, too--about
a year ago.
(pause)
I've been through this.
Rose Rose looks down.
ROSE ROSE
You ain't been through what I been
through, Candy.
CANDY
(doesn't get it)
Yes, I *have*!
Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand.
CANDY
Who's the father, Rose?
Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head.
CANDY
You want to have the baby?
Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically.
CANDY
I know where you can go. Homer and I
can take you...
ROSE ROSE
I can't go nowhere.
CANDY
Why?
Rose Rose stays silent.
CANDY
Is it the father? Does he know?
Rose Rose turns away from Candy.
CANDY
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's
not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it
Muddy?
ROSE ROSE
(almost wistfully)
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table.
Her voice turns bitter, despairing.
ROSE ROSE
It sure ain't Jack.
There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is
uncharacteristically tentative.
MR. ROSE
(to his daughter)
I'll be up top...
Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose
nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks
pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose
is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking
at Candy with an ashamed expression.
The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs
down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the
bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches
and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening.
CANDY
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
HOMER
(shrugging)
Well, we can't force her. It's her
decision.
CANDY
You don't understand! It's her
father...
HOMER
Mr. Rose *knows*?
CANDY
(shouting)
He's the *father*! He's her baby's
father!
The pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to
leave, Homer running after her.
HOMER
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
CANDY
We've got to keep her away from that
bastard!
Candy leaves. Homer starts looking for Mr. Rose.
Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking
while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder.
MR. ROSE
I didn't see where you was pickin'
this mornin', Homer, but you musta
worked up a big appetite. You look
like you're serious about gettin' to
your lunch today!
HOMER
Is it true?
Mr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.
HOMER
Are you sleeping with your own
daughter?
Mr. Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder.
MR. ROSE
(slyly; still composed)
I think you been stayin' up too late
at night, Homer.
HOMER
You're actually having sex with your
own little girl? Is that possible?
MR. ROSE
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my
little girl, Homer--that's somethin'
a father knows.
HOMER
You're lying. How can you... with
your own daughter!
Mr. Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second.
MR. ROSE
Homer, don't you know what business
you in? You don't wanna go into no
business with me, Homer--ain't that
right?
HOMER
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other
clothes.
Mr. Rose is indignant.
MR. ROSE
You a fine one to be talkin' about
lies. Shame! These people took you
in. That boy Wally's at *war*!
That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority.
HOMER
But she's your *daughter*...
MR. ROSE
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody
else gonna treat her as good as I
do!
(looks away)
I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her,
Homer--you must know that.
Homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away.
HOMER
She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?
By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's
clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.
The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious
that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is
sleeping with his daughter.
Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers
arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks
at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to
sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.
Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder
on the other side of the same tree.
MUDDY
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you
know what's good for you.
HOMER
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
MUDDY
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop
it.
Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his
knife.
MUDDY
There's my knife, Homer. It ain't
gonna do *me* no good. You give that
knife to Rose Rose, you hear?
Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and
moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to
Homer until he disappears in the leaves.
MUDDY
You best just watch you ass, Homer!
You don't wanna end up like Jack!
Homer thoughtfully continues his work.
The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking.
In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.
It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the
trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high
on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington
house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the
driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves
the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of
Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning
against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he
watches Candy run.
CANDY
No! No!
Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as
aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.
Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence.
HOMER
(finally)
There are no autonomic effects, just
the paralysis of the lower
extremities.
Candy stares at him, uncomprehending.
HOMER
Wally can have kids, a normal sex
life...
Candy cries.
Ray is throwing snails in the water. Candy sits on the end
of the dock, slumped on Homer's shoulder.
RAY
How about him not needin' the friggin'
compass! How about that?
CANDY
Daddy, *please*...
Ray knows that she wants him to leave. He shuffles off the
dock, toward the house. He knows how they both must feel.
RAY
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold--
it's gettin' cold already.
CANDY
Good night, Daddy.
HOMER
Good night, Ray.
Homer tries to cuddle closer, but Candy sits up, preoccupied.
HOMER
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you
want to do.
CANDY
Nothing.
HOMER
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
CANDY
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally
to come home. I'm afraid to see him,
too.
HOMER
I know.
(he kisses her)
Is *that* nothing.
CANDY
No, don't--that's something. Nothing
is nothing.
(Homer's sad smile)
Don't even look at me. I want...
Candy buries her face in his chest.
CANDY
...to do nothing.
Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying
subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away. With Candy slumped
against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead,
he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words
resonating. An unfamiliar expression is on his face.
HOMER
(mumbling to himself)
It's a tempting idea, I know... to
do nothing.
Candy is silent. Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts
his position.
CANDY
(groans)
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
HOMER
(overly genuine)
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That
would be *doing* something, wouldn't
it? We wouldn't want to *do*
something. Let's just sit here all
night!
CANDY
(irritated)
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
HOMER
(irritated, too)
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm
just doing nothing! If I wait and
see long enough, then--with any luck--
I won't *ever* have to make up my
mind! Decisions can be painful, after
all...
Candy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him.
CANDY
Stop it! Just cut it out!
HOMER
(mock surprise)
You got up! You *did* something! If
you keep this up, you might be in
danger of making a *decision*!
CANDY
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been
shot down!
Candy sobs. Homer puts his face in his hands for a minute.
He regains his composure and stands up.
HOMER
(genuinely contrite)
I know, I'm sorry.
CANDY
(yelling and sobbing)
He's *paralyzed*!
HOMER
(deadpan; just the
facts)
He's *alive*. He still loves you.
(pause)
So do I.
CANDY
(anguished)
What do you want me to *do*?
He faces away from her.
HOMER
(with calm resolve)
Nothing. You're not the one who has
to do anything.
Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house.
MR. ROSE (O.S.)
Where do you think you're going?
ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees
Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the
bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.
MR. ROSE
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle
of the night, girl!
ROSE ROSE
I ain't your business no more, Daddy.
Please let me go.
Rose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr. Rose stops her. She
starts to struggle.
HOMER
Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.
They turn to see Homer.
MR. ROSE
You just go inside, Homer. We don't
need no help.
ROSE ROSE
That's right, Homer. This ain't your
business.
She tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but
he stops her again. They keep struggling.
HOMER
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
MR. ROSE
You forget yourself, Homer. This
here's my daughter! You got your own
mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Homer steps between them, which makes Mr. Rose furious.
MR. ROSE
(yelling)
What business is you in, Homer?
HOMER
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor*
business.
(to Rose Rose)
If you want, I can help you. You
don't have to go anywhere.
Rose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in
charge.
...to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging
roof in the rain.
The cider house in the rain. Mr. Rose staggers out; he stands
there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. He starts
to scream.
Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and
Peaches and Hero are watching him.
Homer and Candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't
look at each other. Candy grips the steering wheel of the
parked car.
CANDY
Please don't make me say it again.
HOMER
No, that's not it--I just want to be
sure I understand you.
Candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel.
HOMER
I *helped* you not to think about
Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't
stand worrying about him, about his
being killed and not coming back--
but when you were with me, you could
stop worrying... well, for a while,
anyway. This is how I helped you,
right?
CANDY
Please... that's enough. I *loved*
you, too--you know I did.
HOMER
"...did." Well, okay.
CANDY
Please don't...
HOMER
(sarcastically)
And now that Wally's coming back,
and because he'll certainly *need*
you...
CANDY
You say that as though it's some
awful thing!
(angrily)
I never stopped loving Wally!
Homer lets that sink in.
HOMER
(still sarcastic)
At least there's no more waiting and
seeing. At least I got to see the
ocean.
Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably,
unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--
another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an
almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at
the blank screen.
The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees
glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer
gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer,
walking, exits the frame in another.
As he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and
Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof.
MUDDY
Rose Rose has runned away!
PEACHES
She took off in the night!
MUDDY
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house.
Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him.
Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the
roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective
that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying
the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to
Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no
dialogue.
Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck.
The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives
up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work
across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him.
They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.
CANDY
Do you think she'll be all right?
HOMER
She knows how to take care of herself.
Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves
her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she
hands to Homer.
CANDY
This came for you a couple of days
ago. Olive asked me to bring it.
With everything happening, I guess
she forgot.
HOMER
Sure. Thanks.
Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it
unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't
let things end there.
CANDY
I know you don't think much of being
needed, or of me for that matter...
HOMER
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally
needing you. It was... unnecessary.
CANDY
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.
You have every right to be angry.
HOMER
No. You warned me. I didn't listen,
but you warned me.
Candy looks surprised.
HOMER
You told me you weren't any good at
being alone.
(pause)
You told Wally, too. Right?
Candy can only stare straight ahead.
HOMER
(relenting)
He's going to be fine, Wally's going
to be fine. I know he is.
A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then
he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.
The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by
the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one
else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open
window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are
Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The
pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation,
while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has
made up his mind about something.
MUDDY
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
PEACHES
He ain't never been outta Maine!
HERO
Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer?
Homer just smiles and shakes his head.
As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of
the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he
sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car
and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.
Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's
coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge
clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is
drawn into a tight-lipped smile.
PEACHES (O.S.)
Let me tell you somethin' about
Florida, Homer.
HERO (O.S.)
The Sunshine State!
PEACHES (O.S.)
It's so nice 'n' warm down there,
you can pick them grapefruits and
oranges *naked*, if you want to.
Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses
Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face,
her hair.
In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes
his head.
HOMER
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with
you. But I've got to move on.
MUDDY
Yeah, well... you could move on with
*us*, man! You could move on somewhere
*warm*!
PEACHES
Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin'
on!
This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and
shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear
from view.
ANGELA (V.O.)
He talked a lot about you, hoping
you would be of use, whatever you
were up to.
Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's
coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh
dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black
against the new white.
EDNA (O.S.)
"Oh, Lord, support us all the day
long..."
We see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone.
EDNA (O.S.)
"...until the shadows lengthen and
the evening comes, and the busy world
is hushed, and the fever of life is
over, and our work is done."
The train stops, blowing snow. Homer steps off the train
carrying a suitcase and Dr. Larch's bag. The disapproving
stationmaster is still disapproving. Music plays Over,
something triumphant.
Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. Music
Over.
Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting
over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins.
Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see
him. Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs
toward him. Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns
away and runs inside. Music FADES OUT Over.
