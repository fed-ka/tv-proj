A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man
sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
with a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
and staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,
KARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
hands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring
and Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant
approaches Charles.
ATTENDANT
You can't smoke in here.
Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
smoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.
CHARLES
A Mercury is a good car and that's
what I was driving that day. I've
owned a lot of cars. Different
kinds. Lots of different kinds of
cars. She was standing, this girl,
on the side of the street where
there was a chicken stand; not the
Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
a chicken stand, and I pulled the
Mercury over and rolled down the
window by electric power. She was
wearing a leather skirt and she had
a lot of hair on her arms. I like
that. I like it a lot. It means a
big bush. I like a big bush. She
said, "Are you dating?" I said,
"yes," and she got in the car. We
pulled to a remote location, one
that she and I both felt
comfortable with and she said, "How
much can you spend?" I said, "What
it takes to see your bush. I know
it's a big one." She said "twenty
five dollars," which to a working
man is not chicken feed. I produced
the money and she put it in her
shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
before me lay a thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis. You can
imagine how badly I wanted my
twenty-five dollars back.
Two young women, MARSHA DWIGGINS, carrying a briefcase, and
THERESA EVANS, carrying two camera bags are being led down
the hallway by a GUARD.
THERESA
I don't know why you're so weirded
out, this is not San Quentin, it's
just a nuthouse. Most of these
people don't even know where they
are, they're not gonna hurt you.
MARSHA
In a few minutes we're gonna be in
a room with a killer. That doesn't
bother you?
THERESA
Hey, you're the one that wanted to
major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't
the guy something like twelve or
thirteen when he did it, it was
twenty-five years ago, he probably
doesn't even remember it.
MARSHA
(wrinkling her nose)
Do you smell shit?
THERESA
Yeah.
They reach a door and the guard ushers them through.
JERRY WOOLRIDGE stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
He's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
class or perhaps eighth-grade science.
GUARD
These are the people from that
newspaper deal.
WOOLRIDGE
Oh yeah, from the college?
MARSHA
Yes sir.
Woolridge shakes hands with them.
WOOLRIDGE
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
MARSHA
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha
Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans.
She's here to take the pictures.
WOOLRIDGE
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of
you?
MARSHA
Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE
I think there must have been a
little mix up. I told your sponsor
or teacher or whatever he is, there
couldn't be any pictures. It's
s'posed to be just a little story
or article or something, isn't that
right?
MARSHA
Well, yeah, it's for the school
newspaper. But it has pictures. I
mean it's a regular paper, you
know.
WOOLRIDGE
Karl's real sensitive about having
his picture made. He wouldn't even
be on the bulletin board for the
Easter Collage.
(to guard)
Melvin, would you get me a good hot
cup with two sugar substitutes? You
girls want some coffee?
MARSHA
No thank you.
WOOLRIDGE
The other thing is I told your boss
on the phone to send a man. Karl
won't talk to women.
CLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
monologue.
CHARLES
There was a young man named John
Liggit Hunter who was in the
filling station business and a good
filling station business. He was
one of those young men that we run
across so often in life. I'm sure
you've run across them, that didn't
deserve the things he had. One of
those things was his beautiful
bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
Peach. As a matter of fact she
looked more like the picture I've
had in my head than any woman I've
ever seen. I took it upon myself to
take her away from John Liggit
Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
not sure if I mentioned that he was
a Frenchman who claimed to be an
Englishman. It took some very
strong nylon cord to take her away
from him. She was a fighter as well
as a Georgia Peach.
The girls look confused.
WOOLRIDGE
I don't know what to tell you. I'm
sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
thought. He probably got busy and
wasn't thinking. I know how that
is. I used to teach shop and eighth
grade science.
MARSHA
Well, what do we do? We drove all
the way out here.
THERESA
Let's just go, Marsha.
MARSHA
No, we have to get this story.
THERESA
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
MARSHA
Why won't he talk to women?
WOOLRIDGE
He has problems. You know. With all
that. He won't hardly talk to
anybody really. Just certain
people. He's very troubled.
CHARLES
(leaning in to Karl)
A shovel just makes too goddamn
much racket.
WOOLRIDGE
(takes a drink of coffee)
I don't think he's talked to a
woman in twenty-five or so years.
That I know of anyway. That's why I
said to send a man. At least maybe
he'd answer a question or two for a
man. I'm all for helping the
college out, believe me. It might
be a real good article or story.
MARSHA
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk
him into it. I'm a real good
interviewer. Just get me in the
room with him.
WOOLRIDGE
(to guard)
Melvin, go get Karl and take him
down to the old classroom.
Woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway.
WOOLRIDGE
I'll talk to him and see what we
can do.
Woolridge is opening a door. He enters and the women follow
him in. He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
lights illuminate the room.
WOOLRIDGE
You see, Karl, growing up, only
knew that sex was wrong and that
people who did it should be killed
for it. He couldn't really read
but, well, neither could his
mother. But, his father made sure
that his mother knew what the Bible
said. And she made sure Karl knew.
You know he slept in a hole in the
ground under a toolshed, right?
MARSHA
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
WOOLRIDGE
His mother told him that he was
their punishment. Hers and his
father's; from God, for having sex--
MARSHA
Before they were married?
WOOLRIDGE
I don't think so. Just period, I
think. She told him... God gave
them the ugliest creation he could
think of. Karl has an entire book --
a notebook. On every page it says
"Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
1." He wrote that a few years ago
after he'd learned to write. His
father's name was Franklin.
MARSHA
That's really strange. What does it
mean?
WOOLRIDGE
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I
imagine. Y'all pull up a chair.
I'll go out and talk to him.
CLOSE UP on Charles's face.
CHARLES
You have to make something explode
to truly understand it. You have to
examine the tiny particles while
they're on fire.
Off screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and
see MELVIN the guard.
MELVIN
Karl, I gotta take you down to the
old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has
some people for you to see down
there. Come on. Let's go.
Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway. Woolridge stands
outside the door of the classroom. They reach him and
Woolridge talks quietly to Karl.
WOOLRIDGE
Karl, you know, do you remember
when I told you about those people
from that newspaper?
(pause)
They want to ask you some questions
about your release. They think it
would make an interesting story.
Will you talk to 'em? Get
interviewed.
(pause)
Now, they're women. I think it
might be good for you to. You're
gonna be seein' all kinds of people
when you go on the outside. This'll
help you I believe.
It's just Woolridge and the two women in the room.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, it surprised the dickens out
of me. He said he'll talk to you.
Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.
WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
But, here's the thing. He'll only
talk to you. He doesn't want you to
ask him anything. And you shouldn't
stare at him.
MARSHA
How am I going to conduct an
interview if I can't ask him any
questions?
WOOLRIDGE
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm
sorry.
MARSHA
Can I ask you a question? If he's
so troubled, why are you letting
him out? What if he does it again?
It happens all the time.
WOOLRIDGE
He's free. His time's up. That's
the rules. He's been treated and
reevaluated. He doesn't show any
signs any more.
MARSHA
Signs?
WOOLRIDGE
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna
change the light in here for Karl.
I hope you can see to write.
Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in.
In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
for Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless.
Woolridge whispers to Theresa.
WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
You'll have to step outside.
Theresa starts to protest.
WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
Please.
Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at
the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing
strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like
forever.
Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other.
THERESA
Can I just sneak in there? I won't
take any pictures, I promise. I
just want to listen.
MELVIN
No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.
Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light
it.
MELVIN (CONT'D)
You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry.
Marsha is staring at Karl. Karl, still breathing and rubbing
his palms, starts to speak. His voice is low and raspy, but
not just low and raspy; strange.
KARL
Well, I reckon what you're a
wanting to know is what I'm doing
in here. I reckon the reason I'm in
here is 'cause I killed somebody.
But I reckon what you was a wanting
to know is how come me to kill
somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
at the front and tell you.
(pause, heavy breathing)
I lived most of my life out behind
my mother and father's house in a
little old shed and my daddy'd
built for me. They didn't too much
want me up there in the house with
the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
around out there in the shed all
the time a lookin' at the ground.
It didn't have no floor but I had
me a hole dug out to lay down in
and a quilt or tow that I put down
there.
(pause, more breathing)
My daddy was a hard workin' man
most of his life, not that I can
say the same fer myself. I most
just set around the shed and
tinkered around with a lawn mower
or two and went to school off and
on from time to time but the
children there made quite a bit of
sport of me, made fun of me quite a
bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
sometimes so mostly I stayed out
back there in the shed. My daddy
worked down at the sawmill there,
down there at the planer mill for
an old man named Dixon.
Old man Dixon was a very cruel
feller, he didn't treat his
employees very well, didn't pay 'em
much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
much of a wage, just barely enough
to get by on. But I reckon he got
by all right, they come out one or
the other of 'em, usually my
mother, and fed me pretty regular.
At least I know he made enough for
me to have mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week. Old man
Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
Jesse was really more cruel than
his daddy. He made quite a bit of
sport of me and takened advantage
of the little girls around the
neighborhood quite a bit.
(pause)
He used to say my mother was a very
pretty woman. He said it quite a
bit from time to time, when I was
at the school house. Well, I reckon
you want me to get on and tell you
what happened so I reckon I'll tell
you. I was settin' out in the shed
one evenin' not doin' too much,
just kindly starin' at the wall and
a waitin' fer my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson and I
heared a commotion up in the house
there so I got up and run up on the
screened-in porch there to see what
was a goin' on, and I looked in the
kitchen window and I seen my mother
a layin' there on the floor without
any clothes on.
(pause, breathing)
And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
top of her having his way with her.
(pause)
Well, I just seen red. I picked up
a kaiser blade that was a layin'
there by the screen door, some
folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
long handle like a axe handle with
a long blade on it that's shaped
kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
edge and dull on the other. It's
what the highway boys use to cut
down weeds and whatnot.
I went in the kitchen there and I
hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
with it and knocked him off my
mother. I reckon that didn't quite
satisfy me so I hit him again in
the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut his head off.
Killed him. Well, my mother, she
jumped up from there and started
yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
(pause, intense breathing)
Well, come to find out my mother
didn't really mind what Jesse was a
doin' to her. I reckon that made me
madder than what Jesse had made me.
I takened the kaiser blade, some
folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade and hit my
mother up side the head with it an'
killed her.
(long pause, breathing)
Some folks has asked me if I had it
to do over again would I do the
same thing. I don't know, I reckon
I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
put me in here and here I've been
for a great long while. I've
learned to read some; took me four
years to read the Bible. I reckon I
understand a good deal of it. It
wasn't what I expected in a lot of
places. I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while. They've
seen fit to put me out now. They
tell me they're a settin' me free
today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
you need to know. If you want any
more details I reckon I can tell
'em to you. I don't know if that's
enough for your newspaper or not.
Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.
MARSHA
Will you ever kill anybody again,
Karl?
This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions
for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He
breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems
almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view
we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking
straight at Marsha.
KARL
(slowly)
I don't reckon I got no reason to
kill nobody.
Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha
and Theresa. Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin.
MARSHA
Is he leaving right this minute?
WOOLRIDGE
We've got some paperwork to take
care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry,
you won't run into him in the
parking lot.
MARSHA
I didn't mean that.
WOOLRIDGE
I hope the best for you, Miss
Dwiggins, with your school and your
paper and all.
MARSHA
Where will he go?
WOOLRIDGE
Wherever he wants to. I think he's
going back to Millsburg where he's
from. It's just about twenty miles
from here.
MARSHA
Will he be supervised?
WOOLRIDGE
As much as anybody else is, I
guess. Y'all have a good rest of
the day now.
Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he
speaks to Marsha.
KARL
(looking down)
Thank you.
MARSHA
(immediately extends her
hand)
Thank you.
Karl doesn't take her hand.
Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.
KARL
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to looking at pretty people.
WOOLRIDGE
Yes, I guess you are.
KARL
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to them lookin' at me, too.
WOOLRIDGE
You better go get your things.
KARL
I ain't got nothing but them books.
WOOLRIDGE
You better go get 'em.
KARL
All right then.
Karl walks slowly down the hallway.
Karl stands at the counter. A middle-aged man is selling
tickets.
KARL
How does a feller go about gettin'
up to the state hospital?
MAN
You buy a ticket for fourteen
dollars and then set and wait for
the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.
KARL
All right then.
Karl walks down the hallway carrying his books. A couple
staffers give him 'Why are you still here' looks. He reaches
a door and goes in.
There is no one at the desk in the outer office, so Karl goes
into Woolridge's office.
Karl finds Woolridge doing paper work. Woolridge looks up
startled.
WOOLRIDGE
Karl, what in the world are you
doing here?
KARL
I want to come back and stay here.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, you can't do that. You're a
free man. You've been let out to do
as you please.
KARL
I reckon I don't care nothin' about
bein' a free man. I don't know how
to go about it.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, you have to learn. It'll take
some time. Don't you know anybody
down there to help you out?
KARL
Naw.
WOOLRIDGE
Your daddy's still livin' down
there from what you told me.
(pause)
I guess he wouldn't help you any,
would he? I wasn't thinking. You
don't know anybody?
KARL
Naw. Never did know too much of
nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
WOOLRIDGE
(sighs)
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't
know where they expect you to go or
what they expect you to do. If it
was up to me, I'd let you stay here
if that's what you wanted. I'm just
doin' my job.
(they sit in silence for a
moment)
You follow me?
(no answer)
Listen, I know an old boy that runs
a fix-it shop deal down in
Millsburg. He used to go to church
with me. You're good workin' on
small engines and things. If I put
my neck out for you with him, will
you work at it if he'll hire you?
KARL
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn
mowers and whatnot.
WOOLRIDGE
I know, I've seen it myself. Would
you give that a try?
KARL
I reckon.
WOOLRIDGE
I can't promise he'll hire you.
I'll have to tell him about your
history.
KARL
I never was no good with history.
WOOLRIDGE
No, I mean your past. About why you
were in here.
(pause)
I'll take you first thing in the
mornin'. You have anyplace you can
stay tonight at all?
I just can't let you stay here.
It's the rules. If something
happened well, I'd be liable.
KARL
I reckon I can just walk around
till the mornin'. Or set and read
me a book somewhere.
They sit and stare at each other for a moment.
Woolridge, his WIFE, his teenage SON, BUBBA, and teenage
DAUGHTER sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely
uncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge
of a chair looking at the floor. After a long creepy moment,
Mom speaks.
MRS. WOOLRIDGE
Karl, would you like a muffin?
KARL
No thank ye.
MRS. WOOLRIDGE
I understand Jerry is going to take
you somewhere else tomorrow.
KARL
I don't reckon I know nobody name
Jerry.
WOOLRIDGE
She's talkin' about me, Karl.
That's my first name.
KARL
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work
in Millsburg where I was borned.
MRS. WOOLRIDGE
Would you like some coffee?
KARL
Coffee makes me a might nervous
when I drink it.
DAUGHTER
Daddy, can I be excused to go to
bed?
WOOLRIDGE
Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama
tonight. I'll sleep with your
brother and Karl can take your
room.
DAUGHTER
Why?
WOOLRIDGE
We have company. Now you go on.
It's an all-American girls room. Everything is pink. There
are stuffed animals everywhere and posters of pop idols.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, Karl, there's plenty of
blankets and things there.
Bathroom's right there in the hall.
We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books.
Woolridge closes the door.
Woolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the
table.
MRS. WOOLRIDGE
Jerry, why didn't you give him
Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of
girly, isn't it?
WOOLRIDGE
Yeah, I thought about that. No
sense in moving him now I guess.
BUBBA
Daddy, don't you think one of us
ought to stay up all night and kind
of - guard or somethin'?
WOOLRIDGE
Why, hell no, son. What's wrong
with you?
BUBBA
Well, he's crazy. He's a nut ain't
he?
MRS. WOOLRIDGE
'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't.
Woolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down
the hallway. He knocks on the bedroom door.
WOOLRIDGE
Karl, you up?
KARL (O.S.)
Yes sir.
Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the
edge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed
still as it was the night before.
WOOLRIDGE
Didn't you go to sleep at all,
Karl? You been sittin' there like
that all night?
KARL
Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, I guess we better hit the
road.
Woolridge's car pulls into the parking lot. He and Karl get
out and walk toward the shop.
Two men, BILL COX, a large man in his forties, and SCOOTER
HODGES, a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up
from behind the counter as Woolridge and Karl enter.
Woolridge goes to the counter, Karl stands by the door
looking at the floor.
BILL
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to
see you. Been a long time.
WOOLRIDGE
Good to see you, Bill. How's
everybody doin'?
BILL
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'
me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put
me in the poorhouse. Can't complain
other than that. Wouldn't do any
good if I did.
(laughs)
Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
WOOLRIDGE
No, don't guess I do.
(he shakes hands with
Scooter who sort of
smiles)
Scooter, good to meet you.
(Woolridge leans in and
gets confidential)
This is him, the one I talked to
you about on the phone. Now like I
said, I'll understand if you get
nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie
to you now, he did get in that
trouble but then he was real young.
BILL
I remember it real well. Cut them
folks to pieces. His mama one of
'em.
SCOOTER
And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I
always wanted to kill him myself.
Asshole's what he was. I remember
that ol' boy
(points to Karl)
too. Kind of retarded or somethin'
back in school.
WOOLRIDGE
Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted
these days. I don't think he'd ever
hurt anybody.
BILL
Don't look much like he could. You
say he can fix a small engine like
nobody's bidness.
WOOLRIDGE
He's a regular whiz at it. That's
all he did when he was a kid.
BILL
Well, I ain't scared of him workin'
here. You know me. I'm a church
goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your
time's up the Lord's gonna come git
you. You seared of him, Scooter?
SCOOTER
I don't guess. Can he talk?
WOOLRIDGE
Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate
it. He needs the job. I don't know
what to do with him. He don't have
anybody really.
BILL
That old man of his still livin'
over there on Clark Street I
believe.
WOOLRIDGE
He won't have anything to do with
him. Now you say it's all right for
him to stay out here in the back?
BILL
Fine with me. If he steals
anything, I'll take it out of your
pocket anyway.
Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with
laughter.
WOOLRIDGE
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you
he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps
to himself.
BILL
Well, I've got a roomful of work
for him to do. Can't get Scooter to
do any of it.
WOOLRIDGE
Karl, come over here. I want you to
meet your new boss.
(Karl obediently shuffles
over)
This is Bill Cox, runs this place.
Says you can work here and stay in
the back.
BILL
Good to know you, Karl.
KARL
Thank ye.
BILL
Now it's minimal wage and there
ain't nothin' but a army cot and a
toilet back there.
Karl doesn't say anything.
WOOLRIDGE
That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to
the car and get your books.
Woolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl
stares at the floor.
BILL
They say you're a whiz on fixin'
lawn mowers and things.
KARL
I've tinkered around on 'em a
little bit.
BILL
We order from Dairy Queen at
noontime usually. We can buy your
lunch till you get on your feet a
little.
KARL
I like them french-fried potaters.
BILL
(long pause)
Yeah, me too.
SCOOTER
They make a good double meat
burger.
The place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and
other equipment, most of it in pieces. A small cot is in a
little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. Karl is
sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while Scooter
puts some tools away. Bill comes to the door.
BILL
All right then, I'll see y'all
later. Karl you done a good day's
work. They right about you.
Scooter, he's gonna knock you out
of a job if you're not careful.
I'll see you tomorrow.
SCOOTER
Wait up, I'll leave with you and
lock up.
BILL
Karl, they's a blanket up in under
that cot and soap in the bathroom
to clean up with.
(pause)
Now there's one more thing. The way
we lock these doors at night, you
can't get out. You didn't want to
go anywhere, did you?
KARL
I don't reckon.
BILL
If it works out and all, maybe
we'll get you a key so you can get
out at night if you need to. See
you later.
They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He
sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a
moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.
It's lunch time and Bill, Scooter, and Karl are sitting in
folding chairs behind the counter eating from their Dairy
Queen to-go bags. Karl has french fries.
BILL
Scooter, did I tell about the two
old boys pissin' off the bridge?
SCOOTER
I can't remember.
BILL
There was these two old boys hung
their peckers off of a bridge to
piss, one old boy from California
and one old boy from Arkansas.
Old boy from California says, "Boy
this water's cold." Old boy from
Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep
too."
(starts wheezing)
Get it? That's a goodun.
SCOOTER
(laughing)
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe
you did tell me that one before.
I've heard that a bunch. Long time
ago.
BILL
Well, yeah it's a classic. You
know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about
it last night and it's just not
Christian of me to not let you have
a key. I mean you been in lockup so
long, you don't need me keepin' you
locked up. You need to come and go
as you please. Here, take this key,
it'll get you in and out that back
door.
(Karl takes the key and
keeps eating french
fries)
Them french fries good?
KARL
Yeah, they's good all right.
BILL
You got any money?
KARL
They give me fifty dollars when
they turned me loose. I spent up
some of it on ridin' the bus and
eatin' french-fried potaters.
BILL
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for
this comin' week, so you'll have
some walkin' around money. When you
get off this evenin' you better go
buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up
supplies to have back there. Some
hard candy and some magazines.
Somethin' to keep you busy at
night.
KARL
All right then.
BILL
I'll let you off while it's still
daylight.
Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded
store. It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart. They find
Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
Ben's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some
mouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her
thirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,
with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging
over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys
approach.
FRANK
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
LINDA
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
VAUGHAN
Let me guess. You want a bunch of
candy and a pop.
FRANK
Yeah.
VAUGHAN
You're gonna rot your teeth that
way. But I bet I know what you
would like even better.
I put potted meat on special, four
cans for a dollar and they're not
moving very well. I'd sure let a
few cans go for free to the right
boy.
FRANK
I don't like potted meat. Daddy
used to say it was made out of lips
and peckers and intestints.
LINDA
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's
that strange lookin' man behind
you? Did he follow you in here?
VAUGHAN
Can I help you, sir?
FRANK
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the
laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama.
And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager.
He lets mama off any time she feels
like it 'cause they're best
friends.
LINDA
Nice to meet you, Karl.
KARL
(keeping his distance)
Pleased to know y'all.
There's an uncomfortable silence.
LINDA
Frank come back here with me for a
minute.
She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.
VAUGHAN
I don't think I've ever seen you
before.
KARL
Naw, I don't believe you have. I
don't reckon I never been in here.
This store didn't used to be here.
VAUGHAN
It's been here seventeen years. Did
you live here before or something?
KARL
I's horned and raised here up till
I's twelve year old.
VAUGHAN
What brings you back?
KARL
What's that you say?
VAUGHAN
Why are you here now?
KARL
They turned me loose from the state
hospital.
VAUGHAN
Is that right?
(pause)
Are you going to be staying here
long?
KARL
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired
on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
VAUGHAN
Do you have family here?
KARL
Not really to speak of.
Linda and Frank return from the back.
FRANK
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you
can stay with us. Out in the
garage. Our car won't fit in there
anyway. It's real neat.
LINDA
Frank told me about your situation.
And Frank loves company. You know,
especially after his daddy passed
and all. There ain't no sense in
you stayin' in that old greasy
shop.
(to Vaughan, hushed)
He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
VAUGHAN
(hushed)
He just got out of the state
hospital.
LINDA
(put out)
I know.
FRANK
Can we get some candy and pops?
VAUGHAN
Sure, go ahead.
They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little
puzzled.
VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
Are you sure it's safe to let him
around that guy?
LINDA
Frank's just crazy about him. He
likes the way he talks. He helped
him carry home the clean laundry.
VAUGHAN
He's been in the state hospital a
long time, something must be wrong
with him.
LINDA
He's retarded's all. You know he's
always after a father figure and
Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
with his mean ass.
VAUGHAN
What about me?
LINDA
I don't think he sees you as a guy
guy.
VAUGHAN
(wrinkles his brow)
Karl is a guy guy?
Karl is tying the strap around his books. His sack of
toiletries is on the bed. Bill Cox comes in.
BILL
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go
stay with these folks? You're
welcome to keep on stayin here.
It's workin' out real good.
KARL
That boy wants me to.
BILL
All right then. I'll see you bright
and early. How you comin' along on
that garden tiller?
KARL
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty
good.
BILL
You done fixed it? I'll be damned.
Scooter told me it couldn't be
fixed.
'Course Scooter's about as shitless
as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.
You done fixed it. I'll just be
damned. See you tomorrow.
DOYLE is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle
drinking beer. He's in his late thirties and dressed in his
construction clothes. Linda sits on the arm of the chair and
Frank stands before them.
DOYLE
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a
shit. I ain't here half the time
anyway. If you want a retard livin'
in the garage, I don't guess I
care. I've got a good tool box and
socket set out there I don't want
stol'd. I guess I could take it
home with me.
FRANK
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal
nothin'.
DOYLE
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you,
was I?
(pause)
Was I?
FRANK
No sir.
DOYLE
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your
mama. This is your mama's decision,
not yours. I'm lettin' it go on
because she asked me, not you.
(to Linda)
Now is this the kind of retard that
drools and rubs shit in his hair
and all that, 'cause I have trouble
eatin' around that kind of thing.
Just like I am about antique
furniture and midgets. I can't so
much as drink a glass of water
around a midget or a piece of
antique furniture. Same thing with
a droolin' retard.
LINDA
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't
be that way.
DOYLE
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just
tellin' the truth. What was he in
the nuthouse for?
LINDA
He's just mentally retarded, I
guess.
DOYLE
He had of went nuts and did
somethin'. They don't put you in
there for just bein' a retard.
They's retards all over the place
that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you
know, Frank?
FRANK
I ain't sure.
DOYLE
You might want to find out. He
might of hacked his family to
pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
LINDA
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you
better ask him. I mean, don't hurt
his feelin's or anything, but it
would be good to know. I'm sure
it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
DOYLE
You sure are hung up on people
bein' sweet.
(takes a long pull on his
beer)
Speakin' of which, where's your
girlfriend? I thought he was comin'
by here for something.
LINDA
He'll be here in a little while,
he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
DOYLE
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What
am I supposed to do about supper
with you traipsin' around with that
fag?
LINDA
You're not crippled. Get in there
and make somethin'.
DOYLE
Boy, ain't you somethin' else.
Talkin' back and everything. It
kinda makes me horny when you talk
back.
LINDA
Frank, why don't you go off and
play in your room if Doyle's gonna
talk nasty.
FRANK
I want to watch T.V.
DOYLE
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V.
Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a
family till your retarded friend
and your homosexual friend gets
here.
Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa. Doyle
looks up and grins.
LINDA
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
KARL
Tolerable, I reckon.
LINDA
(in a hurry to get out)
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.
Frank, why don't you and Karl go
out in the garage and fix him up a
place or play a game or somethin'.
Vaughan, you ready to go?
VAUGHAN
Sure, I guess.
DOYLE
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
She starts to get her things together.
LINDA
(to Frank)
Maybe you and Karl want to go with
us?
FRANK
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl
got things we need to do.
DOYLE
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I
heard? I heard you been puttin' it
to Albert Sellers that works over
at the funeral home.
VAUGHAN
I know Albert. We're friends.
DOYLE
I heard you was more than friends.
I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all
all bowed up and goin' at it in the
same room with poor, little, old
Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a
doornail layed out on a gurney.
VAUGHAN
That's ridiculous. That's just a
total lie.
LINDA
Let's go, Vaughan.
(they start for the door)
Frank, we'll be back in a little
while. I'll bring you back
somethin'. You're food's in the
oven warmin' over.
DOYLE
See, you made him somethin'. Hey
Vaughan, I was just goin' on with
you, jokin' around, buddy.
VAUGHAN
(smiles a little)
Yeah, I knew that. You're a card
all right.
Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave.
DOYLE
So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to
me.
Karl sits on the couch.
FRANK
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the
garage.
DOYLE
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man.
You set right there, Karl.
Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
What's in your bag?
KARL
This and that. Toothpaste and
whatnot.
DOYLE
What's all them books?
KARL
Different ones. The Bible's one of
'em.
DOYLE
You believe in the Bible?
KARL
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't
understand all of it.
DOYLE
Well, I can't understand none of
it. This one begat this one and
that one begat this one and begat
and begat and begat and lo somebody
sayeth some shit or another. Just
how retarded are you?
FRANK
Stop it, Doyle!
DOYLE
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'.
The adults are talkin'. Were you in
the lockup for cuttin' somebody up
with a hatchet?
KARL
I ain't never used no hatchet that
I remember.
DOYLE
You're just crazy in a retarded
kind of way then.
(pause)
It wouldn't matter to me if you did
do violence on somebody 'cause I
ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm
afraid for you to stay here. You're
just a humped over retard it looks
like to me. Not really, I'm just
jokin' with you. Welcome to our
humble home, buddy. Frank needs all
the friends he can get. Frank's a
real weak little kid. His daddy
taught him how to be a pussy.
FRANK
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about
daddy, you hear me!
DOYLE
(mocking)
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on
to the garage and let me be.
Frank is crying now.
FRANK
Come on, Karl.
They get up and walk away.
DOYLE
(yelling to Frank)
Don't tell your mama we had a
little spat. She don't need to be
worried with your ass.
Karl sits on an old sofa and Frank sits on an upside down
paint bucket, still upset.
FRANK
I'd like to kill that son of a
bitch. I hate him.
KARL
You ort not to talk that way.
You're just a boy.
FRANK
Well, I hate him.
KARL
He ort not to talk that away to you
neither. He ain't no count. He's
mean to you and your mama.
(pause)
Yore mama and that feller that's
carryin' me to get somethin'
d'eat's gonna be back here
directly.
FRANK
Will you stay here with us for a
long time?
KARL
I reckon if you want me to.
(pause)
I got some of that potted meat and
sodie crackers left over if you
want some.
FRANK
I don't see how you can eat that
stuff with all those insides it's
made out of.
KARL
I reckon it tastes pretty good to
me.
FRANK
I like the way you talk.
KARL
I like the way you talk.
Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight
as we:
DISSOLVE TO:
Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a
table and they sit and immediately start to eat. After a few
bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.
VAUGHAN
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought
you here was to talk to you about
something that is on my mind.
(pauses for a response,
instead Karl eats french
fries and stares at the
table)
I guess I'll put it right out on
the table. Where do I start. Linda
and Frank are very important to me.
They're like family. My own family
was never like family. They're
horrible people. As a matter of
fact I prayed every night for years
that my father would die. I finally
realized through a lot of therapy
that I was wasting my energy on
hating him. Now I just don't care.
(pause)
You see, you and I are a lot alike,
strange as that may seem. I mean
not physically or even mentally
really, just well, maybe
emotionally or actually the hand
we've been dealt in life. We're
different. People see us as being
different anyway. You're -- well
you have your affliction or
whatever and I, well mine's not as
easy to see. I'm just going to say
it. I'm gay.
(watts)
Does that surprise you?
(watts)
That I'm gay. You know what being
gay is, don't you?
KARL
I reckon not.
VAUGHAN
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
KARL
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
VAUGHAN
Well that's a very offensive way to
put it. You shouldn't say that. You
were taught that, weren't you?
KARL
I've heard it said that way.
VAUGHAN
Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
that's the right way to say it, in
a small town like this. I've wanted
to leave many times, but my love
for Linda and Frank and another
certain person that we won't go
into have kept me from it. Anyway,
I'm rambling. If you're going to
live in the Wheatly garage you need
to know that it won't be easy.
Doyle is a monster. Not just a
closed minded redneck, but a
monster. A dangerous person. I've
told Linda that one day that man is
going to really hurt her or that
boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
see it in his eyes. I'm very in
tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
will make your life hell. You're a
perfect target. When I first saw
you I was afraid of you. Not really
afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
But also, I felt a real sensitive
feeling from you. And for some
reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean it like that. In a good
way. Anyway, I just want you to
know what you're in for. I have a
good feeling about you. You're good
for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
have an adult friend on a child's
level.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
bad way.
(pause)
There's one more thing. It's none
of my business why you were in the
state hospital. Everyone has
something in their past, maybe you
tried suicide, maybe you did
something -- terrible. But what I
see before me is a gentle, simple
man. All I want you to promise me
is that you're capable of being
around Linda and Frank. You know.
You would never hurt them under any
circumstances, would you?
KARL
I wouldn't never hurt them.
VAUGHAN
That's what I thought. I hope I
haven't offended you in any way.
You seem like a thinker. You seem
to always be in deep thought. Tell
me something. What are you thinking
right now?
Karl looks up and stares for a moment.
KARL
I was thinkin' I could use me
another helpin' of these potaters.
VAUGHAN
Oh. How about before that?
KARL
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be
good if I could get another three
or four cans of that potted meat if
you got any extry.
Linda, Frank, and Doyle are eating.
LINDA
How come Karl won't eat here with
us?
FRANK
I don't know. He just said he'd eat
out there.
DOYLE
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
LINDA
I just feel sorry for the poor
thing.
DOYLE
Who could eat with him settin'
there makin' that goddamn racket
with his throat.
LINDA
He does make some funny noises.
FRANK
I sure like the way he talks. It
sounds like a race car motor
idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
LINDA
I'm glad of it, honey.
DOYLE
What have you got to be nervous
about? You're a damn kid. You ain't
got any bills to pay or bidness to
run or old lady to stay on your ass
all the time.
FRANK
I get nervous, that's all I know.
They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where
this conversation could lead and know when to leave well
enough alone.
DOYLE
You know what, by God?
LINDA
What?
DOYLE
You know what we ought to do
tonight?
LINDA
Please Doyle, don't.
DOYLE
Have a damn party! Call Morris and
them and get the band together and
just party our asses off. I'd like
to show that fuckin' Karl to the
guys. They'd get a kick out of
that. Don't you know they would.
LINDA
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not
up for it. They always stay till
mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
DOYLE
You don't have to do anything but
pour some potato chips in a bowl
and bring beers out when we get
low.
FRANK
Last time you got mad and run
Morris and them off and said to
stay away from here.
DOYLE
That ain't none of your damn
bidness. Besides that's the way
friends do one another. Fuck it,
I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find
my guitar, I think it's out there
in the garage with that loony tune.
Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him.
Frank and Linda come through the door. Frank comes and sits
beside Karl. Linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and
comes over and stands in front of Karl.
LINDA
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be
a party tonight here at the house.
Doyle's invited his music-playin'
buddies over to make a bunch of
racket out on the patio.
FRANK
They ain't even no good. The only
one can play is Randy
Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
Indian. His real name's Randy
Collins and he works at the feed
mill. He can at least play guitar.
LINDA
He's no more an Indian than I am
though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
and tease you and be mean to you to
show off to his friends. Just like
he does to Frank and me sometimes.
You just ignore it. Or stay out
here away from 'em if he'll let
you. He's an okay guy till he gets
drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
I guarantee it.
FRANK
He ain't ever okay to me.
The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really
happy.
DOYLE
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.
Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to
get over here. I'd like him to be
here. I owe him a good time.
LINDA
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to
come to a party with you.
DOYLE
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done
called him. He'll be here.
(grins)
Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I
need you to help me ice down a tub
of beer, you and Frank.
White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. Karl
sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up on
the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in a
military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in a
wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who's
not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't
play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a ZZ
Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them.
They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've
obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to
address the 'crowd.'
DOYLE
Okay ladies and gentlemen
(points to Vaughan)
or both. It's come to the time in
our show when we like to introduce
the band. Over here on lead guitar
Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on
hit a hot lick, Randy.
(Randy plays a lick)
Well, come on, y'all are supposed
to clap now. Come on!
(they clap a little except
for Karl)
ANGLE ON LINDA
LINDA
Karl, you better clap your hands or
he'll just keep on.
Karl claps his hands a little.
DOYLE
On the bass, give it up for Terence
"One Ball" Atkins.
(more half-assed clapping)
On the tambourine and lyrics Morris
Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
group.
(claps)
On drums "The Johnson."
(claps)
And last and most importantly,
Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar
and business affairs and the only
motherfucker with a truck big
enough to haul this outfit on the
next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a
big hand for these guys. They're
workin' their asses off here.
(pauses for a slug of
beer)
Okay I'd like to dedicate this next
one to some very special people in
our audience tonight. To my lovely
female companion Linda, her lovely
son Frank, our new boarder Karl -
what's your last name Karl?
KARL
Childers.
DOYLE
Karl Childers just in from the
state facility. Make one of them
gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it
is you do.
(nothing)
Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,
he don't know what the hell I'm
talkin' about. And to Vaughan who
fucks a mortician in the rear
entrance right in front of his
clients. Now that takes balls. Our
number one tune for the folks,
boys. Kick it off Johnson!
They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in
motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler
and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
You like that Vaughan?
VAUGHAN
Sure. It sounded like a number one
tune all right.
DOYLE
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
KARL
I reckon.
We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near
distance.
VOICE (O.S.)
I wished you all would lay off for
tonight. I can't hear myself think
for that racket. It's nighttime,
now let folks be! I'll call the
law!
DOYLE
(hollers back)
I told you already three times, the
laws on my side. I play cards with
J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.
Get fucked you old bastard!
(to the party)
Okay now, Linda, you and the kid
clean up and get a tarpaulin over
this instruments. Me and the boys
are goin' to the county line.
We're out of liquor and beer. Come
on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'
with us.
VAUGHAN
I'd better go on home now, it's
late. I have to work tomorrow.
DOYLE
Come on, don't be a pussy.
Everybody has to work.
LINDA
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go
Vaughan if you don't want to.
You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
DOYLE
(very sincere)
But honey, I'll be good. I promise.
I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'
to help these two be part of
things.
Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the
window. Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
tape. The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play.
VAUGHAN
Are you sure you can drive? You've
really had a lot of alcohol.
DOYLE
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
goes louder.
DOYLE
(points to tape player)
Not that you afflicted sons of
bitches would know anything about
it, but this is art.
They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls
up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
the passenger side and turns down the music.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I
seen your pitcher in the paper for
catchin' that big-ass bass.
FREDDY
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't
drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
DOYLE
Yeah.
FREDDY
I figured that. Well you better be
careful with that cripple in the
back. You'll throw him out. Looks
like you got a wagonful.
DOYLE
We run outta somethin' to drink.
Goin' to the county line. You want
to race?
FREDDY
(laughing)
You know better than that. We're on
duty. Catch me in that Camaro next
week one night.
DOYLE
Catch you later Freddy!
Doyle peels out and the music blares again.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
I bet you like sittin' between two
men in a dual wheel truck don't
you?
VAUGHAN
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
DOYLE
Sarcastic right?
(pause)
You know the boys in the band are
probably gonna stay over tonight.
We'd be glad to have you.
Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
which has obviously been going on for awhile.
MORRIS
Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
me on those particular points, but
it's not really important in the
smaller picture, which is where
most people dwell anyway. Not that
being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
is insignificant. Or that making it
through years of incarceration in a
state supported facility is any
small feat.
THE JOHNSON
Morris, he's the only one in the
band that went to college.
RANDY
I'm in junior college right now
over in Westfield.
THE JOHNSON
That ain't no college, that's trade
school. Auto repair ain't ever made
a genius out of nobody.
MORRIS
Holidays are for campers.
RANDY
What do you know about bein' a
genius, Johnson. You can't even
hardly keep a steady beat on that
high-price drum set.
TERENCE
I think y'all play really tight
together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't
throw off on one another.
MORRIS
Anything that has to be discussed
can't mean anything.
DOYLE
You got that shit right.
VAUGHAN
What exactly do you mean by that? I
don't understand.
MORRIS
Exactly the point, my young
levelheaded friend.
VAUGHAN
I don't get it.
MORRIS
I rest my case.
TERENCE
Morris is real smart with
philosophies and things. That's why
him and me are the songwriting team
of our group. I make up good tunes
or melodies as we call them and
Morris is the lyrics.
MORRIS
Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
Protocol Harum.
RANDY
We don't ever play any songs that
y'all wrote. I never even heard one
of 'em. Y'all just talk.
THE JOHNSON
We don't even play any songs with
words at all that I remember. We
ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or
speaker set up.
TERENCE
We wrote one last night standin'
outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
Then, you know, like on country
songs in parenthesis it says "There
is usually someone in the trunk." I
came up with a tune just humming.
DOYLE
See Vaughan, you shouldn't question
a genius. Morris is a modern day
poet like in the old days.
MORRIS
Our latest composition is as
follows: entitled:
"The Thrill" --
"I stand on the hill
Not for a thrill
but for a breath
of a fresh kill
Never mind the man
who contemplates
doing away with license plates
He stands alone anyway
Baking the cookies of discontent
By the heat of a laundrymat vent
Leaving his soul"
(Then like in poetry I have dot dot
dot then drop down to the next line
kind of off center.)
"Leaving his soul parting waters
Under the medulla oblongata
of (then dot dot dot again)
mankind."
Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
something other than Morris.
TERENCE
I don't think that's right. I
believe dot dot dot come between
medulla and oblongata or something
like that.
(Morris stares at him)
Well it did. It wadn't before
mankind, I know that much.
MORRIS
The dots are where I say they are.
Melody and tune. That's your trade.
You're a tunesmith Terence.
VAUGHAN
I don't really understand the
meaning of the words.
DOYLE
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go
out of my mind. And plus you're
liable to bust a spring in Karl's
head. He's already off balance.
TERENCE
That wadn't the way you made it up
before, Morris. That's all I know.
RANDY
We don't need fancy words, we need
to practice. We don't ever
rehearse.
THE JOHNSON
We need some payin' gigs instead of
just messin' around on first one
patio and then another'n.
RANDY
Morris, you should just be the
manager, you can't play nothin'
anyway.
Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
window. He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
madman in a flash.
DOYLE
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all
just shut the fuck up! We don't
need no practicin' or managers
cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
Morris ain't no genius and the rest
of you are just losers. Am I the
only one sane human bein' around
here? Just get the hell out of my
house and don't come back!
VAUGHAN
It's not your house, Doyle, it's
Linda's.
DOYLE
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
You mind your own business. Now get
out! Now, before I get too mad to
turn back.
TERENCE
What about our instruments?
Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes
him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down
the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.
DOYLE
Now!
They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
frozen on the sofa.
THE JOHNSON
(turning back)
You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's
wrong with you. Nobody needs your
shit.
MORRIS
(stops at the door)
The dots just look good on paper.
You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
showing your true Aries colors now.
DOYLE
Get out of my goddamn face, you
fuckin' buzzard!
He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
the doorway.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
I thought I told everybody to get
out of my house. That includes
cocksuckers and retards. Get off
your asses and go.
LINDA
This is not your house, Doyle. This
is my house and I'll say who stays
and goes. You've got a house, why
don't you go get one of your
girlfriends and go home to it.
DOYLE
You know better than to talk like
that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make
me knock the piss out of you.
VAUGHAN
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on
her.
DOYLE
That's funny.
(to Linda)
You go to bed and take snot nose
with you.
Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets
up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.
LINDA
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go
get sober before you come back. I'm
tired of my child seein' this. Now
you get yourself straight or I'll
lock your ass out of my life for
good.
DOYLE
You know what I told you, you even
think of leavin' me, I'll kill you
dead as a doornail.
LINDA
That might be better than this.
VAUGHAN
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten
her life.
DOYLE
I thought I told you to keep out!
LINDA
Leave.
DOYLE
Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA
Leave.
DOYLE
Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA
Leave.
DOYLE
Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA
Leave.
DOYLE
(an inch from her face)
Don't tell me what to do.
She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty
cans, bottles, a lampstand.
He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to
the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost
pitiful.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
Everything's botherin' me, that's
all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
FRANK
I hate you!
DOYLE
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.
I love your mama. Nobody
understands what I go through. I'll
leave. You bunch of freaks have
fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.
I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,
really.
(to Frank)
You ever hit me again you little
bastard and I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your
little ass out.
He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as
does Vaughan.
FRANK
You all right, Mama?
LINDA
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and
forget about tonight.
FRANK
We don't need to think bad
thoughts, do we Mama?
LINDA
No, honey, we don't.
(pause)
I'll make some coffee and start
cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you
want some coffee, huh?
KARL
No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me
nervous when I drink it.
DISSOLVE TO:
Linda cleaning up the last of the mess. Frank comes in sleepy
eyed in his pajamas.
LINDA
What are you doin' up again, Frank?
You need to get a little sleep.
FRANK
Did Vaughan go home?
LINDA
Yeah, he has to go to work in a
little while. I do too.
FRANK
Did Karl go to bed?
LINDA
I guess. He went to the garage.
Poor thing, he's probably never
seen such a crazy mess. He probably
wants to go back and live in Mr.
Cox's shop.
FRANK
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
LINDA
I know he does.
FRANK
Mama?
LINDA
Huh?
FRANK
Is everything gonna be all right
someday? I just stay nervous all
the time just about.
LINDA
Yeah, honey, someday everything's
gonna be all right.
FRANK
Doyle wouldn't really kill you,
would he?
LINDA
I promise we're gonna get away from
him. The time has to be right,
that's all. I'd rather him get
tired of me and leave me. Then he
wouldn't want to hurt me. He
wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.
I promise. You go to bed now.
(she hugs him)
I love you.
FRANK
I love you, too, Mama.
He goes to his room.
Linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and
sits at the table. After a moment, she looks up and is
startled to see Karl in the doorway.
LINDA
You scared me.
KARL
I didn't aim to.
LINDA
Want to sit down? Did you need
somethin'?
KARL
No ma'am.
Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring.
KARL (CONT'D)
Two fellers was on a bridge a
takin' a leak and one feller says
the water was cold and the other
said it was deep water. One of 'em
came from Arkansas, I believe.
LINDA
(puzzled)
I'll be dog.
More silence.
KARL
Do you reckon you can make me some
biscuits?
LINDA
Right now?
KARL
Just whenever you take a notion to.
I don't aim to put you out.
LINDA
Well, it is nearly breakfast time
anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have
to be at work in three hours. You
know how it is when you just sleep
an hour or two, you feel worse than
if you hadn't slept at all?
KARL
Yes ma'am.
LINDA
Well, set down and I'll make some
biscuits and gravy.
KARL
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
LINDA
Okay.
Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits.
KARL
Thank ye.
LINDA
It's all right.
(pause)
You know I was thinkin' there's
this girl that works with me. She's
real heavy, but she's cute in the
face. Well, you know, she's slow.
She's a little bit, I think. She's
not retarded, just -- it don't
matter, listen to me. I thought you
might like to meet her. Vaughan
wants to have a little supper over
at his house and we could invite
her. Would you like that?
KARL
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
LINDA
Vaughan's "friend" will be there,
too. He works at the funeral home.
And Frank. You know Frank likes you
a lot. He says you make him feel
calm.
KARL
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me
and him's made friends.
She keeps working.
KARL (CONT'D)
Hit ain't right for me to keep from
tellin' you how come me to be put
in the state hospital.
LINDA
That's okay. It's not really my
business. I have wondered though.
Why was it? Was it like a nervous
breakdown?
KARL
I killed my mother and a old boy
name Jesse Dixon. I thought they
was a-doin' wrong. I was about your
boy's age. They say I'm well now
from it.
Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but
not as much as you would think.
LINDA
Was that you? I remember that. I
was only three or four, but I
always heard about it growin' up.
(pause)
They say you're well?
KARL
Yes ma'am.
(pause)
I like your garage.
(pause)
I wouldn't never hurt you or your
boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible
and say the same thing.
LINDA
I believe you. I really do.
Vaughan, ALBERT the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and
MELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl
and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly
picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat.
This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns
to Karl.
ALBERT
So Karl, do you intend to stay in
the lawnmower business for a while
or do you have other plans?
KARL
I reckon.
VAUGHAN
I think Karl is going to be a
writer or a librarian eventually.
You should see all the books he
has. He must read constantly.
KARL
I ain't read 'em yet except two or
three of 'em. I can't understand a
lot of what I try to read. My mind,
hit wonders off to somethin' else
when I try to read.
ALBERT
I'm the same way. Of course, in my
line of work, I stay too busy to
read.
But at least I have job security.
People may stop doing a lot of
things, but one thing is for sure,
they won't stop dying.
LINDA
(looks at Frank)
Why don't we talk about something a
little more festive.
VAUGHAN
Does everyone like the food?
Nods and yeses.
VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm
a good cook.
LINDA
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda
was voted employee of the month at
the Dollar Store last February.
Isn't that somethin'?
KARL
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
MELINDA
Well, when you like pricing items
as much as I do, I guess it's just
bound to happen sooner or later.
VAUGHAN
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might
want to take a walk or something
after dinner. It's a nice night.
LINDA
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
VAUGHAN
I'm sorry.
KARL
I like walkin' quite a bit from
time to time.
MELINDA
I stay on my feet all the time at
work. I just can't find shoes
that's comfortable.
ALBERT
Hospital shoes might be the answer.
Nurses' shoes.
VAUGHAN
Or the kind old ladies who work in
the school cafeteria wear.
ALBERT
Same difference.
MELINDA
I get real mean when my feet hurt.
It's the only time I don't like
checkin' out the customers, when my
feet hurt.
LINDA
Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin'
much, you boys must really like
that food.
FRANK
I just don't have anything to say
about shoes.
Silence for a moment.
VAUGHAN
Listen everybody, I know this may
sound corny, I've had a few glasses
of wine and that kind of makes me a
little emotional, but I'm going to
say it anyway. It just came over me
in a rush. I want you all to know
that I care about each and every
one of you at this table.
LINDA
That's very sweet of you Vaughan.
We care about you, too. Don't we
y'all?
Nods, grunts, "Sure do's."
VAUGHAN
Also, Melinda, please don't tell
anybody at the store that Albert
was here tonight, okay.
MELINDA
Why?
VAUGHAN
Well, a lot of people in town talk
and spread cruel rumors.
Unfortunately, I have to keep
certain parts of my life private.
MELINDA
You mean about y'all bein' together
in "that" way?
VAUGHAN
Yes.
MELINDA
I think everybody at the store
knows that already. They always
talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter
told a awful story about why you
ain't allowed over at the First
Baptist Church no more.
LINDA
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go
take a walk. It's nice out.
KARL
All right then.
He gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up
and tries to catch up.
Karl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they
are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. Bill Cox
appears in the door.
BILL
Hey Karl, they's somebody out here
to see you. Some gal holding a nice
bouquet.
(Karl doesn't move)
Come on now, she wants to talk to
you. Don't just set there.
Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter.
Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a
cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody
says anything for a moment.
MELINDA
Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These
was on sale 'cause they're not
fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus
my ten percent employee discount.
Since I didn't bring you anything
to our date last night, I thought
you'd like to have 'em.
She hands them to him.
KARL
Thank ye.
BILL
Scooter, let's me and you go over
to Dairy Queen and pick up a few
things for lunchtime.
SCOOTER
I can go. You don't have to. You
don't never go.
BILL
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon
my language, ma'am.
They start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at
Karl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the
counter. They are silent for a while.
MELINDA
Well, I just thought I'd give you
them. I liked walkin' with you. I
got a blister the size of a quarter
on one heel. Well, I'll see you
sometime, I guess.
She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say
something.
KARL
A blister shore can hurt.
MELINDA
Yeah.
KARL
Flowers is pretty. I've always
thought that.
MELINDA
Me, too.
She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers
and watches her walk away.
As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a
footstool facing Linda who's in a chair. Doyle is holding
both her hands and talking very softly to her. He sees the
guys and looks up.
DOYLE
Well, I'll be damned, there's the
boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I
wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was
just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell,
I'll just start over, set down you
boys.
They do, on the couch.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
Well, what it is is, I just, well I
took off work early today and your
mama was good enough to do the same
so we could talk. I guess you'd say
I'm really here to apologize, which
ain't easy for me to do, about the
way I acted the other night. I was
just drunk and kinda got a little
too worked up and one thing led to
another. I care about y'all a lot,
I do. I don't mean to be so damned,
assholish I guess the word would
be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit
you, did I? So no apology needed
there I guess, but Frank, I'm
sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama.
I'm just jealous of her. I don't
like her life or the way she runs
it. I don't like homosexuals and
she buddies with one. I don't like
little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'
mental retards and she's got one of
each livin' with her.
(laughs)
I was just kiddin'. But really I
guess people need to get along even
if they have differences.
(pause)
You see, I work construction. I
build things. Do you realize how
important that is to the world. I
have a lot of pressure on me. The
upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot
more time over here and we're gonna
get along. Like a family should.
(to Linda)
I may even surprise you one day and
pop the question.
(he gets up)
Well, I'm goin' back to work. I
just wanted to give y'all some
little piece of happiness today.
(kisses Linda)
See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a
good boy, Frank.
He leaves.
LINDA
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who
knows for how long.
FRANK
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do
better.
LINDA
I know honey. Just remember what I
said, we'll bide our time. You just
steer clear of him as much as you
can. Doyle's had a real hard life.
It's just about run him crazy I
think.
FRANK
We've had a real hard life, too,
Mama.
Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank.
LINDA
You're a hell of a boy, Frank.
Someday you're gonna get all the
good things you deserve. And Karl
here's gonna get some more biscuits
tonight. What do you think about
that?
KARL
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline. Bill
comes to the door.
BILL
Hey there Karl, can you come unload
a generator for me?
Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside.
Karl is on his cot reading a book. Frank comes in. He looks
very depressed. He sits beside Karl.
FRANK
What you readin'?
KARL
Readin' on this book on how to work
carpentry. I aim to learn how to
build things out of wood one of
these times. I've always been
partial to wood buildin's and
cabinets and whatnot. These
drawin's they got here don't make
no sense to me so far.
(he looks directly at
Frank, which he seldom
does)
You seem like yore tails a'draggin'
a might. You got somethin' wrong
with ye?
FRANK
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way
back in. Mama said he's stayin'
over tonight and he's talkin' about
movin' in for good. We ain't ever
gonna be happy. We'll always be
nervous, won't we Karl?
KARL
I don't reckon I know. I ain't
found no way yet and I'm three or
four times as old as you. Might be
that's just the way folks is.
FRANK
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.
I just make like to myself she
loves me. I know better, though. It
just feels good to me when I
imagine it.
KARL
Make believin' always made me feel
good too from time to time.
They sit in silence for a moment.
KARL (CONT'D)
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for
a Mister Turner tomorrow and a
closin' up shop early.
FRANK
Is that right?
KARL
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if
neither one of us is no count it
won't make no difference.
FRANK
You will? For sure?
KARL
Yeah.
FRANK
We'll be on teams, me and you?
KARL
Yessir.
Karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in
thought.
Sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. The shed has
nothing but dirt for a floor. A few tall patches of grass
shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. A few old garden
tools hang on the wall. In the center is a low circular spot
in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
Karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
walks out of the shed.
Karl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the
kitchen window and goes inside.
The place is a mess. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and
on the table. It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere.
Karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an OLD
MAN in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
Karl stands facing him for several moments.
KARL
I'm ye boy.
OLD MAN
I ain't got no boy.
KARL
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
OLD MAN
I ain't got no boy.
KARL
They turned me aloose from the
nervous hospital. Said I was well.
No response.
KARL (CONT'D)
I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox
fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.
No response.
KARL (CONT'D)
That grass out in the yard's all
growed up. I figured I might cut it
fer ye.
OLD MAN
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now
get on out from here and let me be.
Long silence.
KARL
I learned to read some. I've read
on the Bible quite a bit. I don't
understand all of it, but I believe
I understand a good deal of it.
Them stories Mama and you told me
ain't in there. You ort not to of
done that to ye boy.
(pause)
I've studied on killin' you. But I
don't reckon they's no reason fer
it if all you're gonna do is set
there in that chair. You'll be dead
soon enough I reckon and the
world'll be shut of ye.
(Karl walks toward the
kitchen and turns back to
the old man)
You ort not to of killed my
brother. He ort to have had a
chance to grow up. Sometimes he
would of had fun.
All the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed
asleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed
staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring.
Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp
and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a
start. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door
holding a hammer.
DOYLE
What in the goddamn hell are you
doin'? It's the middle of the
night.
LINDA
What do you want, hun?
KARL
I want to be baptized.
DOYLE
Baptized? Well, get baptized then.
I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin'
preacher, goddamnit! I can't
baptize you.
LINDA
We'll go to church and get you
baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go
on back to bed.
DOYLE
What are you doin' with that damn
hammer?
KARL
I don't rightly know. I just kindly
woke up a-holdin' it.
We see a shot of Frank and Linda and Vaughan in a church pew.
The church is pretty full. From their P.O.V. we seek Karl in
a robe standing in the baptismal tank. The preacher takes
Karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up.
Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come
through the front door.
DOYLE
How'd your baptizin' go?
LINDA
It went real good.
DOYLE
Well, that's good. It's about time
to eat and you know what I'm
cravin'? Some of that take out
chicken. Why don't you run get some
of it, honey, for lunch?
LINDA
(to Frank and Karl)
Would y'all like that?
FRANK
Yeah, I guess.
KARL
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken
leg.
LINDA
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
DOYLE
Naw, hell, let them stay here with
me and do men things. There might
be some kind of ball game on we can
watch. You go on.
LINDA
I'll be back in a little bit then.
She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.
DOYLE
I really just wanted to git your
mama out of the house for a minute
so we can have a talk. Y'all set
down.
They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.
DOYLE
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm
gonna throw my entire life away
doin' what I want to come live here
with y'all, we have to get a few
things straight. See, Frank, me and
you mama wouldn't have any problems
if it wadn't for you. We'd never
have a bad word between us. But
since you do exist, if I'm gonna be
here as the head of the household,
we'll have to live by my rules.
And my rules are you don't speak
unless you're spoken to. Stay out
of my way and do what a regular kid
does. You're a weird little shit. I
don't get you. So wake up. Face
what they call reality. We're gonna
be a family now. And it's my
family. I'll be payin' the bills so
you got me. But I ain't your daddy.
You just treat me like I am. I'm
the boss, okay. And the other thing
is your friend Karl has to go. We
can't have a normal family with him
livin' in the garage and comin' in
the bedroom at four in the mornin'
with hammers and shit. See?
FRANK
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama
said --
Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm.
Doyle shakes him off.
KARL
Don't hit that boy no more.
DOYLE
You shut up you, fuckin' retard.
Get your shit and get out of here.
(to Frank)
That was a wake-up slap, Frank.
Remember. Reality, like I said.
Don't forget any bit of what I said
to you and we'll be fine.
Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in
his chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the
garage.
Karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his
bed and leaves.
Karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel.
Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching TV. He looks
up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa.
DOYLE
Where's ever'body else? You seen
'em?
(no response)
I thought I told you to get the
hell moved out of here anyway.
KARL
How does a feller go about gettin'
ahold of the police?
DOYLE (CONT'D)
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call
'em, I guess.
KARL
What numbers do you punch?
DOYLE
I told you to get away from here,
didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and
look at TV.
(notices blade)
What are you doin' with that piece
of iron? I swear to God you're the
weirdest son of a bitch I ever
heard of.
KARL
I aim to kill you with it.
Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
DOYLE
Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police
you push 911. You'll need to tell
'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a
hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're
gonna kill me.
(laughs)
Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We
see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear
one short dull thud.
DOYLE (O.S.)
Oh God! Oh God!
We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting
the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it
for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood
on his face, hand and shirt.
KARL
(into phone)
Yes ma'am. I need the police over
here at the Wheatley house.
(pause)
I've killed somebody with a mower
blade.
(pause)
Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I
hit him two good whacks. That
second time just plumb near cut his
head in two.
(pause)
Hits a little old yeller house
right on the corner of Marigold
Street and some other street.
They's a red pickup truck out front
says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION
on it. I'll be a settin' here
waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the
police, Doyle said you might want
to send a ambulance or a hearse.
Thank ye.
He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the
mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the
biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE
He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull
back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl
is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
CHARLES
... on the third day I washed her.
She wasn't very clean. I got all
the right spots. She was the first
one I ever kept for any length of
time, you see I get bored easily, I
have a short attention span. I
can't say she enjoyed her stay,
although the washcloth in her mouth
held in place by good duct tape
kept any complaints to a minimum. I
don't really like people who talk a
lot. I like to do the talking. I
guess that's why I'm so fond of
you. You're so easygoing, although
I do sense a little tension in you
sometimes. By the way, how was it
out there? Did you have any fun?
Make any new acquaintances? Tell me
what it was like.
KARL
They was a boy. We made friends.
CHARLES
I bet you did. I was never bent
that way. I'm bent the other way.
So, you liked it out there in the
world.
KARL
It's too big.
CHARLES
Well, it's not too big in here, is
it?
(pause)
I feel very generous today. I feel
like listening. I'm sure you have
plenty to tell me. And please bore
me with the details.
(long pause) )
Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was
it the boy?
KARL
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
KARL
Fact the bidness, don't you say
another word to me. I ain't
listenin' to you no more.
Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the
grass that separates him from the next building. He stares
out the window, as we:
FADE OUT.
