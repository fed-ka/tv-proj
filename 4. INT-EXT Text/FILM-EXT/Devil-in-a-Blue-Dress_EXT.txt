Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948,
come and go on Central Avenue. Two-storied storefronts with
canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in
a hurry.
The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac
convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.
Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits
Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.

Little single family houses with tiny yards of St. Augustine
grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on
Easy's car.

He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man
giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street.

A MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a
wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as
he opens his gate.
WOODCUTTER
Want me to knock down some of them
trees back there for you?
EASY
(irritated)
No... Just leave the trees alone.
Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias
and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his
African violets in a jar next to the front door.

He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering
and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana
trees as he lights a cigarette.
EASY (V.O.)
I had moved to Los Angeles right
after the war with three hundred
dollars and the G.I. Bill... And I
liked coming home to a place that
was mine... According to President
Truman I had that comin' to me
'cause I had fought in 'the good
war' against Hitler in Europe...
But that didn't mean a damn thing
to a lotta white folks including
the foreman on my job... So, here I
was out of work needin' thirty-two
dollars to pay the mortgage... That
was three days pay on my old job --
and I had about three days to get
it.

Easy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building.
He

Easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses

A small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling
Easy. He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform.
SECURITY GUARD
What are you doing here?
EASY
I'm looking for, uh...
SECURITY GUARD
We only take deliveries between
nine and six...
EASY
No, no... I...
SECURITY GUARD
Yes, we do!
Now you'd better
leave.
He clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open
palm.
EASY
Uh... Albright!
SECURITY GUARD
What?
EASY
I'm here to see Mr. Albright.
DeWitt Albright!
SECURITY GUARD
Where's your delivery?
He holds out his scrawny hand.
EASY
I have an appointment -- I'm
supposed to meet him.

CONTINUED:

SECURITY GUARD
Did he give you a note to come in
here after hours?
Easy only stares, hating this little man.
SECURITY GUARD
Well, did he?
Because if he
didn't--
EASY
Forget it, man. Next time I see
him I'll just tell him you wouldn't
let me in.
Disgusted, Easy turns to leave.
SECURITY GUARD
Hold on.
He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard.
SECURITY GUARD
(like an order)
Across that way to the left and
down the stairs...
Easy half nods/half glares and walks away.

At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and
heads down concrete steps. At the bottom he opens a door
leading into

Stripped down to its dark, naked self, Central Avenue has
drawn a crowd from all over town. Neon glistens off slick
pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh.
An outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief
Parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two
dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot
suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for
something -- anything -- because his date is a young white
woman. A few onlookers stand back watching, but since this
white woman is not Daphne Monet, Easy only glances and walks
inside.

Easy struggles with Dupree, and Coretta gives him a hand as
they drag him from Easy's car to her front door, the big
man's feet plowing two deep furrows in the lawn.
23
25
The sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Coretta's
porch. She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he
straightens his clothes and looks around for any "witnesses"
on his way to his car.

Easy's Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out.
EASY (V.O.)
It occurred to me that Coretta had
found out a lot more about what I
was up to than I had wanted her to.
But I had found out that the rich
man's woman had a colored
boyfriend... It had cost me a
sawbuck to get Coretta to give me
that information... Well, let's
just say somethin' had cost me ten
dollars.
27
28
Easy waters his lawn in deep thought.
EASY (V.O.)
The letter from Mouse was worrying
me in more ways than one... All I
had to do was call Albright to earn
the hundred dollars I already had
in my pocket... But the last time I
got money that easy I got it from
Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the
next day I had to join the Army to
leave town.
FLASHBACK:

The headlights from Easy's car illuminate the cliffs that
fall alongside the winding two-lane highway.

A35
The lights from the
pier can be seen in the distance as Easy
parks his car. And
the voices of teenagers in raucous
conversation can be
heard above Glenn Miller's big band
playing "Silhouette
In The Moonlight" on the jukebox.

Easy gets out and starts toward the pier.

Easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing
that looks out over the ocean.
O.S. VOICE
Hi.
He spins around and sees a chubby 17-year-old white GIRL in
a tight-fitting skirt.
He nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the
water, hoping she'll leave.
GIRL
It's pretty out here, huh?
EASY
Yeah.
It's all right.
GIRL
I'm from Des Moines in Iowa.
Where
are you from?
EASY
(without looking back)
Huh?... Uh... Texas...
GIRL
Do they have an ocean in Texas?
EASY
The Gulf, they have the Gulf.
She leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his
shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around
like they've lost someone.
EASY
I think they're looking for you.
BARBARA
Who cares? My sister brought me
'cause my parents made her. All
she wants to do is make out with
Herman and smoke cigarettes.
PIMPLY-FACED BOY
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
The five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up
to Easy.
31.
35
CONTINUED:

BARBARA
(yelling)
Leave him alone, Herman!
We were
just talking!
HERMAN
You were, huh?
(to Easy)
We don't need you talking to our
women.
Easy braces himself as five of Herman's FRIENDS rush over,
including one built like a football player.
FOOTBALL
Hey!
What's wrong?
HERMAN
Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara.
BARBARA
Leave him alone! We were just
talking about the ocean!
BARBARA'S SISTER
Barbara!
Football gets right in Easy's face.
FOOTBALL
Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?
A couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are
surrounding Easy against the rail.
EASY
I don't want no trouble.
FOOTBALL
You already got trouble, boy.
EASY
Listen... I was just being polite.
HERMAN
No, you weren't. You were talkin'
about the ocean!
O.S. VOICE
Excuse me.
Easy sees Albright's Panama hat appear behind Football.

FOOTBALL
What do you want?
And he whirls around to Albright's smiling face, just in
time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his
coat, leveling it at his eyes.
ALBRIGHT
I want to see brains.
I want you
to die for me.
Albright cocks the hammer. It sounds like a bone breaking,
and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms.
FOOTBALL
(quickly)
I'm sorry, sir.
Easy nods but Albright is not satisfied.
ALBRIGHT
The question is: "Are you sorry
enough?"
FOOTBALL
Yessir.
ALBRIGHT
Then prove it... Show him... Get
down on your knees and suck his
peter.
Football starts crying.
EASY
(to Albright)
I think he got the point--
ALBRIGHT
(to Football)
You heard me.
He presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and Football
goes down to his knees. The other young men look on in
horror.
ALBRIGHT
Son of a gun. You were gonna do
it, weren't you?
THUNK! He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of
the boy's head. Football screams and the others scatter.
33.
35
CONTINUED:

35
ALBRIGHT
Sick bastard.
THUNK!
He smacks him again, and blood is everywhere.
ALBRIGHT
Get out of here. You call the
cops, I'll kill ya!
Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away
into the darkness back out toward the parking lot.
36
Albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it
36
back into the holster.
ALBRIGHT
I don't think they'd dare call the
cops.
(giggles)
But it'll cost me a few bucks if
they do.
He claps Easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and
giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand.
Easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his
anger in tightly clenched jaws.
ALBRIGHT
What you got, Easy?
EASY
You sure no harm is gonna come to
that woman 'cause of me?
Albright doesn't break stride.
ALBRIGHT
Course not. Mr. Carter wants to
buy her a gold ring and live
happily ever after -- What do ya
got?
Easy exhales, feeling trapped, but he's come this far...
EASY
Woman told me she's with a man
named Frank Green.
Albright stops; the charm gone, he's all business.
ALBRIGHT
Where?
34.
36
CONTINUED:
36
EASY
He's got an apartment at the Skyler
Arms on Skyler and Eighty-third.
Albright scribbles it down on a note pad.
ALBRIGHT
Anything else?
EASY
Frank's a gangster. A hijacker...
Liquor and cigarettes. He's real
good with a knife.
Albright is unable to suppress a smile.
ALBRIGHT
Ever seen him in action?
EASY
Naw.
I just heard about him.
Albright, still grinning, pulls out the brown "secretary"
and counts out more bills.
ALBRIGHT
Here's another hundred.
He shoves the money into Easy's hand.
ALBRIGHT
Buy ya a burger, Easy?
He starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but
Easy declines.
EASY
No thanks, Mr. Albright.
ALBRIGHT
How come you let those boys get
around you like that? War hero
should have been able to pick 'em
off one by one before they got you
against the rail.
EASY
I don't kill children.
For some reason this is hilarious to Albright. He throws
his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh,
then winds down.
35.

CONTINUED:

ALBRIGHT
Take it easy.
He disappears into the hamburger joint and Easy walks away
back toward his car.
37
37
Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford
parked across the street as he gets out of his car.
A tall, skinny white MAN in a dark blue suit gets out just
ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset FRIEND.
Easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway.
SKINNY MAN
Mr. Rawlins.
EASY
Yeah.
They approach fast but cautiously, the fat one with a hand
in his pocket.
SKINNY MAN
Mr. Rawlins, I'm Miller and this is
my partner, Mason.
They both hold out badges. Mason is a slob with grease
spots on his wrinkled tan suit.
MILLER
We want you to come with us.
EASY
Where?
MASON
You'll see.
And he takes Easy by the arm.
EASY
You arresting me?
MASON
You'll see.
And he starts pulling Easy toward the street.
EASY
I got a right to know why you're
taking--
36.
37
CONTINUED:
37
WHOMP! Easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles
over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his
back.
MASON
You got a right to fall down and
break your face, nigger. You got a
right to die.
The two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back
seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away.
38
40
Easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his
top shirt button, his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep
out the chill of the night air.
The street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley
except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the
curb. A taut-faced officer leans out the window.
OFFICER
Hey, Buddy!... It's a long walk...
why don't you let us give you a
ride?
Easy walks across the street off into the darkness...
41
41
A snatch of MUSIC and LAUGHTER startles Easy as he trudges
home and a car full of teenagers shoots by. And then...
A BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
cruises up behind and drives alongside.
VOICE FROM CAR
Hey, you!
Ezekiel Rawlins!
The window rolls down all the way and a white face in a
black cap appears in the window.
CHAUFFEUR
Ezekiel, hold on.
Easy keeps walking.
CHAUFFEUR
Come on, fella. Somebody in the
back wants to talk to you.
EASY
I don't have time right now.
He doubles his pace, almost running.
CHAUFFEUR
Jump in. We'll take you.
My boss
wants to talk to you.
Easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the
other side of the bridge but
41.
41
CONTINUED:
41
The Cadillac whips a U-turn blocking his way in the middle
of the street while cars pass, honking, on either side. The
tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his
hands as if making peace.
Easy starts to make another move to escape but:
CHAUFFEUR
(continuing)
Come on. If we wanted to hurt you
it would have already happened...
He opens the back door and after a few moments, Easy gets
in.
42
43
The limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets
out.
TERAN
Mr. Rawlins, may I offer you cab
fare?
Teran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills.
EASY
No thanks.
Easy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide
away.
44.

CONTINUED:
43
EASY (V.O.)
There had been nights during the
war that I still had trouble
claiming as part of my life...
Insane nights I wasn't sure ever
really happened. And here I was
again... Had I really just gotten
out of a rich man's car who was
runnin' for mayor?.. Running
against the man I was supposed to
be working for... Was he really
lookin' for the same woman I was
trying to find? My ear was killin'
me and the buses had stopped
running. And I was feeling sick...
Sick from wondering if I had really
hard that Coretta was dead.
44
45
It's a Spanish-style set of rooms with tile roofs set around
a square parking lot.
Easy's car pulls into the alley behind it.
He gets out and scans the area looking down from a rise at
the back entrance to the parking lot. And then walks down.

Before Easy can knock, he hears:
DAPHNE (O.S.)
Mr. Rawlins?
EASY
Yeah.
The door opens and she's standing there, more beautiful than
the photograph. They take each other in for a moment before
she steps back from the door.
DAPHNE
Please come in.
48
51
Easy's Pontiac snakes up the winding road, city lights
glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves.
51.
52
53
The Studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street.
Easy
pulls in behind.
The cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible
is the mailbox and address.
DAPHNE
Did you bring a gun or something?
EASY
What?
No.
DAPHNE
Easy, that's not very smart.
Everybody carries a weapon now a
days.
EASY
(defensively)
Well then where's yours?
DAPHNE
Search me sometime.
You'll find
it.
She gets out of the car.
EASY
Damn...
He frowns and gets out of the car.

OMIT

Daphne waits, clutching her suitcase and lets Easy lead the
way.
They get to the door and find it ajar.
Easy takes a look
inside and then cautiously steps in.
53.
56
58
A pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway. Easy
runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into
the street.
EASY
Hey, wait a minute!
She speeds off down the canyon.
EASY
Dammit!
He stands in the middle of the street, watching her go.
59
63
Dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in
a struggle. The BOOM of heavy artillery gives way only to
the deafening CHATTER of automatic fire.
We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in
combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German
soldier. Tears are streaming down Easy's face, his mouth
gaped open in an inaudible SCREAM.
64
BACK TO SCENE

He studies the glass and pushes it away.
Then looks

Albright and his two goons get in the white Caddy and cruise
away.

He dials the operator.
EASY (V.O.)
I needed help... Albright didn't
flinch at hearing that Coretta was
dead and he seemed to know all
about Richard McGee too...
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Number please...
EASY
Raymond Alexander on...
He pauses, speechless as
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Yes?
EASY
(after a moment)
Forget about it, operator.
He hangs up, his eyes trained in thought.
A67

A crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place
band playing "Happy Days Are Here Again"; the second with
someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a "Teran for
Mayor" placard with a man in the front passenger seat
announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least,
Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American
flags.
Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the
waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket.
He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
butcher shop.
B67
67
Easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone
entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished
institution on a bronze plate.
He parks the car and gets
out, adjusting his dark brown
Stetson which matches his
pin-stripped suit. He looks
around at the massive and
well manicured grounds and walks
into a patio area of this
Spanish-style complex.
EASY (V.O.)
Albright had said that when you're
mixed up in something it's best to
be mixed up to the top. I could
see his point. So that's where I
was going... all the way to the
top.
63.
68
68
An ELDERLY SECRETARY descends an outdoor curved stairway
carrying a file. She spots Easy looking around confused and
immediately becomes annoyed.
SECRETARY
May I help you?
EASY
Uh... yes.
I came to see Mr.
Carter.
SECRETARY
Do you have an appointment?
EASY
No, I don't.
SECRETARY
Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Carter is
a very busy man.
Easy pulls out Albright's business card and hands it to her.
EASY
Well, tell him Mr. Albright sent
me, and it's real important.
She looks at the card and then up at Easy with annoyed
superiority.
SECRETARY
May I ask the nature of your call,
Mister...?
EASY
Rawlins. But I'm not so sure he'd
want me to tell you.
SECRETARY
I'm quite sure, Mr. Rawlins, that
whatever you know is nothing I
can't know as well.
EASY
Okay. Well, anyway, tell him I'm
here with information about that
little chippy of his that dumped
him.
SECRETARY
Is this some sort of joke?
O.S. VOICE
Uh... Excuse me...
64.
68
CONTINUED:
68
Easy and the secretary turn to see a TALL MAN in a dark grey
suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in
the doorway. He forces a smile and comes out.
BAXTER
Mr. Rawlins was it?
He holds out his hand and Easy shakes it.
EASY
Yes.
Mister...
BAXTER
Baxter.
(to the secretary)
I'll take care of this.
(and back to Easy)
Why don't you come with me, sir?
They walk through the door into
69
A HALLWAY
69
BAXTER
Not very smart talking about Mr.
Carter's business to a secretary.
EASY
I don't wanna hear it, man. It's
too much goin' on for me to give a
damn about what you think is smart.
Baxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put
Easy in his place. But Easy slows down too and squares up
on him. Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone
staircase.
70
A72
Easy walks to his car, gets in and drives away toward the
entrance.
EASY (V.O.)
So Albright was working for Matthew
Teran. And whatever Teran had on
Carter was strong stuff... too
strong even for Carter to go to the
police... But because Teran was
desperate to find the girl too,
that gave me the best hand. I had
seen her once, and if I played it
right, I'd see her again.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE:
76
POOL HALL - THAT NIGHT
76
Easy talks to the short, squat, suspicious woman who runs
the place. Through the smoke, other distrustful eyes fix on
him from pool tables and dark corners.
EASY (V.O.)
Everywhere I went was a familiar
place, but different because I was
asking about buying hijacked liquor
from the man nobody wanted to talk
about. Frank Green...
DISSOLVE TO:
77
NIGHTCLUB - NEXT NIGHT
77
Upscale, with a balcony. Billy Eckstine fronts the band.
Blacks and whites are dressed to impress, including Easy,
who leans into the bartender.
EASY (V.O.)
It was actually looking more and
more like I might not make it
through this little adventure I was
having. But I was likin' the chill
in my blood, and the freedom of
working on my own.
DISSOLVE TO:
78
ABE AND JOHNNY'S LIQUOR - NEXT DAY
78
The two JEWISH OWNERS unveil for Easy a case of hijacked
liquor in a wooden crate.
EASY (V.O.)
There were times in the war when I
had felt like this. When life or
death where the only two choices.
That made it simple. And that was
alright by me.
79
79
Easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open. He's tired, and
he trudges up the walkway to the porch. He sees
THE WOODCUTTER standing on the front lawn of the next door
neighbor's, waving at him.
71.
79
CONTINUED:
79
BACK TO EASY
He throws a rock and then unlocks the door. But he notices
THE POT OF AFRICAN VIOLETS lying broken on the cement. He
looks up just in time to see a TWO-BY-FOUR swing down.
BONK! And Easy is seeing stars.
A big man, dressed in black, kicks open the door and drives
Easy head first into
80
84
Easy opens the door and stands on the porch.
MOUSE
Hey, Easy, was it a left on
Richland or a right?
76.
84
CONTINUED:
84
EASY
A right. And if Dupree ain't over
there in Compton, just come on back
'cause I might have heard from the
girl.
Just then a car cruises around the corner and Easy watches
MASON AND MILLER pull up across the street and get out. He
glances over at Mouse.
85
86
Easy watches them stroll up the walkway.
MILLER
Mr. Rawlins... We came to ask you a
few more questions.
MASON
(grinning)
So why don't you just invite us
inside...
(holding open the door)
After you.
And Easy and Miller go in.
MASON
What happened to your head? I
don't remember doing all that.
He laughs and closes the door behind them.
87
A92
Easy hurries out of his house pulling on his jacket with
Mouse right behind.
MOUSE
What they tryin' to pin on you?
81.
A92
CONTINUED:
A92
EASY
I'll tell you on the way.
You got
the keys?
MOUSE
Yeah.
And he hurries around to the driver's side.
EASY
Before we run out to Compton we got
one other place to stop by...
He freezes seeing the Woodcutter watching and listening.
EASY
(to Woodcutter)
Man, don't you mess with my trees
while I'm gone.
He gets in as Mouse cranks the engine.
EASY
You heard me.
Leave my trees
alone.
As Mouse starts away the old man smiles mischievously and
starts to sharpen his axe.
Easy leans out the car window, yelling back as the car pulls
away.
EASY
I mean it now. Don't you mess with
my trees!!
92
92
It's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little
porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a
small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees
growing in brick pots.
Easy and Mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly
tenants sitting inside screened doors. Jimmy Lunceford's
"I'm Walking Through Heaven With You" floats out into the
yard.
They arrive at the closed door of number eight. Easy knocks
and then knocks again, hard. Something CRASHES on the
inside and heavy FOOTSTEPS pound to the door.
VOICE BEHIND DOOR
Who's that?

EASY
Easy!
The door opens and JUNIOR FORNAY stands there behind the
screen door in blue boxer shorts and a white T-shirt.
JUNIOR
What you want?
EASY
It's private, Junior.
Lemme in.
And he reaches to pull open the door, but Junior throws the
latch.
JUNIOR
I ain't got time now.
I'm tryin'
to get some sleep.
MOUSE
Why don't you open the door,
Junior, 'fore I have to shoot it
down.
Mouse steps out into the doorway, in plain view.
JUNIOR
Mouse.
MOUSE
Open up.
We ain't got all night.
Junior forces a smile and lets them in.
93
97
They notice the light in the front window go out and the
shade pull back slightly as they walk toward the front door.
Moments later the door opens and the dark figure of Dupree
Brouchard appears.
DUPREE
(to the dog)
Go on. Go on in the back.
The dog obeys and Easy and Mouse walk up the walkway.
EASY
Hey, Dupree.
Been trying to call
you.
DUPREE
Yeah, Easy! Cops just let me out
today. My sister gone to work and
I didn't feel much like talking...
Raymond...
MOUSE
Hey, big man!
Them pigtails I
smell?
DUPREE
Yeah. Lula Mae made some 'fore she
went to work.
Dupree ushers them in.

Easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around
cautiously before starting up the walkway.
EASY (V.O.)

For the first time I hated walking
up to my house... I still didn't
know if I could go to the police.
But Albright was liable to be
showing up in a few hours asking
about Frank Green. I was thinking
I oughta forget the girl and leave
town, back to Houston or Galveston
where they didn't know me too good.
Easy gets to the door, still literally looking over his
shoulder, and hears the phone RINGING inside. He unlocks
the door and bursts in.
104
108
The blurred white form of Albright's Caddy screaming away,
shattering the dark, shrieking in flight.
Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the
neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the
block.
Easy stumbles back inside and into
100.
109
THE BEDROOM
109
Where he manages to dial the phone.
It RINGS several times
on the other end, and finally:
MOUSE'S VOICE
(groggy)
Yeah.
EASY
Mouse...
MOUSE'S VOICE
Hey, Easy?
EASY
(slurring)
Get Dupree's car. Drive it to 78th
and Central... The butcher shop.
MOUSE'S VOICE
You alright?
EASY
Hurry up.
He puts down the receiver, missing the cradle, and staggers
out of the room.
110
111
The street is still alive. A couple of late night juke
joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party
onto the sidewalk to straggle home. Easy's car screams
around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped
young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for
cover.
He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Dupree's
'38 Packard in behind him.
101.
111
CONTINUED:
111
EASY
(to the woman)
Sorry, baby... Lemme give you
twenty bucks for them stockings you
got on.
It takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull
a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy.
He runs back to Mouse.
EASY
Gimme one of them guns you got.
Mouse smiles, loving this side of Easy, and trades him a set
of car keys for a .32 automatic.
EASY
(continuing)
Start up my car. I'm comin' out
fast.
He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the
twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still
stripping as he runs into
112
B115
The car roars down the alley and turns right onto the
street.
115
116
The engine roars from a punch to the accelerator, and
Mouse's voice can be heard cutting through the darkness as
the car powers off down the street.
MOUSE (O.S.)
Oh, my goodness!
117
119
The Pontiac makes the turn onto a graded dirt road.
120
122
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:
House lights show through thick
shrubbery.
JOPPY
There it is.
Mouse pulls to a stop and kills the engine.
EASY
There's some rope in the trunk,
Raymond.
Mouse gets out of the car and is heard opening the trunk.
JOPPY
Easy, come on, man. That girl is
lying if she told you I killed them
folks.
EASY
Who said she told me?
SCREAM! It's muted and distant.
But it's a woman all
right. SCREAM!
Easy pushes out of the back door on the right as Mouse opens
the opposite door on the driver's side.
EASY
Stuff this in his mouth.
I gotta
get up there.
He tosses Mouse the stocking.
106.
122
CONTINUED:
122
MOUSE
Let's just shoot him.
EASY
(on the run)
No, Mouse. And they'll hear it.
123
123
The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill. He
can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out
the words.
It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a
window with the shade pulled down.
He moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through
the crack between the shade and the windowsill. He can make
out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low
ceiling. SMACK! And Daphne screams again.
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
Come on, talk to me. Talk to me
while you still can.
DAPHNE'S VOICE
(sobbing)
Please! I don't have them!
Easy
has them!
Easy can barely make out Shariff passing the window.
He
strains to see more.
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
You said he didn't know anything.
DAPHNE'S VOICE
I was lying!!
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
Okay. Grab that for me, Shariff.
It's ready.
And then SCRE-E-EAM!! The kind that drops the bottom out of
your stomach. The kind more akin to fear than the word
itself... The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill
of horror. S-C-R-E-EAMS again!!
DAPHNE'S VOICE
No-o-o-o!
Please. No-o-o!
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
Now talk to me, goddammit!
107.
123
CONTINUED:
123
DAPHNE'S VOICE
No-o-o!
124
Easy's gotta make a move. KABLANGALANGLE! He smashes the
124
window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up.
Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and
flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning
her down on a battered old sofa.
Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff,
standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him.
Easy starts blasting.
KABLAAM!
Manny takes one to the
throat. KABLAAM!
Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down
behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming.
Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing
into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the
side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a
chunk of the wall.
Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting
ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side
door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE.
And then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right
through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to
the side of the house, underneath another window with the
shade pulled down.
ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
(to Shariff)
Who the hell's out there?
SHARIFF
(getting frantic)
I don't know!
ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
That you, Easy?
(SILENCE)
Tell us what you want, buddy.
See
what we can work out.
Easy HEARS footsteps coming alongside the house where he had
been moments ago. KABLAAM! BLAAM! Albright has fired from
the inside again, thinking it's him.
EASY
(whispering)
Mouse?
108.
124
CONTINUED:
124
But it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air,
stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. A walking dead
man... EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a
moment the gurgling stops.
ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
Easy... Hey, Buddy
(then to Shariff)
Come on, goddammit!
Daphne cries out and KLABLANGLE! Easy breaks the window
with the gun but KABLAAM! BLAAM! BLAAM! The windowsill
tears out above his head and Daphne screams again.
Easy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as
a shield. He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on
him for the kill. And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's
skull flies off and
MOUSE is in the side door, blasting.
BLAAM!
Albright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him
halfway around but he hurls himself through the window
backwards.
Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The
bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car
and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck.
Albright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the
gravel. Mouse appears on the other side of the house and
CLICK! CLICK! he's out of ammo. He pulls out the other
pistol, but it's too late.
MOUSE
Damn, damn, damn! I hit him!
I
hit him!
Easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front
door.
125
126
He leads her down the front porch and hears.
MOUSE
There's blood all over here... I
got him.
Mouse gets up from squatting down, grinning, the gold rims
of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through
the door. He looks Daphne over, admiring.
MOUSE
Damn.
Sweetheart.
Easy leads her past, quickly.
MOUSE
She okay?
EASY
Yeah.
Let's go.
127
127
Mouse opens the back seat door of the car and Easy sees that
there's no one there.
EASY
Where's Joppy?
And then he looks around quickly, seeing
JOPPY'S BODY lying off on the side of the road.
EASY
What happened?
Mouse shrugs.
MOUSE
I didn't have time to be tying him
up.
Daphne sees the body too and starts gagging. Easy's face
twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to
Daphne's mouth.
EASY
Why, man?
Why?
110.
127
CONTINUED:
127
MOUSE
Why what? You just said don't
shoot him. And I didn't... I
choked his ass...
Easy helps Daphne into the car and closes the door.
EASY
Damn Mouse!
Why?
MOUSE
How I'm gonna help you back there
foolin' 'round with him?
EASY
He was tied up! Why?!
MOUSE
Aw, man. If you didn't want him
kilt you shouldn't have left him
with me.
And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
in.
Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
been in Texas with Mouse's stepfather and brother. Tears of
rage well up in Easy's eyes as he hears the car door close.
DISSOLVE TO:
A128
A128
Daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead,
still in shock.
128
128
A few people hurry to board the train, Easy and Mouse among
them.
EASY (V.O.)
I convinced Mouse to take the two
o'clock train to Pomona and to let
me handle everything else. He
could get a train back to Houston
later that morning... He was fine
with that but only because he was
seven thousand dollars richer.
Daphne had gotten the money out of
a locker at the YMCA without a
word...
(MORE)
111.
128
CONTINUED:
128
EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Because she was still in shock and
couldn't really talk... Maybe too
because she had stolen about four
times that much from Carter.
MOUSE
Listen, if you think you gonna have
trouble with that dude Frank, I can
run by and kill him and take that
evening train to Houston.
EASY
Naw, man.
He has had enough of Mouse for a while.
MOUSE
Oh.
This is for you.
And he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag
from his coat.
MOUSE
I cut you in for half 'cause I knew
you was too big a fool to take your
share from that white girl
yourself.
Easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it.
The conductor gets on board and the train starts making
those metal on metal sounds.
MOUSE
Send my grip to Etta Mae. I'm
gonna see if she'll take me back
now that I'm flush.
He slaps Easy on the shoulder and boards the train.
MOUSE
Oh, here's the keys to Dupree's
car.
He tosses them, and the train starts moving.
MOUSE
And if you need somebody to run
them streets with ya, gimme a call.
You know how to put some money in a
nigga's pocket.
And he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away.
112.
128

128
Easy watches.
EASY (V.O.)
I knew I would see him again and I
didn't know how I felt about
that... 'cause, unlike Mouse, my
legs were like rubber... the way
they had been in the war the whole
two years I was there.
129
129
Easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette, rubbing his aching
chin, looking out at
DAPHNE AND CARTER
standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium. Carter
wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and
forth in anger.
EASY
I could tell how it was gonna go
when Carter asked us to meet him at
the Observatory instead of at his
house... She knew it, too. But she
had come this far and she had to
play it out.
Suddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back
toward the car. Carter follows behind.
CARTER
Daphne!
Daphne, sweetheart!
He starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use.
130
137
Easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the
granite steps.
EASY (V.O.)
I'd been thinking about Daphne,
too... wondering if she meant what
she said about what could have
happened between us... But at the
moment I was wondering if there was
any such thing as a sprained chin.
But other than that and a headache,
a loose tooth and a kidney that a
doctor would need to look at, I
felt like five thousand, three
hundred dollars... And unless
Albright was alive somewhere, that
feelin' was gonna last a while.
O.S. VOICE
Hey, Ezekiel.
115.
137
CONTINUED:
137
Miller and Mason are waiting outside their car at the curb.
They come over.
MILLER
You got some mighty powerful
friends up there... mighty
powerful. But, see, we got a
problem.
Easy listens disinterestedly.
MILLER
(continuing)
With the Chief sealing these things
up like this, it doesn't do much
for the morale of the men who've
been working on these cases.
MASON
Yeah.
Makes 'em feel like shit.
MILLER
There's a guy who's been callin' on
the phone. And we're pretty sure
that he was up there with McGee.
MASON
A... uh... colored guy... sounds
kinda dumb...
MILLER
(correcting)
Not very bright... But he said you
accused him of the murder. And he
swears you were up there, too...
MASON
In fact, he's out and out pointing
the finger at ya.
MILLER
How about a name?
MASON
He'd do it to you...
Easy waits to make sure they're finished, and...
EASY
Sorry, fellas. But I gotta go.
He starts away.
116.
137
CONTINUED:
(2)
137
EASY
(continuing)
Why don't you go back to the
station and, uh... wait around for
my call.
MASON
You son-of-a-bitch... You watch
yourself, you hear! Don't you even
spit on the fucking sidewalk... I
better not even--
Mason's voice fades under.
EASY (V.O.)
It might be the last moment of my
adult life spent free was walking
away from City Hall.
138
138
A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE reads: "Carter Back In Race."
The subheading reads: "Quiet Civic Leader Returns As
Flamboyant Teran Quits."
EASY (V.O.)
The paper treated the mysterious
flip-flop like it happened every
day. And I could tell that Matthew
Teran wouldn't spend a day in
jail... Back in the second section
of the paper was a small article
about an unidentified man found
dead, slumped over the steering
wheel of a white Cadillac just
north of Malibu...
FURTHER BACK, we see that Odell is reading the newspaper,
nursing a can of ale.
EASY (V.O.)
It scared me to think about a world
that could kill a man like DeWitt
Albright... What could a world like
that do to me?
ODELL
Hey, Easy, where's your car?
Easy looks up from pulling weeds.
117.
138
CONTINUED:
138
EASY
In the shop... I'm havin' it fixed
up a little.
ODELL
Yeah. Man can't get no decent job
in this town without a car.
EASY
Shoot.
I ain't studyin' no job.
ODELL
Ain't thinkin' 'bout no job?
How
you gonna live?
EASY
I'm gonna go to work for myself.
Take a little money I got saved up
and go into real estate... Start
fixin' up folks' gardens again...
and do a few favors on the side...
Favors for friends.
ODELL
What you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'?
EASY
Well, like a woman offered me
thirty dollars to go track down her
husband for her.
ODELL
You talkin' about private
investigatin' or somethin'... You
could get in trouble doin' that.
Easy keeps working.
EASY
Like a man once said to me, Odell:
'Walk out your door in the morning
and you're already in trouble'...
It's just how you're mixed up in
that trouble that counts.
Easy gets up and turns on the water hose.
EASY
(continuing)
Odell?
ODELL
Yeah, Easy...
118.
138
CONTINUED:
(2)
138
EASY
If you got a friend that does bad
and you still keep him as your
friend, even though you know what
he's like... Do you think that's
right?
ODELL
All you got is your friends,
Easy...
Easy starts to nod, but then spots
THE WOODCUTTER
hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the
street, his shears ready to cut.
EASY
(calling out)
Get out of that yard!
(to Odell)
Bastard cut down two of my trees.
Easy picks up a rock and sails it. Odell comes off the
porch and does the same. Then a neighbor from across the
street joins in.
THE WOODCUTTER ambles off toward another block, leaving
Easy, Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the
street.
139
UP THE BLOCK
139
a man with a pony is setting up a camera. A few children
have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of
the neighborhood.
The man props up a hand-painted sign, "Cowboy Pictures -- 15
Cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony
positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.
140
BACK TO SCENE
140
Another neighbor joins Easy and company, and they continue
to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at
friends in passing cars.
EASY (V.O.)
I thought about what Odell had said
about friends and it made sense to
me...
(MORE)
119.
140
CONTINUED:
140
EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Odell goes to church every Sunday,
so he would know... Later on, he
challenged me to a game of
dominoes. And what'd he do that
for? We got to talkin' 'bout Texas
and fooled around and drunk almost
a quart of whiskey... And I forgot
about Daphne Monet, DeWitt Albright
and Carter and them... And sat with
my friend, on my porch at my
house... and we laughed a long
time...
FADE OUT.
