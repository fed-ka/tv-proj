ABC/SONY/FANFARE
1.8.10      INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

      A HOT GUY (25, model looks), drinks/laments to his BUDDIES.

                                  HOT GUY
                    She s the perfect girl.  I love 
                    her, guys.  And I never even got to 
                    tell her.  And now it s too late.

      He DRAINS his pint.  Sad beat.  His BUDDY looks at his WATCH.

                                  BUDDY
                    It s not too late yet.  You still 
                    have 20 minutes.  Tell her now.

      Hot Guy looks up, THINKING...the Buddies NOD...then --


      EXT. SPORTS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Hot Guy BURSTS out -- JUMPS in his car -- and PEELS OUT!


      INT. IDYLLIC CHURCH, DRESSING ROOM - SAME

      A perfect bride, ALEX (30, the type of girl guys write songs 
      about), gets ready for her wedding.  Her bridesmaids: JANE 
      (26, motherly) fusses with the GOWN; while PENNY (29, slutty 
      dress, bitterly single) puts on too much make-up.

                                  JANE
                    This is so exciting.  You re gonna 
                    love being married.  It s the best.  
                    Oh, and the house next to me and 
                    Brad just went up for sale, so...  
                          (off Alex s look)
                    I know you re not moving to the 
                    suburbs right away, but when we have 
                    kids, they could be best friends, 
                    maybe they ll even get married!   

                                  ALEX
                    We re sisters.  Our kids would be 
                    cousins.

                                  PENNY
                    I can t believe our whole group of 
                    friends is married now.  Except me 
                    and Max.  At least he s got an 
                    excuse - he s gay, it s illegal - 
                    I m just unlovable.

                                  JANE
                    That s not true.  And what about 
                    that new guy you re dating?  Todd?  
                    I thought things were going great.                                                                                      2.


                                  PENNY
                    No, they are.  I actually invited 
                    him to my birthday next week so 
                    everyone can meet.  I know you all 
                    usually hate the guys I date, but 
                    Todd's different.  I...kinda think 
                    he s the one.

                                  ALEX
                    You know, that term sorta loses 
                    it s meaning when you use it ten 
                    times in a row.
                          (off Penny s glare/smile)
                    I m kidding.  We re excited to meet 
                    him.  But can we do me?  Kinda 
                    makin  a major life step over here.

                                  PENNY
                    Sorry.  But c mon, you re marrying 
                    the perfect guy.  Dave s the best.  
                    Your life s completely set.

      Alex smiles...then her smile begins to FADE --


      INT./EXT. HOT GUY S SPEEDING CAR - LATER

      Hot Guy RACES through the streets of Chicago like the END OF 
      A SHITTY ROMCOM!  He WHIPS around a corner and -- GRIDLOCK!  
      He s TRAPPED in traffic!  He looks around FRANTICALLY -- then 
      spots his ROLLERBLADES on the floor.  Beat.


      INT. IDYLLIC CHURCH - LATER

      Now Alex is on the altar with her nervous groom, DAVE (30, 
      loves love/Springsteen/The Bulls, hates idiots), flanked by: 
      PARENTS; Jane and her husband, BRAD (30, black, works hard/ 
      plays soft); MAX (30, hot, fast talking - like a gay Vince 
      Vaughn); and Penny.  

                                  DAVE
                    Alex, for 20 years you ve been  
                    either my best friend, my  
                      girlfriend, my fiancee, or all  
                    three.  I don t know what I d do 
                    without you.  I literally would not 
                    wanna live.  But luckily, I never 
                    have to think about that again,  
                    cause I get to spend the rest of my --   

      THE DOORS BURST OPEN!  THE CROWD GASPS AS HOT GUY 
        ROLLERBLADES IN!  

                                  HOT GUY
                    STOP!  I object!  Alex, I love you.                                                                                      3.


                                  DAVE
                    Wait, what?  Who is this guy?

                                  HOT GUY
                          (blading toward Alex)
                    Don t do this!  You say all the 
                    time that you re not even sure you 
                    still love him, that he s boring, 
                    that the sex is bad --

                                  DAVE
                          (embarrassed)
                    C mon man, my grandma s here.

                                  HOT GUY
                    Sorry, but - Alex, you deserve 
                    more.  I love you, come with me. 

      Dave LAUGHS arrogantly ( No chance. ).  But when he looks at 
      Alex, she s DEEP IN THOUGHT.  A LONG PREGNANT SILENCE...

      ON THE GROOMSMEN: Brad leans in/whispers to Max.

                                  BRAD
                    Yo, I feel like we re supposed to 
                    kick this guy s ass or something.

                                  MAX
                    You do it.  You re a black guy, he s 
                    probably already afraid of you.

      Finally, Alex turns to Dave.  

                                  ALEX
                    I...I have reservations.

                                  DAVE
                          (hoping against hope)
                    To...a nice restaurant for later?

                                  ALEX
                    No.  About us.  I m so sorry.

      She grabs Hot Guy s hand -- a ROMCOM SCORE IGNITES as they 
      run up the aisle and -- BURST out of the church!  

      WE FOLLOW THEM INTO THE SUNSET AS THE SCORE CRESCENDOES... 
      IT S THE PERFECT HAPPY ENDING TO A SHITTY ROMCOM...!  

      BUT...as they RUN/BLADE toward bliss, we SLOWLY PULL THE 
      CAMERA BACK AWAY FROM THEM...and then BACK INTO THE CHURCH...                                                                                      4.


      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

      FIND Dave on the altar, DESTROYED; flanked by the STUNNED 
      WEDDING PARTY.  This is the story of the OTHER SIDE OF THE 
      HAPPY ENDING.  The place is SILENT.  A COUGH, A WHISPER...  

      Behind Dave, Max/Brad/Jane/Penny exchange LOOKS, prodding 
      each other to say something.  Finally, they all talk 
      SIMULTANEOUSLY (with Max trailing in at the end) --

                                    JANE/BRAD/PENNY
                    She ll be right back./Sorry, man./ 
                    We re all here for you.

                                  MAX
                    That guy probably has a small peen.

        Jane/Brad/Penny look at Max incredulously, then to Dave for a 
      reaction...but Dave just stares ahead, DUMBFOUNDED.  Beat.

                                  DAVE
                    When did my life turn into a Sandra 
                    Bullock movie?


      TITLE CARD: HAPPY ENDINGS                                                                                      5.


      ACT ONE:

      INT./EXT.  HAPPY ENDINGS  DINER - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Brad, Jane, Penny and Max (all in loosened/rumpled wedding 
      clothes) sit around a table, SHOCKED, SILENT.  Long beat.

                                  BRAD
                    Wow.  I mean...wow.  You just don t 
                    see that everyday.  

                                  JANE
                    Who was that guy?  Does anyone know 
                    who that was?

      They all shake their heads no.

                                  PENNY
                    I don t know what s more shocking, 
                    that Alex ran out on her wedding, 
                    or that she did it with a guy who 
                      rollerblades.

                                  MAX
                    Even I think rollerblades are gay 
                    and I had sex with a man last night.

                                  BRAD
                    Has anyone talked to either of 
                    them?  Both their phones are off.

                                  PENNY
                    Dave texted me that he s fine, he 
                    just doesn t wanna talk for awhile.  
                    But he said he s okay.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT./EXT. DAVE S CAR - SAME

      Dave CRIES HYSTERICALLY as he drives!  As CARS pass him, the 
      DRIVERS HONK/SMILE/WAVE at Dave enthusiastically!  

      A SHOT of the back of Dave s car reveals a big SIGN:  HONK! 
      WE JUST GOT MARRIED! 

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      INT.  HAPPY ENDINGS  DINER - AS WE LEFT THEM

                                  PENNY
                    Has anyone heard from Alex?  

                                  JANE
                    She went on the honeymoon.
                          (off their STUNNED LOOKS)
                    It was pre-paid.                                                                                         6.


                                  BRAD
                    What a bitch move.  
                          (off Jane s LOOK)
                    Sorry babe, I love Alex, and I know 
                    she s your sister, but still.  I 
                      mean...it s already on Youtube.

      Brad shows her his iPhone: the CLIP is titled,  LOSER GETS 
      LEFT AT THE ALTAR CAUSE HE SUCKS IN BED .  

                                  HOT GUY (ON YOUTUBE)
                      ...boring, that the sex is bad...

      The WAITRESS approaches with DRINKS -- NOTICES the video.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Oh hey, my friend just sent me 
                    that.  Hilarious, right?

      They GLARE at her.  Beat.  She just puts down 5 shots and 5 
      beers, then retreats away.  BRAD MOVES JANE S DRINKS AWAY.

                                  BRAD
                    You re not drinking, right hun?

                                  JANE
                          (off Max/Penny s looks)
                    Oh yeah, I m getting over a cold.  
                    I ll just have water.  

                                  MAX
                          (raises his shot)
                    Well, here s to the last time we 
                    were ever all together.

                                  JANE
                    C mon, they could still work it out.

      They all look at her incredulously, then down their shots.

                                  MAX
                    You sound like my little brother.  
                    He still thinks mom and her new 
                    husband aren t that serious.  You 
                    really think Dave and Alex can ever 
                    even be in the same room again?  

                                  PENNY
                    This sucks.  
                          (they all nod sadly)
                    And...not to make it about me - but 
                    what about my birthday?  It s 
                    supposed to be at their place.                                                                                        7.


                                  MAX
                    There is no  their place  anymore.
                    Your party s in a week, you ll be 
                    lucky if either even shows.

                                  PENNY
                      But...it s my 30th.  They ve been 
                    at every one of my birthdays since 
                    like 5th grade.  And I need 
                    everyone to meet Todd cause...
                          (scared for their reaction)
                    I kinda wanna bring him on the 
                      Thanksgiving ski trip this year.   

      They all roll their eyes.

                                  BRAD
                    Really?  You re gonna bring another 
                    new dude to Mammoth after what 
                    happened two years ago?   

                                  PENNY
                    We re not positive he stole your 
                    identity, Brad.

      Everyone looks at her skeptically.  Max grabs Jane s shot.

                                  MAX
                    Twenty bucks there s no trip this 
                    year anyway.  Trust me, this is 
                    just like when my folks split.
                          (downs Jane s shot)
                    We re gonna shuffle between them 
                    for awhile, they ll get pissed we 
                    still love the other one, we ll all 
                    start hating each other, then 
                      eventually we ll gain 15 pounds, 
                    drop out of college, and turn gay.

                                  JANE

                          (to Penny)
                    Why don t you have your party at 
                    our place?  It ll be my first 
                    chance to host in the new house.

                                  PENNY

                    three DUIs away.  Maybe I just 
                    won t have a birthday this year.  

                                  JANE

                    party.  I ll find a good place.

                                  JANE (cont'd)
                    I already made t-shirts that say 
                     Hang Ten .  C mon, everything s 
                    gonna be totally fine.  Right?

      They re all silent.  Jane looks at Brad PRODDINGLY -- 

                                  BRAD
                    Oh yeah, totally.  Fine.  In a 
                    couple months we ll be like,  What 
                      ...runaway bride situation?   
                          (beat)
                    Just chillax everyone, okay?  Let s 
                    take this one step at a time.  
                    Right now we should really just 
                    worry about Dave. 

                                  MAX
                    Right now we should really just 
                    worry about you saying  chillax .  
                    Give Dave a few days.  He s a guy, 
                    I m sure he s fine.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DAVE AND ALEX S APARTMENT - DAY?

      Springsteen s  She s the One  BLARES in the MESSY room: 
      SHADES drawn; PHOTOS/BOTTLES/WRAPPING PAPER strewn everywhere 
      - the place is PACKED with UNWRAPPED/OPENED WEDDING GIFTS.  

      FIND Dave (tux, tie undone, disheveled) on the couch, blanket 
      over his lap.  He SINGS ALONG as he OPENS GIFTS and arranges 
      a FANCY PLACE SETTING on the coffee table with some of them 
      (plate, silverware, napkin, etc.).

                                    DAVE/SPRINGSTEEN
                      Whoa...she s the one!  SHE S THE --

      KNOCK! KNOCK!  Dave MUTES the music with the remote and gets 
      very QUIET.  A key UNLOCKS the door -- he stands up HOPEFUL...  

                                  DAVE
                    Alex?

        Penny/Jane/Max/Brad (always in a SUIT) enter gingerly.  Dave s 
      blanket DROPS -- reveal WHITE BRIEFS (he s in half the tux).    

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Oh...hey guys.  What s up?

      They look around, AMAZED by the mess.  [ITALICS = BABY VOICE]  

                                  JANE
                    Hey, sweetie.  How...are you?                                                                                      9.


                                  DAVE
                    You know, pretty good.  I came up 
                    with an awesome new drink.  Who 
                    wants to be the first customer to 
                    try my world famous beer float?

      He grabs a BLENDER out of a gift box, scoops ICE CREAM into 
      it, pours BEER over it, then holds it out to them.  Beat. 

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Side bar: thanks for the blender, 
                    Penny.

                                  BRAD
                          (re: beer float)
                    No thanks, pal.  Neat idea though.  
                    So...is that what you ve been up to 
                    all week?

                                  DAVE
                          (surprised)
                    It s been a week?

                                  PENNY
                    Dave, I hope you know you re a 
                    catch.  I d marry you in a second - 
                    I mean - a million girls would 
                    marry you in a second.  This was 
                    probably a really good thing.

                                  MAX
                          (looks at Penny cross)
                    Yeah, it s totally a good thing 
                    that you got humiliated in front of 
                    everyone you know and Youtube.

                                  DAVE
                    It s on Youtube?

                                  MAX
                    Dave, the truth is, your wedding 
                    really sucked.  But there is one 
                    positive: you re single.  So - even 
                    though I like the whole Donald Duck 
                    look - why don t you go throw on 
                    some pants - preferably not your 
                    tux pants - probably a whole new 
                    outfit - and let s go get you laid.  

                                  DAVE
                    I don t wanna get laid.  I wanna 
                    get married.  To Alex.

                                  MAX
                    I don t think that s really on the 
                    table anymore, champ.                                                                                    10.


      Dave DROPS back down on the couch, destroyed.  A TOASTER 
      (gift) DINGS!  Dave pulls out a piece of TOAST, takes a sad 
      bite.

                                  DAVE
                    I don t get it.  What did I do?  Did 
                    she tell you guys the sex was bad?  
                      I might ve gotten a little lazy 
                    recently, but bad is pretty strong.   

      Dave sips the beer float -- RECOILS DISGUSTED, then wipes his 
      mouth with the LINEN NAPKIN from the place setting.

                                  JANE
                      You re...probably gonna have to 
                    return this stuff, honey.

      Dave BLOWS his nose into the napkin.  

                                  BRAD
                    Listen, you don t have to get laid, 
                    but you really should get outta the 
                    house.  How bout some food?

                                  DAVE
                    I just ate two pizzas and most of 
                    the world s largest chocolate bride.

      They look left to see -- an FAO SCHWARTZ SIZED CHOCOLATE 
      GROOM and the DISEMBOWELED BOTTOM HALF OF THE BRIDE.  Beat. 

                                  MAX
                    I got it!  Strip club.  Right now.

                                  DAVE
                    No, I hate strippers.  I always 
                    make up really depressing back-
                    stories for them in my head.  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. STRIP CLUB - FLASHBACK

      Dave s SO UNCOMFORTABLE as he gets a lap dance from a 
      STRIPPER.  As she GRINDS him, we hear her (imagined) INNER 
      MONOLOGUE.

                                  STRIPPER (V.O.)
                    I was born in the backseat of a 
                    Miata on the El Paso border.  We 
                    were poor, but I didn t know it... 
                    til my dad traded me to his friend 
                    Ron for a pack of whippits --

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:                                                                                    11.


      INT. DAVE AND ALEX S APARTMENT - AS WE LEFT THEM

      Dave lies back down on the couch, defeated, and pulls a nice 
      blanket (GIFT TAG visible) over himself.  

                                  DAVE
                      I appreciate what you re doing 
                    guys, but I think I m gonna lay low 
                    for awhile.  I mean, just in 
                      case...well, she might call or 
                      something.

      Beat.  The friends don t know what to do.

                                  BRAD
                          (blurts out)
                    She went on the honeymoon with the 
                      rollerblade guy. 

                                  JANE
                    Brad.
                          (to Dave)
                    It was...pre-paid.

      They all look to Dave, awaiting his reaction...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. LOUD BAR - LATER

      Dave DOWNS two shots quickly, GETTING DRUNK!

                                  DAVE
                    What the hell, guys?!  I mean, 
                      seriously, what the HELL!?

        Brad/Penny/Jane look on, CONCERNED.  Max drinks with him.  

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    You know what, though?  Whatevs, 
                    I m over it.  Max is right, I m 
                    single - which is awesome - and 
                    like Penny said, I m a catch.  I 
                    just wanna go back to normal right 
                    away, okay guys?  It s all good.

                                  JANE
                          (SUPER baby voice)
                    Don t bury your emotions, honey.

                                  DAVE
                    You gotta stop talking to me like I 
                    just got back from Iraq.  You re 
                    making it worse.  I m moving on!  

      He puts up his beer -- Max CHEERS-ES it hard!                                                                                    12.


                                  MAX
                    There he is!  Now pick a girl and 
                    give her two tickets to bangtown.

                                  PENNY
                    You shouldn t just jump into bed 
                    with some slut, Dave.  You re too 
                    good for that.

                                  DAVE
                    I don t know that I am, Pen.

                                  MAX
                    He s not.  And getting laid s the 
                    best medicine for him right now.  
                    It s like...penis-cillin.  Hey-o!

                                  PENNY
                    Nice one, Leno.

                                  DAVE
                    It s not that easy though, Max. 
                    You re a gay guy, you can get laid 
                    in the bathroom of a Barnes and 
                    Noble.  It s a lot harder to 
                    convince a girl to have sex --

      Max GRABS the next HOT GIRL (very young/hot) that walks by.

                                  MAX
                    Whoa darlin, slow up.  I wanna 
                    introduce you to the best French 
                    kisser in Chicago.  Legit.  He s 
                    won a couple Tongue-y s.  Which is 
                    like the Oscar for Frenching.    

                                  HOT GIRL
                          (smiles flirty at Max)
                    You re funny.

                                  MAX
                    I m gay.  But Dave s the straight  
                    me.  And the Jewish me.  Which 
                    means he controls the liberal 
                    media.  So, French it up!

      Hot Girl looks at Dave.  Beat.  DAVE DRUNKENLY LEANS IN... --

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Um, thanks, but...

                                  DAVE
                    Oh, I understand, nice to meet --                                                                                    13.


                                  BRAD
                          (steps in to help)
                    Have you seen the Youtube video 
                    where the guy gets humiliated at 
                    the altar?  

      Jane shoots Brad a look, upset he s helping.

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Yeah, that s hilarious.  I feel 
                    sooo bad for that guy.

      Max/Brad point at Dave.  Dave smiles, embarrassed.  Beat.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      DAVE AND HOT GIRL DIRTY-DANCE DRUNKENLY ON THE DANCE FLOOR!

      MEANWHILE ACROSS THE ROOM, PAN DOWN THE LINE of friends 
      watching: Penny (frowns)...Jane (shakes her head)...Brad 
      (suppresses a smile)...Max (dances in place).

                                  JANE
                    Can we let this happen?  I feel 
                    like he s cheating on Alex.  Or... 
                    we re cheating on Alex.

                                  MAX
                    Alex is in Cabo doing body shots 
                    off another dude.

                                  JANE
                    You really shouldn t have told him 
                    she went on the honeymoon, Brad.  
                    It makes her look bad.  

                                  BRAD
                    Alex looks bad because she s doing 
                    bad stuff.  That s like saying John 
                    Mayer s songs are making John Mayer 
                    look bad.

                                  PENNY
                    I love her Janey, but even I can t 
                    defend her on this one.

                                  JANE
                          (looking out at the dance 
                            floor)
                    He does look happy...

      THEIR POV: Hot Girl s bent over, GRINDING her ass into Dave s 
      crotch as he gives the friends a GOOFY THUMBS UP!  He looks 
      down at Hot Girl s TRAMP STAMP:  STAY GROUNDED .  He ROLLS 
      HIS EYES at the idiocy, but then YELLS OVER THE LOUD MUSIC --                                                                                    14.


                                  DAVE
                    I LOVE YOUR TATTOO!

                                  HOT GIRL
                    It really just reminds me to STAY 
                    GROUNDED!  

                                  DAVE
                    That s the dumbest thing I ve ever 
                    heard!

                                  HOT GIRL
                    WHAT?

                                  DAVE
                      I said...I LOVE STAYING GROUNDED!

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. DAVE AND ALEX S APARTMENT - LATER

      Dave and Hot Girl BURST in, MAKING OUT MADLY -- KNOCKING into 
      gifts as they BOUNCE around the room UNDRESSING!

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Do you have a condom?

                                  DAVE
                    Oh, wow.  Nice.  Um...I m not sure.  
                    I haven t used one in like 10 years.
                          (she STOPS, SO FREAKED)
                    Oh, no, not like that.  I just - 
                    meant cause I ve been in a 
                    committed relationship.  I don t 
                    have AIDS.  Or...warts.
                          (off her weird look)
                    I m sure I can find one.

      She tackles him O.S. onto the couch -- leaving the CAMERA ON 
      A PHOTO OF DAVE AND ALEX LAMELY POSING ON THE SLOPES HAPPILY.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

      Hot Girl SNORES LOUDLY on Dave s chest in his bed.  He STARES 
      at the ceiling.  The doorbell RINGS.  He SLIDES out carefully 
      and trudges to the FRONT DOOR, HUNGOVER.  He opens it to... 
      ALEX (tan, Bo Derek BRAIDS).  He s FLOORED.  Long beat.

                                  ALEX
                    Hi.

                                  DAVE
                    Hi?  That s what you re going with?

      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


      ACT TWO:

      INT. DAVE AND ALEX S APARTMENT - AS WE LEFT THEM

      Dave and Alex stare at each other in the doorway.

                                  ALEX
                    Dave, I - I m so sorry.  I didn t 
                    mean to do that...to you.

                                  DAVE
                    So, is that guy like your boyfriend 
                    now?

                                  ALEX
                    Who, Bo?  

                                  DAVE
                    Of course his name s Bo.  I bet he 
                    smells like Axe Body Spray.

                                  ALEX
                    He s not my boyfriend.  We barely 
                    even know each other.  We flirted a 
                    little at work, I guess - had some 
                    smokes - but I don t know why he 
                    thought I d run away with him.

                                  DAVE
                      Uh...cause you did?

                                  ALEX
                    No, I didn t.  I ran away with... 
                    myself.  The truth is, I was having 
                    second thoughts for awhile - things 
                    just weren t the same between us.  
                    But I didn t have the guts to say 
                    anything.  Then when Bo ran in --

                                  DAVE
                    You mean, rollerbladed in.

                                  ALEX
                    Right.  I thought it was a sign, or 
                    maybe it was just the out I needed.  
                    In a weird way, him breaking up the 
                    wedding was a good thing.

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah, tell him thanks for me.  And 
                    ask him if he enjoyed my honeymoon.  
                          (re: Alex s hair)
                    I can t believe you got the white- 
                    trash tourist braids.  I feel like 
                    I don t even know you anymore.                                                                                    16.


                                  ALEX
                    Bo didn t go with me.  I went 
                    alone.  It was...pre-paid.  I never 
                    cheated on you.  I loved you.  I 
                    don t know - Can t we just go back 
                    to being friends for now?  You said 
                    if we tried to take it to the next 
                    level and it didn t work, we could 
                    go back to being friends.

                                  DAVE
                    That was like 9 years ago!  And I 
                    was just trying to sleep with you.
                          (shakes his head)
                    You were the only girl I ever even 
                    liked.  I literally can t even 
                    picture myself with another girl 
                    ever again for the rest of my life --

      BEHIND HIM, Hot Girl enters NAKED.

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Have you seen my tongue ring?  I 
                    hope I didn t swallow another one.

      Alex is SHOCKED/HURT.  Dave goes RED.


      INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY

      Penny SPRINTS on a treadmill, DRIPPING SWEAT/GRUNTING!

                                  PENNY
                    Ugh!  Ugh!  So, he s moving out?

      PAN RIGHT to reveal Alex and Jane WALKING SLOWLY on their 
        treadmills/drinking smoothies, AMAZED at Penny s intensity.

                                  ALEX
                    I told him he could stay for a 
                    little, but he said no.  I feel 
                    bad, but...I own the place.

                                  PENNY
                    You re really doing a complete tear-
                    down on his entire life.

                                  ALEX
                    Well...he already moved on.  He had 
                    sex with the trashiest girl I ve 
                    ever seen.  In our bed.

                                  PENNY
                          (really disappointed)
                    He slept with the tongue ring girl?                                                                                    17.


                                  ALEX
                    You know her?

                                  PENNY
                    They met at the bar last night.

                                  ALEX
                    Wait, so you guys stood by and let 
                    him go home with another girl?

                                  JANE
                    You don t really have a leg to 
                    stand on right now, Alex.

      Alex knows they re right.  Penny INCREASES her speed -- she s 
      GRUNTING SO LOUD NOW!  Other GYM-GOERS look over oddly.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Jesus, Pen, take it easy.

                                  PENNY
                    Hey, you re married.  I still gotta 
                      advertise.  Welcome back to the 
                    single life by the way, Al.  I hope 
                    you like cardio, cause it s gotten 
                    really competitive out there.  
                    C mon --

      Penny SLAPS off her machine, jumps down.  Alex/Jane follow.

                                  PENNY (CONT D)
                    While you ve been spooning for ten 
                    years, the whole game changed.
                          (motions at SCANTILY CLAD GIRLS)
                    They re all sluts now.  A guy 
                    doesn t even have to call anymore.  
                    A text at midnight is basically a 
                    romantic dinner for two.  So I hope 
                    you re ready to put out.

      Alex s POV: HOT YOUNG GIRLS EVERYWHERE.  She s a bit WORRIED.  
      Penny lies down at a BENCH PRESS and starts LIFTING HARD.

                                  PENNY (CONT D)
                    You shoulda married Dave.  I mean, 
                    he s a great guy, he s good 
                    looking, he s your best friend...  

                                  ALEX
                    I wasn t sure we were...still in love.

                                  PENNY
                    That is love.  It s not gonna feel 
                    like  The Notebook.   Trust me, 
                    there s nothing better out there.  
                    It s mostly poor guys with weird 
                    sexual stuff.  And Dave s awesome.                                                                                    18.


                                  ALEX
                    Then you marry him.

                                  PENNY
                          (forces a laugh/belying 
                            feelings)
                    Yeah, right - that s hilarious.  
                    Besides -  
                          (sing songy)
                    Todd and I had our first sleepover 
                    and it was awesome.  
                          (sits up, excited)
                    I can t wait for you guys to meet 
                    him tonight.  And don t worry Al, 
                    Jane got us the room at Gibson s.  
                    We figured you probably wouldn t 
                    wanna have my party at your place 
                    anymore.

                                  ALEX
                          (suddenly realizes)
                    Oh my god - today s your birthday.  
                    I m so sorry.  I completely forgot.  
                          (scared of Penny s response)
                      Happy...birthday?

                                  PENNY
                    Don t worry.  It s totally okay.  
                    You ve got a lot going on right 
                    now.  I completely understand.

                                  ALEX
                          (surprised)
                    You do?  Wow.  Thanks.  Well...in 
                    that case, do you think it s okay 
                    if I don t come tonight?  I 
                      kinda...just don t wanna deal with 
                    Dave and everyone.

                                  PENNY
                          (suddenly pissed)
                    Really!?  It s bad enough you 
                    didn t even remember my 30th 
                    birthday - and I was so cool about 
                    that by the way - but now you re 
                    not even gonna come to my party?!

      Alex is SURPRISED by the anger, she looks to Jane for help -- 
      but Jane s pissed too.

                                  JANE
                    Seriously Al.  I mean, this isn t 
                    just about this party.  It s about 
                    if we re still even gonna be a 
                    group of friends anymore.  Or are 
                    we just, like, six separate people 
                    that don t go to each other s 
                      birthdays?                                                                                    19.


      Alex is STUNNED.  A HOT GIRL (19, half naked) approaches.

                                  HOT YOUNG GIRL
                    Excuse me ma am, are you done with 
                    that machine?

                                  PENNY
                          (looks at her sadly)
                    Ma am?

      Penny STORMS off.  Jane follows.  Alex is at a loss.


      INT. DAVE AND ALEX S APARTMENT - SAME

      Dave/Max/Brad finish packing BOXES.  Dave SLOWLY puts STUFF 
      in a box, PAUSING on each thing.  Max/Brad are uncomfortable.  
      Max has to lighten the mood - he holds up a SPRINGSTEEN CD -- 

                                  MAX
                    No Springsteen s leaving this house!
                          (off their ODD LOOKS)
                    St. Elmo s Fire?  When Sheedy s 
                    moving out of Judd Nelson s loft?

                                  BRAD
                          (rolls his eyes at Max)
                      So...Dave, you sure you don t wanna 
                    stay with me and Jane?

                                  DAVE
                    No thanks.  I m single now,  I 
                    can t live in the suburbs.  I m 
                    gonna just crash with Max.

                                  MAX
                    It ll be like college again.  
                    Except now I like dudes, so you 
                    might actually get some girls.

      Dave laughs a little, goes back to packing SLOWLY/FORLORNLY.

                                  BRAD
                    Everyone knocks the burbs, but we 
                    love it.  It s quiet, homeless guys 
                    don t piss on your car...and kids 
                    that are raised in the city grow up 
                    too fast.  My boss  son got caught 
                    doing blow at his Bar Mitzvah.

                                  MAX
                    Are you guys already talking about 
                    putting a baby in Jane?

                                  BRAD
                          (hiding something)
                    No...but it s the logical next step.                                                                                    20.


                                  MAX
                    Your kids are gonna look amazing.  
                    Half black is god s photoshop.

                                  BRAD
                    Why do you think I married white?  
                    Now c mon, let s go, I gotta get 
                    back to the office.  And I still 
                    need to grab Penny a present, too.  
                    What do you get the girl that hates 
                      everything?  Maybe I ll do the 
                    funny gift thing.  I ve always 
                    wanted to try that.  

                                  MAX
                    Sweet idea, Leno.  I made her a 
                    card.

                                  BRAD
                    What re you, five?
                          (to Dave)
                      So...you re comin tonight, right?  
                    It s gonna be at Gibsons now.  And 
                    Penny s bringing a new dude, which 
                    is always interesting.

                                  MAX
                    Of course he s coming.  

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah, of course I am.  Why wouldn t 
                    I?  Cause of Alex?  I bet she 
                    doesn t even have the balls to 
                    show.  Not that it would matter to 
                    me if she did.  I m good.  Besides, 
                    Penny might legit murder me if I 
                    don t come.  She seems a little on 
                    edge about turning 30, right?

                                  MAX
                    What?  No way.  Do people actually 
                    care about that kinda thing?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. EQUINOX, LOCKER ROOM - LATER

      Penny CRIES HYSTERICALLY on a bench as Jane consoles her.

                                  JANE
                    Trust me honey, you do not look 
                    like a ma am at all.

      Alex enters.  Penny/Jane GLARE at her in the mirror.  Penny 
      wipes her eyes, then gets up and starts changing.                                                                                    21.


                                  PENNY
                    I m sorry Al, but...I just want 
                    things to be like they always were.  
                    I want all my friends at my 
                    birthday, happy and drunk.  And I 
                    want everyone to meet Todd and tell 
                    me he s great and that he can come 
                    to Mammoth with us, and that I m 
                    not gonna die alone, surrounded by 
                    pillows crocheted with 
                      inspirational sayings.

                                  ALEX
                          (laughs)
                    Wow, you really think this guy s 
                    marriage material?

                                  PENNY
                    Yeah, but the last guy I thought 
                    that about stole Brad s identity.

                                  ALEX
                    That dude had obvious red flags you 
                    shoulda seen from the beginning.

                                  PENNY
                    That s not true.

                                  ALEX
                    You met him at a Planned Parenthood.

                                  PENNY
                    It was outside a Planned 
                      Parenthood.  And I didn t realize 
                    he was coming from there.
                          (shakes her head, sits)
                    You re right.  I m an idiot.

                                  ALEX
                      Well...that s what we re here for.  
                    I ll tell you within five minutes 
                    tonight if he s the one, or if you 
                    should lock up your valuables.

                                  PENNY
                          (beat, looks up happy)
                    Really?  You ll come?  Even if Dave 
                    comes too?

      Jane smiles at Alex -- she smiles back, BARELY HIDING HER FEAR.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  I mean...what s the big deal?
                          (Penny HUGS her huge)
                    So where d you meet Todd?  Outside 
                    a prison?  At a Klan rally?                                                                                        22.


                                  PENNY
                    Ha, ha.  No, this was legit.  We 
                    met on JDate.

                                  JANE
                          (exchanges a look with Alex)
                      Don t...you have to be Jewish to be 
                    on that?


      EXT. DAVE AND ALEX S BUILDING - LATER

      Dave/Max/Brad load the boxes into Dave s car.

                                  DAVE
                          (trying to be nonchalant)
                    So...do you know if Alex is gonna 
                    be there, though?  
                          (faux tough)
                    Not that I care at all. 

                                  BRAD
                          (sensing Dave s reluctance)
                    I don t know, man.  But...hey, 
                    everyone would really understand if 
                    you can t handle going.

                                  DAVE
                          (scoffs, slams the trunk)
                    You kidding me?  Alex can t handle 
                    going.  I can totally handle it.  
                    I m gonna handle it like an adult.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. GIBSON S RESTAURANT, FRONT BAR - THAT NIGHT

      Jane/Max/Alex drink at the bar, when -- 

                                  DAVE (O.S.)
                      Whaaazzzuuup!?

      They turn to see Dave walk in...with the hot tongue ring girl 
      he slept with, JACKIE (slutty top, Ed Hardy hat), on his arm.  

      Alex s mouth drops, AMAZED/HURT/PISSED.  Jane/Max look at each 
      other SHOCKED/UNCOMFORTABLE.  Dave HI-FIVES Max awkwardly.


      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    23.


      ACT THREE:

      INT. GIBSON S RESTAURANT, FRONT BAR - AS WE LEFT THEM

      Alex looks Jackie up and down as Dave introduces her.

                                  DAVE 
                    Max, Jane - you remember Jackie 
                    from the other night. 

      They say hello awkwardly.  Dave acts surprised to see Alex.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Hey!  I didn t know you were coming 
                    to this.  I guess you two already 
                    sorta met, but this is Jackie, my... 
                          (to Jackie)
                    I don t know what to call us.  My 
                      kinda...girlfriend?

                        ALEXJACKIE
          Girlfriend?Girlfriend?

      Jackie BLUSHES/SMILES.  Dave KISSES her with A LOT OF TONGUE 
      right in Alex's face.  Max DOWNS his whiskey, leans to Jane.

                                  MAX
                    This is just like when my mom 
                    brought her new boyfriend to my 
                    21st birthday party.

                                  JANE
                    How d it end?

                                  MAX
                    My dad shot himself.

                                  JANE
                    What?!

                                  MAX
                    Not to death.  In the hand.  It was 
                    a hunting party.  Total accident.  
                    But he was distracted by everything.

      Jane pulls over the WAITER, talks to him quietly.

                                  JANE
                    Listen, I need vodka in a water 
                    glass with ice.  I m gonna keep 
                    ordering  water  from you all 
                    night, okay?   Water  means vodka.

                                  WAITER
                    ...Okay.

      Waiter exits.  Now everyone just stands there AWKWARDLY.                                                                                    24.


                                  ALEX
                      So...Jackie, I love your hat.

                                  JACKIE
                          (oblivious)
                    Thanks.  It s Ed Hardy.

                                  DAVE
                          (glares at Alex)
                    What re you wearing that s so great?

      Jackie s confused.  Max/Jane exchange an uncomfortable look.

                                  PENNY (O.S.)
                    Hey everybody!

      They turn to see -- Penny enter with her date, TODD (25, hot).

                                  JANE
                    Happy birthday!
                          (whispers to Alex/Dave)
                    You guys should really try and keep 
                    it together for Penny s sake!

      Alex/Dave put up their hands  innocently .  The Waiter hands 
      Jane her  water  as Penny and Todd approach the group.  

                                  PENNY
                    Hey guys!  Um, so...this is Todd.  
                    This is Alex, Jane, Max, Dave and --

      Penny s STUNNED to see Jackie there.  She glances at Alex.

                                  JACKIE
                    Jackie.  Dave's girlfriend.

      Max DOWNS his drink.  Jane takes a BIG GULP off her  water .

                                  TODD
                    Penny s told me so much about you 
                    guys.  It s awesome that you ve had 
                    such a close group of friends for 
                    so long.  That s really special.  
                          (to Penny)
                    I m just gonna run to the men s real 
                    quick and wash my hands, okay babe?

      He KISSES her, exits.  Penny SMILES WIDE to the group.

                                  PENNY
                    So...?  Isn t he amazing?

      Alex doesn t respond, her eyes are locked on Dave, who is ALL 
      OVER Jackie.  Jane tries to pick up the slack --

                                  JANE
                    He seems really great.  Super hot.                                                                                    25.


                                  MAX
                    Gay.  I mean, he also seems really 
                    great and super hot, but he s gayer 
                    than Hugh Jackman s boyfriend.  

                                  PENNY
                    We ve been dating for a month.  I 
                    think I d know if he was gay.

                                  MAX
                    You didn t know I was gay.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. COLLEGE MAX S DORMROOM - FLASHBACK

      COLLEGE MAX and COLLEGE PENNY make out on his bed.  She 
      DRIFTS down on him...he just SMILES, then GAZES to his left -- 
      at an EVANDER HOLYFIELD POSTER (shirt off, glistening). 

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      INT. GIBSON S RESTAURANT, FRONT BAR - AS WE LEFT THEM

                                  MAX
                    I m just looking out for you, Pen. 
                    Trust me, I can tell.  C mon, what 
                    straight guy ever washes his hands?

      Penny glares at him -- Todd comes back in.

                                  TODD
                    Sorry, it s just so hard to get the 
                    soot off.  I m a volunteer fireman.

      Max EYES Penny ( See. ) -- she GLARES back ( What? ).  Then --

                                  BRAD (O.S.)
                    Happy birthday party people!  

      They all turn -- Brad (suit) enters carrying a WALKER (with a 
      BOW, and a NOVELTY LICENSE PLATE hooked to it:  30 )!

                                  BRAD (CONT D)
                    Sorry, had to work late.
                          (hands Penny the walker)
                    Get it?  Cause...30 s old?  It s 
                    funny, right?

                                  MAX
                    Not really, Leno.

                                  TODD
                          (to Penny)
                      I...thought you were turning 26.

      Everyone looks at Penny, SURPRISED.  She GLARES at Brad --                                                                                    26.


                                  PENNY
                    I am.

                                  BRAD
                    Oh...did I say 30?  I misspoke.  And 
                      mis...purchased the wrong novelty 
                    license plate.  That should say 26.

      Awkward beat.

                                  JACKIE
                    I can t wait to be 26.  I feel like 
                    no one takes you seriously when 
                    you re still in high school.

      Dave SPITS/COUGHS his drink out, BLOWN AWAY!  Everyone s 
      STUNNED.  Beat.  Jane SIGNALS the waiter.

                                  JANE
                    Another water when you get a chance.


      INT. GIBSON S RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

      They eat/drink in TENSE SILENCE at a round table.  Silverware 
      CLINKS.  Penny leans in/WHISPERS to Alex --  

                                  PENNY
                    So...what do you think of Todd?  Any 
                    red flags?  He s not gay, right?

                                  ALEX
                          (not listening to Penny)
                    So Jackie, what do you wanna be 
                    when you grow up?

                                  JACKIE
                    Well, I either wanna be a 
                      veterinarian, or on a reality show.

                                  ALEX
                    Wow.

                                  DAVE
                    You know what I love about you, 
                    Jackie?  Whatever you decide to do, 
                    you ll really do it.  You won t  
                    just say you ll do it, and then 
                      rollerblade away at the last second.

                                  ALEX
                    Well, unless you get to vet school 
                    and you suddenly realize,  Wow, I 
                    don t love animals anymore.  They 
                    totally take me for granted. 

      Jackie/Todd are CONFUSED.  SILENT BEAT.  Jane whispers to Brad --                                                                                    27.


                                  JANE
                    Say something.

                                  BRAD
                          (to Penny and Todd)
                    So, where d you two lovebirds meet?

                                  TODD
                    JDate.  We just instantly connected.

                                  BRAD
                    Oh, I thought you had to be Jewish 
                    to go on that thing.

                                  TODD
                    I am Jewish.

                                  BRAD
                    No, I meant --
                          (off Penny s LOOK)
                    Penny s also Jewish.

      Penny tries to smile through.  Max puts his ARM AROUND Todd.

                                  MAX
                    I love Jewish guys.  Like that Shia 
                    Lebouf.  I d love to connect with 
                    him on JDate.  Scale of 1 to 10: 
                    69, am I right, T?

                                  TODD
                          (wiggles free, confused)
                    I m more of a Megan Fox guy, bro --

      Jane HOPS UP/CLINKING her glass, trying to save with a toast --

                                  JANE
                    It really is all about connecting 
                    though, isn t it, Todd?  Great to 
                    finally meet you.  You guys are so 
                    cute together.  And happy birth --      

                                  DAVE
                          (stands up toasting, drunk)
                      I couldn t have said it better 
                    myself.  But I would throw in one 
                    caveat, Todd.  Which is that you 
                    never know when someone else is 
                    gonna come in and connect with the 
                    person you already connected with, 
                    and then you re the jackass on 
                    Youtube that --

                                  BRAD
                          (jumps up, trying to save)
                    I think what my pal s trying to say 
                    is that love is a four letter word --                                                                                    28.


                                  ALEX
                          (stands up toasting)
                    You know Todd, Dave has a point.  
                    Things change.  You can t just go 
                    through the motions.  You gotta 
                    work at the relationship.  Don t 
                    wear sweatpants everyday and only 
                    focus on yourself in bed.

                                  TODD
                    ...Okay.

      Penny drops her head, defeated.

                                  DAVE
                    I m a very caring lover!  And all I 
                    did was work on our relationship!   
                    You re the most high-maintenance 
                    person on the planet.  You make Mariah 
                    Carey look like...Maya Angelou. 
                          (off everyone s odd looks)
                    I m assuming she s low maintenance.

                                  JACKIE
                    Wait, so...Alex is the runaway bride?

                                  ALEX
                    Yes, genius, I m the runaway bride!  
                    I ruined everything for everyone!  I 
                    know you all want some great 
                      explanation, but all I can tell you 
                    is that two minutes before I was 
                    supposed to walk out there, Jane was 
                    talking to me about kids and the 
                    suburbs, and I just had this image 
                    of myself as a fat soccer mom in a 
                    minivan and...I freaked out.  Then 
                    Bo rollerbladed in and - that s all 
                    I got, okay!?  I m sorry everyone!    

                                  DAVE
                    Really great bridesmaid work, Jane.

                                  JANE
                    You know Dave, if a few sentences 
                    can make a girl run out on your 
                    wedding, you re not really on solid 
                    ground in the first place.

                                  DAVE
                    You re not on solid ground!

                                  BRAD
                    Whoa everybody.  C mon, this is a b-
                    day celebration, not a dirty laundry 
                    ...mat.  Todd must think we re nuts.  
                    Alex, we ll work it out, okay?  
                    Breathe, have some water.                                                                                    29.


      Brad grabs Jane s  WATER  and hands it to Alex -- she GULPS 
      it and -- COUGHS/SPITS it out all over the place!

                                  ALEX
                    What the hell!?  That s all vodka!

                                  BRAD
                    What?  Jane, why are you drinking?

                                  MAX
                    Why do you care all of a sudden?

                                  BRAD
                    Because we re trying to have a baby!

                                  JANE
                    You re not supposed to tell anyone! 
                    It s bad luck!

                                  BRAD
                    It s also bad luck to drink vodka.  
                    Unless you like Downs Syndrome!

                                  JANE
                    God, you re so uptight!  You don t 
                    have to quit drinking when you re 
                    trying.  Drinking s how most people 
                    get pregnant in the first place.  
                    But nooo, you gotta do everything 
                    by the book.  You re like the 
                    whitest black guy in the world!
                          (chugs her  water  in his face)
                    I don t wanna have a baby right now, 
                    okay?  I did - when I thought Alex 
                    and Dave were gonna have one too, 
                    and live next door - but now we re 
                    all alone.  And you always work 
                    late, and I hate the suburbs and I 
                    don t wanna be a SOCCER MOM EITHER!

      Jane STORMS OUT!  They re all STUNNED (she s not a yeller).  

                                  BRAD
                      Well...you coulda told me all that 
                    before we JUST BOUGHT A FOUR 
                    BEDROOM HOUSE!

      Brad GLARES at Alex/Dave, then goes after Jane angrily.

                                  DAVE
                    Nice work, Al.  You re the Michael 
                    Jordan of destroying marriages.

                                  ALEX
                      Well...you re the Michael Jordan of 
                    banging high school sluts!  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  ALEX (cont'd)
                    Seriously Dave, she s wearing an Ed 
                    Hardy hat.  Have some self-respect!

                                  JACKIE
                    GOD, YOU GUYS ARE ALL SO IMMATURE!

      Jackie gets up to leave, pauses, THROWS her drink in Alex s 
      face, then STORMS OUT!  Dave looks at Alex, DRENCHED.  Beat.

       Happy birthday to you... .  WAITERS enter SINGING.  They put 
      a CAKE in front of Penny.  Todd looks at it:  HAPPY 30TH!   

                                  TODD
                    Wait, so you are 30, or 26?

                                  PENNY
                          (fed up)
                    I m 30...and Catholic...and I M 
                    GONNA DIE ALONE!     

      Penny SWEEPS the cake off the table and storms out!  The 
      Waiters RETREAT slowly/oddly.  Now it s Todd/Max/Alex/Dave.

                                  TODD
                    I m...so confused right now.

                                  MAX
                    I know you are.  I ve been there.  
                    But at some point - couple weeks, 
                    couple years - you re gonna figure 
                    out, Hey, I like dudes.  
                          (puts his CARD in Todd's pocket)
                    When that happens, gimme a shout.  
                    We ll get some beers, talk about 
                    where you re from, maybe see a 
                    movie.  No pressure. 

                                  TODD
                    Dude, I m not gay, OKAY?!

      Todd STORMS out!  Now it s just Max/Dave/Alex.

                                  MAX
                    Wow, what a homophobe.  Well...good 
                    work guys.  See you in hell.

      Max CHEERS-ES Dave/Alex, DOWNS his drink, exits.  Now it s 
      just Dave and Alex.  Beat.  She sighs, then gets sincere.

                                  ALEX
                    Dave, I...I m so sorry.  But think 
                    about the last couple years.  Can 
                    you honestly say things still felt 
                    the same between us?  You got me 
                    gift certificates for our last 
                    three Valentine s Days. 
                          (Dave considers that)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                  ALEX (cont'd)
                    I feel like we just got engaged 
                    cause we were 30 and that s what 
                    you re supposed to do.  Like we 
                    were in love for so long, we didn t 
                    realize that...we weren t anymore.  
                    You didn t feel any of that?   

      Dave thinks on that...sighs.  He knows she s right.  Beat.

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah, I guess.  Maybe.  But...even 
                    if that is true, that s the type of 
                    thing you talk about over dinner, 
                    not on the altar.

                                  ALEX
                    I know.  I m so sorry.  Really.  
                    You ve been my best friend for 20 
                    years.  I don t want that to 
                    change.  Please...forgive me.

                                  DAVE
                          (long beat)
                      Well...that s not gonna happen.

      Alex s face falls, disappointed, sad.  Beat.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    But that s our problem.  And if we 
                    don t keep it between us, we re gonna 
                    lose all our friends.  And they re 
                    gonna lose all their friends.  And 
                    we ll probably all be alone forever, 
                    cause I don t think any of us has 
                    made a new friend in like 11 years.   

      Alex laughs a little.  Beat.  They both know he s right.


      EXT. VALET STAND - LATER

      Todd and Penny talk by his car.

                                  PENNY
                      So...crazy night, right?  Sorry.  
                    Do...you still wanna come over?

                                  TODD
                      I actually have an early morning, so... 

      Beat.  Todd sorta BRO-HUGS her, then gets in his car and 
      goes.  Penny s SAD.  She turns around to -- Brad/Jane/Max/ 
      Alex/Dave there.  They don t know what to say.  Beat.  Then 
      they all TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY (Max trails in at the end). 

                                      JANE/DAVE/ALEX/BRAD
                        Sorry./Loser./Forget him./His loss.                                                                                    32.


                                  MAX
                      Guaranteed small peen.

                                  BRAD
                          (rolls his eyes, then)
                    No Pen, it s my fault.  I m the one 
                    that brought the walker.  I m just 
                    ...not the funny gift guy.  Sorry.

      They all look to Penny, scared for her reaction.  Long beat.

                                  PENNY
                    It s not your fault.  It s mine.  I 
                    was never this...psycho.  Guys used 
                    to lie to have sex with me.  Guys a 
                    lot cooler than Todd.  Something 
                    about getting close to 30 turned me 
                    into a Sex and the City character.  
                    It s embarrassing.  And I m sure 
                    I ve probably been driving you guys 
                    crazy.  So...I m sorry.    

      They re all TAKEN ABACK by her mature reaction.  Beat.

                                  MAX
                    We forgive you.

                                  PENNY
                    Uh, you re still an asshole for 
                    hitting on him all night.

                                  ALEX
                    Guys c mon, all this fighting is 
                    really just cause of me and Dave.  Or 
                    me, I guess.  I mean, Jane - You ve 
                    wanted to be a soccer mom since you 
                    were 6.  What s really changed?  And 
                    Brad might be the most uncool black 
                    guy on the planet, but he just wants 
                    what s best for you guys.
                          (Jane laughs/SMILES at Brad)
                    And Pen - Max was just trying to 
                    break up the tension that we caused.  
                      And...he s an idiot.  

                                  MAX
                    I really am a moron.

                                  PENNY
                          (finally laughs/smiles)
                    It s cool.  There s always tons of 
                    hot guys in Mammoth.  I d rather be 
                    single there anyway.    
                          (realizes something)
                    I mean, if anyone still wants to do 
                    the trip this year.

      Awkward beat as they all look at each other.                                                                                    33.


                                  BRAD
                    Yeah, we need to decide who s in.  
                    If we re gonna get a smaller house 
                    this time, we gotta get on that.

      Everyone looks to Alex/Dave, HOPEFUL.  They exchange a look.

                                  DAVE
                    Of course we re all in.  

      Alex SMILES/NODS.  Everyone SMILES, HAPPY.  Beat.  

                                  JANE
                      But...then do we actually need a 
                    bigger house though?  Cause... 
                    don t we need an extra room now?

                                  ALEX
                    Oh.  Yeah, I guess we do.

      Beat.  EVERYONE REALIZES THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  

                                  MAX
                    Why Al?  Are you gonna bring the 
                      rollerblade guy?
                          (off everyone s GLARES)
                    What?  Too soon?

      They all look to Dave, AWAITING his reaction.  Beat.  Then --

                                  DAVE
                      Well...he ll probably just show up 
                    at the last second.

      Everyone laughs, RELIEVED.  The weight is lifting...

                                  JANE
                    You should bring Jackie.  If she 
                    doesn t have too much homework.

                                  BRAD
                    Oh!  Le-no!

      Everyone LAUGHS HARD.  BRAD PUTS HIS ARM AROUND JANE -- SHE 
      SMILES.  Awkward beat.  What now...?  Penny checks her watch.  

                                  PENNY
                      Well...it s still my birthday for 
                    six more minutes.  Who needs a 
                    drink?  Alex, you re buying.

      Alex smiles/nods.  Dave puts his arm around Penny, KISSES HER 
      HEAD PLATONICALLY -- SHE SMILES UP AT HIM, BLUSHING WITH SECRET 
      LOVE.  They all walk back in.  CAMERA STAYS OUT ON THE WINDOW: 
      They belly up to the bar.  Max makes a joke.  They all LAUGH.

      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    34.


      TAG:

      INT. MAX S SHITTY APARTMENT - LATER

      Dave looks around Max s MESSY place (like a shitty college 
      apartment).  Max hands Dave a blanket.

                                  DAVE
                    I thought gay guys were supposed to 
                    be clean.

                                  MAX
                    I thought Jewish guys were supposed 
                    to be rich.  
                          (slaps Dave s ass)
                    Sleep tight, roomie.

      Max exits.  Dave clears crap off the NASTY FUTON, then lies 
      down.  He stares up at the ceiling.  His life has changed.  
      It s a HEART MOMENT.  Then -- KNOCK! KNOCK!  

      Dave looks over.  Max comes out in his boxers, opens the 
      front door to...TODD.  They lock eyes.  Beat.  Then they KISS 
      AGGRESSIVELY!

      THE END
