It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.
Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.
A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.
ZOE
Hi!
Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.
ZOE (CONT'D)
Taxi!
She runs (little steps) across the street.
Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.
ZOE
Now what?
STAN
I don't know. You tell me.
That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.
ZOE
What? Where's he going?!
(waving her hands, then)
Come back!
They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.
ZOE (CONT'D)
Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
get out, you, stupid-head?
STAN
You said you were in a great mood
and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
(then)
Did you just call me stupid-head?
Zoe storms off with her little steps.
The lights in the pet store go dark.
Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.
BOBBY
Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
have an O'Dhouls or something.
JALISA
We'll go to the piano bar and get
Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.
BOBBY
Forget it, she's not coming. I can
tell by the dull look on her face.
ZOE
Love you.
13.
They all hug.
Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.
BOBBY/JALISA
I saw the sign and it opened up my
eyes, I saw the sign...
Zoe turns to lock up.
While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.
STAN
Hi.
ZOE
Aahhh!
Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.
ZOE (CONT'D)
You scared the hell out of me!
STAN
Oh, wow.
Is he...okay?
Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.
Zoe sets
him upright.
ZOE
What are you doing here?
STAN
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
worry, I'm not a stalker.
ZOE
How'd you know I worked here?
STAN
I followed you after the subway.
(thinks, then)
That sounds a little stalkery, huh?
ZOE
Yeah.
STAN
I just really wanted to see you
again. Almost like I had to see
you again. Can I walk you home?
(then)
Is it me or does everything I say
make me sound more like a stalker?
14.
Zoe allows a small smile.
STAN (CONT'D)
Can I just give you my card? Here.
Take my card. I'm not a freak.
Really. I sell cheese.
This hangs out there for a beat.
ZOE
Cheese?
STAN
Yeah. My family has a goat farm.
We make cheese. You like cheese?
ZOE
I guess. I've never really thought
about it.
STAN
Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
at the Farmer's market? Come by
sometime and you can taste my
cheese.
(then)
Okay, I'm going to go. This has
not gone as planned.
Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.
ZOE
Bye.
Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.
Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.
The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.
Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.
She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.
ZOE
Oh, well.
She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.
As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.
Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.
OLIVIA
Can I help you?
ZOE
(distracted)
No, I'm fine.
Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.
OLIVIA
Tasty, huh?
Zoe nods and takes another berry.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
Bet you could just eat him up in
one bite, right?
Zoe now turns, confused.
ZOE
What?
OLIVIA
And don't look now, but he's coming
this way.
20.
Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.
STAN
A-ha! I didn't scare you away
after all.
ZOE
(trying to be casual)
I was just in the neighborhood. I
thought I'd come by and get some
blueberries. I'm going to make a
pie.
STAN
I love blueberry pie.
Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.
ZOE
I'm confused. I thought you made
cheese or something.
STAN
What makes you think I don't?
ZOE
I don't know, you're over there
playing the banjo.
STAN
Can't someone do both?
ZOE
Honestly, I didn't know anyone did
either.
Olivia returns.
OLIVIA
Aren't you going to introduce me to
your new friend?
STAN
Nope.
(to Zoe)
Come on. Let me show you around.
Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.
Olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed.
21.
Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.
STAN
This is our basic chevre, probably
our best seller. The cheese that
started it all, as they say. Then
over here we have our surface-
ripened cheeses. These are the
aged/raw milk cheeses.
(realizing)
This is really boring, huh?
ZOE
No, not at all.
STAN
It's like you're in a foreign
country and the only thing to watch
on tv is a documentary on cheese.
You don't want to watch it, but
somehow you can't stop...
ZOE
(laughing)
I think it's interesting.
Really.
STAN
All right, you asked for it...
(boring voice)
The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
from raw milk and then aged for
four to six months. Sometimes
more. Sometimes less. Usually
more. Depends on the cheese.
FRED
Stop.
You're killing me.
FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
up from behind the counter.
STAN
Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.
(then)
She's the one I followed from the
subway the other day like a total
psychopath.
FRED
Right...I heard about you.
22.
ZOE
I don't know whether to be
flattered or terrified.
FRED
Be afraid.
STAN
Don't scare her away.
I'm trying
to redeem myself.
FRED
Then you should put down the banjo.
You look like a doofus.
STAN
Doofus?
(then, to Zoe)
Do you think I look like a doofus?
ZOE
I don't really know what a doofus
looks like.
Fred points to Stan.
STAN
Okay. If I put the banjo down, can
I take you to lunch or something?
ZOE
I should really get back to work.
STAN
Come on, say the word and we can
have a six-course tasting menu at
Union Square Cafe. I know the
chef.
ZOE
That sounds nice, but, I should
probably go.
STAN
Well, can I call you?
Zoe smiles.
Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.
They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.
ZOE
Okay, first kiss...
STAN
Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She
wore a head-gear. What about you?
27.
ZOE
Summer camp. I think his name was--
Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...
ZOE (CONT'D)
That was way better.
STAN
When can I see you again?
Zoe feels her heart jump.
She kisses him again.
Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
"Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."
STAN
Who makes me forget all the other
girls I met, sweet, little Miss
Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,
than she really ought to be, sweet
little Miss Blue Eyes.
Zoe appears at the door to the patio.
Stan smiles at her
while he sings.
STAN (CONT'D)
Who's gonna start takin' care of my
heart, she makes me realize. And
it's lucky for me and I really want
to be with...
(winks at Zoe)
sweet, little Miss--
Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts
for the bathroom, puking.
STAN (CONT'D)
Blue eyes?
Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is
practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.
STAN
My singing made you vomit.
ZOE
No.
It's not that.
STAN
Sure, we were a little out of tune,
but...
ZOE
I really don't feel well.
STAN
Is it your corns?
Hurts to walk?
ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.
Zoe's face pales.
CAROL
Zoe?
ZOE
Wow.
Hi.
Hey, there...
CAROL
Where have you been?
You haven't
been coming to any--
ZOE
(cutting her off)
Right. I know. I've been so busy.
Next one, I'm there. For sure.
(then, awkward)
This is my friend, Stan.
36.
STAN
Hi.
CAROL
(eyeing Stan suspiciously)
Hello. Are you two--
ZOE
Late. Yes. We are. We really
are.
(pushing Stan along)
I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.
They walk on.
Stan looks at Zoe.
STAN
An old...boyfriend?
ZOE
Her name is Carol. We're on
a...committee together.
They reach Zoe's front stoop.
Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder
to make sure Carol's gone.
ZOE (CONT'D)
All right. I have to go to bed
now. I'll call you, okay?
STAN
Okay.
(then)
Hey, I was thinking, if you don't
have any plans this weekend, maybe
you'd like to come up to the farm
and get away for a few days.
ZOE
I'll call you tomorrow.
Something's not agreeing with me.
STAN
Was it the lamb's tongue?
Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.
Stan stands
there for a beat. He calls after her.
STAN (CONT'D)
Okay, well...this weekend.
Think
about it.
37.
Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.
There is a small group of WOMEN speed walking around the
courtyard. They are fully decked out in jogging suits,
visors and nose shields. The ringleader is NANA, 83, fit and
fabulous.
On the sidelines is ARTHUR, 87, with his walker and big grin,
as he watches the ladies exercise.
ZOE
Morning, Arthur.
38.
ARTHUR
Hello, my dear!
He struggles to get up.
ZOE
No, no, no, don't get up.
ARTHUR
Good, because I can't get up. Came
to see my lovely fiance? She's
looking fine today, let me tell
you. Fine.
Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically.
ZOE
Hi, Nana.
NANA
One more mile to go. Do you have a
minute? Talk to Arthur.
Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding.
ARTHUR
That's what I'm talking about.
Work it.
Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.
Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the
same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.
NANA
Do you want a nose guard?
I have
an extra.
ZOE
No, I'm fine.
SHIRLEY
Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck
just had another carcinoma removed
from her nose.
ZOE
(to Nana)
I kind of need to talk to you.
Alone.
39.
Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several
paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.
NANA
Don't worry, they can't hear
anything anyway.
ZOE
I'm pregnant.
NANA
(can't hear her)
What?
ZOE
I'm pregnant.
NANA
What?
ZOE
I'm pregnant.
NANA
I can't hear you, darling.
SHIRLEY
Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.
Turn
your hearing aide up.
Zoe closes her eyes.
Nightmare.
Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.
Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.
Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.
ZOE
He's so not a douchebag.
The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.
Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.
STAN
I can't believe that Nuts has an
off-road wheelchair.
ZOE
He's got one for snow, too.
With
little skis on the bottom.
Stan smiles and shakes his head.
49.
ZOE (CONT'D)
What?
STAN
You're really something.
ZOE
Are you making fun of me?
Do you
think I spoil him?
STAN
No, I really think you're amazing.
I mean, that story you told
tonight. You just quit your whole
professional life because of this
little dog? Started your own
business, just like that?
Zoe shrugs.
STAN (CONT'D)
You're very...unique.
ZOE
Well, you're a dime a dozen. I
can't tell you how many banjo
playing, cheese makers I've been
with.
STAN
I keep waiting for the other shoe
to drop. Like, how can you be so
perfect? Why are you even still
single? I can't believe no one's
snatched you up by now.
ZOE
I drive them all away, I guess.
STAN
Yeah, right.
Stan takes her in his arms.
STAN (CONT'D)
Look, I know this is all going
fast...the time we're spending
together, meeting my parents and
everything...but, I'm okay with
that. I want it to go fast.
ZOE
It is going fast.
50.
STAN
But isn't that okay? Aren't we old
enough to skip all the bullshit?
What are we waiting for? I...want
to be with you.
Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him.
Before this
goes any further, she has to tell him.
ZOE
Stan.
STAN
Come on. There's something I want
to show you.
The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.
It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
from one pasture to another.
Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.
A
beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.
MONA
Come here.
Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.
The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.
ZOE
Carol, thank you. This has been
really helpful. Just getting it
all out and being with other women
who--
CAROL
I'm going to have to ask you not to
come back.
ZOE
What?
Why?
CAROL
I don't think we can help you, and,
quite frankly, you're against
everything we stand for.
ZOE
But, I thought we were all sisters.
CAROL
No.
Not you.
(then)
Do you know how long it took me to
conceive? Five years. I had three
miscarriages and spent every last
dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
woman with the short hair?
ZOE
Which one?
CAROL
The one with the really short hair?
ZOE
Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it
down much.
63.
CAROL
She
just flew to Memphis to watch
her
baby being born. Seconds after
the
birth, the birth mother changed
her
mind and refused to give it up.
Zoe's face changes.
She starts to get it.
CAROL (CONT'D)
So, as you can see, we are really
dedicated and choosing to be single
mothers, and you seem to be in a
slightly different place. You're
carrying two healthy babies, and
you have no idea how lucky you are.
ZOE
(after a beat)
You're right.
CAROL
I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
But you kind of need to figure out
where you are.
Zoe nods.
Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.
NANA
That man is obsessed with my ass.
ZOE
I know.
It's kind of upsetting.
NANA
He wants to take me on a cruise so
that we can finally tie the knot.
But, I don't know. What's the
hurry?
ZOE
You've been engaged for nine years.
NANA
No reason to rush into anything.
Nana looks over at Zoe.
She sees the bags under her eyes.
64.
NANA (CONT'D)
You look terrible, dear.
ZOE
Thanks.
NANA
You must really love him, huh?
ZOE
I guess I do.
NANA
Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
you have put him in a really
awkward position. Having a baby is
a big adjustment for any couple.
And you're not married. And he's
not the father. And you've only
been together a little while. And
now you're having twins. And--
ZOE
Please stop.
NANA
I'm just saying, if he actually
wanted to stay with you right now,
he'd be the greatest man in the
world, and, quite frankly, I don't
think any man is that great.
They complete another lap around the courtyard.
Arthur
smiles at them and then "raises the roof."
NANA (CONT'D)
Arthur's just about the best man I
know, and look at him. He's a
fucking idiot.
Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
older. Thinner.
Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.
JOAN
You know, people thought we were
crazy when we bought this farm.
(MORE)
65.
JOAN (CONT'D)
All of our friends in New York,
they thought we'd lost our minds.
Stan nods.
We get the feeling he's heard this before.
JOAN (CONT'D)
I guess I'm saying that you may
have envisioned your life going one
way, but the reality is, it could
go a totally different direction.
You just have to be open to it.
Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.
He
shrugs.
STAN
Having a baby with someone I barely
know, someone else's baby...it's
just not how I pictured it.
JOAN
I used to work on Wall Street. Now
I wear boots covered in goat shit.
This isn't how I pictured it,
either. But guess what...I'm
happy.
She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.
Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
far as it will go.
A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches.
Zoe smiles.
ZOE
Hi.
WOMAN
Hi.
TWIN TODDLERS
Hi./Hi.
Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
voice.
STAN
Hi.
Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.
For
a brief second, they look like a family.
Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
what. They just stand there.
ZOE
Hi.
STAN
Hi.
ZOE
You said that already.
STAN
You...look great.
Zoe touches her belly.
Proud but protective.
STAN (CONT'D)
How are you feeling?
ZOE
Okay.
STAN
Good.
A long silence.
68.
ZOE
You have a beard.
STAN
Yeah, it's awful isn't it.
ZOE
No.
STAN
Don't lie.
(then)
Did I tell you how pretty you look?
Zoe nods.
Another silence.
STAN (CONT'D)
I miss you.
A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
separation makes the moment all the more tense.
ZOE
I miss you, too.
STAN
This whole time we've been apart,
I've been trying to figure out what
it is about you that I love so
much. And I think that it's that a
lot of people talk about doing
things, but you actually do them.
You're really kind of daring. How
you quit your job and took over a
pet store all because some asshole
sold you a lame dog. You came and
found me at the Farmer's Market
even though the night before I
acted like a total stalker...
Zoe smiles at the memory.
Stan continues.
STAN (CONT'D)
And now you're pregnant. Because
you wanted to have a baby and
didn't think you could wait any
longer. Well, that's just the same
kind of thing. It's...brave. And
I can't love you for being that way
but then walk away for the same
reason.
Stan takes her hands.
69.
STAN (CONT'D)
I love you. I've been waiting my
whole life for you. And I can't
let one little baby get in the way
of that. I just...can't.
ZOE
There's something I need to tell
you.
STAN
Okay.
ZOE
It's big. And you're allowed to
take all of this back when I tell
you.
STAN
What.
ZOE
It's not just one baby....I'm
having twins.
Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.
And then, Zoe starts laughing too.
The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.
STAN
This is insane.
Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
meetings, or fighting for cabs.
But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
street.
STAN
Two girls!
A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.
Stan smiles.
Now he's part of this exclusive club.
STAN (CONT'D)
Hi.
WOMAN
Hi.
A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the
door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While
it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.
STAN
You look smokin'.
ZOE
Thanks, honey.
Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.
STAN
Let's go.
We're super late.
She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,
but again, the dress is too tight.
ZOE
Hmmmm...
76.
STAN
Why don't you sort of go in...head
first and then turn around.
Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.
ZOE
Shut up and push me.
STAN
Push you?
ZOE
Just do it.
Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.
14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
unload their wares.
Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
soldiers back from battle.
ZOE
Wow. We really shouldn't have seen
that.
STAN
No.
ZOE
I did mention that I barely know
those people, right?
STAN
Like forty times.
ZOE
I feel the need to say it again.
They turn into the Farmer's Market.
ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.
STAN
It won't be like that for us.
ZOE
How do you know?
STAN
Well, for starters, you wax.
ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.
OLIVIA
Oh, hi.
92.
STAN
Hi.
(awkward beat, then)
You remember Zoe.
OLIVIA
Right, hi.
And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Wow.
(then, to Stan)
Wow.
At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.
It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
ZOE
What is that supposed to mean?
OLIVIA
It's nothing.
Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
(re. Zoe's pregnant belly)
I had no idea it was that serious.
STAN
I told you it was serious.
ZOE
(interrupting)
What the hell does, "sorry about
last night" mean?
OLIVIA
It's stupid. I was drunk and...
STAN
It was nothing.
ZOE
What was nothing?
Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.
OLIVIA
You're having a baby? I didn't
know you'd been together that long.
93.
STAN
Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,
we're having a baby. Two actually.
On Zoe's look of shock we...
CUT TO:
The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe
runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.
STAN
Nothing happened.
ZOE
Get away from me.
Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.
STAN
Nothing happened!
ZOE
You said, "they're not mine."
STAN
I didn't mean to say it.
ZOE
How could you say that?
STAN
I don't know. I was flustered.
ZOE
Flustered?
STAN
I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking
straight. I've been up all night
watching Orca give birth!
ZOE
(incredulous)
"They're not mine?"
STAN
(at a loss )
Well, I mean...technically, they're
not.
94.
The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.
Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.
ZOE
You know, all this time you're
trying to figure out who the real
me is, but who the fuck are you?
STAN
Zoe.
She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.
Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the
sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.
ZOE
What.
STAN
It's Thursday. We have a doctor's
appointment.
ZOE
There is no "we", Stan.
STAN
Come on, I didn't mean to say it,
and that's not how I feel.
Zoe shakes her head.
ZOE
I made a mistake trusting you.
STAN
Don't say that.
That's not true.
ZOE
You're not good for me. You made
me think I needed you, and I don't.
97.
STAN
So that's it? Because of one
stupid, asinine thing that I said,
it's all over? This is how it
ends?
ZOE
Yes.
This is how it ends.
(then)
I don't know why you're so
surprised. I told you, nothing
lasts forever.
Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.
Stan stares off into space. His beard is back.
A CUSTOMER
surveys the different cheeses on the table.
CUSTOMER
Is this new? The Zoe?
STAN
Yeah. This is the first week it's
been out.
CUSTOMER
Can I have a sample?
What's it
like?
STAN
It's...very stubborn, overly
suspicious and distrustful of men.
The customer looks up at Stan.
CUSTOMER
Huh?
The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as
Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the
logistics of the trip to the hospital.
ZOE
I'll drive.
NANA
You're in labor.
You can't drive.
ARTHUR
I'll drive.
NANA
You don't have a car or a license.
(then, to Bobby)
You drive.
BOBBY
We're in Queens. I don't even know
what side of the road they drive on
here.
ZOE
Will someone please just drive me
to the fucking hospital?
All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.
Mona's at the
wheel. She leans out and waves.
MONA
This was my surprise for after the
wedding, but let's hit it.
BOBBY
This works.
They all pile in.
105.
And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
behind them.
Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital
gown.
ZOE
Taxi!
Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her
like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero.
And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.
ZOE
Ow.
Son of a bitch, that hurts.
OLIVIA
Are you okay?
Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
Olivia.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Are you in labor?
As soon as the contraction ends...
ZOE
Fuck off.
Zoe takes off again.
Olivia watches her go.
Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan.
ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
cheese.
ZOE
Stan!
Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.
FRED
Whoa. I've had nightmares that
started like this.
109.
ZOE
Stan!
Stan turns.
STAN
Zoe?
ZOE
Stan!
STAN
Are you okay? Don't run!
ZOE
I can't help it!
She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.
STAN
Are you all right?
ZOE
(panting)
Great. I'm great.
STAN
Why are you in a hospital gown?
ZOE
I'm in labor.
STAN
What?
What the hell are you doing
here?
ZOE
It's you.
STAN
What?
ZOE
Nana's my birthing partner, but she
passed out and needed stitches, and
Bobby asked me who I most wanted
with me, and...it's you. It's only
you.
(then)
I don't want to be alone anymore.
I love you. You don't know how
much I love you.
110.
Stan doesn't know what to say.
He's literally speechless.
ZOE (CONT'D)
More than anything in the world, I
love you.
STAN
I've been in love with you since
the moment you stole my cab.
Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.
A contraction.
ZOE
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
hee-hee, hoo-hoo.
The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.
Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.
ZOE (CONT'D)
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
STAN
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
love you. I love you so much.
(then)
Let's get the hell out of here.
ZOE
Yeah. I think I really need to go
to the hospital now.
They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
Stan has tears in his eyes.
STAN
Let's go have our babies.
People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.
Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that
says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER."
We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
girls have flaming red hair.
A woman pushing a stroller passes by.
She smiles at Zoe and
Stan. They smile back.
WOMAN
Hi.
ZOE
Hi.
STAN
Hi.
