      SUPER: BELORUS, THE PRESENT DAY

      Methos and Kronos ride on horseback through the ancient woods. 
      It looks like the middle of nowhere it is.

                                      METHOS
                    This is the place.

      Kronos scans the woods with a wary eye.  Then he turns and
      fixes Methos with a long, hard warning look.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    He's here, Kronos.  You don't think
                    I'd lie to you?

      Kronos holds his look for a moment longer, then a dark smile
      washes over his face.

                                      KRONOS
                    Do you do anything else?
                          (turning back to the
                            woods)
                    Where is he?

                                      METHOS
                    Not far.

      Methos turns and leads the way.

      As they ride closer, Kronos' enthusiasm grows.

                                      KRONOS
                    This is what I've dreamed of... every
                    night for over two thousand years.
                          (off Methos' look)
                    The four of us... reunited.

      Methos gives a sour look.

                                      METHOS
                          (to himself)
                    Certainly gives a new meaning to the
                    phrase Dream Team.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     2.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1201CONTINUED:1201

      Kronos pays no attention to Methos' murmurings.

                                      KRONOS
                    It will be like the old days.  Better. 
                    Whatever we want, we have...

                                      METHOS
                          (dry)
                    ... or take.

                                      KRONOS
                          (ignoring Methos 
                            tone)
                    That's the spirit.

      Methos and Kronos react to the sound of CHOPPING coming from
      the near distance.

      INSERT - A BLADE

      splitting a chunk of wood with expert precision.

      BACK TO SCENE

      An eager look lights Kronos' face.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    It's Silas... The man is a virtuoso.

      Again, the sound of an ax hitting wood reverberates through
      the forest.

      Methos stops, turns to Kronos.  Serious.

                                      METHOS
                    He's been here a thousand years.  He
                    may not even remember us.

                                      KRONOS
                    He'll remember.  What we were, you
                    don't forget.

                                      METHOS
                    What happens if he won't come along?

      Kronos is all smug self-assurance.

                                      KRONOS
                    He'll come... or he'll die.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - SILAS THE MAGYAR

      In a small clearing, SILAS THE MAGYAR (Charles Bronson at
      40) is chopping wood rhythmically, sweat running down the
      muscles of his back.  In mid-swing, Silas gets the BUZZ.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     3.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1201CONTINUED: (2)1201

      Surprised and alert, he stops his chopping, hefts the AX at
      the ready, and turns to see Methos and Kronos, now walking
      their horses, approaching.

      Silas throws the ax.  It lands with a loud thunk in the tree
      between Methos and Kronos.  Silas measures them in deadly
      silence for a long beat.  Then a broad grin comes over his
      face.

                                      SILAS
                    Brothers!

                                      KRONOS
                    Guess he remembers.

      Silas reaches his old friends, embraces Methos in a bear hug
      that lifts him off the ground, squeezing the breath out of
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    Nice to see you too, Silas.

      Silas puts Methos down.

                                      SILAS
                    We ride?

                                      METHOS
                    We ride.

      MacLeod and Cassandra are in mid-conversation on the balcony

                    It's Kronos who's behind this.  Let
                    me take care of him, then we'll worry
                    about the rest.

      As he takes her into his arms.


      MacLeod s on the balcony overlooking the city.  Cassandra
      comes from the shower in a robe.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan...

      Her voice is shaky, she's holding herself together with an
      effort.  MacLeod moves to her.


      Methos is standing in the shadows, phone to his ear.

      And then click as he folds his phone closed.


      SUPER: THE BRONZE AGE

      A few pavilions on bluffs by the sea.  (NOTE: A different
      location than the Horsemen's Camp in Ep. 96511)

      The Four Horsemen ride in, fresh from battle, blood on their
      swords and on their leather armor.  They've brought booty
      back to their camp with them, including a few frightened
      captive women.

      Silas and Caspian, flushed with the charge of battle, strip
      off masks and armor and wash off the day's dust and gore in
      a small stream.  Kronos looks on, the proud leader.  He turns
      to Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    Another day well spent.  Come, Methos,
                    let's celebrate.

      With a grin, Kronos looks over at the cowering captive women.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    And divide our bounty.

                                      METHOS
                    You can have my share.  I'm tired.

      Methos nods good night, then turns and heads for his pavilion. 
      Kronos looks after him thoughtfully.


      Kronos drags the unwilling Cassandra to his tent.  He throws
      her down.  Through the translucent tent wall we see Kronos
      standing over her.

      The CAMERA PANS to the sky and night falls.


      MacLeod approaches the fountain.  A few people mill about.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Go... get out of here!

      They disperse as if he s crazy.

      MacLeod searches the fountain, finds a METAL BOX.  He slides
      it out carefully.

      THE BOMB

      has a timer on it and colored wires.  The timer reads
      02:58.52.

      MACLEOD

      has sixty seconds.  He has time.

      He pulls out a swiss army knife, starts to reach for the
      blue wire.  Cuts it.  Then a WHINING noise.  He reacts.

      The water from the fountain starts to spray.  He's getting
      soaked, but he relaxes.  Then --

      A LOUD CLICK

      from inside the metal casing.  MacLeod cuts the green wire. 
      Ten seconds to go.

      Methos looks at a dead Greek as Kronos rifles the body of
      another.

                    Methos the scholar?  That's a good
                    one, brother.

      Kronos laughs incredulously, but Methos is serious.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm serious.  It's what I want to

                    I'm Kronos.  I always have been, and
                    I always will be.  And you're just

                    turning into a Greek.

      Methos pours Kronos more wine, and in a life-defining moment,
      slips in some poison from a ring.

                                      METHOS
                    Thank you.

      Methos hands him the wine.  Kronos drains it.

                    I never forget what I am.  The more
                    I learn, the more aware I become.

                    will be.

                                      METHOS
                    Find another to take my place.

                                      KRONOS
                      Impossible.  We four are brothers. 
                    The blood we spill binds us, only
                    blood can separate us.

      Methos doesn't move.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (pleasant)
                    Don't you understand, Methos?  The
                    only way to leave the Horseman...
                          (cold)
                    Is by leaving your head.

      Methos shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS
                    I was afraid you might see it that
                    way.

      Kronos stands and draws his sword, making ready to force
      Methos into a fight.  Methos draws his sword, steps back.

                                      KRONOS
                    Fight me, and don't think you'll
                    live to learn anything from it.

      As Kronos steps forward, he wavers on his feet, vision
      blurring, swordarm dropping.

                    The wine...

                                      METHOS
                    A little something I came across in
                    my studies.  That potion would kill
                    most people.
                          (beat)
                    It will stop even you.

      Kronos makes one last effort, but the drugged wine takes
      hold, sending convulsions through Kronos.  He falls to the
      ground, out cold.

      Methos moves to Kronos' side, stands over him, deep in thought
      for a long beat, sword gripped firmly in his hands --


      Methos is pounding in the hinges on the grate that covers
      the well from which we saw Kronos escape at the beginning of
      the previous episode.

                                      KRONOS
                    Traitor!  Coward!  Fight me!

      He grabs at Methos through the bars.

                                      METHOS
                    Why would I do that?  I've already
                    beaten you.

                                      KRONOS
                    The hell you have!  Your head is
                    mine!  Your life is mine!

      Methos makes no answer -- just slams the massive bolt home.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod approaches and gets the BUZZ.  His sword is out.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra?

      He turns, just as an AX bears down on him hard.

                                      SILAS
                    Welcome home.

      With a lightning motion, MacLeod just barely manages to
      deflect the attack as

      CASPIAN

      charges him from the other direction.

      MacLeod sidesteps Caspian's charge, deflecting Caspian's
      sword, but getting knocked back, a bit off balance, by the
      sheer power of Caspian's charge.

      As MacLeod scrambles to regain his balance, Silas approaches.

      MacLeod's options are dwindling fast -- he's got Horsemen on
      two sides, and even if he defeats one...

                                      CASPIAN (CONT'D)

                    And when I kill one of you, the other
                    takes my head.

      With a blood curdling ancient battle-yell, Caspian charges,
      only to be met with a hard boot to the stomach.

      MacLeod slips past him and takes off.

      Silas and Caspian exchange a glance.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Just like old times.

      Caspian and Silas turn and hurry after him.

      MacLeod's on the run.  Silas and Caspian split up to search.


      MacLeod is crossing the bridge when he hears another battle-
      yell.  He turns to see Caspian charge at him, hard and
      furious.

      Caspian's first charge knocks MacLeod hard against the side
      of the bridge.  He recovers just in time to dodge Caspian's
      next blow.

      MacLeod is hard-pressed to counter Caspian's undisciplined
      fighting style.

      The madman has little finesse but he's relentless.

                                      CASPIAN
                    It's been a long time, Highlander.
                          (licking his lips)
                    You're gonna taste so good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're gonna go hungry.

      MacLeod backs away from the onslaught of Caspian's almost
      incessantly swinging sword.  He's noting the pattern of the
      swings and timing them.

      Suddenly, MacLeod takes a quick sidestep, and in the same
      motion swings at Caspian's head.

      MacLeod's sword hits its mark.  Caspian falls hard to the
      ground, headless.

      As the Quickening drives MacLeod to his knees --

                    Damn you!

      SILAS

      is just striding toward him from the end of the bridge, ax
      raised.

      The wind from the Quickening strikes but Silas fights against
      it, approaching MacLeod, ready to kill him while he's down.

      MACLEOD S POV

      Through the wind and light, Silas looms closer.  He swings
      the ax.

      ON MACLEOD

      Before the ax hits its mark, MacLeod manages to roll off the
      bridge, even as the Quickening engulfs him, and disappears
      under water in the center of a whirlpool of wind and
      lightning.

      SILAS

      stands on the bridge, watching.  Ready.

      The water calms.  He looks... nothing.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      MacLeod approaches the store as the owner closes for lunch. 
      In the window are cages of different animals, including
      monkeys.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Monsieur, If I wanted to import a
                    hundred monkeys, who would I talk
                    to?

      As the owner smiles at the thought.


      MacLeod drives Kronos from the chateau.  Rage and frustration
      is clearly getting the better of Kronos.  With a battle-yell
      similar to Caspian's

                                      KRONOS
                    I am the apocalypse!

      KRONOS

      raises his sword and charges MacLeod in a fury.

      Momentarily blinded by his rage, Kronos leaves

      MACLEOD

      an opening.  one is all it takes.  MacLeod takes Kronos'
      head and the Quickening begins.


      Methos has been driven through a door, against a balcony
      railing.  He's struggling to keep Silas' ax away from his
      neck.  Then, the BOOM of the Quickening.

      Neither of them know whose head has fallen.  But Silas' split-
      second reaction to the nearby sound and fury gives Methos
      his chance.  He takes it, and takes Silas' head.

      The two simultaneous Quickenings light the exterior of the
      chateau, with two battered, kneeling figures at the center --
      Methos on the balcony and MacLeod on the ground.

      As the Quickening dies away

      CASSANDRA

      picks up Silas' ax and raises it over the exhausted Methos. 
      Methos looks up at Cassandra, physically and emotionally
      drained, his expression tired and sad.

                                      METHOS
                    I killed Silas.
                          (to himself)
                    I liked Silas.

      Cassandra reacts angrily, her words almost exploding under
      his.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    And now I'm supposed to forgive you?

      MACLEOD

      runs in and finds this tableau.  Methos on his knees by Silas'
      body, Cassandra standing with ax ready to strike, tears
      streaming down her face.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra...

      Cassandra looks at him.  Ax still raised, arms trembling
      with the effort of holding it.

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod and Methos are in conversation.  There's no anger
      between them, but there is a distinct awkwardness -- their
      former easy camaraderie has been blasted away, and will take
      some time to heal.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You must have known Kronos would
                    escape that well one day.

                                      METHOS
                    I tried not to think about it.

                          (beat)
                    You had the chance, why didn't you

                                      METHOS
                    I wanted to.
                          (a beat)
                    But I couldn't.  Not then, maybe not
                    ever.

                    If I judged him worthy to die, I

                    to live.  I still do.

      MacLeod looks at him sharply.  Not liking what he's thinking.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Kronos was right, wasn't he?  You
                    set the whole thing up.

                                      METHOS
                    What do you mean?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You knew Kronos would take Cassandra. 
                    And you let him, because you knew
                    I'd come after her.
                          (beat)
                    You couldn't kill him, but you knew
                    I could.

                                      METHOS
                    Maybe I hoped you could.

      He turns to walk away.  MacLeod takes his arm, forces him to
      turn back.

                    What about Cassandra?
