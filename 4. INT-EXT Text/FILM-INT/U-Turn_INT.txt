At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young,
good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find
country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it
shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the
steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing
Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand
as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in
the road and lays on the horn.
BOBBY
Get off the goddamn road!
The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is
caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He
sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes
quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser
roars past at speed.
BOBBY
Fuck you!
There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick
cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge
now starts rising.
BOBBY
No!...Not now!...Shit!
A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction,
buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.
DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front
window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the
road, with the bag on his shoulder.
BOBBY, naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water.
It
shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body.
As the
water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice:
VOICE(V.O.)
I want my money.
Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady
himself.
His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his
pinky or ring finger.
Bobby leans back in the shower.
Just as
he does:
We see BOBBY's face reliving the experience as once again we
hear the voice.
VOICE (V.O.)
Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you
gonna lose your nose and ears.
Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his
left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it.
As a streak of
blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring
FINGERS have been cut off at the joints.
BOBBY, his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes.
BOBBY (to himself)
You're still lucky.
As he does he looks at himself in the mirror.
He bends to pick
up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag.
As he lifts it we
can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is
3/4 filled with money.
He closes the bag and stands.
In the
MIRROR, hidden in the doorway, he sees GRACE watching him.
Bobby
slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself.
After a
moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.
GRACE
Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.
Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down.
He rubs the glass
against his forehead.
BOBBY
That's good.
Cools you right off.
(tentatively) I saw you watching me.
GRACE
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
BOBBY
I didn't say it bothered me.
GRACE
Did you like it; me watching you?
BOBBY
I guess.
I've got an ego same as any man.
GRACE
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant. Grace slides
an ice cube from the glass between her lips. He notices a framed
picture of GRACE and an OLDER MAN.
BOBBY
Nice place.
GRACE
Thank you.
Grace sits on the edge of the bed. Bobby indicates the picture,
ironic.
BOBBY
Who's that, your father?
GRACE (without much thought)
Stepfather...
BOBBY (coy)
Got a boyfriend?
GRACE
No. Not really.
Bobby senses she's lying but plays along.
BOBBY
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living
by herself in a big house.
GRACE
I guess it must.
BOBBY
What do you do anyway?
GRACE
A little of this, a little of that.
Mostly
I tell fortunes.
BOBBY
Where'd you learn to do that?
GRACE
From my father.
He was the tribe's shaman.
BOBBY
A medicine man?
GRACE
Those are white words, not ours.
BOBBY
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.
You
must be good.
GRACE
Come here.
Bobby goes to Grace and kneels before her.
She takes his head
in her hands and looks deep into his eyes.
Her voice goes
thick, but soft, like a morning fog.
GRACE
There's something in your past; something
you want to keep hidden.
There's a pain.
Something ... someone you can't forget.
And there is something you want very badly.
It seems very far away to you, but you are
determined, and you will do what you must
to get it.
Bobby closes his hands on Grace's and takes them from his face.
He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Grace's
reading.
BOBBY
My face tell you all that?
GRACE
It tells me what every face tells me.
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and
they have something they want.
(seductively) What is it you want?
BOBBY
The same thing you do.
They silently stare into each other's eyes.
GRACE
Really?
I want to hang drapes.
Grace walks from the room.
For a moment Bobby stares after her.
He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his
teeth.
GRACE is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes.
BOBBY notices a photo of Grace with an older INDIAN WOMAN, her
mother?
GRACE
Hold me.
Bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's
waist.
GRACE
Tighter.
I won't break. You know girls are
a lot tougher than men think.
Bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes.
His
eyes are transfixed on her ass.
GRACE
There.
All done.
Lift me down.
BOBBY
What?
GRACE
Lift me down.
Bobby lifts Grace down from the ladder.
He holds her, his hands
around her waist.
GRACE
You can let go of me now. I'm safe.(with
a wicked smile) How do they look?
BOBBY
Like you.
GRACE
Beautiful?
BOBBY (kidding)
Like they're made of polyester.
GRACE
I like them.
I was sick of looking at this
room.
I think they add a little life.
BOBBY
Nothing like a little liveliness.
With a sexy pout Grace loads the next question.
GRACE
No more drapes to hang.
Now what should
we do?
BOBBY
I have an idea.
GRACE
And what would that be?
Bobby steps close to Grace and takes her by the shoulders.
He
pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers.
Grace
doesn't respond.
BOBBY
All right, Grace.
No more games.
GRACE (innocently)
Games?
BOBBY
You flirt with me, then you run cold.
You
lead me on, then slap me down.
I don't go
for being jerked around.
GRACE
Really?
And what game did you want to
play?
You carry my box for me, and I fall
into bed with you?
Bobby grabs up his pack.
BOBBY
I think I can find my own way back to
into town.
GRACE
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
BOBBY
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.
That and a
few memories of bad women; just like most
guys.
But you already know that.
You read
my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
Bobby turns to leave.
GRACE
You never did answer my question.
BOBBY
Still playing?
GRACE
That's not an answer.
What is it you want?
BOBBY
You know what I want.
GRACE
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
For a beat Bobby stands and stares hard at Grace.
His pack
slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor.
With great
determination, like a beast closing for the kill, Bobby moves
for her.
Grace stands firm, ready for him; her head tilts back.
Her breath comes deep and hard.
Just as Bobby is about to reach her, just as he is about to take
her, he is stopped dead by the booming voice of JAKE McKENNA.
JAKE (O.S.)
Grace!
Bobby turns to face Jake:
An older man, still large and
formidable for his age.
GRACE (nonplussed)
Jake.
I thought you...
JAKE
Who the hell is this!?
BOBBY
Who the hell are you?
JAKE
I'm her husband.
BOBBY (shocked whisper)
Husband ...?
JAKE
Now who the hell are you, and it better be
good, or God help me I'll break you in
half.
BOBBY
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife.
I met her in town.
She needed a hand with
her drapes.
That's all.
JAKE
Didn't much look like you were hanging
drapes.
BOBBY
I swear to you that's all that happened.
I
haven't so much as set foot in your
bedroom.
JAKE
A lot that means.
BOBBY
Grace, tell him.
Grace says nothing.
She picks up a glass of lemonade and sips
at it coolly.
BOBBY
Damn it, Grace!
Tell him.
GRACE (coyly)
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it
must be true.
JAKE
Oh yeah, and I suppose you didn't have
anything to do with it Grace, he just
wandered up here by hisself. I got a mind
to put you over my knee and paddle your
ass raw!
BOBBY (to Grace)
You bitch! Is this what it's all about? You
sucker me up here so you can watch the two
of us beat the shit out of each other over
you? You both... Forget it! (heads for the
door)
JAKE
Where you going!
BOBBY (exiting)
'Scuse me, you want to take my head off,
mister. I won't even try to stop you. I
deserve it for being an idiot. But if
you're not, I think I'll be on my way...
Ow!
Jake punches him in the nose.
JAKE
You can't just walk in here and walk out,
you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new
asshole!
BOBBY
You broke my nose!
JAKE
It ain't broke.
It probably isn't, but it bleeds. Bobby feels the blood and then
sees it on his shirt.
BOBBY
Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue
you.
JAKE (opens the door)
Get goin' Junior.
Bobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little smile.
BOBBY
You people are crazy!
He storms out holding his nose.
The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny, older
Mexican WOMAN who is behind the counter.
BOBBY enters.
BOBBY
Got any cold soda?
WOMAN
Eh?
BOBBY
Soda.
You got any soda?
WOMAN
Hablar slowly, por favor.
My ingles no es
bien.
BOBBY
Soda.
You know.
Bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming.
WOMAN
Oh.
Something to eat.
Si.
She holds up a pack of Twinkies.
BOBBY
Not eat.
Drink.
What the fuck is drink in
Spanish ... uh, agua?
The old woman's eyes widen.
She starts to scream, but quickly
clamps her hands over her mouth.
For a moment Bobby thinks the
woman is screaming at what he has said.
Then, as if he feels a
presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO
tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered BIKERS.
One holds a
gun.
BIKER
That's right, lady.
Keep it in you and
nobody gets hurt.
That goes for you too,
stud.
Gimmie the money.
Now!
WOMAN
Eh?
SECOND BIKER
The dinero, Senora.
Hand it over.
Bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back.
The woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it
open.
She hands the money to the biker.
BIKER
That's it?
Lady, I got kids to put through
school.
WOMAN
Es all I have.
The biker turns to Bobby.
BIKER
Okay, pal.
Whatcha got? Give it, now.
Bobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant
pocket, tosses it on the counter.
BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)
Nice...Just who are you beautiful? What
else you got for papa?
Bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him.
BIKER
Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the
bag, sweetie.
BOBBY
It's just books.
BIKER
I'm a reader. Toss it.
BOBBY (an entreaty)
It's personal things...family things.
BIKER
How touching...I like family values. Give
it to me.
Bobby takes an unsteady breath.
BOBBY
No.
BIKER
No?
SECOND BIKER
Hey man, forget it. Come on.
BIKER
No?
WOMAN
Senor, give him the bag.
BIKER
That's all right. He doesn't want to give
me the bag...
SECOND BIKER
He's fucking with you man. Shoot him.
BIKER (cont'd)
...he doesn't have to give me the bag.
The biker grabs Bobby's bag. Bobby flinches in anticipation of a
shot but refuses to let go of the bag.
The biker swings the gun
hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.
Bobby falls against
the counter and to the floor.
The woman starts to scream. The
biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a
ring on her finger.
He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring.
The woman screams wildly.
SECOND BIKER
Let's go, man.
BIKER
A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you
just relax.
WOMAN
No!
No! My wedding ring.
He pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back.
With Bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave.
BIKER
Now we go.
WOMAN
You go to El Diablo!
From beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. The woman
fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the
biker.
He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of
blood and shredded money.
SECOND BIKER
Bugger! You bitch!
The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place
out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at
the old woman, who ducks behind the counter.
The Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not
expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND
BLAST into him and the bag.
Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to
shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead.
Bobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds.
WOMAN (cursing in Spanish)
Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia
mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons
of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell).
She comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet
and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants.
WOMAN
I call the sheriff.
BOBBY
No! No police.
Bobby gives her a hundred dollars.
WOMAN
A hundred dollars? No police?
Bobby gives her some more cash. She looks at him. Finally he
gives her the entire wad.
BOBBY
No police until I leave.
Bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white.
FADE TO:
It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any
open road:
Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in
the corner belching out country TUNES.
Business is slow but
it's the only restaurant in town. There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in
the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the
counter.
A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated
on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin.
ED
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.
That was
back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon
it dropped down to forty three! True story.
BOYD
One time last year I remember it went from
98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come
out like...
BOBBY comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the
counter.
He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a
mess. He buries his face in the menu.
BOBBY
You got a beer?
FLO
What kind?
BOBBY
Beck's.
FLO
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
BOBBY
Heineken?
FLO
No, we ain't got no Heineken.
We got
Miller.
BOBBY
Genuine Draft?
FLO
No.
Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can
fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave
it.
BOBBY
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
SHORT ORDER COOK
Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'.
FLO
I'll be right back with that beer.
Flo moves off.
BOBBY
...and a waitress named Flo.
Christ.
As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he
hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE
RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot.
He
looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg.
He gives it
a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech.
BOBBY
Fucking cat.
In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth.
TOBY looks the
part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.
His hair is
cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school.
His
girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is
the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look.
Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom.
After he
is gone Jenny walks to Bobby.
JENNY
Hey, Mister.
You gotta quarter for the
juke?
BOBBY
What?
JENNY
I wanna play a song on the juke.
You got a
quarter?
Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and
flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it.
JENNY
What happened to your hand?
BOBBY
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more
careful.
JENNY
Got any requests?
BOBBY
That country shit all sounds the same to
me.
JENNY
How about I pick one out for you?
Bobby half smiles.
Jenny plays a song.
Patsy Cline's "Your
Cheatin' Heart."
Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's.
JENNY
You like Patsy Cline?
I just love her.
How come, I wonder, she don't put out no
more new records.
BOBBY
Cause she's dead.
JENNY
Gee, that's sad.
Don't that make you sad?
BOBBY
I've had time to get over it.
JENNY
You're not from around here, are you?
Where you from?
BOBBY
Oz.
JENNY
You ain't from Oz.
Oz is in that movie.
BOBBY
You're too quick for me.
Toby walks back into the room.
He looks at Jenny.
He looks at
Bobby.
He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby.
He loses it.
TOBY
No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not
believin'...Stop the wedding.
This can't
be. Hey!
What are you doing with my girl?
Bobby says nothing, ignoring Toby.
TOBY
I axed you a question.
JENNY
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.
We was
just talking.
TOBY
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back
over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not
going to axe you again, Mister.
What were
you doing with my girl?
BOBBY
I wasn't doing anything.
TOBY
That's not the way it looked to me.
Looked
to me like you was trying to make time with
her.
BOBBY
Make time?
Is everybody in this town on
drugs?
JENNY
Honest, Toby.
I just axed him for a
quarter for the jukebox.
TOBY
Stay out of this, Jenny.
We got man's
business to take care of. I ain't never
taken no drugs, mister, and ...
BOBBY
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I
wasn't making a play for your girl.
TOBY
You expect me to believe that?
BOBBY
I don't care what you believe as long as
you leave me alone.
TOBY
Mister, I'm calling you out.
BOBBY
What?
You want to fight?
Over her?
Bobby looks Jenny over.
FLO
Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the
man alone.
TOBY (to Bobby)
You know who I am?
Toby N. Tucker.
Everyone round here call me TNT. You know
why?
BOBBY
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
TOBY
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.
And when I
go off, somebody gets hurt.
BOBBY
Fine.
I was making time with your girl.
Now I'm scared to death and I learned my
lesson. Now can you go away?
TOBY
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
BOBBY
Christ, I don't believe this!
TOBY
Stand up.
BOBBY
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
TOBY
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where
you sit.
Bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with Toby now
with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either. He
sits there.
FLO
Toby, you stop it now! Can't you see he's
got a hurt hand?
TOBY
Don't you never mind, Flo.
This is gonna
be over real quick.
Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching
their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move.
The tension builds.
We see it on the faces of Jenny, Flo and
the regulars.
Just then the record on the juke ends and the
needle scratches off.
There is the crackle of a police radio as
the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in.
The tension eases. Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to
Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear.
TOBY
You're lucky, Mister.
Don't think it's
over.
I called you out and I'm gonna see
this through.
You hear me? (to Jenny)
Come on, girl.
I got half a mind to make
you walk home.
Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner.
FLO
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil,
has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
SHERIFF
What was that all about?
FLO
You know how that Toby is.
Thinks every
man he sees is after his Jenny.
SHERIFF
More like Jenny is after every man she
sees.
FLO (to Bobby)
You pay Toby no mind.
He just likes to
show off for his girl.
Give him a couple
of hours, he'll cool off.
Still want that
beer?
BOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff)
I'll take it to go.
Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his
forehead.
ED
How's it with you, Sheriff?
SHERIFF
Already started out bad.
Couple of bikers
from out of town tried to knock over
Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It
was a real shootout.
BOYD
What happened?
SHERIFF
The old witch killed 'em both.
ED
Holy shit!
FLO
Poor thing.
Is she all right?
SHERIFF
Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to
steal her wedding ring. That's when she
started shooting.
Can't blame her.
The
ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Store's a mess.
BOYD
It's the desert.
That's what it is.
The
desert makes everybody crazy.
Ain't that
right, Sheriff?
People go crazy out here.
ED
Come on, Boyd.
I've got to make tracks.
That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before
it spoils.
BOYD
Dr. Pepper don't have that problem.
Ed and Boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit.
Flo
stands near the cash register with Bobby's beer.
FLO
I can't open off-sale for you, sugar.
Bobby pays for the beer ($1.75).
Flo opens the register.
FLO
Let me get your change.
SHERIFF
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill
on the coffee.
The Sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot.
FLO
You be careful now, Virgil.
Just as the words leave Flo's mouth the Sheriff spills the pot.
It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere.
Flo runs over to him.
SHERIFF
Son of a bitch!
FLO
Virgil!
Now look at what you done!
Are
you all right?
SHERIFF
I think I burned my gun hand!
As Flo bends to wipe the counter, Virgil touches her intimately.
SHERIFF (Cont'd)
How 'bout we put something soft on it
later? (a look)
FLO
(quietly) I could put some butter on it,
hon'. (Her normal abrasive voice) It'd
serve you right, you asshole.
Put it under
some cold water. Joe, run get a mop and
clean this fuckin' mess up.
While everyone is distracted Bobby notices that the register
drawer has been left open.
He looks around to make sure he is
not being watched.
Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer.
It gets closer and closer.
As he is about to grab the money
there, the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses
and claws at his hand.
Bobby jumps back startled.
FLO
Shasta!
Now why'd you go and scare the
nice man like that?
Sorry about that,
mister.
Let's see, you want $3.25. (gives
it to him) You try to have a nice day now,
would you?
BOBBY
Sure, I'll try.
With the Sheriff occupied, and the Mexican Jose mopping the
floor, Bobby exits.
It is the kind of cheesy, temporary office one would expect to
find in a Las Vegas apartment building overlooking the DOWNTOWN
STRIP.
MR. ARKADY, dressed in a silk suit with conspicuous
jewelry, sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his
nails.
SERGEI, his goon in a shiny polyester shirt, hovers over
his boss helping feed and manicure him.
These are the TWO MEN
from Bobby's earlier FLASHBACK.
They are dangerous in an
endearing way.
Sergei answers the phone. In the background is a
very voluptuous female, obviously from the Middle East. SOFIA.
SERGEI
Da?
MR. ARKADY
Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal? How
many times do I have to tell you?
You
answer a phone "hello," not "da."
SERGEI (nods yes)
Sorry, Mr. Arkady.(into phone)"Hello?"
OPERATOR(V.O.)
I have a collect call from Bobby Cooper.
Will you accept the charges?
SERGEI
Mr. Arkady, deadbeat Cooper's calling.
Mr. Arkady doesn't acknowledge him.
SERGEI
He's calling collect.
At this Mr. Arkady's head springs up.
He snatches the phone
from Sergei.
MR. ARKADY (overly sweet)
Bobby, what a surprise.
I expected to be
seeing you, not talking to you over the
phone.
INTERCUTS TO:
BOBBY squats, looking at a real estate model of a desert
development. JAKE smiles.
JAKE
What can I do for you, lad?
BOBBY
I was hoping we could talk.
JAKE
Talk?
About what?
BOBBY
About things.
About your wife.
JAKE
Sweet Grace?
What about her?
BOBBY
About what you said this morning.
Jake shakes his head as if he doesn't understand.
BOBBY
You said you had an insurance policy out on
your wife.
Fifty-thousand dollars.
JAKE
I do.
BOBBY
You said you'd cut that up with the man who
did her in.
JAKE
I did?
BOBBY
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a
betting man. You want me to spell it out
for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in
on the money.
JAKE
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way
you're rambling on.
BOBBY
I'm not rambling.
JAKE
You're talking like a madman.
BOBBY
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for
citizenship in this town. You're the one
brought it up. This morning. In your car.
JAKE
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband
gettin' pissed off.
I don't want anybody
dead.
BOBBY
Bullshit.
You wanted me to kill her.
JAKE
A man doesn't always mean the things he
says.
BOBBY
You meant it.
JAKE
What makes you say that?
BOBBY
Because you're a slimy bastard who would
have his wife killed just to get his hands
on some money.
JAKE
And what does that make you?
BOBBY
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for
you... (pause) You're a jealous man Jake.
If you can't have Grace to yourself...well,
you're not the sharing kind.
For a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby.
JAKE
Well, I guess I have what you call a
love-hate relationship with Grace.
BOBBY
You love her, but you hate her?
JAKE
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of
person she is. I hate having to tolerate
the little "games" she plays. Like fucking
half of the town behind my back and
laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to
play. She wants me to hit her and when I
hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But
she's family. She's my little girl. My
baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes
roll back in her head as she sucks her last
breath, or to see her pretty pink brains
spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you?
You got the killing in you, boy...How much
you want?
A pause.
BOBBY
Make it twenty.
JAKE (stressed, paces)
Twenty-thousand?
I don't have that kind of
money.
I won't get the insurance until
months after she's dead.
I don't imagine
you'll want to be stickin' around after
poor Grace's demise.
Twenty-thousand;
that's more money than I could ever get my
hands on.
BOBBY
How much could you get?
JAKE
Maybe ... ten-thousand.
And that's a
maybe.
BOBBY
I need thirteen.
JAKE
That's a bit much.
BOBBY
We're not talking about buying a car Jake.
We're talking about killing your wife. It's
thirteen, or it's nothing.
For a moment the two men stand silent.
All we hear is the
ticking of a grandfather CLOCK that stands in the corner.
JAKE
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a
feeling you were my boy when I met you.
BOBBY
I'm not your boy.
I don't like you.
I got
no choice but to do business with you.
Let's just call this a nasty little
marriage of convenience.
JAKE
Don't say that.
I had a marriage of
convenience with Grace, and look where
that's lead...
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a contract.
BOBBY (sarcastic)
Do we shake hands?
JAKE
If you can't trust the man you've hired to
kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got
to look like an accident; that's the thing.
If it doesn't, then it's no good.
I won't
get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on
the chopping block while you're living it
up somewhere.
BOBBY
How do you want it?
JAKE
How the hell should I know?
I've never had
a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You
want this job, you don't know how to do
this? I guess I should have hired a
professional.
BOBBY
You want to do this yourself?
I don't have
to do this, you know.
JAKE
Be quiet, boy.
I got to figure this thing.
I'm thinking. It can't be done at the
house. It should be...
Jake walks the office thinking.
BOBBY
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money
upfront?
JAKE
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane
ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I
know you...
(then)
This is what you do:
Go to the house to
see her.
BOBBY
(beat)
And tell her what?
BOBBY enters the BUS DEPOT.
The interior is poorly lit.
There
are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty.
Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall.
A bored FEMALE
CLERK is behind the counter.
BOBBY
I need a ticket.
CLERK
Where to?
BOBBY
Out of here.
CLERK
But, in particular?
BOBBY
I ... Mexico.
You got a bus that goes to
Mexico?
That's where I have to go.
CLERK
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico
would you like--
BOBBY
I don't care, just get me there.
The clerk is a little put off by Bobby. He seems delirious. She
goes through her schedule looking for a bus.
CLERK
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a
local, arrives in two hours, and transfer
in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the
border.
BOBBY
How much?
CLERK
One way, or round trip?
BOBBY
One way.
CLERK
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Bobby counts his money.
BOBBY
Twenty-seven, fifty.
That's all I got.
CLERK
The ticket is 30.55.
BOBBY (rifling his pockets)
I bought a beer.
That was a dollar
something. Then I gave that girl 25 cents
for the juke box. And the blind man...the
soda...I..I'd have 30 if...if...
CLERK
I'm sorry, sir.
It's $30.55 for the
ticket.
BOBBY (to himself)
Yeah.
Just a little short.
Figures.
I
just wanted to get out, that's all.
Bobby starts to walk away. Suddenly he turns, runs back at the
clerk, proffers his money, half-crazed, near tears.
BOBBY
Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I have
to get out of here.
They're going to come
looking for me.
They're going to kill me.
If I can't get this ticket then I'm going
to have to do things to get out of here.
You know what I mean! I don't want to hurt
anybody, I just want to leave. Please. I
can't...I can't.
He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression,
Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this
whole town.
CLERK
Okay, I'll give you the ticket, sir,
but...just...just, please calm down,
please!
her sane tone reminds Bobby of how far down he's come. He
shrinks, suddenly ashamed of himself. She takes the cash on the
counter, hands him a ticket.
CLERK
Keep your change.
Bus three-twenty-three.
Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
BOBBY
I'm sorry.
It's just ... you know ...
She nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears.
BOBBY turns away, but not fast enough. SERGEI spots him, hits
the pedal.
SERGEI
Got you, shitface! Bobby Cooper. Bobby
Cooper...
GRACE, in the kitchen, is also on the phone.
GRACE (coolly)
I thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by
now.
Is there something you wanted?
BOBBY
I wanted to talk.
GRACE(V.O.)
I don't think we have anything to talk
about.
BOBBY
What about us?
GRACE
There is no us, remember?
BOBBY
Except I can't get you out of my head,
Grace.
(beat)
GRACE
Stop it.
BOBBY (V.O.)
Why?
Am I making you hot, or does the
truth scare you?
GRACE
Because I know you're full of shit.
BOBBY
I mean it, Grace.
I'm getting out of here,
and I want to take you with me.
GRACE (V.O.)
I thought you couldn't get your car.
BOBBY
I could if I had Jake's money.
GRACE (V.O.)
Is that what changed your mind?
The money?
BOBBY
I don't give a damn about the money.
I
want you, and I want to get us out of this
shithole.
There's only one way to do that.
Pause.
GRACE
Are you sure?...
About me, I mean?
BOBBY
I came back for you; this morning I came
back.
Before I even knew about the money.
You're what I want.
(then)
The only reason I stormed off is because
you spooked me talking about Jake.
But
I've had nothing but time to think about
it.
It keeps coming back to you and me and
us getting the hell out of here.
But we've
got to get the money, baby.
We get the
money, I get the car, then we get the hell
out.
GRACE
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
BOBBY
We don't have to kill him.
Just knock him
out and tie him up 'till we get away.
(beat)
It was your idea, remember?
I'm doing this
for you.
I'm doing this so you can
fly...fly like a bird.
Grace bites at a nail and fidgets, but says nothing.
BOBBY (V.O.)
Grace ... Grace?
GRACE
After dark.
I'll leave the back door
unlocked.
She quickly hangs up the phone.
Bobby also hangs up the phone, an unreadable expression on his
face.
JAKE sits in an easy chair reading a paper.
Puffs of smoke from
his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over
his head.
GRACE stands in the doorway, body stiff and arms
crossed, staring at him.
JAKE
Who was that on the phone?
GRACE
Wrong number.
JAKE
You spent a long time talking for a wrong
number.
But then you make friends so
easily.
Don't you, Grace?
Grace has no answer for that, so she says nothing.
A long
moment passes, then:
GRACE
I put up new drapes, Jake.
JAKE
I know.
I was here when your apprentice
was helping you.
Remember?
GRACE
You never said anything.
About the drapes.
JAKE
They look nice.
GRACE
You haven't even looked at them once.
Jake lowers the paper, looks at the drapes.
JAKE
They look nice.
GRACE
I picked them out for you, Jake.
I thought
you would like the colors.
JAKE (softly, admiring)
You look just like your mama when you move
like that against the light.
Grace stares at the CHAIN now visible around Jake's neck that
disappears under his shirt.
She knows that hidden there is a
key, and she fixes on it intently.
JAKE
What the hell you looking at, girl?
GRACE
Nothing, Jake.
Absolutely nothing.
GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock. JAKE
yells to her from another room.
JAKE(O.C.)
What the hell you doin', Grace?
Are you
coming to bed, or aren't you?
For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock.
Suddenly, like
a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt.
Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the
bedroom.
We start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks
as bedsprings groan.
We reveal Grace copulating on all fours
with JAKE from behind.
JAKE
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You
like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta
go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but
you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't
you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
GRACE
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
JAKE
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my
heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You
betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't
no forgivin' ya, girl!
GRACE
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
JAKE
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's
heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it
away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause
your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost
baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya
alone.
GRACE
No! No! Please!
He hits her. Harder.
In a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's MAMA
beneath him, receiving his punishment.
He stops, abruptly. He can't go on. Fear coming into his eyes.
He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or
forgiveness.
JAKE
Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...
(he starts to cry)
I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It
just...got away...
He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs.
JAKE
Forgive me, baby, forgive me!
He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to
himself.
Grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a
new occurrence in their strange relationship.
The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens.
BOBBY slips
quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the
door behind him.
It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no
bearings.
He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the
darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only
to catch it just before it crashes into the floor.
JAKE hears the noise.
He raises his head and cocks an ear to
the air. She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early.
GRACE
What's the matter?
JAKE
You didn't hear something?
GRACE
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my
ass.
JAKE
There's someone in the house.
GRACE (nervous)
Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over
(encouraging him to continue). Come on
baby, keep going.
Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a
drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark
metallic OBJECT.
GRACE (realizing)
What's that? Jake -- where's you get that?
JAKE
Relax baby. Stay here.
He goes to the door. She follows, tries to block the door.
GRACE
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
JAKE
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared
of things...
He maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor.
Crowbar in one hand, BOBBY makes his way slowly through the
living room, banging against the edge of a table. He hops
silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and
listens.
Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the
darkness.
A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see
the barrel of his own black .9mm BARETTA pressed against his
forehead.
JAKE appears now, backing him into the living room.
He switches on a LAMP.
JAKE
Well, well.
As I live and breathe.
I
didn't expect to be seeing the like of you
again.
Thought you'd be long on your way
by now.
Jake continues to press the gun to Bobby's head.
BOBBY
That's my gun...(then) That fucking
Darrell!
JAKE
I like Darrell.
He may be an idiot, but
he's my half brother. We own Harlin's
together, yeah, that little redneck manages
to get paid no matter how things work out.
BOBBY (realizing)
You been workin' me the whole time.
JAKE
I guess this is what they call "ironee"?
Hunh?
BOBBY
It's not what you think, Jake.
JAKE
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're
lying there with your brains all over my
carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about
this drifter, didn't have enough money to
fix his car. And Darrell happened to find
his gun, and through maybe this drifter
heard old Jake got some money stashed away,
and figgered he might try to break in and
steal it!
BOBBY
Wait a minute.
Just listen to me...
JAKE
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake
McKenna and turn his brains into wall
paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or
$20,000, or $200,000...
BOBBY (very serious)
That's not the reason I'm here, Jake.
JAKE
There's another reason? It better be good.
GRACE makes her way down the hall in a nightgown, and now hides
in shadow, listening.
BOBBY (V.O.)
I came for Grace.
JAKE (V.O.)
You came to take my wife from me?
BOBBY (sincere)
No. I came to kill her.
GRACE'S eyes get real narrow and angry.
JAKE (V.O.)
Shhh! Liar.
BOBBY (V.O.)
It's the truth, Jake.
JAKE
That's a thick change of heart from this
afternoon.
BOBBY
Maybe I don't like being played, like she
played us today.
Maybe I don't like that
at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe
I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
JAKE
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of
talk.
BOBBY
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to
kill me, and if it comes down to me or
Grace, then I pick Grace.
You were going
to give me thirteen-thousand.
Give me
two-hundred.
I'll kill her and dump the
body where no one will ever find it. She
showed me the perfect place. There won't be
enough left for an autopsy.
But I need the
the money.
I've got to have the money.
Jake is silent.
He takes his time thinking.
Finally:
JAKE
She's in the bedroom.
GRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom.
BOBBY stares at the automatic in JAKE's hand.
BOBBY
Wanna give me my gun?
Jake laughs, a "don't even think about it" look.
JAKE
A strangling'll do just fine. Go to work.
Bobby holds up his eight fingers with a "you try" look. Jake
shrugs. Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet.
BOBBY
How 'bout the pipe?
JAKE (sarcastic)
She's got a slender neck.
Bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom. Jake follows into an
adjoining room.
JAKE
Hold on a second! Come here!
Bobby turns to Jake, who is suddenly extremely upset.
JAKE
How the hell did you know where the
bedroom's at?
BOBBY
What are you talking about!
JAKE (getting closer)
This morning when I came in on you and
Grace, you swore you hadn't been near the
bedroom. Now you make straight for it.
GRACE returns to listen. This thing is like a seesaw battle of
wills.
BOBBY (V.O.)
Come on, Jake --
JAKE (V.O.)
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You
probably didn't even make it out to the
desert this afternoon...
JAKE has come right up on BOBBY in a rage.
JAKE
...Or did you just ply the afternoon away
between my sheets putting your lips all
over her, you little horndog...
BOBBY (changing tactics)
What difference does it make if I slept
with her? We're gonna kill her.
JAKE
You're right! I don't give a damn about
her. But killing her's one thing. Fucking
her behind my back, that's another!
Suddenly Jake swings his arm, clipping Bobby across the side of
the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash.
Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out.
Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and
smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss. The blood
from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's
lips.
JAKE
Now you've tasted both of us!
He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobby's
head. Bobby sees it coming, plays his last card on his knees.
BOBBY
O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it's
her you have to worry about, not me! She
wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead
and she wants your money.
JAKE (hesitates)
What are you babbling about?
BOBBY (talking fast)
Think about it! How do you think I got in
here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you
hear a door splinter?
GRACE listening.
BOBBY (V.O.)
How did the evening end?
After you went to
bed did she linger a bit?
Maybe just long
enough to leave the door unlocked?
Is that
what happened?
Like an old rag, JAKE gradually soaks all this up becoming
heavier with the weight of the knowledge.
JAKE
You'd tell me anything to save your
pathetic life.
BOBBY
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake.
You know how badly she wants to get the
fuck out of Superior.
What's she to you,
Jake; a woman who wants you dead?
Let me
kill her.
All I want is two-hundred
dollars to get out of here with.
JAKE
Two-hundred dollars?
BOBBY
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!
I'll
kill her!
A beat. Jake stares down at Bobby on the floor.
JAKE
Sweet Christ, I'd be doing the world a
favor, ridding it of the likes of you. Get
your miserable ass off the floor. You're
positively pathetic... Go on, go kill
Grace.
Bobby slowly stands.
JAKE
I'm not letting you walk for nothing. Two
hundred dollars. Do it, boy. Kill her.
Bobby goes.
GRACE bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she
flies.
BOBBY walks it. His POV -- the door. Every step seems freighted.
GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in
to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure.
She looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it
down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in
the boxes. Suddenly she finds it.
A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off
its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of
splitting a skull or impaling flesh.
Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind
the door.
A moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly
enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as
to whether he can kill her.
In a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as
victim...closer, closer.
He now lifts the edge of the bedcover
but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure.
He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her
presence. He spins.
She's directly behind him, hatchet raised. His life is in her
hands.
His eyes, locked in an eternal moment.
Her eyes, the hatchet.
SNAP CUT TO:
As JAKE, anxiously torn, waits, there is a LOUD CRASH, followed
by SOUNDS of struggle, of murder, of death. Then...
GRACE
Jake!
It is a desperate cry for help. Jake can't help himself. He
breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved.
JAKE
Grace!!
JAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned,
sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken.
Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a
pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves
in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet...
Over
there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET.
The look on her face is pure shock.
JAKE
Well...looks like you got him, Grace.
That's good...that's real good.
He must of
slipped past me, but you got him.
Looks
like that drifter from this morning.
Got
to be careful who you make friends with,
sweetheart.
Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand.
JAKE
Why don't you put that down? It's all over
now.
Put it down.
Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand.
JAKE
Go on, girl.
Put it down.
What choice does Grace have?
She lets the hatchet clank to the
floor.
JAKE
Aww, that's my Grace:
Not about to let
someone get the best of her.
That's what I
love about you.
As dangerous as you are
unpredictable.
behind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very
much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is
staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin
slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire.
Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and
drives it straight into his back.
He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to
kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the
rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once,
discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back.
Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged
rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back.
An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.
Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around,
Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his
hands full.
BOBBY
Grace, goddamit, do something!
Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for
help.
JAKE
Grace...?
She commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side
she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor,
strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's
a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its
toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead,
but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as
Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away.
But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on
her knees across the floor.
She grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two
men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand,
no longer sure which way she'll go.
Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping
from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that
she will help him. He gasps the words.
JAKE
Help me, Grace, help...
GRACE
Like you helped her, Jake?
Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her
hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men.
It flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake,
almost transfixing him to the floor.
In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers.
But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare.
Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls
back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.
BOBBY
What the hell'd you wait for?
She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body
off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of
it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new
territory, feeling an apartness between them.
Suddenly JAKE gasps, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He
grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one
last time.
Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on
her knees and prying open several floorboards.
GRACE
The money's right here! Get the key!
BOBBY
No! You get it!
He doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to
his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The
action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the
floor. She runs back to the floorboards.
The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed.
Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the
outcome.
With the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles
of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him,
offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on
his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the
fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery
store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.
They see each other.
GRACE
Didn't I tell you?
BOBBY (plunging into the cash)
There must be 150, 200 thousand here!
Goddamnit Grace, you were right!
GRACE
We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!
They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of
cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back. The day
didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby.
GRACE
Fuck me baby!
BOBBY (looking at Jake)
What about him?
GRACE
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's
missing.
As they consummate their violent relationship for the first
time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them.
GRACE sits next to BOBBY peering out the windshield, clutching
the money in a backpack. She's humming an Indian song.
BOBBY
I can't see it.
GRACE
It should be just up ahead.
Hold on ...
there!
There it is!
A SIGN illuminated by the HEADLIGHTS.
It reads:
YOU ARE
LEAVING SUPERIOR.
THANKS FOR VISITING.
Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.
GRACE
Oh, God!
I can't believe it.
I'm out.
I'm finally out!
The MUSTANG begins to swerve along the road.
BOBBY
Hey!
Take it easy.
Want to get us killed?
GRACE
You don't know what it feels like to be
free of that place.
BOBBY
I don't know about that?
GRACE
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my
entire life there. I feel like someone just
took a million pounds off my shoulders.
BOBBY
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
GRACE
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
BOBBY
I want a place where only the vultures will
find him...(then) It'll be over soon,
Grace.
GRACE
Then will you take me on your friends' boat
with you?
BOBBY
I'm not sailing his boat.
GRACE
But I thought --
BOBBY
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby,
and sail it wherever we want to go.
GRACE
Anywhere?
BOBBY
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
GRACE
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've
dreamed of going there and just lying on
the beach while the water licked up against
my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
BOBBY
You already have.
She gives him a funny look.
BOBBY
You know I thought you'd left me back
there.
GRACE
What are you talking about?
BOBBY (emotional)
When I got back from the garage, and your
jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd gone and
left me and taken the money.
(off her look)
...Cause I never had any luck with women,
Grace. You don't know what I been through.
The shit I've taken. I thought you were
like the rest of 'em... but when you came
out of the house... well you're here Grace
and we might be starting in the shit but
we're starting where I never been --
together with someone -- together with you
Grace.
She responds with a luminous smile.
GRACE
I love you Bobby.
He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.
BOBBY
We're gonna pull this off, Grace.
Just then a HEADLIGHT rakes them from the rear as we hear,
again, the ominous crackle of a POLICE RADIO and the short
brutal "Whoop" of the siren, as Sheriff Potter's VEHICLE rolls
up quickly behind them. Grace's face is caught like a surprised
deer in the headlamps.
GRACE
Oh, my God!
(then)
Don't stop!
Bobby is in a bind. The siren whoops again. The lights flash to
highbeam.
BOBBY
He must've seen us swerving on the road,
that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for
swerving...
But even Bobby has trouble believing that as the POLICE VEHICLE
pulls out sharply alongside his and SHERIFF POTTER motions to
him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder.
SHERIFF (into loudspeaker)
Pull over, goddamnit, pull over!
GRACE
Keep going!
She seems to be panicking. Bobby pulls over.
BOBBY
Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done
nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He
doesn't know anything.
His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the
Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.
BOBBY (starts)
'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this
jackrabbit...
Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at
his window, jerking his door open, angry. A GUN in his hand,
pointed at them, his eyes on Grace.
SHERIFF
You had to fuck him, didn't you!
GRACE (nervous cool)
I would never do that to you, baby... He
killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if I
didn't come with him. All he wants is the
money.
Bobby looks at her. He cannot believe what he just heard.
BOBBY
What!
SHERIFF (flipping, yelling)
Don't lie to me!
Grace knows the jam is up.
GRACE
OK...but he never made me cum! Really
Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do
so we could be free. Just like we talked
about. It meant nothing.
A pause. Virgil wants to kill her, but he also wants her back
badly.
BOBBY
You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody
fucking everybody in this town?
She ignores him. Her attention on the backpack with the money
between her legs -- the gun is there, inside an outer flap of
the bag.
SHERIFF
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your
dirty work and you think you can take the
money and dump me?
GRACE
No baby, you got it wrong.
SHERIFF
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where
were you going to meet me?
His flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat. She
doesn't have an answer to that one.
GRACE
It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I
got the money here.
She gets out of the car on her side, comes around to him, the
pack of money slung on her shoulder, hard to see in the dark.
SHERIFF (hurt)
Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but,
I watched you fuck that pervert for years
while you're telling me you loved me? What
happened to going to Milwaukee together?
You and me -- gonna open up the finest
sporting goods store that city ever did
see? Get us a place on the north shore, by
the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you
and me, Grace. What happened?
GRACE
All talk, that's all you did was talk, and
all I did was sit around getting older
waiting for you to free me! You never did
nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to
Bobby) He did!
The Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby.
SHERIFF
This is some girl you and me got here
Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too,
wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course
you had a lotta practice haven't you
darling, going way back to your crazy mama!
GRACE (deadly)
Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the
money. It's not so bad.
SHERIFF
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not
gonna give up everything I got for a lousy
50,000 dollars. It's you. You Grace or
nothing. The whole thing... I want you to
be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way
Grace?
GRACE
You sound just like Jake... I did see into
the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it.
Go back to your family. They love you.
Bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation.
BOBBY (misunderstanding)
Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at
least. Split it three ways, we all walk
away...
The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight,
knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again,
gathering the psychic force to murder him. Grace tries to
approach.
SHERIFF
Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round
here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you
that story about the bird flying away?
BOBBY (rolling on the ground)
Ow! Look, I ... ow!
GRACE
Stop! Stop it!
SHERIFF (kicking again and again)
Were you going to help her fly away,
asshole? What'd you think, you were the
first boy to drift through this town she
came on to? She tell you the story about
old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a
good story... How he killed her crazy Mama?
Bobby in bloody agony. Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal
this now publicly.
GRACE
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!
Don't!
SHERIFF
...But I bet the story she didn't tell you
was the best story of all. How old crazy
Jake was really her Papa. And she liked
fucking Papa! And now she's killed the
sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill
you!
Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil
across the car in the gut.
GRACE
No...you! You!
The Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing
what's happened.
Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the
Sheriff.
She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting
ancient wrath.
BOBBY
Grace. No!
The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock. Grace then fires right
at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the
back of his head.
Grace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action,
dragging the body. She snaps to Bobby.
GRACE
Help me get him off the road. Into the car!
We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!
Bobby stares at her.
They're driving. GRACE and BOBBY, wordless, each thinking in
separate worlds. Grace wipes her hands. The bag with the money
between her legs. The Baretta is back in the bag.
BOBBY (finally)
Jesus, did you have to kill him?
GRACE
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and
me.
BOBBY
He was in love with you Grace. He would've
done what you wanted, you could've made a
deal and ...
GRACE
The only deal he had in mind was killing
you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me
into sucking his dick for the rest of my
life... no thanks.
BOBBY
He was a cop, Grace, they never stop
looking for you when you kill a cop...
GRACE
He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby.
These guys don't let go! Even when they're
dead... (softer) You don't know what it was
like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
A silence. The oncoming road.
GRACE
So, aren't you going to ask me?
BOBBY
Ask you what? You mean what kind of
horrifying sick shit is coming next?
GRACE
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's
burning a hole in your brain just now?
BOBBY
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a
past...
GRACE
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my
Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't
you want to know that?
BOBBY (shouting)
What do you want me to say!
She's yelling, emotionally out of control.
GRACE
Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I
married him!... I married him...okay?
She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her. Finally:
BOBBY
Why?
GRACE
I don't know why!
She drops back in her seat. Tears come.
GRACE
All I wanted was to be a kid... He took
that from me... They all did... (very
quietly, dangerously) They treated me like
meat. A piece of meat. Fuck me. Blow me.
Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass...
Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They
deserved to die!
A pause.
BOBBY
And us Grace? What do we deserve?
GRACE (crying quietly to herself)
"Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say
in Apache. "Your worst is doing this to
you," she said, "your worst has killed
you." And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find
out the result of what you have done..."
Just when you think it's over, when you've
gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get
away.
Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road. Can he still
love her? She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said
she could.
GRACE
It's easy to judge someone else when you
don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache,
Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't
see what I see. Don't judge me.
A silence. Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through
the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night.
BOBBY
I don't want to think anymore.
GRACE (quietly)
Then drive...
The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness.
THE SUN COMES UP:
