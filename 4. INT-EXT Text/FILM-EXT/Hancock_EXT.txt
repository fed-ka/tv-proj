A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
It's a man.
It's a man, plus.
It's a SUPERHERO,
garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
Disheveled. Worn. A face
chiselled with mileage.
2.
In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
down the street like loose change.
The rain continues its onslaught.
Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets
glimmer from puddles left behind from the night.
The overcast sky - its precarious rain formation indicates that
the storm is far from over.
Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING
EMPORIUM.
From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
swig from its hollow interior.
ROHEIM
I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
Ball...
He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
from his jacket.
ROHEIM (CONT' D)
(caps it)
like that.
Horus looks on - silent.
14.
A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
testosterone cases with nothing to do.
RUTGER.
(passenger seat)
Boys...
The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
between them. And they drive off.
Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the
"TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
of their vehicle.
Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.
ROHEIM
Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
warm spit... couldn't find their
asshole with common sense and a thumb.
(BEAT)
Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
the sensitivity of a man like you.
Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
a thorn in the eye of his soul.
ROHEIM (CONT'.D)
(CONTINUING)
Come on, let's go home.
On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
peering out from a hole in his coat.
A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
still.
Something brews within this superman.
15.
The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with
e DELIS and NEWSSTANDS and BARBER SHOPS and OUTDOOR MARKETS - they
are the "esque" in Bro ly qu
Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way
TO
BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards
of screaming little anti-christs.
I
Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
to pull ahead and away.
MARY
Will you slow down.
AARON
I know it. I know it.
MARY
I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.
AARON
What?
MARY
Is my dress too tight?
AARON
What? Nothing. It's fine.
MARY
Really, my waist isn't too big?
AARON
What? Not here, mom.
MARY
All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't
leave the building till then. I'll be
there.
AARON
I know it, mom. Can I go now?
MARY
Give me a kiss, you snot.
16.
AARON
(there is no god)
Geez!
He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.
MARY
Two-thirty.
AARON
All right, mom.
He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.
MARY
(after him; in vain)
You want anything from the store?
He's gone.
This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
street, takes us home.
Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
(35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
robe.
CLYDE
(LOUD)
Longfella. Good to see you.
HORUS
Clyde...
Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.
CLYDE
Picked this up for you.
(pulls the paper back)
Say thanks.
HORUS
Thanks.
CLYDE
(hands it over)
You're a good man.
17.
He heads inside.
Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
page. The headline reads...
RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
inside.
Mary moves through the street, embracing a grocery bag.
She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping
bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
Mary continues forth, entering the bank.
A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
The engine is running.
The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
grips the wheel.
SQUADS of police cars form a noose around the building. A
S.W.A.T. teem spews from a transport unit, armed for the big
tightening. Guns and ammo abound.
The CLOCK on the building reads 2:30 school is out. Children
file out of classrooms. Scatter. Only Aaron remains, alone to
the elements - waiting.
A ball bounces, rolls to his feet. Aaron looks...
It's not a ball. It's a doll's head.
Aaron's face - dread.
A portly man, oily, thick, bellows out negotiations via his
HORN; Introducing TED, the police captain, BROCK (45) - aspires
to be Warren Beatty, more like Ned Beatty.
TED
(YAWNING)
Time's running out, fellas.
He turns to his sidekick, CHAD (25), a fellow cop. Chad's on the
phone deliberating an important call.
TED (CONT'D)
(tapping his attention)
The pizza here, yet?
CHAD
Negative.
(hands over the phone)
Tami.
TED
Ooh, one sec.
(to the bank)
Time's... all Hell's gonna break loose,
fellas.
(to phone)
My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo...
A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity.
Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard,
tumbles out and onto the sidewalk.
Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered -
he's probably dead.
24.
The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns
raised.
Ted punches Chad on the shoulders.
TED
Where's that car, Jesus!
CHAD
It's out getting your pizza.
TOM (O.S.)
. a car and I want it NOW!
And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
still reeling from the impact.
The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

What the...
25.
There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
examines the ground below. And he dives.
Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
bank structure, flying around and around.
Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.
Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
another awaiting police windshield.
PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.
The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
where we are.
Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
sight - they eclipse the heavens.
And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
- his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
and ERLICK (both his age.)
Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
the blonde kid from class.
We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.
The aftermath.
Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
superman.
29.
We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
suck on his cape.
CUT TO:
Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.
MARY
Tell me... what happened?
AARON
(about to break)
You were late.
MARY
I was held up...
AARON
The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.
MARY
.at the bank. Honey, were they the same
ones? Don't cry.
AARON
Get a grip, mom.
They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
stairs.
The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
Horus, sleep still on his face.
HORUS
How was your day?
Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.
CUT TO:
Just your average professional building, several stories of
brick and cement.
30.
But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
him down.
JUMPER'
(SELF-PITY)
People ignore me.
From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
across the street.
FIREMAN
Mr. Fisher.
SECRETARY
(through her teeth)
You're not unattractive.
FIREMAN
Baldness is not fatal.
JUMPER
My wife ignores me.
FIREMAN
Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.
SECRETARY
We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
acknowledge you, we all do.
JUMPER
No.
SECRETARY
Yes.
JUMPER
Really?
The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
across the street. The secretary points...
There...
31.
on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
His mother's FREAKING from the window.
Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
lonesome.
The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
the infant down.
But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.
CUT TO:
An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even
bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS
bemoan the loss of...
Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.
CUT TO:
Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
head.
He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
uniform, his gun.
They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.
SCARPO
Nutri-cop.
Horus keeps walking.
SCARPO (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
Look like the Man. Walk like the Man.
Shit, ain't half the Man.
OTHERS
Ain't half the Man.
Horus simply walks away.
CUT TO:
A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in'
sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc.
A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
solitude.
35.
He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes.
Taps himself a stick.
VOICE (O.S.)
How about spreading some of that joy?
Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
slimy kind of way.
In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
gun to Hancock's temple.
HOODLUM
(PSYCHOTIC)
Better yet, why don't I just take it...
Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.
HANCOCK
(SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
What are you thinking?
The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
pavement.
HOODLUM
(fuck me)
Shit...
HANCOCK
What are you thinking?!
Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.
HANCOCK (CONT' D )
Huh?!
Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
Hoodlum's nose.
HANCOCK (CONY' D)
Want to see brain? Huh?!
Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.
36.
HOODLUM
(with his mouth full)
Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
wife. I got student loans...
Hancock - intense.
Is this getting through?
HOODLUM (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
please. Have a heart, mister.
Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
He lowers the. Hoodlum.
He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.
Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
peers into the alley.
There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...
38.
A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
violence.
Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
legs.
A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
other's eyes for answers.
The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
it into the light.
WHORE
(the sage)
You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
tired...
(BEAT)
and in need.
Hancock - his eyes agree.
The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
out a MATCHBOOK.
Hands it to him.
WHORE (CONY' D)
My business card.
(to the phone booth)
My office.
Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.
HANCOCK
(GEENA)
Gina.
WHORE
(correcting; vaGINA)
Gina.
CUT TO:
From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
into the trash cans below.
Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
we think it deserves.
There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
as if he can hear.
Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
he can hear it, and then maybe not.
MARY (V.O.)
"Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
awake you when you rise."
Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.
MARY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I
will sing a lullaby..."
And like that, a seamless fade into peace - he sleeps.
CUT TO:
Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...
.. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
swallows hard.
FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
there time?
Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.
ERLICK
He's not going anywhere.
SPENGLER
'Less he can walk through wall.
41.
ERLICK
Fuck... squeeze through brick.
PERCEVAL
(just arriving)
Let's rock it up.
They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
the brick wall and a trash can.
They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
can.
He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
away.
Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her
bladder's going to break.
MARY
(checking watch)
No... no... no!
A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
head. Disappointed.
He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.
HANCOCK
You smoke?
AARON
What?
42.
HANCOCK
Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
(beat; takes a puff)
Smoke no evil.
Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(re: cigarette)
Ever curious... .what it's like?
Aaron shakes his head.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(hands it to.him)
Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't
kill you. Once.
Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
it. Doubles over, coughing.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
first stick. Then, after a few more... it
starts getting this. flavor. A little
nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
now, it takes a whole pack to get
there.., and you won't settle till your,
mouth's as sweet.
Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing
philosophical.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
From manure to pure cane sugar. That's
change. Today... you're a boy. Tomorrow,
Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your
hand. Takes you for a walk... and tells
you about life's simple pleasures. You're
a man. And you don't look back..
(BEAT)
You see... things evolve. Nothing is
wholly inert. A step in any direction...
you're walking into pockets of evolution.
That is living... taking those steps. And
change. Can start by changing some
principles.
Blank best describes Aaron's face.
43.
AARON
Principles?
HANCOCK
Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
about all you need to know: a man's got
to do what a man's got to do.
(beat; smokes)
I look at your face, the shiners. You
took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
good. That's a formula for future
abuse... an invitation to the loser's
dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
,(shakes head)
Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
running, looking for a place to hide.
AARON
What am I suppose to do?
HANCOCK
You do what is necessary.
AARON
I wanted... there were three of them.
HANCOCK
What is necessary.
(HEAT)
Let me tell you something, kid. There was
this infantry unit, you see... badly
outnumbered.
(thinks about it)
Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
fox and he's walking through what, the
woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
chase, the fox's running his ass off,
over boulders and through streams and,
but the damn hounds are still on his
tail. Finally the fox comes to this
cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
are closing in and they're going to tear
him to pieces. So what does he think...
"I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
confront them and I'll get my ass
butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
"stay and least I'd have something, a
chance.
(MORE)
44.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to
go down fighting, make a stand. Right?
(BEAT)
The hounds come. What do you think
happens?
AARON
(thinking about it)
He gets away.
Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
HANCOCK
No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
like cheap fabric.
AARON
What're you saying?
HANCOCK
But you know, when the last hound was
through with him,-and he's walking away,
he hears this noise. It's the fox and
he's muttering something under his
breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
up close. To hear what he's saying. You
know what the fox's saying... just before
he keels off?
Aaron - negative.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
Now he's gurgling, choking on his own
blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
next to his entrails, you know... and you
know what he says?
(raises his fist in the air)
"No regrets."
AARON
What?
HANCOCK
No regrets. You make a decision and you
stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
"no regrets."
Aaron - submitting it to memory.
AARON
Why're you telling me all this?
45.
HANCOCK
(a beat to think)
Look at it this way... I got to do what I
got to do.
CUT TO:
Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher
son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
possibly, they were awestruck.
.CUT TO:
The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
sort of. They enter the street.
HORUS
(POINTING)
I'm this way.
Hancock points the opposite way.
HANCOCK
Need a lift?
HORUS
It's a short walk.
Acknowledged.
An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
. until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.
CUT TO:
Time lapses into the late hours. This town experiences a serene
moment - a peacefulness which says that this as night as a night
will be.
It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the
community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's
bedroom.
From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
disrobes down to bare back...
And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
towards his face intense.
CUT TO:
A foreign TERRAIN of trees, of lakes so clear and blue.
They pass below us as we soar through air and mist...
the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children
in hysterics...
58.
we quicken to a frantic pace, slicing through the growth.
Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees
and earth...
. we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering
continues...
until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris
settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of
BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and
CHILDREN... DEAD...
. we SCREAM!
A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by
themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating.
ROHEIM
. that look on her face, you know the
look, when she's almost there... makes
you feel like a man.
(BEAT)
Then everything gets blurry and all of a
sudden, it's not my arm that's around her
and it's not my hand that's touching her
and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,
this good-looking guy... he looks like
the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And
so... the Marlboro Man's running his
fingers through her hair. And he's...
banging her... and her knees... by her
ears, you know?
(beat; cringing)
And that look on her face. That look.
HORUS
Roheim.
ROHEIM
(CONTINUING)
Bitch.
HORUS
Come on.
ROHEIM
(gets up)
Walk with me.
CUT TO:
The Longfellow's apartment.- seem from above.
Clyde exits the building in his morning robe., Takes hold of the
newspaper. Digs through it...
Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde.
Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes
the paper from him, sending him cowering inside.
61.
Mary and Aaron - by the perimeter fence.
MARY
Have a good one.
AARON
I got to do what I got to do.
She watches him go -curious.
The sky's POV - the schoolyard. Aaron - sauntering to class.
Mary - turning, walking away.
We soar through air and mist. Circle a street below. Hover over
an alley. Descend from the clouds - into the depths of buildings
and fire escapes.
Mary, among other pedestrians, head homeward. Her pace say
she's in no hurry to get there.
Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated,
inconspicuous, and in pursuit. J
Horus waits outside - hands in his pockets. He paces
uncomfortably.
Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown
paper BAG.
Not a word from Horus.
ROHEIM
(POST-GULP)
This stuff's going to kill me.
He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig.
ROHEIM (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
You disapprove, I know.
HORUS
No.
J
62.
ROHEIM
Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you
allow me to drink... to poison myself.
Your friend. Without a word of caution.
Not a word. Just take it... you take
everything.
HORUS
No.
ROHEIM
You're afraid to offend. You don't want
to be abrasive. Provocative.
(beat; as'Horus squirms)
So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it.
Roheim takes another gulp.
HORUS
(pulling teeth)
You shouldn't drink.
ROHEIM
My wife. She left a bad taste in my
mouth. I drink to kill-the taste.
Horus has no response to this.
ROHEIM (CONT'D)
(SMILES)
You're a good man, Horus...
(BEAT)
And you're right. This stuff's no good.
It's a coward's way out and I know it.
He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle into a
nearby garbage can.
ROHEIM (CONY' D)
(sick of himself)
What the hell. I can learn to love
beverage.
Mary. Walking.
Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a
world to himself.
He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS
truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air -
towards Mary.
63.
200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window -
just ahead of Mary's path. Glass showers the scene. People
SCREAM.
Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks
at Mary, reposed before him.
HANCOCK
(nothing happened)
How are you?
In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of
steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator.
Hancock shrugs a smiles.
Mr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired
and his face shows it.
There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports
page on the front steps.
A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the
steps with fire and...
HORUS
(burning...)
Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief
moment?
CLYDE
(YAWNING)
Not now, Longfella. I'm all blocked up.
Clyde heads inside - with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes
in.
HORUS
(EXTINGUISHED)
Sure.
Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a
cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.
MARY
What were you doing in the street?
(the trenchcoat)
You ripped it pretty good.
64.
Hancock - he's lost.
MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
What're you:.. how old's this thing?
HANCOCK
didn't see it coming... left myself
open.
MARY
It'll be all right.
HANCOCK
All right?
MARY
It's just the seams. I can sew it back.
HANCOCK
What?
MARY
(the trenchcoat)
This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good
care of it.
HANCOCK
You'll sew -it?
MARY
Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for
you, all right?
Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.
MARY (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING}
Are you okay?
No reply. He stares at her - simply.
CUT TO:
Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.
65.
He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
together tightly.
MARY
(like a little girl)
Let's see.
HANCOCK
You have to be quick.
MARY
Come on, I want to see.
HANCOCK
If you blink, you'll miss it.
Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
moisture. It showers into his open hands.
Mary reaches for it. Too late.
MARY
I saw it, right? A little cloud.
She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
touches his.
He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
her hand away.
MARY (CONY' D)
The water is dirty.
HANCOCK
MARY
HANCOCK
I'm sorry.
MARY
(into his eyes)
It's not your fault.
66.
Hancock looks away.
MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
You're tense.
HANCOCK
I've been tired, lately.
MARY
You should slow down. Rest.
HANCOCK
-So people tell me.
MARY
(heat; upon some thought)
It must be hard.
HANCOCK
Hard?
MARY
To always do right... do good when all
you want to do is rest.
HANCOCK
It's harder to not do anything. What am
I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
about people. Rest? When there is
despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
relief. You know that instant, that split
instant of time when you realize that the
nightmare... the totality of fear
itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
That it's safe? That is relief. The
infant in my arms... to the hysterical
mother. When you can see her face, what's
rest? It is self-indulgence.
Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."
MARY
Where... who are you?
HANCOCK
It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
what... where I'm from. It doesn't
matter. I'm a man. I am every man.
67.
MARY
(sizing up his words)
You probably get a lot of practice
explaining yourself, on account of who
you are and what you do.
HANCOCK
Why... do you say that?
MARY
It's like, everything you say sounds...
so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
that it's insincere...
(BEAT)
I mean, maybe it's something about you
but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.
MARY (CONT' D)
(APOLOGETIC)
But probably not... probably..
HANCOCK
Yes...
(pulling teeth)
sometimes.
Mary allows the moment to sink in.
MARY
So, you never answered. Back there...
what were you doing in the middle of the
street?
HANCOCK
(THINKS)
I was lost...
(EXHALES)
. but I think I'm ok, now.
CUT TO:
Trash cans fly. Paper, swept up and sent aflutter. We've seen
this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in
pell-mell pursuit.
He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER
to his liking.
68.
Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness.
Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
takes.
AARON
(HANCOCK)
" before long, you're running, looking
for a place to hide."
Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
they scale it.
Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.
PERCEVAL
Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
my hair.
Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
eyes are of disbelief.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
What's up?
(checks his hair)
What?
Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
with clenched fists.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
(rolls up sleeves)
I just combed my hair.
Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Don't bother. He's mine.
(to Aaron)
No biting. I hate biting.
SPENGLER
Kick his ass, Percy.
ERLICK
(OVERLAPPING)
Do him, Percy. He's your woman.
69.
PERCEVAL
Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
still kids.
Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
little gonad.
(BEAT)
Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
purple-headed shlongs the size of...
All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
BLOWS to the face and body.
Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
left and right...
ERLICK
He's yours.
SPENGLER
Save some for us.
Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.
ERLICK
What's he doing?
SPENGLER
Kick his ass, Percy.
Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
revenge presents itself.
ERLICK
That's cold.
?0.
SPENGLER
Kill him, Percy.
Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
orifice. Contemplates his target.
Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.
AARON
(to the boys)
Don't mess with me.
He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
taking him away.
CUT TO:
Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
cigarette smolders from his lips..
Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
triumphant, SMACKS it for five.
CUT TO:
A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
street.:.
80.
. as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
been drinking, right?
HORUS
Dear God.
Horus catches him.
On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.
HANCOCK
got to do what you got to do.
He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
hand. We sense a decision brewing...
Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
despair, a combination thereof.
He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.
By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
far away place.
AARON
Are you all right, mom?
MARY
(DISTRACTED)
Yeah... why?
AARON
You're acting weird.
MARY
(didn't hear)
What?
AARON
I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
it's time for your nap.
Aaron leaves.
Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.
The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
muffled volume.
Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
while, one would suspect.
88.
COP (O.S.)
Come back here! Stop him!
In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
follows suit, passing by.
COP (CONT'D)
Stop him!
Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.
Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
corner BAR.
Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
clouds - they're alive, restless.
She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.
HANCOCK
Hi.
(EMBARRASSED)
Thank you for being here.
MARY
Is everything all right?
89.
Hancock has no response.
U
MARY (CONT' D)
(CONCERNED)
What's wrong?
HANCOCK
(constipated; following some
THOUGHT)
It's cold.
Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(at the clouds)
They're moving. The turbulence has
started.
MARY
Tell me what's wrong.
He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
darkness.
HANCOCK
Look out there and what do you see, Mary?
MARY
(PERPLEXED)
Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
anything.
HANCOCK
see it,can
It's out there. But you can't
Y nu?
(beat; holding on to a thread)
And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
there.
MARY
Please, Hancock. What are you talking
about? What's out there?
HANCOCK
Duty.
(beat; at Mary)
You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
Or what? You let the next guy do it for
you, if you don't... if you can't.
(losing it)
And... but. If I can't, then who?
(MORE)
90.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
Just "I must."
Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
what I have to do. I get in there.., all
the killing... the blood... and I deal
with it. I clean up. I make things right.
(BEAT)
And. But when.., where does it end?
(re: his cape)
Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
do, Mary. The things I am capable of
doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
seen. It's in me...
(points to his head)
in here and I can't not think about
it. It's in me. It's me.
MARY
Hancock... what...
HANCOCK
I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
break. I need to get away. Get away to
where? I don't know.
(at Mary)
I need your help.
MARY
Me? What can I do?
(she's helpless)
What do you want me to do?
HANCOCK
I want you to save me.
MARY
How?
Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
her senses, pulls away.
MARY (CONT'D)
Don ' t.
91.
HANCOCK
(DESPERATE)
Save me.
MARY
I can't.
HANCOCK
You can.
(the hard sell)
AND
Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
anymore.
MARY
(OVERLAPPING)
I'm married.
A pause.
HANCOCK
To whom?
MARY
I love him.
The death blow.
HANCOCK
No.
(turns from her)
Unacceptable.
MARY
I love him. I'm sorry.
One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
Mary wants to console... but what can she do?
HANCOCK
I'm cold.
Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.
MARY
I'm sorry.
92.
She leaves.
CUT TO:
The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
soiled in disgrace.
He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
Hancock, anywhere.
Aaron waits, hopeful.
Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
upper branches of a tree.
SUE
(so innocent, her voice)
Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.
SUE (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
tree.
Hancock's reaction - "what?"
SUE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
My pussycat. She won't come down.
She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
eyes.
94.
So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.
SUE (CONT'D)
(so innocent, her voice)
Holy fuck.
Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.
Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.
The place is empty. Deserted.
Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
- the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.
Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
stiff up his ass.
REED
What do we have here? A piece of shit.
A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
superguy.
Hancock stares at him.
95.
HANCOCK
(HUMORLESS)
Fuck off.
He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.
A
Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
chase... and confronts him, out of breath.
AARON
(a slight smile)
Hi.
HANCOCK
(turning; drunk)
What're you doing here?
AARON
(the smile fades)
I saw you walking. Where were you today?
You said you'd... be there.
Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.
HANCOCK
I don't know what you're talking about.
AARON
Where are you going? Can I go?
HANCOCK
You don't want to go where I'm going.
AARON
Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
today...
(trying to hold on)
and you said you'd pick me up at
school.
Hancock turns. He's upset now.
HANCOCK
Listen.
Aaron recoils.
HANCOCK (CONY' D)
(CONTINUING)
Listen. I'm not here to save you.
(MORE)
1
96.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
(pounds his chest)
Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
with it, kid. You are what you are and...
what I say, it won't do you any change.
You'll grow up to be just like-your old
man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
hope by the grace of God the reaming's
gentle.
Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.
HANCOCK (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
here to save you.
He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
against the rocks.
In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.
In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
her glory.
GINA
I've been waiting.
They stare for one horny beat.
Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.
\./
A phone booth - Gina's office.
There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
her leather.
GINA
Come on, baby. Relax.
HANCOCK
I can't.
98.
GINA
You can.
The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.
HANCOCK
I can't.
GINA
Let it go, baby. Just let it...
RING...
HANCOCK
(in tears)
I can't.
His arm rips through the glass...
GINA
. go.
(ORGASMS)
Oh god.
HANCOCK
I can't!
RING...
He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'
GINA
Don't give up, now.
He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.
There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
presence, toys with fallen leaves.
The store bathroom.
Horus - his reflection in the mirror. He stares at himself.
Disgust.
R
He washes his face.
104.
Hancock's P.O.V. - a blurred, wobbly image of an alley. He-takes
a swig from a fresh bottle of whiskey.
He turns a corner... a dark FIGURE jumps him.,, knocks him
against the wall... GUN pointed.
it is the Hoodlum - from before..,
HOODLUM
Scream and I blow...
(not you again!)
oh shit.
Hancock in a foul mood. He brushes the Hoodlum away, sending
flesh and bone against the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing.
The Hoodlum. Dead.
Hancock - realization. He hastens to the body... limp... broken.
HANCOCK
No... don't. No.
(LOUDER)
No!
He moves away. Angry. Tired. Drunk. Hancock drops against the
wall, beaten...
Hancock listens.
MARY (V.O.)
once there was a way, to get back
home..."
Her voice grips him. Torments him...
This dilapidated structure serves as landing pad for Hancock,
easing Mary down with him.
A swift kick and the oor is no more. He drags her down
into the bowels of da roof d rkness.
MARY
What're you doing?
HANCOCK
What I got to do.
CUT TO:
The SOUND of distant SIRENS are heard. They arrive binlthe form
of three POLICE CARS - pulling up
From one of the cars - Officer Rutger and Officer Adams, in
control of the situation.
108.
Rutgers and Adams - cops with Dirty Harry delusions. They greet
Horus as one would Rodney Dangerfield.
RUTGERS
You did the right thing, Longfellow.
HORUS
(COP)
I saw four. Presumably armed. Only other
way out is through the back.
The cops trade laughs.
RUTGERS
Take a hike, Longfella. Get back in your
hole and watch the law kick some ass.
Horus, reluctant, returns inside his building.
Rutgers moves to work the speakers - his action preempted by the
other COPS.
COP #1
We got something big going down.
(LISTENS)
Shit, all units. What the bell's going
on?
109.
ADAMS
(at the computer)
Killybegs Textiles. The Cap sounds like
he's chewing the rag.
RUTGERS
Fuck, what do we do with this?
COP #1
This is a wrap. Come on, lets roll! All
units.
ADAMS
I don't like the smell of this shit.
Horus, watching the red and blue light fade into the night. His
complexion is the color of liquid paper.
On Horus - as he swallows, backing away and down the street. See
coward run. See coward hide. He disappears around the corner...
. but something pulls him back. He reappears, thinking,
staring at his feet. Destiny awaits him.
CUT TO:
POLICE UNITS flood this once quiet and forgotten block. S.W.A.T.
teams ooze from vans. COPS kneel behind their cars, guns cocked.
We SEE Ted Brock - he's on the radio, hammering out orders. He
looks pissed.
Rutgers and Adams arrive. They take position next to fellow
COPS.
ADAMS
What's with the Cap? Looks like someone
just fucked his wife, or something.
Nervous smiles from the fellas.
In the wide expanse of this top floor - Hancock and Mary. He
squats before her, calm - unperturbed by the activities outside.
Mary huddles in her spot, occasionally stealing glances outside.
Hancock simply stares at her. At the curves of her gentle frame.
The alcohol's wearing off.
with gloom.
Those clouds that shroud the sky
a CRACKLE of lightning echoes through the
They begin to surge
neighborhood. And the rain begins to pour.
114.
All right, so this block is squared off - surrounded. The local
police force and your cousins are here, ready to pounce on cue.
Ted "the pissed-off police captain" Brock stands by his vehicle,
screaming out orders - a BULL HORN in his hand.
TED
Let the lady go, Hancock. Or all hell's
going to break loose.
RUTGERS
(to Adams)
Does he know anything else?
Hancock. Mary. She's slumped against the wall, exhausted.
TED (O.S.)
(bull horn)
Come on out!
Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves.
He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
healing.
Hancock closes in - corners her.
MARY
Please.
But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his
hand down her back and between her buttocks.
MARY (CONT' D)
(in tears)
No...
HANCOCK
Please...
A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES
Hancock across the face.
MARY
NO!
He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.
115.
HANCOCK
(a desperate child)
Help me.
TED (O.S.)
(bull horn)
All HELL'S going to break loose!
Hancock recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches
his ear.
HANCOCK
Make it go away, Mary.
Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him
struggle.
TED (0. S)
You are surrounded. There's no way out of
this one... NO WAY OUT!
Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes it off.
HANCOCK
No... do what I got to do.
He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through...
C
the other side. The authorities react. They right their
guns.
Ted Brock - a picture of grim impatience, breathing hard.
TED
I want his balls in a jar...
Chad. The others. They take a good look at him.
TED (CONT' D)
in a fucking vice...
(into horn)
this is the END of the line.
Hancock - pacing the floor, trying to marshal some emotional
order.
He drops to a squat, searching for calm.
116.
MARY
I'm cold..
Hancock does not respond.
MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
You're fighting a lot, right now. I know
that.
(BEAT)
They're out there waiting for you. It's
like... sometimes.., you feel like the
world's waiting for you. Expecting.
What's your next move, they want to
know...
TED (O.S.)
there's NO ESCAPE!
MARY
(CONTINUING)
and the responsibility. The duty. You
can't shrug it off.
(BEAT)
I know that. And I'm sorry.
Hancock - a committed stare into space. Can he hear her?
MARY (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
Maybe... if you knew that, that I know.
And. That I won't expect anything from
you. And... there doesn't have to be a
next move.
Hancock turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch.
Mary - back to wall, on the defensive.
He approaches. Stands before her.
He reaches back... and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently
shielding her. from the cold.
There is no eye contact.
Ted. Out of patience. He signals to a RIFLEMAN atop an adjacent
building.
Signal acknowledged. The Rifleman loads his piece...
in.
TED
Where the fuck is Chopper Three?
CHAD
(CONCERNED)
This is a hostage situation, Cap. We've
got a woman in there.
TED
Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I
want that bastard in a body bag.
Ted waves a "go-when-ready" sign. The Rifleman steadies his high-
powered weapon... FIRES...
Bullets EXPLODE against walls... bricks... Mary SCREAMS, ducking
to the floor.
Hancock REACTS, the chaos throbbing inside his head. And like
that something snaps.
He BURSTS out of the building - eyes lit with the Hell inside.
He lands on the wet surface below. ROARS before the police force
- possessed.
HANCOCK
Go away! Go. Away.
The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops.
S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins.
Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of
shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of
superFLESH.
He stares at them all, invincible.
Through this downpour hobbles Horus - pass police CARS
SCREECHING by, en route to Killybegs. A police car sits in front
of his apartment, lights blaring.
A HELICOPTER (Chopper Three) has since joined the picture of
CHAOS. A strobe light cuts through the darkness and rain, zeroed
in on Hancock.
A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets
ricochet off the superhero with no effect.
Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only
thing they can do, and it's worthless.
And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
RIPS the vehicle in half.
An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning
PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of
Cops - heads are severed, sent flying.
Horus sprints through the downpour, following the SOUNDS of
destruction. At the scene, he arrives in time to witness the
dismantling of future law enforcement.
120.
Hancock swoops down toward a patrol car. Scares the Cops away.
Hoists the vehicle over. his head. Throws it at a band of Cops.
He ROARS...
HANCOCK
Go away!
Aaron and Roheim arrive, finding their places behind Horus. They
startle him.
HORUS
Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be
here.
ROHEIM
(at the mayhem)
I need a drink.
Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him.
It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's.
Aaron ducks into his father's chest.
In the blink of an eye, the police department is no more. The
entire block - a panorama of bedlam, overturned vehicles, and
mangled bodies.
Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
belonging to Adams.
A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes
that no revolver will do. He continues forth.
Mary is on the floor, wrapped in cape.
Hancock returns. He's pumped, deranged, and he's lost that
loving feeling.
121.
MARY
What have you dome?
HANCOCK
I made them go away.
HORUS (O.S.)
Mary!
Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar.
MARY
(HORROR)
Horus!
HANCOCK
(holding his head)
The noise...
HORUS (O.S.)
Mary!
MARY
Horus!
HANCOCK
Why?!
MARY
Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him.
(grabs him)
It'll never go away.
Hancock responds to "it."
MARY (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
If you've got anything left... inside...
(hand over heart)
and you do, I know you do... whatever
it was that you felt for me... inside...
then you won't go out there.
He just looks at her.
MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
Just let go... and it'll go away. Please,
just let go.
HANCOCK
(DESPAIR)
I can't.
122.
Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man. He
wants a fight.
And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the
building - fire in his eyes.
HANCOCK
You ready to rock it up?
Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock
follows, toying with the man.
Horus disappears inside.
HANCOCK (CONT' D)
Come out, you little shit.
A pause in action - no reply from Horus.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
Are you a man?!
Horus answers...
He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
brick structure.
HORUS
Fuck you.
Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
street.
Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
- grabbing him by the collar.
With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.
123.
He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't.
Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace
towards his wounded game.
Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back
against the curb, nowhere left to go.
Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -
not unlike Scarpo much
The situation presents itself - he reacts.
A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.
bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus
else can he do?
Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strike es
this piece of jagged metal.
(CONT' D)
(DEFIANT)
No regrets.
HANCOCK
(COOL)
No mercy.
He takes aim...
AARON (O.S.)
NO!
Mary SCREAMS in the background...
Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
Killybegs Textile.
they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams...
and tear of recent artillery.
Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the
building with it.
A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.
Mary is no more.
HORUS
MARY!
Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
124.
AARON
(BLANKLY)
Mom...
Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping
over to the building that once was.
HORUS
MARY!
Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
pale.
Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.
ROHEIM (O.S.)
(you're wasting your time)
Come on, Horus.
Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
midst... surveys the carnage...
A loaded beat.
Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
knees... by a fallen police GUN.
He picks it up...
points it at his head...
FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
off skull.
Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
surreal sight.
Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
He stops.
126.
