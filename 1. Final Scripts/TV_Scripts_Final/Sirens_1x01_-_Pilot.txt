      EXT. BREAKFAST BISTRO - CHICAGO -  MORNING

      Chock full of hipsters - the staff and the clientele. At an 
      outdoor table sits HANK - 32, black, handsome, wearing his 
      EMToutfit. Sipping an espresso from a tiny cup and eating a 
      plate of sliced apples. Here comes JOHNNY - 32, white, rugged 
      good looks. Not happy right now: 

                                    JOHNNY
                    Ya gotta be shittin me.

                                    HANK
                    My day to pick - I picked a bistro. 
                      Thought you d like the chicks.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Which ones are the chicks? 

                                    HANK
                    Every day it s your turn, you pick 
                    some depressing old diner where 
                    they pour sadness over your 
                      pancakes and the youngest chick in 
                    the place is 87 years old. 

      An incredibly cute waitress drops off some honey and brown 
      sugar. Her beauty is affected only by a long ugly serpent 
      tattoo that stretches all the way down one arm. She exits.

                                    JOHNNY
                    As opposed to that chick - who 
                    looks like she s about to star in 
                    The Girl With The DouchebagTattoo. 
                      I like sad pancakes and I like my 
                    sad pancakes served by someone sad 
                    who got their tattoo either in the 
                      Marines or the holocaust and I like 
                    to get both my lonely coffee and my 
                      tragic pancakes for less than 4 
                    very happy dollars. How much did 
                    you pay for that apple? 

                                    HANK 
                      5 bucks. But it tastes like 10. 
                      When s the last time you had a 
                    piece of fruit?

                                    JOHNNY
                    Is there fruit in Fruit Loops?

      Hank knows Johnny like his own brother. Translates:    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 2


                                    HANK
                    This ain t about the pancakes. This 
                    is about the guy who died on us 
                      yesterday.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    He was the same age as us, bro. Hit 
                    by a bus.

                                    HANK
                    Dead on impact. Even though we 
                      worked on him for almost half an 
                    hour there was nuthin we could do 
                    about it. Not a sad pancake deal.

                                    JOHNNY
                            (looking off - lost)
                      Really puts things in perspective.

                                    HANK
                    Check this perspective asshole:you 
                    got Daddy issues, which lead to 
                    your Mommy issues, which lead to 
                    your commitment issues - let s not 
                    throw a mortality grenade into that 
                    whole goddammess.  

                                    JOHNNY
                          (long beat)
                      I miss her, man.

                                    HANK
                      Omigod! This is about Theresa. I 
                    knew it! Ya wanna talk about 
                      perspective? Look at it from hers: 
                    she lived with a guy who showed 
                    more commitment to diners than he 
                    did to getting married. Tell ya one 
                    thing I don t miss: the screaming 
                    crazy arguments and the endless 
                      grudges and the constant breakups. 

                                    JOHNNY
                      I don t wanna die alone. Like that 
                    guy yesterday.

                                    HANK
                    Okay then. Y knowwhat you should 
                    do? Get back together with her.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Really?

                                    HANK
                    Oh yeah. Guarantee you won t die 
                      alone.

                                  HANK (CONT'D)
                    Cause the last thing you ll see 
                    will be her standing over you 
                      holding whatever weapon it was she 
                      killed you with.   

                                    JOHNNY
                    Still can t believe she moved out.

                                    HANK
                      Johnny - do not - I repeat do NOT 
                    think about getting back together 
                    with her. You can t get murdered 
                    now. We got great seats for the 
                    Cubs opener.

                                    JOHNNY
                      I know. It s over. It s - done. 

                                    HANK
                          (a beat)
                    Ya need a moment?  

                                    JOHNNY
                    Yeah.

                                    HANK
                    Tough shit. We got a new guy comin 
                    on the rig today and I heard he s 
                    an ex-Navy Seal.      

                                    JOHNNY
                    Navy Seal. Shit. Do I look like I 
                    been cryin ?

                                    HANK
                    You were actually cryin ?

                                    JOHNNY
                            (defensive)
                    No. Misty. I got misty.


      INT. AMBULANCE/EXT. CHICAGO STREETS- LATER

      Johnny drives, waiting for a call. Eating a jelly donut and 
      drinking his coffee. Hank rides shotgun. In the middle is the 
      new guy - BRIAN, mid-twenties. Short. Stocky. Blonde crew 
      cut. Bag of candy. Wide-eyed.

                                    BRIAN
                    You guys want a Skittle?

      Hank and Johnny exchange a look. No takers.    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 4


                                    BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Wow. This is a regular lime Skittle 
                    in a Wild Berry Skittle bag. 
                      What rethe odds?

                                    HANK
                      I thought I read somewhere that you 
                    were with the Navy Seals.

                                    BRIAN
                    Navy? No no - EASTER seals. 
                      Volunteered. This is so cool. First 
                    day on the job. You guys Facebook? 

                                    JOHNNY
                    No I don t Facebook- matter a fact 
                      I don t even read regular books. I 
                    eat, I sleep, I save lives.

                                    HANK
                            (sarcastic)
                    He s a very complicated man.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Hey - I control technology, 
                      technology does not control me.

                                    HANK
                    Which means he can access online 
                    porn from his phone WHILE he s 
                      driving.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    Is there some fancy name for that?

                                    HANK
                    Last time I checked it was still 
                      called jerkin  off.

                                    DISPATCH (O.S.)
                      Chicago North 115 report of 
                      overturned automobile corner of 
                    North Shore Drive and West 
                      Hawthorne. Driver trapped inside.

      Hank responds and Johnny hits the gas as the sirens wail.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Hang on Easter Seal - I know a 
                      shortcut.

      He pulls a 180, tires squealing, and just misses getting 
      slammed by a huge truck coming in one direction and a bus 
      headed in the other. Brian blesses himself.  

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    Might wanna say a rosary too.    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 5


                                    HANK
                    This comin from a man who doesn t 
                      believe in God.

      Johnny is driving like Jeff Gordon while almost nonchalantly 
      eating his donut and slurping coffee.

                                    JOHNNY
                      I never said I don t believe in 
                    God. I said I believe Michael 
                      Jordan is God.

                                    HANK
                    Then why ain t you wearin a 
                      Scottie Pippenmedal on your collar 
                      instead of St. Jude?

                                    JOHNNY
                    Who s complicated now, asshole?

      Johnny speeds thru an intersection, barely avoiding cars and 
      trucks coming from every direction. 

                                    DISPATCH (O.S.)
                      Chicago North! Possible fuel leak

                                    JOHNNY
                    Like you don t download porn to 
                    your phone.

                                    HANK
                    I try to keep my dickaway from my 
                      phone. He always wants to call my ex.


      EXT. W. HAWTHORNE AND NO. SHORE DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

      The ambulance screeches to a halt close by an overturned 
        automobile. Several bystanders. No other emergency vehicles. 
      The guys jump out. Don McLean s  AMERICAN PIE  is blaring 
      from the overturned car s audio system. 

                                    JOHNNY
                    Got a fuel leak ready to spark. 

      He points out the leak - and the camera pans to reveal the 
      DRIVER, unconscious and bleeding in the passenger foot well.

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    I m goin in.

      Hank clears the remainder of broken glass from the window.

                                    BRIAN
                      Aren t we supposed to wait for the 
                    fire department?    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 6


                                    JOHNNY
                    Yup. Get the body board.

                                    BRIAN
                      Especially when there s a chance 
                    the vehicle could go up in flames?  

                                    JOHNNY
                            (crawling thru the 
                              driver s side window)
                      Absolutely. But I can t stand this 
                      goddamsong. If it was The White 
                      Stripes we d wait. Now move your 
                      easterbunny ass!

      As Brian runs to the rig, Johnny snakes himself across the 
      front seat as Hank keeps an eye on him and the fuel leak.  
      Other sirens can be heard approaching.

                                    HANK
                    Leak is gettin heavy, bro. And 
                    based on personal experience I 
                      estimate there s another 14 verses 
                    left in this crappy tune.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Almost there.

      He s squirming and struggling - seems close to reaching the 
      victim when: his hand reaches up and shuts off the car, 
      killing the engine and the music.

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                      I dunnowhich was gonnaexplode 
                      first, the car or my friggin head.

      He feels the guy s neck.

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    He s alive.    

                                    HANK
                    Thank God. This couldabeen so much 
                      worse.

                                    JOHNNY
                    How?

                                    HANK
                    What if he liked Madonna?

      Johnny and Hank pull the guy out.  Just as they carry the guy 
      to safety, the back end of the car bursts into FLAMES.

      EXT. W. HAWTHORNE AND NO. SHORE DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

      Cops and firefighters and ambulance personnel are on the 
      scene. Hoses turned on, water fed, and shooting. Brian has 
      the body board and Johnny and Hank have stabilized the 
      victim s neck with a brace. As they strap him to the board, a 
      Fire Lieutenant approaches. 

                                    JOHNNY
                    Where were you comin from, Lard-
                    ass? Milwaukee? We been here 
                      fifteen minutes already.

                                    CHICAGO FIRE LT.
                      Bullshit, Farrell! I m writin you 
                    up again, numbnuts!

                                    JOHNNY
                      Course you are.  Cause all the 
                      rescue work is already over so only 
                    thing left is the paperwork.

      Hank and Brian lift the boarded victim onto the gurney and 
      roll him towards the back of their rig. Johnny brushes him 
      off and helps Hank and Brian get the gurney in the back of 
      the rig. Suddenly a gorgeous female cop, THERESA, and her 
      equally gorgeous black male partner, DANNY, arrive at the 
      ambulance back doors.  

                                    THERESA
                      Pissedoff fire lieutenant, car in 
                      flames, victim already locked and 
                      loaded - figured it had to be 
                      Johnny and Hank. Guys, this is my 
                    new partner, Danny.

       Hey s  all around. Just a head nod from Johnny. Through the 
      following, Hank and Brian secure the patient.

                                    HANK
                    This is our new guy Brian. Brian - 
                      Theresa.

                                    THERESA
                    How s it hangin Bri?

                                    BRIAN
                    Um- good.

                                    THERESA
                          (to Danny)
                      Johnny s dad was a highly decorated 
                      Chicago fireman who retired as a 
                    hero a hundred times over but left 
                    his mother for a stripper when 
                      Johnny was thirteen.

                                    THERESA (CONT'D)
                    Plus he fails the firefighter test 
                    every year which is more than 
                      likely a subconscious form of 
                      sabotage so he can stay in this job 
                    which he loves and does better than 
                      everyone else on the planet. Except 
                    Hank.  
                          (Johnny is smiling)
                      What s funny.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Nothing. She wasn t a stripper.

                                    THERESA
                      Right. She was just a drunk who 
                    liked to take her clothes off in 
                      nightclubs where they serve steak.

                                    HANK
                          (off the patient)
                    We re good to go here, bro!

      As Johnny begins to close the doors, he notices Theresa 
      carefully straightening Danny s badge. A telling moment of 
        tenderness? Hank notices it too. As Theresa and Danny walk 
      away - Hank looks right into Johnny:

                                    HANK (CONT D)
                    You awright?

      Johnny appreciates the concern, pats Hank on the shoulder as 
      a thank you gesture and BAM! slams the doors shut:


      INT. AMBULANCE / EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

      They fly through traffic, sirens and lights ablaze. Johnny 
      drives as Hank finishes vitals on the guy and then asks Brian 
      to hand him medical supplies, which Brian does as ordered:

                                    HANK
                    Tape.

                                    JOHNNY

                    stuff about me in front of whats-
                        his-nameunless she still cared

      Hank notices a cellphone on the gurney next to the victim.

                      Didn t look like Denzelto me.  
                      Looked like Dennis Rodman.

      Hank expertly dresses several wounds during the following:

                    Not a problem. Bri - run down the 
                    rig and get the ColoVac500. It s

                    Wow. The ColoVac500. Sounds 
                      powerful. Is it gonnahurt?

                                    JOHNNY
                    It s gonnahurt a lot. Mainly 
                      because it doesn t exist.

                                    COKE BOTTLE GUY
                    But he just ran like a bat out of 
                    hell as soon as you said the name.

                                    HANK
                    He s new. And we re paramedics,

      INT. - MOVING AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATER

      Sirens wailing. Lights ablaze. Johnny drives.

                    Okay okay!


      EXT. - CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS

      WIDE ANGLE shows the ambulance is literally moving at about 7 
      mph. Cars and trucks speed past. Some cars backed up behind 
      it, beeping their horns as Johnny waves them to go around.


      INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

      Hank sits in the back, bored as Brian reassures the guy, 
      who s laying on the gurney with his knees up, moaning and 
      breathing heavily. ANGLE ON JOHNNY: as he hears the Whoop 
      Whoopof a police car, Theresa and Danny pull up alongside 
      the ambulance.

                                    THERESA
                    You realize you re doing literally

                                    JOHNNY
                    Yeah. Got a guy in the back with a 
                    coke bottle jammed up his keister.    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 20


                                    THERESA
                    Wow. What is it with men wanting to 
                    put stuff in their rear ends?

                                    JOHNNY
                      Askin the wrong guy. You lived 
                    with me almost two years - did I 
                    ever get anything stuck up my ass?

                                    THERESA
                    You mean besides your own head?

      Danny laughs hard and heavy at that until he notices Johnny s 
      not laughing-- he s glaring at him. And she speeds off. 
      Johnny s pissed. Sees a giant pothole ahead - and gets an 
      idea. He purposely drives right over it - making the entire 
      rig slam down and rumble up.

                    Ahh!

      IN THE BACK: the coke bottle rolls off the gurney and across 
      the floor of the rig.

      INT. SANDWICH JOINT - LATER THAT DAY

      The guys have ordered sandwiches and are now picking out 
      drinks from the cooler. Brian is holding the door open as 
      they gaze at the sea of bottles.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Whaddayawanna drink?

                      Speaking of which - Denzel
                      approaching.  

      Danny is walking towards them. Johnny notices how Hank is 
      eyeballing him:

                                    JOHNNY
                    Maybe he should be your new ICE.

                                    HANK
                      I would gladly strip down njump

                                    DANNY
                    Hey guys. Johnny - Theresa wants to 
                    talk to you outside for a sec.

      Johnny s head drops with a sigh.

                                    JOHNNY
                          (to Danny)
                    Do me a favor. Shoot me.

                    You want some sperm, Denzel?

      Danny doesn t know what to say. Hank smirks.

                    Did I just say what I think I just

      EXT. SANDWICH SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

      Johnny notices that the police cruiser is empty. Glances 
      around when he hears a hushed  hey  which seems to come from 
      inside the back of the rig, where one door s ajar. He crosses 
      to peek inside when someone grabs him and pulls him in:


      INT. BACK OF THE AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

      grabs him and kisses him. Starts undoing his belt. She s 
      already got her pants off and shirt open.

                          (a beat - then:)
                      I asked you first.

                                    THERESA
                            (pulling back)
                    So - none. I can t BELIEVE you 
                      Johnny! All this time and you 
                      haven t been on a single date!

                      around on me! I M the one who 
                      should be pissedoff at YOU!
                          (to his penis)
                    Stay with me bro.

                                    THERESA
                    For what? Doing what we both agreed 
                    to do? See other people so we could 
                      figure out whether or not we 
                      ultimately belong together? I KNEW 
                    you were never gonnasee anyone!

                                    JOHNNY
                    Who the hell am I gonnasee? Hah? I 
                    work all the time!

                                    THERESA
                    So do I! That didn t stop me from 
                      meeting a Matt Damon look-a-like 
                    and the Chicago version of Channing
                      Tatum.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Who s ChanningTatum?

                                    THERESA
                    He s like Matt Damon only younger 
                    and - hunkier.
                          (off his penis)
                    Wow. You have some kind of Matt 
                    Damon fetish?

                                    JOHNNY
                    Must be the arguing. Go time!

      He reaches out to grab her.

      She takes a breath. Looks right into his eyes.  

                                    THERESA (CONT D)
                    I m not in love with any of these 
                    guys - I m still in love with you - 
                    but I m WORKING at finding out if 
                    this - thing - you and I have is 
                      gonnastand the test of time - if 
                      there s anyone else out there who 
                    is going to turn my head and make 
                    me laugh and make me sigh whenever 
                    he walks into the room - someone 
                    who, even when I m not with him, is 
                      always in my head making me wish 
                    time would move faster until the 
                    next moment I get to be with him. 

      A beat as he stares into her eyes and she his. Then:

                                    THERESA (CONT D)
                          (off his penis)
                    Oh my god - THAT made you lose your 
                      hard-on? Of course! Just the SOUND 
                    of commitment turns you off. OUT! 

      She turns her back and starts getting dressed - her phone is 
      by Johnny s knees. He picks it up. Eyeballs it. Scrolls:

                                    JOHNNY
                    You changed your ICE from me to 
                    your sister? You hate your sister.

                                    THERESA
                    My sister might suck but she s 
                    still my sister. YOU - on the other 
                    hand - have managed to transform 
                      yourself from the love of my life 
                    into not even a late night booty 
                    call.  

      He opens the door and -

                                    THERESA (CONT D)
                    Wait.

      She picks up his St. Jude medal - which had fallen off - and 
      tenderly fastens it back around his neck. They look into each 
      other s eyes for a second. Then - he jumps out. TWO WOMEN are 
      standing there. They see Theresa in her underwear and 
      unbuttoned police jersey with the hand cuffs on one wrist.

      After work. A pretty waitress smiles at them as she leaves 
      the table. They all raise their glasses in a toast.

                                    HANK
                      Congratulations on making it

                                    BRIAN
                    It s a Peach Cobbler. I invented 
                    it. Ginger ale, lemon zest and a 
                    dash of peach shnapps.

                                    KEENA
                    You keep drinking these - pretty 
                    soon your tits are gonnabe bigger

                    get us five beers and five shots of 
                      whiskey. 

                                    BRIAN
                          (gets up to go)
                    I m not supposed to drink whiskey.

                                    HANK
                    Why not?

                                    BRIAN
                    Makes me wanna take my clothes off.  
                    And sing.

                    Five doubles. Order five doubles.

      Brian crosses out. Johnny glances at his phone. 

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    We gotta go.

                      leaving her apartment right now to

                    She wears ChanelNo. 5 and you came 
                    back smelling like you just guest-

                      Pretty good look. Goes with my

                      She ll recognize my truck and your

                                    JOHNNY
                    Why not.

                                    MOLLY
                      Because unlike you he s a decent, 
                      civilized, moral human being who 
                      respects other people s privacy.

                                    HANK
                      Exactly. So we re gonnahave to get

                    that whiskey though.
                            (calling out to Brian)
                      Brian! Scratch the whiskey and get  
                    us 5 Peach Cobblers!

      Brian smiles and givers her a thumbs up. Hank high fives 
      Keena.

                      shittin bricks.

                    She s lookinthis way!

      They all duck down. A beat. Then:

                                    BRIAN
                    Did you see the new Jason Bourne 
                    movie with Jeremy Rennerwhere he s 
                    NOT Jason Bourne but he s like-
                          (off Johnny s reaction)
                      I didn t think you did.

                                    JOHNNY

                    She despises her sister.

      He sits up.

                                    HANK (CONT D)
                    Oh my god.

                                    JOHNNY
                    What?

                                    HANK
                    The guy drives a Lamborghini.

      They all peek up at the most incredible car you ve ever seen. 
      Then they duck back down. Johnny is in prayer mode.    

                                    JOHNNY
                    Oh Lord - please don t let her 
                    sleep with him please please
                      please.

                                    HANK
                    Lord - if you can hear me - please 
                    let this guy be gay.

                                    BRIAN
                    Hey, they re not leavin . They re 
                      making out.

      Brain was peeking and now they all rise up.  

                                    HANK
                    Okay - forget gay. Let him be bi.

      Suddenly Theresa pushes the guy away.

                                    JOHNNY
                      That s my girl. Kick him in the 
                    balls honey! Kick him in the - hey,

                                    BRIAN
                    She s gettin out.

      They watch as Theresa gets out of the car and crosses to the 
      front of it and - starts writing something down.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Wait. Is she -

                                    HANK
                    Yup. She is writing him a ticket.    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 33


                                    BRIAN
                    Must have been a terrible kiss.

                                    HANK
                      Brian?

                                    BRIAN
                      I know. I ll stop talking.

      Theresa walks to the driver side window of the Lamborghini.  
      The Matt Damon-ChanningTatumguy rolls it down and she hands 
      it to him. He speeds off.  

                                    BRIAN (CONT D)
                    She s comin this way!

      They all duck down again. Shhh-ingeach other. There is a 
      long beat as they hold their breath and then - TAP TAPTAPon 
      the window. Brian gets up and rolls down his window in the 
      back. Johnny and Hank stay down.

                                    BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Theresa.

                                    THERESA
                    Why do you smell like peaches?

                                    BRIAN
                    I m drunk. You wanna go swimming?

      Johnny and Hank slide up.

                                    JOHNNY
                    You just give that guy a ticket?

                                    THERESA
                    Yes. His registration was expired - 
                    which I normally let go when I m on 
                      a date with such an incredibly 
                      handsome, sexy, shockingly wealthy 
                    hunk of manhood - except for two 
                      things. Number one? He couldn t 
                    stop talking about himself.  He was 
                    an arrogant cocky self-involved 
                      asshole. Which is what I seem to be 
                      attracted to. So I was still gonna
                    let him make out with me right 
                    there in the car for hopefully 
                    about fifteen minutes.

                                    BRIAN
                      Because it was a Lamborghini?

                                    THERESA
                    That and the fact I knew you guys 
                    were out here watching.    SIRENS - LEARY & FISHER  7-24-12                 34


                                    JOHNNY
                    How?

                                    THERESA
                      Because I GPS dYOUR phone about 
                    two months ago.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Oh.

                                    THERESA
                    Plus he had a tongue like a horse. 
                    And he tried to finger me. Which I 
                    don t allow on the first date. 
                      Unless the guy s a really great 
                      kisser. Then it s both hands on 
                    deck.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    She s kidding.

                                    THERESA
                      Y knowwhat? I never should have 
                      deleted you as my ICE -  cause who 
                      better to call in case of emergency 
                    than someone who s already parked 
                    right across the street!? Johnny - 
                    if only you had put this much 
                      thought and energy into our 
                      relationship while we were living 
                      together. It would have been 
                      charming and impressive. And might 
                    have ended with us walking home 
                      together tonight, arm in arm - 
                      totally in love. Instead - I m 
                      taking a taxi. By myself. And shame 
                    on you for getting this innocent 
                    young man drunk and using his car 
                    for your nefarious plan! Good 
                      night!  

      She turns and walks way. They all watch her go. There is a 
      long, uncomfortably quiet beat in the car. Then:  

                                    HANK

                      I need something to drink - 
                      something without alcohol.

      She hands him a Coke. He downs a couple Advil. Takes a swig.

                                    BRIAN
                    Think I m off peaches. And bars.  
                    And swimming.

                                    JOHNNY

                      middle of that whole Theresa thing 
                    last night, Easter Seal. It was 
                      unfair and irresponsible.

                                    BRIAN
                    No no. That part was awesome. I ve 
                    never been on a spy mission before.

      He downs two more Advil. Huge swig of Coke.

                                    JOHNNY

      Brian takes another huge swig.

                                    BRIAN
                    This Coke tastes funny.

      A beat. Brian stares back at them. Then does a HUUUGEspit 
      take and starts screaming with his tongue stuck straight out 
      until he heads into the locker room. Johnny spent that time 
      taking pictures with his phone. Which he is now dialing on.
