    BEN and SAMMY (Sammy driving) braced against their seat belts 
    as they skid to a sudden stop. OUT THE WINDSHIELD -- a black 
      GANGSTER is beating up a half-naked TEENAGE GIRL, who CRIES 
    and SCREAMS for help. Ben and Sammy pop their doors. 


      Trash cans, bikes, all CRASH DOWN as they run through. Ben 
      sees the guy clutch his waistband and bang through a door 
      into the house. Ben draws his gun and bangs in after. 


      They stumble through a LAUNDRY ROOM and into a messy KITCHEN, 
      knocking shit everywhere. The guy bolts out a SCREEN DOOR 
      nearly taking it off its hinges, Ben closing in, and then --


      LYDIA wakes up to an urgent POUNDING on her front door. She 
      checks the alarm clock -- it s 5:57 a.m. WTF? She grabs her 
      gun from her night stand drawer and goes out into the hall...    


      Lydia looks through the peephole, Christ... She opens up to 
      find DENELLE PRICE, looking desperate and scared. Denelle, 
      once pretty, is Lydia s age but looks older. 

                                    DENELLE
                    I know, I m sorry, me bein  here, 
                    but I needed someplace safe.  

                                  LYDIA
                          (pissed off)
                    How d you get my address, Denelle? 

                                    DENELLE
                    Pastor Higgins at our church.  

                                  LYDIA
                     Our church?  Only time you were 
                    there, you were wrapped in a 
                    blanket eating soup. 

                                    DENELLE
                    You gonna let me in?  

                                  LYDIA
                    No. What the hell are you doing 
                    back in the neighborhood? 

                                    DENELLE
                    It s my brother s birthday.  

                                  LYDIA
                          (exasperated)
                    Your brother is in Pelican Bay.

                                    DENELLE
                    Yeah, but I still gotta mark it 
                    with my  play  brother, Darren.

                    I dunno --  

                                  LYDIA
                    Denelle, listen to me: we moved you 
                    after the trial for your safety. 
                    You wanna stay safe, you gotta go 
                    back to Lancaster and stop sneaking 
                    back to your old  hood. 
                          (as Denelle s eyes well up)
                    What? 

                                  DENELLE
                    Things ain t exactly worked out for

                    You re using again?

      Lydia grabs her hand, sees her fingertips are somewhat burnt. 

                                  DENELLE
                    Nuh-uh, I swear... Now c mon, can I 
                    come in? 
                          (off Lydia, feeling played)
                    Please, I got nowhere else. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Couple hours, that s it, till I can 
                    figure out what to do with you. 

      Lydia reluctantly lets her in, wincing at the smell of her. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


    A fit, buffed-out JOHN, SWEAT POURING down his face, lets the 
    270 lbs. he just bench-pressed CLANG the rack above his head. 
    He feels like a new man, and it shows in his every movement. 

    He swigs some Powerade and grabs a jump rope. As he jumps, 
      getting faster... starting to do some fancy footwork... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SAMMY drives with coffee talking to TAMMI on his Bluetooth,

                    the whole bottle.  

                                  TAMMI (V.O.)
                    Did you change him? 

                                  SAMMY
                    No, I like to just let him sit in 
                    it. 

    A beat-up FORD with a tatted-up DRIVER pulls alongside him. 
      Sammy speeds up, keeping an eye on his side-view MIRROR...

                                  TAMMI (V.O.)
                    I m just asking, Sammy. I know 
                    sometimes you re rushed --

                    No, I still don t know. River says 
                    that the mercury -- 

                                  SAMMY
                    Yeah, I know what  River  says. I 
                    don t think your Pilates teacher s 
                    opinion should get more weight than 
                    the Surgeon General. All the crap I 
                    get exposed to on the street, we 
                    can t risk it... 

    He stops at a RED LIGHT, and yeah, something is hinky. The 
      Driver is REVVING HIS ENGINE and really eye-fucking him now.

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    Listen, um, I ll call you back in a 
                    bit -- bye. 

      Sammy glances in his MIRROR: Nate just GURGLING happily...

                                  DRIVER
                          (darkly, yelling over)
                    Whattsa matter? You don t remember 
                    me?

      Sammy meets the guy s gaze, his hand moving to his gun... 

                                  SAMMY
                    Why, there a reason I should? 

    A long, tense beat. But then the Driver breaks into a grin.  

                                  DRIVER

      John suits up at the mirror (a crisp, dry-cleaned uniform), 
    and we see the still pink SCAR on his lower back. There s an 
      intense self-awareness to him as he secures his Sam Brown and 
      gun...  

    He stares into the mirror. In his eyes, mostly confidence, 
    but then just the hint of doubt: Now that he s off the 
      pills... does he still have the nerve to be out there?   

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  RUBEN
                    When I was on patrol, I wasn t 
                    making enough money, so I jump 
                    through the hoops to become a 
                    Detective Trainee. Now she 
                    complains I m making shit money and 
                    I m never home.

                                  LYDIA
                    She s right about the never home 
                    part. Detective hours.

                    I m tempted to go back to 
                      Afghanistan, do another tour, but 
                    I m scared she ll call my bluff 
                    just to get the signing bonus.

                    I m driving, so obviously I m 
                    contact. I carry a Glock .40, 
                    extended magazines are in my war 
                    bag. My back-up s on my right

                                  TANG

      John eyes her... wondering just how much she knows, and what 
      that was exactly. After a beat --

                    You ll start carrying a back-up

    She nods. Great. A beat of driving, and then:

                                  TANG
                    So, what nickname you gonna use? 
                     Hollywood,   Joy Luck,   Pu Tang?  
                    I ve pretty much heard  em all.

                    Ah, so you re the one... 

      As they both see, in front of them, a GREY CUTLASS fail to 
      stop for a PEDESTRIAN in a crosswalk, nearly hitting her.  

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    Light him up. 


      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey move through, clearing a CLASSROOM, 
      past TEACHERS clutching KIDS all desperate to stay hidden. 
    One 4 YEAR OLD under a desk points down a HALL. Sammy motions 
    and they head there, seeing BLOOD on the floor, more streaked 
    on the walls... They get to a BATHROOM DOOR, kids  paintings 
    all over it. On Sammy s signal, they bust in, TO FIND --   

    Our Gangster shot in the neck, alive, slumped against some 
      KIDDIE TOILETS. He s soaked in his own blood and literally 
      drowning in it, sucking air with a horrible RASPING sound. 

      Seeing cops, he tries to get up and grab for his gun, which 
      lies on the tiles just a few feet out of his reach. But it s 
      pathetic. Sammy kicks the gun away, as our cops stand over 
      him catching their breath...    

                                  BEN

                    location, suspect down with a 
                    gunshot wound to the neck...  

      Sammy moves closer to the guy.

                    Wouldn t you guys agree? 
                          (to Gangster)
                    You are definitely not gonna make

                    Just walk toward the light, man. 
                    Oh, wait, there is none where 
                    you re going.  

                                  SAMMY
                    Any last words? Maybe ask for 
                    forgiveness? 

    The Gangster, violent to the end, makes an awful GURGLING 
      noise that sounds a lot like  fuck you.  Then his eyes go 
      glassy. He dies with his head in one of the toilets. Long 
      beat, then --

                      Appropriate resting place at least.

    FAT WOMAN pulling a 4 YEAR OLD GIRL by the hand. The girl 
      waves to Ben. Ben waves back... as the Fat Woman SLAPS her 
      hard upside the head for being friendly to the cops. 

    Ben shakes his head slightly, watching them whiz by, as the 
      RADIO CRACKLES and we hear JOHN S VOICE buying a call -- 

                                  RADIO (O.S. JOHN)

                    Trouble at Dodger Stadium, Parking 
                    Lot 12.     

    Ben reacts to hearing his old T.O., throws Sammy a look --

                                  BEN
                    Cooper s back?

                    Sure. Okay. 

    As Sammy nods and whips a U-ey --

      I./E. JOHN & TANG S PATROL CAR/DODGERS PARKING LOT - DAY2525

      John and Tang roll up to a big CIRCULAR CROWD dwarfed by the 
      vastness of this huge deserted parking lot. We see the lonely 
      cement pilasters and cones separating the various parking 
      areas, the effect quite surreal. In the center of the crowd, 
    a beat-up BUICK appears to be recklessly  doing donuts.  

                                  JOHN
                    Knuckleheads... 

                                  TANG
                    It s only funny till someone s road 
                    kill.

      They hop out and move to the inner perimeter around the 
      Buick, tires WHINING as it banks around. Tang cautiously 
      approaches the driver s side, having to break into a jog, but 
      then sees --  

    NO ONE S DRIVING. It s a prank. A bungy cord holds the wheel 
    in an endless  right turn  position.  

                                  JOHN
                          (to crowd)
                    Hey, fun s over! 

                                  TANG
                    Who did this? Anyone know? 

      The crowd s not talking; at least half take phone videos. The 
      Buick s wheels SQUEAL and start to smell of burnt rubber... 

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    Shoot the tires, T.J. Hooker? 

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah, and have to deal with FID? 
                    All that paperwork? 
                          (a beat)
                    Here, hold this. Don t wanna get 
                    caught on anything. 

      John takes off his side-handle Monadnock baton and hands it 
      to her, along with his sunglasses, starts stretching his back 
    a little -- 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (re: back)
                    Let s hope the pins hold.

      CONTINUED:2525

    He starts running alongside the car, holding on to the frame 
    of the OPEN WINDOW. At just the right moment, John dives in 
      head-first, eventually getting his legs in. We catch glimpses 
      of awkward movements, and then -- the car stops.  

      HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd, as John emerges with the 
      CONCRETE BLOCK that had been put on the gas pedal. Tang 
      shakes her head, pretty ballsy, as John throws her a smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    You could say that.

    A beat. Back to Denelle:

                    Denelle just got grabbed up at a 
                    drug bust -- in Compton.

      Ben looks at Sammy, the door obviously open for him to vent

      Sammy GUNS IT, shoving them back into their seats as they 
      rocket toward the crime. With just enough stopping distance, 
      Sammy SLAMS the brakes. OUT THE WINDOW -- a black GANGSTER is 
      beating up a half-naked TEENAGE GIRL, who CRIES and SCREAMS 
    for help. They pop their doors and leap out. FROM INSIDE THE 
      CAR, we see them sprinting toward the asshole, as we --

      Trash cans, bikes, all CRASH DOWN as they run through. Ben 
      sees the guy clutch his waistband and bang through a door 
      into the house. Ben draws his gun and bangs in after. 


      They stumble through a LAUNDRY ROOM and into a messy KITCHEN, 
      knocking shit everywhere. The guy bolts out a SCREEN DOOR 
      nearly taking it off its hinges, Ben closing in, and then --


      Tang and John drive, Tang glancing impatiently at her phone.

      other end of it is tied to the basket of the Genie Lift that 
      surrounds him. A 2ND  GENIE LIFT  is nearby, this one in the

    Ben is washing his hands as Ferguson joins him at the sinks. 
      Sammy, getting into civvies, glances over from his locker.  

                                  FERGUSON
                    No complaints so far, from the good

                    Looks like your shoddy first aid 
                    skills did the trick. Nice work.

                    Give it a rest, Danny.

    Ben yanks at a paper towel, trying not to be baited.  

                                  FERGUSON
                    No hard feelings, by the way. 

    Ben can t take it anymore --

      Up on the lift, Milsap is alert again, as Tang clicks off her 
      cell. John looks at her expectantly. Bicks and others are in

      John makes a face, terrific. Milsap shouts down from above --  

                                  MILSAP
                    So, that was Sandra? Is she coming 
                    here, or what? 

                                  JOHN
                    Like we said, Mr. Milsap, it s 
                    Sandra s day off -- 

                                  MILSAP

                    I know her schedule, okay? What I 
                    asked you, is she coming?

      John and Tang trade eyes, ill-equipped, but not much choice.   

                                  TANG
                    Yeah, she s coming. Just gonna take 
                    her a bit in traffic. 

                                  MILSAP
                    Did she sound  sorry  on the phone? 

                                  JOHN
                          (cautious)
                    Is that... what you ve been waiting 
                    for? Her to apologize? 

                                  TANG
                    And then you ll come down? 

                                  MILSAP
                    Yeah. So was she sorry? 

      John and Tang exhale a bit; finally, a little sunshine. 

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah, absolutely. Very, very sorry. 

                                  MILSAP
                          (calmed by it)
                    She said that? 

                                  TANG
                    She did. 

      Milsap nods, even smiles. His eyes close, taking that in. But 
      then, his eyes pop open and he seems like a different person: 

                                  MILSAP
                    Sandra s always been a liar.  

      Milsap steps off the Genie Lift -- 

                                  JOHN / TANG 
                    Hey! No! *

      CONTINUED: (2)4242

    -- and starts CHOKING to death, hanging, KICKING WILDLY, 
      making AWFUL NOISES. Bicks and the others SCREAM and run out 
    of the room, horrified and disgusted, as John and Tang climb 
    on the second  Genie Lift  and throw it into gear, the engine 
      WHIRRING, moving up... up... at an excruciatingly slow pace. 

                                  JOHN
                    Thing s slow... really slow... *

      Tang just shakes her head. Her cell DINGS, she checks it, as 
      Milsap goes limp and his BLADDER lets go.

      Ben and Sammy in their civvies, Ben now calmed down, walk 
      through toward the LOBBY after shift. They see Ferguson, 
      still in uniform, drinking a soda and filling out a late 
      report. As they ignore him --    

                                  SAMMY
                    Big party tonight in Castaic. Coker 
                    from Shootin  Newton. You should 
                    come check it out. 

                                  BEN
                    Mostly cops, right?

                                  SAMMY
                    And girls, that s the beauty.   

                                  BEN
                    Yeah, think I ll pass.

                                  SAMMY
                    Sure. Why get drunk, and laid, when 
                    you can hear a guy play the zither. 
                    Maybe get some Turkish coffee...   

      Ben gives him a look -- let the shit-giving continue. They 
      clock a MAN entering the station whom we vaguely recognize: 
      it s the Customer who argued with the Waitress and locked 
      eyes with John and Tang. We re processing that, as suddenly --  

                                  LOBBY DESK COP (O.S.)
                    Gun! 

      The guy whips a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE out from under his 
      jacket and starts BLASTING from the lobby, shooting to kill.

    A weird, suspended micro-beat. And then hell breaks loose:   

      Ben draws his off-duty gun, taking cover and RETURNING FIRE. 
      But there are PILLARS in his sight-line; he can t get a clear 
      shot. As he moves tactically toward the lobby --  

      Sammy fumbles in his bag, his back-up gun inside; MOVE WITH 
      HIM as he finds it, running and FIRING toward the lobby --   




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                43.

      CONTINUED:4545

    And now Ben, Sammy, and OTHER COPS are FIRING and it s chaos. 
    A close-range, ugly, awful ballet ensues, as the man leaps 
      over the LOBBY DESK, STILL FIRING. It s all caught on 
      SURVEILLANCE CAM, as STAFF and COPPERS (many caught off-guard 
    and not used to drawing their guns) throw files, trash cans, 
      anything they can find -- and some TAKE BULLETS. 

    We see one PANICKED COP SCREAMING and running away from the 
      man, desperate to get away. The man turns his rifle in this 
      cop s direction, about to shoot him in the back, when -- 

                                  FERGUSON
                    Hey -- asshole! 

    A SODA CAN thrown by Ferguson hits the edge of a pillar the 
      man s behind, splattering him in the eyes. The man points his 
      rifle at Ferguson instead and FIRES, as Ferguson comes right 
    at him, unloading, till Ferguson gets shot and goes down.   

    And then -- by whom it s not even clear -- the man s shot 
      dead and falls hard.   

      We hear MOANS... people shifting on the floor... the SOUNDS 
      of teeth-gritting pain undergirded by a weighty silence. Ben 
      and Sammy trade eyes. Both unhurt, if dazed. And as the SMOKE 
      LIFTS, we see... at least FOUR COPS are down, Ferguson among 
      them, and he s not too far from Ben. Ben hears his LABORED 
      BREATHING and goes over to check him out. Ben sees he s been *
      shot in the CHEEK, and taken a couple to his vest as well. *
    Ben bends over him, starting to render aid... And then --    *

      It s eerily silent. The shock of it all surreal, as we...  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      John s in his civvies after shift, alone. He takes a DVD from 
    a manila envelope and sticks it in the machine, hits  play.      
    On a TV we see the LAPD LOGO... It s a POLICE TRAINING VIDEO.

      ON-SCREEN -- Tang, from a couple years ago, from the POV of a 
      DASH CAM. She approaches the driver s side and asks a BIG GUY 
    for his license. She s solo, no partner. He gives her lip, it 
      isn t clear, and then he makes a move for his glove box...  

      Concerned he might have a weapon, Tang makes the mistake of 
      leaning too far into his window. Suddenly, the guy pivots and 
      just PUNCHES her in the face, breaking her nose and laying 
    her flat-out on her ass.   

    And then this THUG, prison-big, gets out and beats her 
      brutally. It s very hard to watch. John has to force himself. 

    At last, the video freezes on the FINAL IMAGE -- just half of 
      Tang still IN FRAME, BLOODY, limp, the guy in mid-kick. The 
      SCREEN GOES BLUE. John senses a presence behind him...

      It s Tang. Long beat. 

                                  TANG
                    You really hadn t seen it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Guy was big, Jessica. 

                                  TANG
                    Yeah, and I was stupid. Should ve 
                    backed up. Kept him in my sight-
                    line.

                                  JOHN
                    I m gonna drive tomorrow. 

                                  TANG
                    No, not yet. 

                                  JOHN
                    You got nothing to prove to me. 

                                  TANG
                    It s not about you. 

    A beat, John understanding. No doubt he d be the same way...    

                                  JOHN
                    So, how d I do today?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                45.

                                  TANG
                    What do you mean?

                                  JOHN
                    C mon, I know they ve told you to 
                    tell  em if I m still fit to be out 
                    there. 
                          (Tang shrugs, won t lie)
                    Any conclusions so far? 

                                  TANG
                    We ll see how tomorrow goes. 
                          (John smiles... okay)
                    Hey,  Truck Norris  is back in the 
                    city now, over near Palms. You up 
                    for a late lunch? 

                                  JOHN
                    Nah, salmonella screws up my sleep. 
                    How  bout a drink instead?

                                  TANG
                    Thanks, some other time.

                                  JOHN
                    You really gonna drive to Palms to  *
                    eat off a freakin  roach coach, *
                    because it s Wednesday? *

      She nods. Hoping that he gets it. Her way of keeping a grip  *
      on things. A growing COMMOTION from outside -- COPS TALKING 
      LOUDLY and gathering around a TV showing NEWS FOOTAGE of the 
      shooting -- draws their attention through the glass... 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)*
                    What the hell... 

      As they start to the door -- 

                                                                            CUT TO:


    Ben kills a beer in the kitchen, sets down the bottle and 
      finds his keys. He s dressed to go out, cool leather jacket. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                48.

      CONTINUED:4949

    A TV in b.g. DRONES the local news... some mindless puff 
      piece, the renewed popularity of metal lunch boxes or some 
      shit.  

    Ben finds his boots and starts lacing them up, glancing 
      aimlessly at the TV. It s almost like nothing happened. He 
      could almost convince himself. But then... something catches 
    his eye, something white and a bit red that s lodged in the 
      tread of his boot. He takes it out. It s a HUMAN TOOTH. 

      He stares at it.*

      ON TV -- A WEATHER WOMAN in a tight dress, giving tomorrow s 
      forecast. Ben turns UP the volume. 

                                    WEATHER WOMAN
                    ... And for tomorrow, holy cow, 
                    just a perfect day here in the 
                    Southland, 70 s, sunshine, tons of 
                    blue skies...  

    Ben clicks the TV OFF. Stares again at the tooth. Then he 
      tosses it in a small dish on the counter. Goes to the door. 
      What else is he supposed to do? Tomorrow will be Thursday. 

    Ben walks out and SLAMS the door, as we -- 

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
