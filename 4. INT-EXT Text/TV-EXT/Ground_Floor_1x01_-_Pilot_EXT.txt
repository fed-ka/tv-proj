      (BRODY, JENNIFER)

      BRODY S IN BED.  GROGGY, HE OPENS HIS EYES.  JENNIFER IS 
      UNDER THE SHEETS, HER FACE INCHES FROM HIS.  SHE S WAY PERKY.

                                  JENNIFER

                Oh good, you re up.  You ll never 

                believe this: my mom and sister are in 

                the neighborhood, shopping, and they 

                want to go to brunch.  You ll come, 

                right?  I really want them to meet 

                you.

                                  BRODY

                Uh....

      JENNIFER PULLS BACK THE SHEET AND HOPS OUT OF BED: SHE S 
      FULLY DRESSED. 

                                  JENNIFER 

                Just kidding.  You should ve seen your 

                face; it was pretty funny.  I ve gotta 

                go.  Have a nice rest of the weekend. 

                                  BRODY

                Watch out for snow plows. 

      SHE S GONE.  AS BRODY SMILES TO HIMSELF:

      (BRODY, MANSFIELD)

      MANSFIELD S BALCONY IS A SLEEK, COMFORTABLY DECORATED AREA 
      THAT OVERLOOKS THE CITY.  MANSFIELD PATS THE CHAIR NEXT TO 
      HIM.  BRODY SITS DOWN AS MANSFIELD LIGHTS A CIGAR.

                                  MANSFIELD 

                Let s fire up some guy talk.  I ll 

                start.  How about those 49ers?  Do you 

                like working here?  

                                  BRODY

                Sir, I m sorry I skipped out on Friday 

                night, I just-- there was this girl. 

                                  MANSFIELD

                Ah, the start of every tragic story.  

                So, how was the sex?  Was it your 

                basic, pasty white, fumble-fumble-

                  grunt-grunt-done?  Or was it mind-

                blowing, willing-to-throw-your-career-

                away fantastic? 

                                  BRODY

                Are those my only choices?  (THEN)  

                Sir, I was planning on coming back, 

                there s just something about this 

                girl.  She works on the ground floor, 

                and she s-- GROUND FLOOR    "Pilot"    Rev. Network Draft      6/29/12         17.

                                  MANSFIELD

                Wait, she works on the ground floor?  

                You have to understand something about 

                ground floor people.  They came right 

                out of high school and are sitting 

                behind the desk that they re going to 

                sit behind for the rest of their 

                lives.  The only way out is to find a 

                meal ticket like you, Mr. Moyer.

                                  BRODY

                She didn t seem like that kind of--

                                  MANSFIELD

                I ll give you a signal when I m done 

                talking, son.  Now, I can t lose my 

                most promising, young, money manager 

                to a sea of personal problems.  If I 

                were you, I d go down and fix this.  

                Tell her it s over.  Be nice, but be 

                clear.  I assume you re grinning like 

                a fool because I said,  most 

                  promising  earlier.  Don t celebrate 

                until you ve left the balcony. 

                                  BRODY

                (CALMLY)  Of course, sir.

      BRODY EXITS INTO THE OFFICE.  THE SECOND THE DOOR CLOSES, HE 
      RAISES HIS ARMS IN THE AIR.  MANSFIELD SMILES AND THROWS HIS 
      CIGAR OFF THE BALCONY.  WE FOLLOW IT TO THE GROUND FLOOR. 

                                                                    TRANSITION DOWN

                                  JENNIFER

                So, what do you need to talk about? 

                                  BRODY

                Look, Jenny, Friday night was great, 

                but I think you and I...  

      BRODY STARES, LOST IN HER EYES, SMITTEN.

                                  BRODY (CONT'D)

                Do you wear colored contacts? 

                                  JENNIFER

                Nope.  (HOLDS HER HAIR)  But this 

                comes in a bottle.  

                                  BRODY

                (LAUGHS, THEN TO SELF)  Come on, 

                Brody, focus. 

                                  JENNIFER

                Right there.  That s the kind of stuff 

                you were saying Friday night.  (OFF

                                  BRODY

                (THINKS, THEN)  The hell with it.  

                Neither one of us likes one-night 

                stands, so we should probably go out 

                again.

                                  JENNIFER

                Aw that s so sweet, but no thanks. 

                                  BRODY

                Oh, okay.

      AS HE REACTS, HE GETS HIT BY A CIGAR.  AS HE FRANTICALLY 
      TRIES TO PAT THE BURNING EMBERS OUT:
