      FADE IN:

      EXT. VINEYARD. NORTHERN NAPA COUNTY - DAY (D/1)11

      JANE, LISBON, CHO, and a 45ish Tommy Lee Jones SHERIFF 
      MCALLISTER -  walking between rows of vines on the hillside 
      of a green little valley. 

                                    SHERIFF
                    Boy I am happy to see you guys.  
                    We are sorely ill-equipped for this 
                    kind of a deal.

      They come upon a body dumped in a shallow ditch by the edge 
      of a dirt track through the vineyard.  There's yellow tape,  
      a Deputy amateurishly photographing tire tracks while others 
      give him sage advice.

      The body is a young red haired woman fully clothed in jeans 
      and a T-shirt, tightly and thoroughly bound in silver duct 
      tape.  There's one large knife wound in her abdomen.

                                    SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                    Quail hunter's dog found her this 
                    morning about five-thirty.  Wasn't 
                    meant to be hunting quail, but he was.

                                  LISBON
                    Do we know who she is?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Nope.  Looks familiar though. 
                    So I'm guessing local.  People look 
                    different when they're dead, don't they?  

      Lisbon and Cho get in the ditch to examine the body.

                                  CHO
                    That wound doesn't look fatal.  

                                  LISBON
                    Doesn't does it?  No ligature marks 
                    on the neck, so she wasn't 
                    strangled or hung.  But the gums 
                    are livid, eyes are hemorrhaged.  

                                  CHO
                      Suffocation.

      Lisbon nods. 


                                    SHERIFF
                    My bet, meth-heads from the city, 
                    coming off the interstate.  
                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    2.
      CONTINUED:11

                                  JANE
                    No.  It was a local.  And it was an 
                    accident.  Her killer didn't intend 
                    for her to die this way. 

      Given the state of the body, it's understandable the Sheriff 
      is incredulous.  Lisbon, looking under Melanie's fingernails, 
      knows Jane better...

                                  LISBON
                    How so?

                                  JANE
                    Her clothes are still on.  Her 
                    abductor was taking her to a location 
                    where he would have time and privacy 
                    to undress her for a sexual assault.  
                    But she made too much noise at the 
                    wrong moment.  He tried to keep her 
                    quiet and he smothered her by mistake.  
                    No good to him now.  So he dumped her.  
                    In a spot only a local would know. 

      That all makes good sense to Lisbon, but the Sheriff, 
      irritated by Jane's certainty, ain't buying. 

                                    SHERIFF 
                      Outstanding.  What happens next?  
                    Do we catch him?   

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  

                                  LISBON
                          (nods to Coroner's men)
                    Okay guys, she's all yours.  Thanks 
                    for waiting so long.

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, and the Sheriff walk away from the 
      cordoned body, back to the cars.

                                  CHO
                    Why a sexual motive?  Could be 
                    gangs, or drugs.  

                                  JANE
                    A drug trade smothering?  By who?  
                    The Sesame Street Crips?  

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing there to say it's not plain 
                    boyfriend trouble. 

                                  JANE
                    Could be boyfriend trouble.  
                    But it doesn't feel that way. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    3.
      CONTINUED: (2)11

                                    SHERIFF
                          (testily, to Lisbon)
                    Who is this?

                                  LISBON
                          (been here before)
                    He's a consultant.  You want CBI    
                      assistance on this, he comes as 
                    part of the package.  

                                    SHERIFF 
                          (hostile now)
                      Consultant.  You're clairvoyant or 
                    some gizmo like that huh?  You got 
                    "psychic powers"?   

                                  JANE
                    No.  No powers.  I had them once.  
                    I mean, I pretended I had them, 
                      obviously.  There's no such thing 
                    as psychic powers. 

                                    SHERIFF
                    Oh-kay.  So uh, what is it that you 
                    do exactly?

                                  JANE 
                    Do you know rock paper scissors?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Sure.

                                  JANE
                    Play me.

      The Sheriff shrugs bemused - okay.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    On three.  One two three.

      The Sheriff throws a rock.  Jane throws paper.  

                                    SHERIFF 
                    One two three.  

      The Sheriff throws paper, Jane throws scissors. 

                                    SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                    One two three.

      The Sheriff gets beat again, and again, and again, and as we 
      kick into the theme and FADE OUT, Jane still hasn't lost.


                                    END OF TEASER    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    4.


                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. O'KEEFE FARMHOUSE. SONOMA VALLEY - DAY (D/1 CONT'D)22

      Deep in the country.  A weary blue-collar woodframe house 
      flanked by various trailers and sheds.  Lazy dogs, goats in a 
      pen, an old F-150 up on bricks, a big John Deere in good 
      working order.

      MERCEDES O'KEEFE - forty-one, zaftig Mexican/American in 
      Wranglers and a San Francisco Giants T-shirt - takes laundry 
      off a clothesline and folds it with the help of her son 
      FRANKIE - wiry, tough, 9-10 years old.  

      They stop when she sees a Sheriff's Dept. CRUISER and the 
      CBI's PASSENGER VAN come along the winding road toward the 
      O'Keefe property.

                                  MERCEDES
                    Honey, go get started on your 
                    homework.

      Frankie's about to protest, but he sees the fear in her eyes 
      and it impels him into the house. 

                                  MERCEDES (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    Joe.

      JOE O'KEEFE - forty-five, rangy, a fighter's face under 
      Celtic red hair and a battered Raiders cap - emerges from one 
      of the sheds, wiping oily hands on a rag.

      He joins his wife and they watch in highly charged silence as 
      the cars pull up; the Sheriff and Jane and Lisbon and Cho and 
      a Deputy walk somberly toward them.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. and Mrs. O'Keefe?  I'm Agent 
                    Teresa Lisbon, California Bureau of 
                      Investigation.  I'm sorry.  I'm 
                    bringing bad news.  We found your 
                    daughter Melanie...

      Two hearts breaking.  Joe turns to stone.  Mercedes begins to 
      WAIL, low at first.  Lisbon touches her arm in sympathy.  
      Jane drifts away toward the house.

      INT. MELANIE'S BEDROOM. O'KEEFE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS33*

      Frankie sits rigidly at the desk in his sister's room, a  *
      picture of her clutched in his hands, anxious expectation on  *
      his face.  When he hears his mother WAIL, he closes his eyes  *
      and puts his hands over his ears.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    5.
      CONTINUED:33

      When he opens them again, Jane is standing in the doorway, 
      looking around in that keen but casual way of his.  

                                  JANE
                    Hi.

                                    FRANKIE
                    Who are you?

                                  JANE
                    My name's Patrick Jane.  I'm with 
                    the police.  Is this your sister's *
                    room? *

                                    FRANKIE
                    Yes.  Did someone kill my sister? *

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                                    FRANKIE
                    Okay.

      EXT. O'KEEFE FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS44

      At a wooden bench and table Joe and Mercedes O'Keefe sit side 
      by side, numb with shock.  Lisbon sits opposite.

                                  MERCEDES
                    The night before last, she didn't 
                    come home from work.  She 
                      waitresses at Shand Creek Winery 
                      Restaurant.  It's in all the 
                      guidebooks. 

      Lisbon notes the Sheriff react strongly to this news and 
      wonders why.

                                  MERCEDES (CONT D)
                    She was on 'til eleven.  Her car's 
                    still in the parking lot there.

                    We're always asleep when she comes 
                    in so we didn't know she wasn't 
                    here until the morning.  We called 
                    all her friends.  She wasn't with 
                    them.  Nobody saw her after she 
                    left work.

      Frankie watches Jane take in his sister's room.  Small, super  *
      neat.  Lots of pink stuff, lots of softball stuff.

      Several unfaded patches on the walls where posters have quite 
      recently been taken down.  There's a couple of stuffed toys 
      on the bed, the rest are stacked on top of a cupboard.

      Her cork pinboard is - as with many teenagers - a labor of 
      love, a Myspace page in 3D.  Softball teammates goofing 
      around,  pictures of rock stars and actors.  What Would Jesus 
      Do? stickers.  Cute animals, cartoons, the Virgin of 
      Guadalupe, notes from friends, souvenirs of innocent fun.  We 
      get a sense of a conventional, well behaved, and good hearted 
      jock.  The board is arranged so that the letter H is formed 
      by photos - the one at the center of the H being a recent 
      PHOTO, cut in half, of MELANIE AT A FUN-FAIR.  Smiling 
        ecstatically at someone or something in the missing half of 
      the frame.

                                  JANE
                    She didn't like them anymore?

                                    FRANKIE
                    Said they were for little girls.  
                    Do you know who killed her?

                                  JANE
                    No.

      Jane lies down on Melanie's bed, looking at the room as 
      Melanie would have done.  Frankie looks askance at this, like 
      'what are you doing?'  Peering under the bed, then reaching 
      under it, Jane comes up with a cheap RED PLUSH HEART with a 
      comical face on it, like you might win at a fun-fair.

                    We were worried about her going 
                    down there to Los Angeles.  You 
                    hear about all the crime.  Did 
                    they, you know, do anything to her?

                      Oftentimes, it's the first name that 
                    springs to a mother's mind that turns 
                    out to be the guilty party.

      restaurant and beckons urgently.

      We watch the Sheriff hurry to back of the restaurant and have 
      a quick conversation with the waiter alongside a parked PANEL

      Schnabel, part Donal Logue - and wife SANDRA - a quietly 
      sharp, capable, likeable, Joan Cusack type.  They talk with 
      Jane whilst seated at the proprietor's table, overlooking the 
      main dining area, which has an extensive OUTDOOR TERRACE.  
      It's early lunchtime so only a few tables are occupied.

                                  JANE 
                    And a lot of butter.

      Malcolm and Sandra laugh.  Jane has hit on their culinary 
      secret.  Sandra puts a finger to his lips.

                    Shhh.

                                    MALCOLM
                    No, there's no shame in it. 
                    A lot of butter.  The great thing 
                    about food, it's necessity and 
                      indulgence all in one.

                    What time did Melanie leave work 
                    that night?  To build a timeline, 
                    we need to know exactly. 

                                  SANDRA
                    I know she took off first, but
                    I'd need to look at her timecard to 
                    be exact. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    Hey, it wasn't me by the way.  I 
                    have twenty staff that will tell 
                    you.  I only ever leave the kitchen 
                    to take a leak or yell at 
                      customers.

      He gets a smile of rueful affection from Sandra.

                                  SANDRA 
                    Sad but true. 

      INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY1717

      A SHEET OF FLAME rises around a SOUS CHEF, 25, as he tosses a 
      dash of oil into a cooking pan, and stirs the contents.  
      Distracted by the appearance of Jane and Lisbon with Malcolm 
      and Sandra, he turns away from the pan, and burns his hand; 
      then gets a good natured whack around the back of the head 
      from Chef Malcolm.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Attention Randall.  Pay it. 

      Malcolm takes the pan from Randall and starts to show him how 
      to saut  whatever the hell it is. 

      INT. RESTAURANT OFFICE - DAY1818

      Sandra talks to Jane and Lisbon as she looks for Melanie's 
      timecard.  Jane roams around in characteristic fashion, 
      looking at things casually, but from every angle.  The office 
      is right by the back-door of the restaurant, that lets out 
      onto the parking lot.  No one can exit or enter from the lot 
      without passing the office.

                    server, betty butterfinger we 
                    called her, but she had a good

      FLASHBACK

      INT. RESTAURANT BACK OFFICE - NIGHT1919

      Sandra's on the phone, listening and uh-huhing.  Melanie 
      comes in, punches out on the time-clock.  An exchange of nods 
      and smiles with Sandra, and Melanie leaves.  

                                  SANDRA (O.S.)
                    She went out that door...

                      I imagine?  Credit cards? 

      A Waitress - RAQUEL, Latina, pudgy, too much make-up, 22 - 
      enters from the lot, starts to enter office, hesitates on 
      seeing all the people.

                                  SANDRA
                    Yes.  I'll get you a full list. 
                    It's okay, Raquel.  Come in.

      Raquel scurries in sideways, all shy, punches in at the time-
      clock.  Jane looks at her intently.

                                  SANDRA (CONT D)
                    These people are here to find out 
                    what happened to poor Melanie.

                          (a low murmur)
                    Oh okay.  Good.

                                  JANE
                    You and she were good friends,

                    Weird huh?

      Raquel looks startled.

      CU - The fairground SNAPSHOT on the corkboard.  The other 
      girl in the picture is indeed Raquel.

      INT. RESTAURANT OFFICE - DAY2222

      Cho enters to find Raquel seated in a chair.  Lisbon seated 
      opposite.  Jane leaning against the wall.  Raquel is 
      politely, but dumbly determined to stonewall.  

                                  RAQUEL
                    I don't know why she has a picture 
                    of me and her ma'am.  Maybe she has 
                    a secret crush on me.  I don't

                    She doesn't have a boyfriend. 
                    That's her thing right?  Purity.  
                    No boys.

                                  JANE
                    So who was it that she cut out of 
                    the picture? 

                                  RAQUEL

                    receipts.

      Lisbon exits.  Cho's about to sit down with Raquel, but Jane 
      pulls him aside and speaks quietly...

                                  JANE 
                    Give me a minute with her.  
                          (indicating Raquel)
                    She's got a super low threshold.

                    No big thing.  Just stand in the 
                    doorway and pretend you're making a 
                    phone call for a moment. 

                                  CHO
                    No.  It's illegal and it's 
                      unprofessional.

                                  JANE
                    That's why I need you to stand in

      Beat.  Cho gives.

                    One minute.

      Jane sits opposite Raquel and anchors her with a finger on 
      her knee and a steady gaze.  Cho stands in the doorway 
      keeping watch.

                    Before you fall asleep tonight, 
                    while you're lying there in your 
                    bed relaxing and slowly drifting 
                    off into sleep, I want you to think 
                    of me.  Think of me, then imagine 
                    that you can fly.  Imagine that 
                    you're weightless.  You can float 
                    gently into the air if you want to.  
                    Safe and calm and serene.  You can 
                    fly away and leave all your burdens 
                    and worries and fears behind you. 
                    Imagine that.  What a nice feeling 
                    it is.  
                          (beat)
                    Next time you see me, when I say 
                    hello, you will remember that good 
                    feeling and you will want to tell me 
                    the truth because when you do tell me 
                    the truth you'll feel that a heavy 
                    weight has been lifted from your 
                      shoulders.  I'll say hello and you'll 
                    feel light as a feather, as if you 
                    were floating on air.  Why don't you 
                    sit here a moment and think about that 
                    before you go back to work?

      Jane taps her on the knee, breaks his gaze, and stands up.  
      Raquel's like - this guy's a loon. 

                                  RAQUEL
                    Uh, whatever.

      Cho smiles, assuming that the hypnosis was a failure.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  

      Raquel hastens away.  In answer to Cho's sardonic glance,

                    Nothing to worry about. 

      Jane stands up on a chair.  Waits for silence, which comes

      Jane pauses for effect.  General gasps of dismay.  With a 
      graceful flourish, Jane takes the slip of paper from his 
      pocket and holds it up for everyone to see.

                    bureau's chief graphologist. 
                    Each one of you is going to give us 
                    a sample of your handwriting, left 
                    and right-handed.  Cho will examine 
                    the samples and determine which of 
                    you left this note.  Which of you 
                    is the killer?

      For his own amusement, Jane has taken his performance into 
      melodrama, and some of the staff are on the verge of 
      giggling, but the SOUS CHEF who burnt himself earlier - his 
      name's RANDALL - looks very serious.  He makes a faint noise 
      as if about to speak, then faints dead away.  Jane turns to 
      Lisbon...

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Voila.

      Cho questioning Randall.

                                  CHO
                    Randall, why did you want to say 
                    sorry to Melanie?

                                    RANDALL
                    I didn't kill her.

                                  CHO
                    I didn't say that you did.  I asked 
                    why you wanted to say sorry to her. 

      No answer from Randall.  But Cho can see he's ready to talk.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Your timecard and your boss say you 
                    left work ten minutes before 
                    Melanie.  You waited for her in the 
                    parking lot, right?  Right? 
                    There's no law against waiting for 
                    someone.  You waited for her.  

                                    RANDALL
                    I just wanted to speak to her.

                                  CHO
                    Nothing wrong with that.  
                    You wanted to speak to her.  Then 
                    what happened?

      FLASHBACK

      EXT. PARKING LOT. SHAND CREEK WINERY - NIGHT2727

      MOS - Randall leans against his car, smoking.  Tosses it away 
      when he sees Melanie exiting the restaurant and walking to 
      her car.

                                    RANDALL (O.S.)
                    I'm like hey Melanie, how you 
                    doing?  And we talked.

      Randall approaches.  Melanie doesn't see him coming and jumps 
      a little when she hears him, but smiles when she sees it's 
      Randall.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    20.

                                    RANDALL
                    She didn't leave, and she's 
                    laughing and smiling, so I figure 
                    I'm doing good...

      FLASHBACK

      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT2929

      MOS Randall is talking away, and Melanie smiling and laughing 
      tightly, strictly out of politeness, whilst looking anxiously 
      down the road in anticipation of someone's arrival.  

                                    RANDALL (O.S.)
                    So I made my move. 

      Randall suddenly lunges at Melanie and tries to kiss her.  She 
      resists and he tries harder and they wrestle for a moment. 

                                    RANDALL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And ah, she wasn't so into it.  
                    Which is cool.  Only I know she's 
                    got this whole I'm a virgin thing 
                    going so I figure I have to be, you 
                    know, be goal oriented...

      Randall won't take no for an answer.  Melanie knees him in 
      the balls.  He goes down on his knees.  

      She's apologetic but firm - back off.  Her hair and clothes 
      are in disarray. 

      Randall hurls pain wracked obscenities at her - fucking dyke 
      bitch, etc. - as he staggers back to his car. 

                                    RANDALL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And she was kind of upset.  
                    So I apologized for the 
                      misunderstanding and I left.

                    I got in my car and I drove off.  
                    And that was it.  Only I felt like 
                    maybe she would still be mad at me?

                    before I knew she was missing, I 
                    wrote sorry and I put it in her 
                    locker.

                                  LISBON

                    parking lot?  Try and be precise.

                    Five minutes.  Six.

      INT. MAIN OFFICE. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY3131

      Lisbon and Cho exit the interview room and cross the open-
      plan office.

                                  LISBON
                    Sounds like the truth.

                                  CHO
                    I don't know.  He has potential.

                                  LISBON
                    Do we have anything to keep him on?

                                  CHO
                    Nope.

      They stop at a wall mounted black-board on which Lisbon has 
      sketched out a GRAPHIC TIMELINE with yellow chalk.  Jane is 
      lounging next to it.

                                  LISBON 
                    So spring him.  Forensics have his 
                    car.  We'll grab him up again if 
                    they find anything.  

      Cho heads back across the room.  Lisbon takes up a marker and 
      puts new data up on the board.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Randall tried to kiss Melanie 
                    because he assumed it was on his 
                    account that she didn't leave.  

                                  JANE
                    But in fact, she didn't leave 
                      because...

                                  LISBON
                    She was waiting for someone else.

                                  JANE
                    We need to speak to Raquel again.

      Van Pelt on the line.  Rigsby hovers in BG.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I did the database search.  I'm e-
                    mailing the results. 

      CUT BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND NAPA:

                                  LISBON
                    I'm putting you on speaker.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's not much.  One hit for the 
                    brand of silver tape used.  
                    Two months ago in Fairfield.  
                    An abduction.  

                                  JANE
                    What happened?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Dolores Sanchez, a female, 22, 
                    migrant farm laborer.  Abducted at a 
                    bus stop, she doesn't know how. She 
                    wakes up on a bed in a motel room all 
                    tied up in duct tape.  Unharmed.  The 
                    cleaners found her.  Never saw her 
                      abductors.  No suspects.  Fairfield 
                    PD concluded it was a drunken prank.  
                    The complainant Sanchez left town so 
                    the case kind of drifted away. 

      NB Van Pelt has a PHOTOCOPIED PHOTO of SANCHEZ among the case 
      papers she's referring to. 

                                  JANE
                    That's very interesting.  

                                  LISBON
                    Let's not go off on tangents already. 

                                  JANE
                    Any other correlations?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh, yes actually.  Sanchez is a 
                    redhead, like O'Keefe.

      Jane grins. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    23.

                                  LISBON
                    Cool down.  It's a common brand of 
                    tape.  And there's a quarter 
                    million redheaded women in 
                      California.  

                                  JANE
                    You're right.  But just supposing, 
                    for fun, that it was the same guy 
                    did both crimes?  What's going on?  
                    He kidnaps a redheaded girl, ties 
                    her up, takes her to a motel room. 
                    He has her at his mercy, but he 
                    does nothing.  Month later, he 
                    kidnaps another redhead but his 
                    planning isn't good enough and he 
                    kills her in a panic to keep her 
                    quiet.  What's that say? 

      Lisbon is cleaning up the graphics of her timeline.        

                                  LISBON
                    He's an idiot.

                                  JANE
                    He's new to this, and he's 
                      conflicted.  He's hungry to do 
                    terrible things, but his conscience 
                    and his fear tell him not to.  So 
                    he's not yet going into it with the 
                    proper focus and planning.  So 
                    stuff goes wrong.

                    was with him at the fair one time 
                    and we run into Melanie and they 
                    were like, bam.  Romeo and Juliet.  
                    She was meeting him that night.

                    Yes.  I didn't tell you because I'm

                    than snitching on him like this.  
                    For real. 

      Raquel's sigh of relief and contented expression are a 
      puzzlement to Lisbon.  Cho tries to wear a blank expression.

      INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY3333

      Jane and Cho and Lisbon walking across the office...

                                  LISBON
                    That was strange.  The way she gave 
                    him up so easily like that?   

      Cho and Jane exchange a look.

                                  JANE
                    Yes it was.  But hey, you were 
                    right huh?  Secret lover.  Guess I 
                    was wrong about the whole red hair 
                    and duct tape thing.  

      Jane's manner confirms Lisbon's suspicions.

                                  LISBON 
                    You hypnotized her, didn't you?

                                  JANE
                      I certainly did not.  Okay, no.  
                    Yes.  I did hypnotize her, but-- 

                                  LISBON
                    --But nothing.  It's unprofessional 
                    and it's illegal.  It's totally out 
                    of bounds. 

      She takes out her phone, speed dials.

                                  CHO
                    That's what I told him.

                                  JANE
                    I was going to say you had nothing 
                    to do with it, but hey...

      He splits.  She wants to ask questions, but doesn't, and 
      follows him out. 

3535EXT. HECTOR'S HOUSE. VACAVILLE - DAY 

      A tract house in a scrubby neighborhood.  Big black truck in 
      the driveway.  We join the warrant serving just as Lisbon, 
      Rigsby, Cho, and Van Pelt, fronted by a half dozen VACAVILLE 
      P.D SWAT GUYS move stealthily but swiftly into position to 
      bust down the front door.  Then holding very still, nothing 
      but the sound of heavy breathing and pounding hearts, as the 
      LEAD SWAT GUY counts down with his fingers... 

      ANGLE reveals Jane waiting anxiously in the street, leaning 
      against a car.  

      Back to Van Pelt, breathing heavily with nerves, eyes locked 
      on the SWAT LEADER.  Rigsby's eyes swivel constantly between 
      the SWAT leader and Van Pelt.  

      Lisbon watches this.  All very still, waiting.

      NEW ANGLE - We watch the little house from JANE'S POV - 
      awaiting the outcome on the street. It's quiet like an 
      everyday city street.  An ICE CREAM TRUCK in the distance.  
      The whoosh of CARS on a nearby freeway.  As if nothing at all 
      was going on.  The seconds tick by.  O.S CRAAASH!  Then a 
      MUSCULAR TATTOOED MAN IN UNDERSHORTS with a MACHETE in his 
      hand comes sprinting round the corner of the house.  Lisbon 
      follows him, gun drawn.  HECTOR - for it is he - sprints 
      around the side of the house, but when Rigsby and Van Pelt 
      and a SWAT guy appear, coming the other way, he doubles back 
      and sprints toward the street.  Toward Jane, who becomes 
        increasingly concerned about the outcome.  But Lisbon tackles 
      Hector round the legs and brings him down hard.  The machete 
      clatters out of his hand and slides to a stop at Jane's feet.  
      Lisbon is up and on him and cuffs him like it's a calf roping 
      contest.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      Jane drains a bottle of water while Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt, 
      and Rigsby doff their body armor and helmets and stuff and 
      pack them in their VAN.  IN BG, Hector is put in back of a 
      cop car.

      They are still up on the buzz of a hot warrant.  Rigsby is 
      acting out Lisbon's take down of Hector.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    ...Boom, out of nowhere.  He didn't 
                    know what hit him. 

      They all laugh.

                    Oh I didn't bother to formulate a 
                    plan.  I knew she'd stop him.

                    Staties, then go back to

      Rigsby and Van Pelt are surprised, cast down.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes boss. 

      Lisbon goes, Jane by her side.  We follow them.

                                  JANE 
                    I don't get it.  You won't allow 
                    sexual tension in your sacred unit, 
                    but you're leaving those two in the 
                    office with nothing to do.  It only 
                    heightens the tension.  

      Lisbon smiles.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  The sooner they start having 
                    sex the better.  Then one or other 
                    of them will have to transfer out.

      Hector sits upright in his chair, a thousand yard stare.  
      Lisbon sits opposite, the Sheriff next to her.  Jane leaning 
      against the wall.

                                  LISBON
                    We're investigating the murder of 
                    Melanie O'Keefe.  Do you know her?

      Not a twitch.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    She was suffocated and stabbed to 
                    death and dumped by the roadside, 
                    three nights ago.  

      No response.

                    We know you and Melanie were

                    pirate, instead of what you are.

      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT3838

      Hector's truck pulls into the lot and stops.

                                  HECTOR (V.O.)
                    We were supposed to meet at eleven-
                    thirty at the restaurant.

      Hector looks around the lot for Melanie.  No sign of her.  He 
      looks at his watch and scowls.

                                  HECTOR (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I got there maybe ten minutes late 
                    and she hadn't come out yet. 

      A FEW MOMENTS LATER.  

      Hector tosses his cigar, and shouts imprecations in the 
      direction of the Restaurant and Melanie. 

                                  HECTOR (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    So I waited for a few minutes and I 
                    left.  I'm impatient.  I was angry. 

      Hector drives off at speed.  As he leaves, the Sheriff's  
      cruiser enters the other end of the lot.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    31.

                    I will always hate myself for that.

                    I wanted her to leave me behind.  
                    This life I lead is no good for a 
                    woman.  I wanted her far away.  
                    I told her, go to LA and don't come 
                    back for nothing.

                    He's telling the truth.

                                  LISBON
                    Now you're just trying to be 
                    contrary.  Have you read his sheet?

                                  JANE
                    Did you hear what he said?

                                  LISBON
                    He's a good actor.  It was you that 
                    said it was him in the first place. 

                                  JANE
                    I said Melanie had a secret lover.  
                    I didn't say he killed her.

                    If it wasn't him, then who was it?  
                    And if you say a man who likes red 
                    hair and silver duct tape, I will 
                    scream. 

                                  JANE
                    I don't want you to scream.

      From behind them, the Sheriff hurries down the hall.

                                    SHERIFF
                    You folks going to be talking to 
                    that boy some more?  Or can I send 
                    him back to lock-up?

                                  LISBON

                                    SHERIFF
                    Alright, then.

      The Sheriff nods respectfully to Lisbon, turns and ambles 
      back the way he came.  Lisbon looks at Jane.

                                  LISBON
                    Look, you have your reasons.  
                      I understand.  But you're seeing 
                    more than is actually there in 
                    front of you.  It's a tendency you 
                    have.  But not every murder is a 
                    secret inside a secret inside a 
                    secret.  There isn't always a 
                    hidden pattern.

                                  JANE
                    Not always.  Sometimes there is.

                                  LISBON
                    Sometimes the obvious guy did it.  
                    Most of the time, the obvious guy

                    It was Hector.

      INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY (D/3)4848

      Lisbon's at a desk, tapping expertly at a keyboard, with a 
      phone to her ear.  Jane enters.

                                  LISBON
                    Got it.  Thank you.  Nice work.

      She drops the phone.  Keeps typing.

                    Listen, I don't want to make you 
                    mad, but I found something really 
                      interesting that I want you to take 
                    a look at.

                                  LISBON

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  So, happy day.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  Now I'm going to go ask 
                    Hector what he has to say about 
                    that.  And you?  What did you find?

                    two weeks ago, she was 
                      disrespectful, so I had to tune her

      INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY5050

      Lisbon looks at Jane as they exit the interview room, and 
      sighs.

                    Go ahead.  Say it.

                                  JANE
                    I think he's telling the truth.

                                  LISBON
                    And I disagree.  I'm charging him.

                                  JANE
                    No, yes, good.  That's good.  You

                    Hi.  I booked a table for two this

                    See you then.

      He hangs up.  Terrible suspicions race through Lisbon's mind.  
      He's fucking with her, obviously.  But what if he's not?  
      What if he's setting up a romantic dinner for the two of 
      them?  She is repulsed and attracted by the idea in exactly 
      equal measure. 

                                  LISBON
                    Don't fret.  I wouldn't seduce you 
                    with a candlelit dinner.  That 
                    would be very sophomoric.

      'Start the weekend lunch' - a Summer Friday afternoon 
      tradition - is in full swing.  An outdoor grill, wine from 
      the barrel, and a convivial crowd getting buzzed for the 
      weekend.  The California Country bon temps are rolling. 

      Rigsby waits by the maitre d's desk - in his best slacks and 
      dress shirt - scanning the crowd with what he hopes does not 
      look like a policeman's suspicious glare (it does though, a 
      little). 

      Van Pelt appears, lovely in a summer dress.  Looks around for 
      Rigsby.  Rigsby makes an unconscious NOISE OF YEARNING.

      But he just sits there.  Everybody's still looking, but 
      pretending not to.

                    You're meant to shout at me and go.

      Rigsby stands up, extremely self conscious.

      UNKNOWN POV, closer now - most customers have gone.  Van Pelt 
      has finished her meal and paid the check and stands up just a 
      tiny bit unsteadily.  Sandra intercepts her.

                    Can I call you a cab, ma'am?

      At the exact moment we left off.  Malcolm and Sandra put the 
      woman down on the floor.  She groans in semi-conscious pain.  

      Malcolm goes out to the truck again, comes quickly back with 
      a canvas bag.  Shuts the door behind him and throws the 
      security bolt.  Sighs with relief.  Safe.  

      Malcolm takes the plastic sheet from the cupboard.

      They go to the bedroom and throw the sheet over the bed.  
      Jane is standing against the wall edging toward the door.  

      It takes a beat for them to see him.  There's a beat of 
      stunned silence.  Then Jane tries some straight Jedi lion-

      Malcolm lumbers after Jane.  Before Jane can undo the 
      security lock, Malcolm's on him, grabs him by the collar and 
      throws him back across the room.  Suddenly there's a big 
      knife in his hand.  Sandra fumbles a gun from her shoulder 
      purse.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Why are you here?

                                  SANDRA 
                    How?

                                  JANE
                    Does it matter?  I'm here.  The 
                    place is surrounded by police and 
                    CBI agents.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Oh no.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    52.

                                  SANDRA
                    He's lying.  They'd be in here 
                    arresting us by now if they were 
                    here.

                                  JANE
                    They're waiting on SWAT.  There's 
                    no way out of this.  

      Sandra looks out the windows.

                                  SANDRA
                    Nobody.  We should just kill them 
                    and get out of here.  

                                  JANE
                    Listen to me.  You can walk away 
                    from all of this.  No disrespect, 
                    but both of you are clinically 
                    insane.  You won't go to prison.  
                    You'll spend a couple of years in a 
                    hospital, and then you can walk 
                    away.  

                                    MALCOLM 
                    Shut up!  I'm thinking!

                                  SANDRA
                    Oh, now he's thinking. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    You wanted this too.  Don't pretend 
                    you didn't.

                                  SANDRA
                    I told you we should wait!  I told 
                    you we--

      Malcolm waves the knife at Sandra.

                                    MALCOLM 
                    --I swear to God woman!  One more 
                    word...

      Boom!  The door is kicked in and there stands Lisbon with 
      large gun in hand.  

                                  LISBON 
                    Police!

      With a guttural roar, Malcolm goes at Lisbon, knife held 
      high.  Lisbon has no choice, no time.  She shoots him twice 
      in the chest.  Shrieking, Sandra tries to shoot Lisbon, but 
      she's got the safety on.  She fumbles to get it off.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    53.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Drop the gun!  Drop the gun!

      Sandra gets the safety catch off and fires one wild shot. 
      Lisbon has to shoot her.  The shot echoes.  Smoke rises.      
      A muffled cry from the red headed girl.  Lisbon holsters her 
      gun and hurries to the girl's aid, untying her and taking the 
      gag from her mouth.  The girl can only whimper.  

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                          (holding her)
                    It's okay.  You're safe.  It's okay.

      Jane checks on Malcolm and Sandra, lying entwined on the 
      floor.  In answer to Lisbon's look, he shakes his head.  
      They're both dead.  This is the first time Lisbon has killed 
      anyone and the shock of it starts to sink in. 

      EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY (D/4)8383

      The burial of Melanie O'Keefe.  Mercedes, Joe, and Frankie at 
      the head of a small gathering.  Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt, 
      and Rigsby at the edge of the group, a little apart.  Lisbon 
      is still in shock.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don't understand it.  One crazy 
                    evil person, I understand, but two? 
                    Husband and wife?  Marriage should 
                    be a sacred, loving thing.

      Cho and Rigsby exchange guy looks.

                                  JANE
                    They were soulmates in their way.  
                    It's not just love that unites 
                    people.    

      As the mourners are walking away after the service, the 
      O'Keefes approach the CBI team.  Mercedes embraces Lisbon.

                                  MERCEDES
                    God bless you.

      Lisbon looks down at the ground.

      Jane and the CBI team leave.  Jane puts a consoling hand on 
      Lisbon's shoulder.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
