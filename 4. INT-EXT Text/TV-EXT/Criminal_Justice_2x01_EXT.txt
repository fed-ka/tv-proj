      JULIET shuts the car door. She looks about her. She looks in 
    the rearview mirror. Furtive. She doesn't want to be seen 
      here. She turns the key in the ignition. Toscaon the stereo 
    big and loud. It makes her jump. She turns the volume down. 
    She drives a little way down the street and then remembers 
      something. She parks the car badly. 


      JULIET rings the doorbell. Then, immediately, she rings it 
      again. She glances over her shoulder. The door opens. DOMINIC 
    is there holding the scarf she left behind. He gives her a 
      hug. She wants this and she doesn't want this. She fights 
      back tears. She pulls away from him and looks about her. 


      JULIET coming up the path. She can hear the phone ringing. 
    She fiddles with her door keys. She badly wants to get the 
      call. Her keys are in a muddle. She finds the right key. 


    JOE comes out. JOHN, Joe's junior clerk, waiting for him with 
      a porter's trolley. JOE piles his papers and bags onto the 
      trolley. JOE hands JOHN his mobile phone.          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     7.



    JOE starts the stopwatch on his running watch and runs off. 
      JOHN watches him go. JOE's mobile rings. JOHN answers it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Hello, MrsM. No, you just missed 
                    him. Yeah. Bye. 

    He ends the call and pops the phone into Joe's briefcase.


    JOE running. He looks at his watch and ups the speed. This is 
    an interval training session - thirty seconds hard, thirty 
      seconds recovery, repeated. 


    JOE running. Another RUNNER goes past him. This is a 
      fortysomething television scriptwriter. JOE doesn't like 
      being overtaken by scriptwriter types and he ups his speed 
      even more and passes the RUNNER.           CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     8.


    NO SCENE 361/361/36


      A narrow path alongside the canal. A wall on one side, the 
      canal on the other. JOE looks at his watch and starts a 
      thirty second interval sprint. EDDIE AGAR, a big scary 
      looking hooded man standing with his back to the wall dealing 
      drugs to two runty looking JUNKIES. They block the path. JOE 
      approaching. He can see that he won't get by. He has to slow 
      down. AGAR and the junky runts know they are blocking the 
      path. JOE looks angry. AGAR sees this. 

                                  AGAR
                    Is there a problem?

                                  JOE
                    Are you dealing?

                                  AGAR
                    Who are you?

                                  JOE
                    What is it? Crack? 

      AGAR takes a step towards JOE.

                                  AGAR
                    You looking for a slap?*

                                  JOE
                    I'm running the London marathon

      AGAR stares at him trying to fathom what the hell this man 
      wants. A silence.

                    In seven weeks time. 

      AGAR stares. Who is this? Why is he saying this?

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    So sponsor me.

      A slow smile from AGAR and then the smile broadens and then 
      he's laughing. JOE smiles. 

                                  AGAR
                    Sponsor you?

                                  JOE
                    It is your money, isn't it? Or are 
                    you just a soldier?

    The question works. AGAR needs to prove his status. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     9.

                    How big are your balls, man? 

    He hands him a twenty. JOE folds the note very carefully and 
      puts it in the small zip pocket in the back of his shorts. He 
      runs off and up some steps onto road level and past a parked 
    car with two MEN sitting in it. JOE doesn't see that the 
      FIRST MAN is talking to the SECOND MAN who is making notes in 
      a notebook down on his lap. 


    JOE sprinting up Middle Temple Lane past Barristers and 
      TEMPLE PORTERS in bowler hats. He reaches the entrance to 
      chambers. He stops his running watch. Up close with his 
      breathing. He leans against the wall to recover.   


      SAUL and JOE walking. SAUL in sunglasses. SAUL pulls out a 
      wadgeof cash from his trouser pocket and hands it to JOE.

                                  JOE
                    Thanks. Don't you want to know who 
                    I'm running for?

                                  SAUL
                    No. I love charity. All of it.

      They walk on. 

                                  SAUL (CONT D)
                    Apart from breast cancer. 

                                  JOE
                    If you do it online you can add 
                    gift aid and... 

                                  SAUL
                    Cash is better. Me and the Inland 
                    Revenue aren't the best of friends.

    He gives JOE another couple of twenties. 

                                  SAUL (CONT'D)
                    There's my gift aid. 

    JOE takes the Agar twenty out of his pocket and puts it with 
    the Saul wadgeof notes before returning it to his pocket.

                                  JOE
                    What's wrong with the breast cancer 
                    charity? 

                                  SAUL
                    There are parts of the body  
                    getting squeezed by the breast 
                    thing. 

    JOE amused. He loves it when Saul gets going. 

                                  JOE
                    Like?

                    tired of the pink ribbon schtick.
                    What can I say? I'm going to start 
                    wearing a toilet seat on my lapel.  

      They reach the gate at the top of the lane. A flower stall. 
    JOE looks at his watch.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     14.

                    home. 

                                  SAUL
                    Okay.

                                  JOE
                    Okay.

                                  SAUL
                    Later, Joe. 

      SAUL walks a few paces and then turns round and looks at JOE 
      buying flowers. 

                                  SAUL (CONT'D)
                    You're a good boy, sir. 

    JOE waits for SAUL to turn and go. He looks at his watch.


      Taxi pulls up, JOE gets out dialling a number on his mobile 
    and goes to the driver's window.


    JOE paying the driver whilst on the phone. The pips on the 
      radio. It's five o'clock.  

                                  JOE
                    John? Bike me the rape will you?

                    I don't have to think about it.

                                  TAXI DRIVER
                    What?

                    It's never an issue for me because 
                    I only prosecute.

                    How did you know I was asking that?

                                  JOE
                    You're a taxi driver, right?

    JOE walks away. DRIVER calls after him. 

                                  DRIVER
                    Okay then. So what about when you 
                    have to prosecute someone you know 
                    is NOT guilty?

                                  JOE
                    Doesn't happen. They're all guilty.

    JOE walks towards the house.

      (18.01H)

    JOE pulls open the drier and sees the clothes Juliet was 
      wearing earlier. He looks in the laundry basket - lots of 
      dirty clothing. He pulls out the four items from the drier. 
    He folds them carefully. The folding feels like an expression 
    of pain. ELLA and KATE are in the garden.

                                  KATE 
                    Your Dad does the washing?

                                  ELLA
                    Yeah.

                                  KATE
                    Amazing.

    JOE buries his face in his wife's folded clothing. 


    JOE getting into the car. He reaches inside the plastic bag 
    and pulls out a supermarket receipt. He looks at the time on 
    it. 11.30 am. He circles it with the pencil he keeps inside 
    his little green book which he takes from his old bag. He 
      starts the engine and checks the mileage. He turns to another 
      page in his little green book. A long column of mileage 
      numbers. He looks at the last recorded number and looks again 
    at the current mileage. He calculates the difference between 
    the two and writes it down in pencil.    

      4.2.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     22.

    He sets the clock to measure the mileage on the journey he is 
      about to make.


    JOE driving. Toscaon the stereo. He glances at the mileage 
      indicator twice. He pulls into the supermarket car park and 
      stops. He looks at the mileage for this journey so far. 1.7. 
    He stays in the car, engine running. Then suddenly he reaches 
      forward and hits the eject button on the stereo. 


    JOE pulls into the driveway and stops the car. He writes down 
    the real mileage to and from the supermarket. The journey he 
    has just done. 3.4. Then he writes down the gap between this 
      distance and the recorded distance (4.2) of the last journey 
      made in the car - by his wife. 0.8. He puts his face in his 
      hands. 


    JOE and KATE in the car. 

                                  KATE
                    Sorry you ended up having me at

                    He didn't say. 

    JOE starts the engine and resets the mileage counter. KATE 
      sees this.

      DOMINIC a little uneasy here. It's not obvious why Joe is 
      lingering.

                                  DOMINIC
                    I hear you're up to eighty miles a

                    I ran it five years ago. Did I tell 
                    you? I did the last five miles

                                  JOE
                    Pretty slow, then.

      A beat. Then JOE smiles and this tells DOMINIC that the above 
    is a joke and now JOE drops the cross examining tone he has 
      adopted and is suddenly more friendly. DOMINIC is relieved. 

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    We should play squash maybe?

                                  JOE
                    Great. See you soon. 


    JOE pulls up. He looks at the mileage. 0.8. He takes out his 
      green notebook and looks at the note he made after returning 
      from the supermarket. 0.8. Now he knows where Juliet has 
      been. He sits in the car for a moment. The pain of betrayal. 


      JULIET walking. Coat wrapped tight around her. She stops at a 
      litter bin. She looks about her. She puts the vaselinein the 
      bin.  


    The TWO AMBULANCE MEN outside. A Police van pulls up. Three 
      POLICE OFFICERS pile out. MICHAEL TRUSSLER and STEPHEN HAWES

                    I think he's still alive in there.

      A car pulls up. DCIBILL FABER gets out and heads straight 
    for the house. 

                                  TRUSSLER
                    Sir? Suspect's in there, sir, with 
                    a knife.

      FABER doesn't miss a beat or a stride. He heads in. 


      FABER coming out. HAWEScoming from the neighbouringhouse. 
      BRAWN on the radio in the background.

                                  FABER

                    Yeah. Where is she?

      HAWESdoesn't know.

                                  FABER (CONT'D)
                    Find her. Dad's name?

                    Joe Miller. QC, sir.

                                  FABER 
                    Right. Right. 

                                  HAWES
                    Is that a bad thing, sir?

      (22.25H)

      ELLA sees her father being stretcheredto the ambulance. She 
      wants to go with him. She fights to get out of the car. HAWES
    has to hold her down. Now she is hysterical. We are up close 
      inside the car with all this - and it's claustrophobic as 
      hell and very disturbing for us and for HAWES.


      FABER walking TRUSSLER to the ambulance. 

                                  FABER
                    He's conscious and he won't have a 
                    mask on. He'll speak. 

      Ambulance doors being closed. TRUSSLER climbing in. FABER 
      grabs his arm. He really cares about this stuff. 

                                  FABER (CONT'D)
                    Don't you miss it when he does.

      Ambulance doors shut. FABER looks over at ELLA in the police 
      car. The struggle in the car intensifies - she's really 
      fighting to get out - and then subsides as the ambulance 
      pulls away. NORMA FREDERICKS approaching from her parked Fiat 
      Uno. She is black. 

                                  NORMA

                    with the victim, blood all over

      FABER turns away.
