          LADIES' HATS

          Seen from behind as we pan across, then move to reveal
          the faces of the ladies themselves: African-American,
            middle-aged, formidable, fanning themselves with hand-
          held fans, staring forward with anticipation.  Sunday-
          Best clothing, 1981.


          ANGLE - THE PULPIT

          A low podium, fronted by a seated row of six African
          American men in their twenties, in period suits and shades.


          ANGLE - A TEN YEAR OLD BOY

          Wearing a dazzling white suit steps up to the pulpit,
          almost casually.  He exchanges a glance with his father --
          a large, imposing African-American PASTOR sitting next to
          pulpit.  The older man nods his permission to begin.  The
          boy turns to his audience, voice clear and calm.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        Our subject today... the End of
                        the World.

          He takes a deep breath -- not that he needs to, this is
          part of the style and the rhythm of the sermon.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld an Angel...

            Immediately, scattered voices respond "Amen" "Uh-huh"
          "Praise the Lord" "Hallelujah" "Glory" "That's right"
          "Preach it" -- and will continue to do so for the rest of
          the sermon as the Spirit moves them.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        I said I beheld an Angel...

          The responses get more energetic.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        And he broke the seal...

          He steps aside from the pulpit so he can be fully seen.

          He puts his hand on his hip.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        Come and see...

            A breath.


          REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH

          Sitting in a pew.  The only White face in the entire
          church.  This is a Dead Zone vision we are watching. 
          Johnny glances over at a woman (Clara Johnson) in a big
          church hat fanning herself next to him.

                                        BOY BRUCE

                        Come and see...

          Breath.

                        He said Come and see...

          Breath.

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                        Come and see...

          The people in front of him are on their feet, the crowd
          is shouting louder now.


          JOHNNY 

          watches the boy preacher, whose voice is steadily building,
          carrying the worshipers up with him.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth...

          Voices joining --

                        Come and see...

          His voice goes louder, more rapid, keeping out in front.

                                        BOY BRUCE
                        And the moon became as blood...

          The words pour out in a rush. 

                                        BOY BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth... And the moon became
                        as blood... And in Heaven there
                        was Silence.

          End vision --



          Sitting in the same pew as above.  Silent.  Johnny glances
          up --


          JOHNNY'S POV - BRUCE

          Standing at the front of the church, at the pulpit, by an
          open casket.  Completing some comments.

                                        BRUCE
                        I wish I could find the words. 
                        After so much time.    

          The Pastor from the vision is lying in state -- twenty-
          five years older, but still imposing, still recognizable
          as the same man.

                                        BRUCE
                        My father would want me to give a
                        sermon.  As he taught me.  But it
                        doesn't really go with the haircut,
                        Daddy.

          It's an odd time for a joke, not entirely inappropriate,
          but it does reveal a trace of guilt and separation.  There
          are no laughs.  And Bruce really feels out of place and
            uncomfortable and decides to wrap this up.

                                        BRUCE
                        I... thank you all for coming.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - TEASER - 2/13/03 - YELLOW        4.

          He steps away and the guests are disappointed but forgiving
          in this circumstance.  Bruce moves beside his sixty year
          old mother MRS. LEWIS, comforting her as people move
          forward and line up to pay their respects...

          As Johnny stands and moves to get in line.


  33MOMENTS LATER - ON BRUCE

          As Johnny moves to him in line...

                                        BRUCE
                        Thanks for coming back with me,
                        John.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods with sympathy)
                        I found out more about you in the
                        last two hours than you've told
                        me in the last two years.

                                        BRUCE
                                  (acknowledges)
                        Lot of ghosts here.  Starting
                        with me.

          They embrace as good friends would in this situation. 
          And as they do, 180 DEGREE RAMP TO JOHNNY...

          over him.  Johnny turns to the Pastor and their eyes
          connect (and this transcends the moment as though Johnny
          in the vision has an awareness of the unusual presence of
          the pastor).

          THE VISION ENDS.



          Johnny lets go.  They BOTH look dazed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, the Zone must be in overdrive
                        today.

          Johnny just looks at him, what's he mean?  Bruce raises a
          hand up to his temple.

                                        BRUCE
                        I could feel you having a vision. 
                        That never happened before.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (murmurs)
                        Let's keep moving please.

          As Johnny starts to move away...

                                        BRUCE
                                (sotto)
                        Tell me you saw us on a plane
                        going home tomorrow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly.

          Johnny glances down at the man in the coffin -- the same
          man he just saw praying over his dying body.  OFF the
          mystery of the situation.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          The reception after the funeral service... casual food
          and drinks on a buffet table... finding Bruce with a
            community DOCTOR... we'll call him MCCANTS.... (his wife
          is also in the room, chatting with someone near-by)...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        It's what he would have wanted.

                        Doctor McCants, my father and
                        I... we...
                                (never saw eye to eye
                                on this subject)

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                                (overlapping)
                        He told it to your mother on his
                          deathbed, Bruce.  I was there.

                                        BRUCE
                                (quiet, uncomfortable)
                        I'm no preacher...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                          I brought you into this world
                        with my two hands.  And I swear
                        to God I think you came out of
                        your mama's womb a preacher -
                        natural born.  I've never seen
                        anyone who had the gift like you
                        had as a boy.  It's a sin to waste
                        it.  It's what your father would
                        say.

                                (mostly to himself)
                        Yup.  He would all right.

                        Your mother tells me you've lived
                        in a dozen different cities since
                        you left... somewhere in Maine,

                                  subject)
                        I like being mobile... it's the
                        great thing about being a physical
                          therapist...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        Could you be any farther from
                        home?  Did you stop running away
                        from Indiana when you reached the
                          Atlantic ocean?

          Bruce looks around for an escape to this conversation...

                                        BRUCE
                        Have you tried the chicken?  Mrs.
                        Krasner brought it...

          McCants holds Bruce's arm as he tries to move away...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        What are you searching for, Bruce? 
                        And couldn't you find it here...
                        with your mother... carrying on
                        your father's fine work... cause
                        she's going to lose it if you
                          don't... she will lose the church
                        and the house...

                                        BRUCE
                                (dry)
                        Thank you for making sure I
                        understood that...

          A man (ALVIN) and his attractive wife (NORMA), both about
          Bruce's age... move to him as he moves away from McCants...

                        I'm so sorry it has to be for
                        this.  Hey, I want you to meet my
                        wife, Norma.

                          I didn't even know you were
                          married.

          Shakes her hand.

                                        NORMA
                        I'm sorry for your loss.

          There's nothing unique about this meeting, strictly
            perfunctory, funeral talk.


          NEW ANGLE

          Johnny is standing with Bruce's mother at the gathering.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Is there a special lady in his
                        life?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're all special--

          Johnny catches himself.  He doesn't want to give the wrong
          impression, even if it's the right impression.

                                        JOHNNY
                        --I mean...

          But Mrs. Lewis has just stopped a Young Woman serving
          appetizers from a tray.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Go back and forth like a typewriter
                        you'll cover the room much faster
                        than if you just drift.  

          Mrs. Lewis makes the movement with her finger in the air.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Back and forth and back and forth.

          The Young Woman acknowledges and moves quickly away. 
          Mrs. Lewis turns again to Johnny.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Does he talk about us?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT ONE - 2/10/03 - BLUE         9.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All the time.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (even)
                        It takes more time to lie than to
                        tell the truth, Mister Smith.

          She doesn't hesitate to ask provocative questions --

                                        MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                        Are there any other black people
                        there?  In Maine?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not a lot.

          She thinks about that...

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Is he happy?

          Johnny studies this formidable woman.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Miz Lewis, he's been a great
                        friend.  But he's not a man to
                        show his feelings, at least not
                        to me.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Covers them with a joke, I'll
                        bet.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        To be honest, after today, I
                        realize I don't know him nearly
                        as well as I thought.  I want to
                        change that.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Now, that's an honest answer.

          She looks across the room at Bruce who looks uncomfortable
          dealing with all the hugs that people want to give him...

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                                (beat, thoughtful)
                        I don't think he knows himself
                        any better than you know him, Mr.
                        Smith.

          Then she smiles gently.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Thank you for being his friend.

          As she's about to move away, she puts an intimate hand on
          his forearm in a gesture of appreciation... on her touch,
          RAMP TO HIS FACE...


  1010VISION - MATCH CUT - JOHNNY'S FACE AS WE SAW IT BEFORE IN
          THE VISION - ON THE FLOOR... DYING... 

          As before, he turns and makes eye contact with Bruce's
          father who prays over him... this time at normal speed,
          we can hear chaos in the walla off camera... there seems
          to be a big crowd... people running, maybe someone at a
          loudspeaker telling everyone to be calm and exit in an
          orderly fashion... but this is a two shot between Johnny
          and Pastor Lewis...

                                        PASTOR
                        Deliver him from his sins and let
                        him partake of Thy redemption.

          The vision ends...


  1111RESUME JOHNNY

          As Mrs. Lewis moves away... off his curious reaction...



          To find Johnny alone... staring at the corpse of Bruce's
            father... wondering what his vision meant... he slowly
          reaches out... to touch the body... both afraid and
          curious...


          HIS HAND

          Touches the chest... and it ignites a vision --

                                        PASTOR (O.S.)
                                  (mid-conversation)
                        In time, you'll find your way...

          Johnny turns into a -- 


          ANGLE - SPLIT REALITY - 

          Bruce has a duffel, short hair, and is now wearing casual
          clothes circa 1992.  He's leaving home.  His father stands
          in his way. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT ONE - 2/25/03 - PINK-2      11.

                        If you put your faith in God....

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        I lost my faith in God a long
                        time ago.

          The Pastor slaps Bruce hard across the face.  The duffel
          falls to the ground.

                                        PASTOR
                        Not in this house.  You will not
                        speak like that.  Not in this
                        house.

          They stare at each other.

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        You used me to fill this house. 
                        You used me to fill your collection
                        plate every week.  

                                        PASTOR
                                (refusing to even
                                  consider the charge)
                        Doing God's work.  You were doing
                          God's... 

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        Oh so it was God who took my
                          childhood away?  Wouldn't let me
                        play ball?  Go to the movies?  Be
                        alone with a girl.  I'm the only
                        black man in West Indianapolis
                        who can't dance, Daddy.    

          A beat.  He walks past Johnny toward the pulpit...

                                (as though preaching)
                        "And I heard an angel saying with
                        a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to
                        the inhabitants of the earth..."

          It echoes in the hall...

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        I've never heard the angel, Daddy.  

                                        PASTOR
                        You will.

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                          Armageddon?  The end is near? 
                        Please.  How can you possibly
                        believe anything we preach every
                        Sunday.

                                        PASTOR
                                (simple, honest)
                        I read the morning paper.  And I
                        have faith in the teachings...

                          I don't.

          Younger Bruce picks up the duffel in defiance... opens
          the door... he stares at his father a long beat, weighing
          his choices.

                                        PASTOR
                        Deny your destiny, you deny God
                          Himself.  And me.

          Young Bruce finally decides...

                        Nobody has a destiny.  We're all
                        just stumbling around in the dark.

          And exits.  We stay a beat on the pastor who is controlled
          but devastated... and although it must be a coincidence,
          he seems to look over in Johnny's direction... not eye
          contact per se... but almost an awareness...

                                        BRUCE
                                (entering from the
                                  party)
                        There you are.

          And unlike most visions... this one lingers as the scene
          in real time continues... the Pastor never disappears... 
          he sits in a pew and looks sadly straight ahead, perhaps
          praying to himself; he doesn't pay attention to Johnny
          and Bruce and how could he - he's in the past... a vision,
          nothing more...

                                        BRUCE
                        You told my mom there are no black
                        people in Maine and now she's
                        worried about me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think she's worried about you
                        for a lot of reasons.

          Bruce doesn't want to confront his feelings about all
          this... he puts some distance between him and Johnny...
          walks over and looks at the cross... 

                                        BRUCE
                        Why is everyone worried about me; 
                        I got a job, an apartment, a lot
                        of good white friends...
                                (beat)
                        They want me to come home... save
                        the church... like I owe it to
                        him... maybe I do...

          His father doesn't look at him; he doesn't see his father. 
          The pastor just looks ahead sadly, continuing a silent
          prayer.  

                                        BRUCE
                        It feels like he's in the room
                        with us.  I think I must be into
                        my own Dead Zone today.

          Sighs uncomfortable, stands again...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Cause I feel him... trying to
                        pull me back...

          He moves to the casket... looks at the quiet figure of
          his father...

                          Reaching out from that casket.

          He reaches out and touches his father's cheek...

                                        BRUCE
                        I could never touch him like this
                        when he was alive... it was too
                          personal, you know?  It was too...


          THE PASTOR

          stands, mind working.  A tear rolls down his cheek.


          BRUCE

          studies the body.  And a parallel tear runs down his
          cheek...

          And Johnny moves to comfort his friend, puts a hand on
          his shoulder... while Bruce still is touching his father's
          cheek... (note: it is important that we emphasize this is
          a three-way connection - not just between Johnny and Bruce
          but between Bruce and the body of his father as well) and
          on Johnny's touch... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S HAND... THEN RAMP
          TO THE PASTOR AND BRUCE'S HAND...

          CLOSE ON BRUCE'S FACE... HIS HEAD FEELS LIKE IT'S SPLITTING
          OPEN... he grabs his head... groans... AND WE TURN 180
          DEGREES AS BRUCE'S EYES CONNECT WITH JOHNNY'S EYES...  
          suddenly Johnny's head snaps back as a vision HITS HIM...
          A CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN BRUCE AND JOHNNY IS THUS

                        John?  What's happening, John?  


  1515RESUME RAMP TO BOY BRUCE

          Suddenly pain grips the child and he grabs his head... his
          father moves to his side, concerned... we RAMP RIGHT INTO
          THE BOY'S EYES... AS THOUGH HE'S HAVING A VISION OF --

  1818RAMPING OUT OF YOUNGER'S BRUCE'S EYES

          As he stands at the door about to leave home... he drops
          his duffel and grabs his head in pain AS THOUGH HE'S JUST
          HAD THE SAME VISION...


  1919FLASH - JOHNNY'S FACE AS WE SAW IT BEFORE IN THE VISION -
          ON THE FLOOR... DYING... 

          As before, he turns and makes eye contact with Bruce's
          father (present day) who prays over him...

                                        PASTOR

  2020RESUME YOUNGER BRUCE AND PASTOR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                                (in pain)
                          Something's wrong.  Something's
                        wrong. 

                                        PASTOR
                          Headache again? 

          Younger Bruce nods silently, almost incapacitated with
          the pain.  His father moves to him and closes the door... 
          Bruce never gets to leave this time... the father puts
          his arm around the son and they exit toward the corridor
          behind the pulpit.

                                        PASTOR
                        It will pass.  As all things do.
                        God will show us the way. 
                        Everything will be all right now.

          They walk by Bruce in the present... and our angle gives
          an extreme closeup of Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        But this isn't how it happened...
                        John, this isn't...

          But as he turns, there is no Johnny - and in fact, the
          moment Younger Bruce did not leave, Johnny was gone...
          and more has changed as well... Bruce's hair is shorter,
          more conservative but he still has a beard (to help
          distinguish him from the younger Bruce we just saw and
            establish this as a present day alternate reality - in
          other words, he doesn't look that much different here.)

                        John?  Johnny?!

          And the casket is gone too.  And he's wearing a preacher's
          suit.  And bells are peeling.



          Bruce's mother is helping him on with his robe in
          preparation for Sunday Service.  He is objecting even as
          he gets ready to go through with it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't do this.

                        You know your father doesn't preach
                          anymore.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's been ten years!

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        What are you talking about?

          She adjusts his tie, considering his face.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        You have got to get a haircut.

                                        BRUCE
                        Momma if you only knew.

          His mind races toward the sermon he has no clue about how
          to deliver.

                                        BRUCE
                        "The Misunderstandings that Divide
                        Us."

                        Indeed they do.

                                        BRUCE
                        What am I supposed to say up there?

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Do what you always do, Baby Boy. 
                        Just help the folks get happy.

          OFF the panic in Bruce's eyes.



          Bruce is moving toward the front of the Church, barely
          able to look at the packed house.  His father is seated
          among the other men flanking the pulpit.  Bruce reaches
          it, then turns toward his father, who nods.  Bruce faces
          the throng.

                                        BRUCE
                        How y'all doin today?

          Silence.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm feeling kind of strange myself.

          From the crowd: "Amen."

                                        BRUCE
                        No, I mean, I'm really feeling
                        kind of strange.

          "Preach it!"  "Uh huh!"  The shouts encourage him, seem
          to loosen him up.  Bruce looks down and sees Clara the
          hat lady with a monster hat on... laughs...

                                        BRUCE
                        Mz.  Johnson, it's good to see
                        some things never change.  Folks
                        behind you ought to be given
                          'obstructed view' tickets.

          Laughs from the PARISHIONERS.  Bruce finds himself relaxing
          into it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm going to just go with this if
                        you don't mind.  Try to get into
                        the zen of the moment. 
                                (off confused faces)
                        Well, maybe we'll hold off on the
                        zen for now.

          Takes a deep breath and looks over at his father who looks
          at him curiously... this is not the usual sermon...

                                        BRUCE
                        Our subject today... the
                          Misunderstandings That Divide
                        Us... and it's a subject I know a
                        lot about... a lot about...

          "Praise God", "Hallelujah"...  The connection continues
          between father and son... and we should cut away to see
          mom too as she watches this unfold...

                                        BRUCE
                        Because misunderstandings can
                        drive families apart... far
                          apart... until it's too late to
                        do anything about them...

          "Amen!"

                        in a way I've never been able to
                        tell it before...

          "Tell it"... ad libs...

                                        BRUCE
                        I have seen the angel.

          "Praise God"... and the father isn't sure yet... is this
          just another performance or is he really saying something
          to me?

                                        BRUCE
                        I have.  I really have.

            "Hallelujah!"  With more confidence and the old skill --

          And the men in front stand, whooping, ready to rock...
          And the room starts moving to the rhythms of the gospel
          being preached... responses get more energetic...

                        And he has told me of the fire
                        that will rain down on mankind... 

          "I have seen the angel!", "Amen", "Hallelujah"... The
          crowd is shouting louder now. 

                                        BRUCE
                        I have seen the angel who would

          Clara Johnson in a big hat is fanning herself...

                        And he has visions.  I think he's
                        in a vision right now.  And we're

          Someone in the crowd starts singing a gospel song in low
          a cappella counterpoint to the sermon.

          "Hear us, John"...  More voices, scattered, join in the
          rising song.

                        Are you working on this, John?

          "Work it, John", "Praise the Lord"

                        Give me a sign!  Any time you're
                        ready, John.

          "We want a sign, John"... "Glory"... the singing ratchets
          up to match his growing intensity, his voice escalates to
          pull them further.  A woman suddenly stands and screams
            ecstatically, almost painfully, overcome with emotion,
          stomping her feet and jabbing her arms into the air with
          her screams.  A woman in a nurse's uniform rushes in to
          attend to her... grabbing her, fanning her... (and this
          sort of display is not unexpected, it's encouraged)... 
          It's a bedlam of charismatic energy.  But Bruce is worried
          and confused and looks up as though to heaven or up from
          his own darkness...

                                        BRUCE

          His father studies him curiously as the room around him
          is about to explode...


          ALT REALITY

          Now covered with an array of foods that Bruce's mother
          has cooked... Mrs. Lewis carries out a platter of babyback
          ribs... which join the bowls of collard greens and rice
          and pinto beans and grits...

                        Just Sunday supper.  

          Bruce watches with very mixed feelings on his face.  Part
          of him loves being here at this family tradition he
            abandoned a decade ago, part of him is overwhelmed by the
            weirdness of it all and the mystery of why it is happening.

                        Don't believe I've ever heard
                        that blessing.

                        Right, Ma, and the Tamil nation
                        is on the northeast corner with
                        their own history, culture and
                          language... interesting people...
                        proud of their traditions...

                                        PASTOR
                        You're just full of surprises
                        today, "Elder".

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Well if no one else is going to
                        say it, I will - I thought it was
                        one of the best sermons I ever
                          heard...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        Natural born.  I always said.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm a little out of practice.  I
                        mean, I didn't get much time to
                          practice it this week.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Well, it was heartfelt.

                                        PASTOR
                                (curious)
                        Indeed.  I never knew you had
                        such an interest in John the
                          Baptist.

                                        ALVIN
                        Or the Tamil civilization.

                        Did you believe that thing on
                        Clara Johnson's head?

          We move down on Norma to find her knee under the table...
          it moves over and rubs against Bruce's knee...

                                        DR. MCCANTS (O.S.)
                        I think she feeds that hat.


          BRUCE

          reacts, almost chokes... 

                                        MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
                          I didn't even notice.

          She tries not to laugh.  She doesn't like to think of
          herself as gossiping.


          BRUCE'S KNEE

          Moves away from Norma's... Norma's knee pursues...

                                        ALVIN (O.S.)
                        Notice?  I couldn't tear my eyes
                        away.

          Norma's left hand...

                                        DR. MCCANTS (O.S.)
                        That hat had its own gravitational
                        field.

            ...snakes into Bruce's lap...

          The others laugh... and then react as Bruce stands
          abruptly...

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa!

          They all look at him...

                                        BRUCE
                        Is it warm in here or is it just
                        me?

                                        ALVIN
                        The door's open...

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, it must be letting all the
                        hot air in.

                        Right.

          Bruce doesn't know quite what to do - his father ends it
          with...

                                        PASTOR
                        Sit down, Bruce.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                        Have some iced Tea.

          Bruce sits, reluctantly... and we can only guess what's
          going on under the table... Norma's left hand is still
          under there... as she demurely eats her supper...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        The boy may be coming down with
                        something.

                                        MRS. LEWIS
                          Everybody's got something... and
                        they all bring it to church with
                        them.

          But Bruce glances over and sees his father studying him
          and Norma... his father knows something is going on under
          the table... Bruce abruptly gets up again...

                                        BRUCE
                        You know, I just remembered... I
                        have to make a phone call.

          And moves out of the room.  Everyone is perplexed.  

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        I'll check him over later.



          Bruce is in the small office linking the house to the
          church.  He's pacing, agitated, holding the phone in hand
          as it rings a number he has just dialed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay, John... maybe it's like
                        that... that time you saw the
                        mall was going to explode and it
                        did that, that DZ overload?  Come
                        on... come on... answer the phone,
                        I got to talk to you, man... I
                        gotta know where you are...

          He clicks off, shakes his head.

                                        BRUCE
                        Keep telling myself it's a vision
                        and it's going to end.  Click my
                        heels three times and say 'There's
                        no place like home' and it'll all
                        be over.  This cannot be real.  
                        Things like this do not happen.

                        Dammit, John, answer the phone.

          He slams the phone down, turns and sees his father standing
          at the door.

                                        PASTOR
                        Not the angel I hope.  I think
                        their numbers are unlisted.  

          The Pastor comes in and sits down.

                                        PASTOR
                        Can we talk?  You said before, we
                        haven't talked for awhile.  And
                        that's true.  I miss it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me too, Daddy.

                        I know.  And of course, I've been
                        waiting for you to come to me.
                                (beat, realizing)
                        Maybe that's why we're doing this.

                        You're talking in circles.

                        That's closer to the truth than
                        either of us could possibly
                          believe.

                                        PASTOR
                        Excuse me if I find it hard to
                        accept a day after Officer Lorber
                        brings you home at three a.m.
                        covered in your own vomit.  And
                        then sitting at your mama's supper
                        table today watching you and
                        Alvin's missus pretending nothing's
                        going on which I know it is.  And
                        she isn't the first lonely wife
                        in this parish you've fooled with.

          Bruce reacts, tries to absorb all this.  He stands, shakes
          his head, thinking: could this be me?

                        "the road not taken."

                                into his father's
                                eyes)
                        ...As though the search for meaning
                        itself would somehow bring me
                        closer to you.
                              (a very long beat)
                        I... see myself through your eyes,
                        Daddy.  I want you to be proud of
                        me.  No matter what else happens, 
                        I'm glad I had the chance to tell
                        you.

          It is an extraordinary thing for a son to tell his
            father... and completely out of character for the Bruce
          he's known... the Pastor studies him as puzzled as can
          be.



          Bruce moves quietly down the stairs, a duffel bag slung
          over his shoulder, a man ready to go somewhere... as he
          moves to leave, he pauses as he sees some photos of himself
          and the family on the wall... studying a picture of the
          Pastor and Baby Bruce for a moment.  Then he looks back
          up the stairs, says a silent good-bye and moves out of
          view.





          Reverend GENE PURDY is moving with Bruce through the
          interior... where red, white and blue banners are being
          set up along with Stillson signs and paraphernalia.  Around
          them, Faith Heritage students work to set up the chairs
          and check the podium sound system in preparation for the
          opening session.

                                        PURDY
                        Sorry for the turmoil but we're
                          preparing for a rally - there's a
                        wild Congressional election in
                        Maine this year... we have old
                          Harrison Fisher shaking in his
                        boots over our boy Greg Stillson...

                                        BRUCE
                        I've heard of him.

                                        PURDY
                        All the way in Indianapolis? 
                        That's very encouraging.

          Purdy stops an Assistant going by...

                                        PURDY
                        Our balloons haven't arrived;
                        find out where our balloons are.

          The Assistant nods and moves off.

                                        PURDY
                          Now,then, what would a man of God
                        want with Johnny Smith?

                                        BRUCE
                                (casually)
                        I have an interest in psychic
                        phenomena.

                                        PURDY
                        Elder Lewis, there are psychics
                        and there are psychotics.

                        I fear poor Mister Smith has more
                        in common with the latter than
                        the former.

          Purdy can't keep the anger out of his voice.

                                        PURDY
                        The man had the audacity to sue
                        me over his mother's estate... In
                        a coma for six years... not a day
                        went by that I didn't pray for
                        his recovery.
                                (beat)
                          I washed my hands of him a year
                        ago.  I have no idea where you
                        might find him... nor do I
                          recommend you try. 



          The Pastor is on the phone... his wife is waiting for
          news, worried.

                                        PASTOR

                        Mark deCastrique down at the bus
                        station says he bought a ticket

                        And why wouldn't he tell us where
                        he was going...

          The Pastor shakes his head, doesn't know.

                                        MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                        Was he having the headaches again?

          Lots of activity... phones ringing... earmarks of a

          Sarah's fingering through a rolodex... pulls out a card

                        need it any more.

          As Bruce reacts...



          The window breaks from the outside, and Bruce crawls
          through, pushing past the heavy plastic blackout sheet
          that covers the window.  All the windows are so covered,
          leaving the apartment disturbingly dark, even in mid-day.

          A computer screen adds some light to the room.  Bruce is
          amazed at what he finds -- the place is like Johnny's
          "threat board" basement times ten.  And we do an extended
          MONTAGE as Bruce examines Stillson pics and articles are
          pinned and taped and strewn about on all available
            surfaces.  If the basement indicated a potential stalker
          mentality, this looks to be many degrees darker.  Among
          the pictures: photos of famous assassinations... some
          with progressive time lapse shots: Dealy plaza... arrows
            superimposed on where the shots were and may have been
          fired from... George Wallace ambushed by Arthur Bremer...
          Martin Luther King's death scene... Huey Long's photo...
          John Hinkley and Ronald Reagan...  Oswald in his death
          growl as he's shot by Jack Ruby... very disturbing
            images... and notebooks... one is opened to a page and a
          line is written with a triple circle around it as though
          to keep it in: "If you could jump into a time machine and
          go back to 1932, would you kill Hitler?" 

          But there's more -- as he moves into the bedroom, he finds
          a shell casing on a desk... from some kind of rifle...
          and as he opens a closet... he finds guns... a whole mess
          of guns... and ammunition... Bruce's face is filled with
            horror...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        What are you doing here?

          Bruce turns to see our alternate Johnny staring at him,
          deceptively calm and controlled...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yes.  Only you don't remember.  I
                          remember.  I don't know why I
                          remember but I do.  My name is
                        Bruce Lewis.  Does that sound at
                        all familiar to you?

          It doesn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bannerman sent you, didn't he...

                          Something has gone terribly wrong. 
                        A Dead Zone implosion.  I... we...
                        are either trapped in one of your

                        maybe you'll see... you'll see
                        what I'm talking about... maybe
                        it'll even break the spell...

          Johnny just stares at him evenly... Bruce takes the bull
          by the horns and moves to him... grabs his arm... we hear
          a DZ sound effect...

                        angel.'  You're a preacher.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not a preacher.  I'm a physical
                        therapist.  I was your physical
                          therapist before everything
                          changed.  This isn't you. 
                        Everything in this room... it
                        isn't you, John... it's the you
                        that would have been if I hadn't
                        been there...  

          As he says the above, he makes a point of moving around
          picking up paraphernalia, ammunition...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you'd better leave.

                        think we both should leave.

          But as he's moved around, his eye has been caught...


          BY THE COMPUTER SCREEN

          displaying the Faith Heritage website announcing the
          evening rally for Greg Stillson.  He sees a blueprint of
          the Faith Heritage Auditorium on the desk next to the
          screen.  He suddenly realizes what's about to happen.

                        this afternoon.  Stillson.

          He stares at the ammunition in his hand... losing sight
          of Johnny for several seconds as he does... suddenly --


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          brings a massive flashlight hard across the side of Bruce's
          head.


          BRUCE'S POV - JOHNNY

          Staring at him, inches away, eyes wild.  A beat, as
            consciousness collapses into a single point of light,
          which finally disappears into blackness.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          Red white and blue bunting hung... crowds moving inside...
            loudspeakers inside playing lively political music...



            A worried Pastor Lewis has just introduced himself to a
          very busy but patient Gene Purdy...

                        The cab driver at the bus station

                        Your son was here... early this
                          morning, Pastor Lewis.  On a
                        dubious mission.  
                                (off the Pastor's
                                  concerned look)
                        He was looking for a man I've had
                        some unfortunate dealings with
                        named John Smith.

                                        PASTOR

                                and phone call)
                        'John'?  Did you say, 'John'?

                                        PURDY
                        Local man who claims to have
                        psychic powers.  Your son said he
                        had an interest in the subject.

                                        PASTOR
                        Psychic powers.

          And he's obviously shaken... Purdy notices... pauses to
          offer some compassion...

                        to you.

                          Reverend Purdy, I've prayed to
                        God asking for guidance today. 
                        But I don't understand what is

                        and I can't explain it.


  4242BY THE LADDER TO THE CATWALK

          A fresh faced young female Faith Heritage volunteer... a
          student in her late teens... is carrying leaflets, rushing
          to get somewhere, when she sees a man... it's Johnny...
          he's carrying a case... she looks at him curiously...

                                        VOLUNTEER

                          Electrical.  Got a call from

                        named Kennedy...

                        Some kind of problem with the
                          lighting grid...?  Maybe you know
                        exactly what it's doing...

          Looking up at the lights... she follows his gaze... she
          has no time for this...

                                        VOLUNTEER
                        Oh.  No.  But go ahead, check it
                        out...

          And she rushes away...  Johnny glances around...



          Is regaining consciousness... holding his head... trying
          to gather his wits... his eyes focus back on the computer
          screen, still showing the Faith Heritage website...

          Greg Stillson has arrived in the hall... making a grand
          entrance... huge swell of cheering... band playing... 
          Some of the motorcycle guys are around him... Sonny Elliman
          glances around...

          Like the President entering the chamber for the State of
          the Union... smiling, shaking hands, pointing to someone
          he knows...

          The crowd loves him...

          We tilt up past Stillson... to the catwalk... 



          assembling a rifle.

  4949ANGLE ON THE FLOOR - AS THE PASTOR COMES OUT FROM BEHIND
          STAGE

          The crowd is still going wild... the band is playing...
          balloons and sparkling confetti is falling from the
          ceiling...

          In the midst of all this visual texture, confetti, balloons
          falling... we're intercutting action... so it's not just
          a flat shot here... a flat shot there... it's almost
          surreal... a nightmare...

          The Pastor reacts as he sees --


  5050LONG SHOT - HIS POV - BRUCE

            entering, moving quickly among the crowd... looking in
          this fog of excitement for Johnny... he pauses to say
            something we can't hear to a Security Guard who looks
            concerned... talks into a walkie-talkie...          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/03 - YELLOW     45.


  5151THE PASTOR

          way on the other side of the auditorium - through the
          confetti... moves through the confetti toward him... it
          isn't easy with the crowds of people between them...



          Lying flat on his back on a bare floor, staring straight
          up into camera.  He holds the rifle horizontally across
          his chest.  From this overhead angle, body and rifle form
          the unmistakable shape of the crucifix.  The SOUND of a
          microphone coming to life.


  51B51BTHE STAGE

          Stillson climbs the stairs, still waving to the crowd,
          and they roar as though his rise to the stage is an
            accomplishment of sorts...  Purdy has moved on stage to
          greet Stillson... they shake hands, wave... Purdy moves
          to the podium...

                        God bless you.  God bless you all
                        for coming.  And God bless Greg
                          Stillson!

          More cheers... more music... more chaos...  Finding
          Bruce... Security people talking on headphones...


  5252JOHNNY

          Moves to his knees and lifts his rifle...


          THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE

          Thuds as it sockets home next to the shoulder joint,
          chambering a round, the cheers of the audience covering 
          the metallic kerchang of the rifle.


    5353STILLSON

          Arms raised in victory... as Purdy smiles and whispers
            something to Sarah...

                        God bless you too!  Back at you!

          Yaay!, goes the crowd... Elliman gets a call on his
          earphone... his eyes show concern... look out to the
          crowd... scans the auditorium...          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/03 - YELLOW     46.


  5454THE PASTOR

            Struggles to get through the crowd...


  5555BRUCE

          Finally focuses on the darkness of the catwalk... sees
          the ladder... bounds toward it...

          And we move into SLOW MOTION AS --


  5656JOHNNY

          flicks off the safety, aims...


    5757STILLSON - IN THE CROSSHAIRS

          Waiting for the applause to subside.  He smiles with great
          warmth and sincerity.


    5858JOHNNY'S FINGER

          pulls the trigger... the rifle fires...


  5959THE STAGE

          And once again to paraphrase Mr. King:

          "The slug takes away nearly one quarter of the podium,
          peeling it back to the bare, bright wood.  Splinters fly. 

          "Across the way, men in topcoats are reaching inside their
          jackets and Sonny Elliman, his green eyes blazing, is
          hollering: Down!  Greg, get DOWN! 

            "Stillson stares up to the [catwalk] and his eyes lock
          with Johnny's in a perfect sort of understanding... the
          crowd has started to move, panicky as cattle.  They all
          drive into the center aisle.  People who had been standing
          at the rear escape easily but then a bottleneck of cursing,
            screaming men and women form at the doors..."

          Finding the Pastor caught in all this.


  6060JOHNNY

          pumps another cartridge into the chamber... and is about
          to shoot when...

          ANGLE - BRUCE

          Coming up the stairs, yelling 'No', at Johnny... but is
          forced to take cover as...

          Continuing Mr. King's description: "...suddenly part of
          the [catwalk] railing splinters up in front of Johnny's
          eyes.  Something screams by his ear a second later.  A
          window across the way dissolves in a tinkling rain of
          glass.

          "All three of them [motorcycle guys] across the way are
          holding handguns, their field of fire to the gallery
          crystal clear...

          "He raises the rifle to shoot again but a pistol-slug
          grooves Johnny's neck... two more bullets strike him then,
          one high in the chest, the second into the left side of
          his mid-section, spinning him around into the railing..."


  6161ECU

          -- a bloody hand ripping a red, white and blue bunting
          draped across the front of the catwalk... as he falls...
          (SAME AS SCENE 5)


  6262ECU

          -- the floor below... as feet scatter to reveal Johnny
          lying face up... chest and neck wounded and bleeding...
          crazed eyes in shock, glazing over, dying... (SAME AS
          SCENE 6)

          As he hits the ground, we RESUME NORMAL SPEED...


  6363ANGLE - THE PASTOR

          Who is only a few feet away from where Johnny fell...
          looks up shocked and confused at Bruce who is looking
          down from the catwalk... their eyes connect as Bruce starts
          to run back downstairs...


  6464MOVING WITH STILLSON

          arm around Sarah who is crying, terribly upset... reporters

          spinning the assassination attempt for the benefit of
          several reporters.

                        We can only thank God nobody else
                        was hurt.  A madman's bullet will
                        not scare us off our mission in
                        this campaign.  It will only make
                        us stronger.  Excuse us...  

            A photographer takes a photograph with Stillson and
          Sarah... and we might guess he's going to come out of
          this as a hero...

  6666THE PASTOR KNEELS BESIDE JOHNNY

          Johnny turns to the Pastor and their eyes connect... 
          praying for Johnny --

                                        PASTOR
                        Deliver him from his sins and let
                        him partake of Thy redemption.

          Bruce arrives and pushes his way beside Johnny, during
          the prayer...  Johnny reaches out and grabs the Pastor's
          hand... and somehow Bruce knows what he has to do - he
          puts his hand on theirs - the three-way connection again -
          and looks at his father - as he does, RAMP TO THE HANDS...


6767A FLASH - THE PASTOR AND BOY BRUCE IN THE PAST (AS IN
          SCENE 1)

                                        BOY BRUCE & PASTOR
                        Come and see!


          RAMP TO THE PASTOR'S EYES...

                                        PASTOR (O.S.)
                                (overlapping)
                        Deny your destiny...


  6868THE PASTOR STANDS WITH YOUNGER BRUCE

          eleven years in the past at the door about to leave home...

                                        PASTOR
                        ...you deny God Himself.  And me.

                                        YOUNGER BRUCE
                        Nobody has a destiny.  We're all
                        just stumbling around in the dark.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ZION - ACT FOUR - 2/19/03 - GOLD       49.


    68CONTINUED:68

          And exits.  On The Pastor's reaction... RAMP TO HIS FACE...



          Finding the Pastor moving down the aisle... eyes narrow...
          confused... People are frozen in the line...  Johnny is
          with adult Bruce, having just embraced Johnny which was
          the first time we saw the alt reality vision... the Pastor
          looks at himself in the casket...

                                        PASTOR
                        What... dear Lord... what is...
                                (going on?)

          He looks at his frozen son... reaches out and touches the
            dreadlocks...

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        They're called dreadlocks.

          The pastor turns to see the alternate Bruce - Elder Bruce -
          walking through the frozen guests toward him... he is
          aware now that he is beyond life, that he is experiencing
            a miracle of some sort... and that plays as subtext as
          their conversation continues...

                                        PASTOR
                        You don't think I know what
                        dreadlocks are?

          Bruce smiles...

                                        PASTOR
                        I've just never seen them on my
                        son.

                                        BRUCE
                        I know.

                                        PASTOR
                                (studying the frozen
                                  Bruce)
                        I don't like them.

                                        BRUCE
                        I knew you wouldn't.

          As the Pastor turns back to the body in the casket, it
          slowly begins to make sense to him...  and this is an
            important line because as he explains it to himself, he
          is helping us understand what has happened --

                                        PASTOR
                        As a man dies, he dreams of what
                        might have been. 
                                (beat, realizing)
                        My last thoughts on this earth
                        were of the day you left...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, it's been on my mind too...
                                (re: Johnny)
                        That's what he must have tapped
                        into...

                                        PASTOR
                                (looking at Johnny)
                        Is he really an angel?

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't know.  Maybe.  This is
                        his vision we're in.

                                        PASTOR
                        Are you sure...?

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm standing at my father's funeral
                        talking to him in an alternate
                          reality.  I'm not sure of anything.

                                        PASTOR
                        Would it surprise you to know
                        that I talked to my father at his
                          funeral?  It's not so unusual. 
                        People do it all the time.

                                        BRUCE
                        What happened today, to us... it
                        was unusual.

          The Pastor considers, acknowledging...

                                        PASTOR
                        It was a blessing...
                                (looking to Johnny)
                          ...angel or not.

          The Pastor has realized at this moment that his journey...
          and all the things he's experienced in the vision of an
            alternate life... have been an opportunity - to 'deliver
          him from his sins and let him partake of Thy redemption.')
          And he softly prays over his own body... asking God for
            forgiveness.

          After a quiet beat, he turns to his son and studies him...

                                        PASTOR
                        You were wrong about one thing -
                        we're not all just stumbling around
                        in the dark.  You found your
                        destiny...
                                (re: Johnny)
                        ...at his side.  Protecting him.

                                        BRUCE
                        If I don't come back, she'll lose
                        the church, the house.

                                        PASTOR
                                (laughs)
                        Before everyone decides what's
                        best for Rose Lewis, they better
                        talk to her.

          Bruce doesn't understand.

                                        PASTOR
                        She's been after me to retire for
                        years.  Got a nest egg, wants to
                        see God's earth before she dies.
                        Guess she'll see it without me...

          They look at each other a long beat...

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't know how to say good-bye.

          The Pastor smiles, feeling ready to go now...

                                        PASTOR
                        Sure you do.

          Bruce moves close to his father and hugs him in a bear
          hug... and as Bruce lets himself get lost in the arms of
          his father... The whole show-long vision ends the way it
          began... 



          RAMPING FROM BRUCE'S HAND ON HIS FATHER'S CHEEK... TO

          as they return to reality... their connection broken...

                        You didn't see any of that?

                        Because it had to be a vision. 
                        Didn't it?

                        Something.  When you touched me.

                        day - that didn't make any sense -
                        of being shot... your father
                        praying over me...

          Bruce studies him... tries to make sense of it... looks
          to his father...

                        John, there's a dead zone in all
                        of our brains, right?  We just
                        don't know how to use it.  But
                        there are times we get awful
                          close... times like this.  I told
                        you I felt like I was into my
                        dead zone today after the funeral. 
                        Your abilities - maybe they acted
                        like a lightning rod when you
                        touched me, I'm not sure.  But I
                        know how you feel now, John.  I
                        know the power of the visions.

                        My dad and I, we got a chance to

          Johnny looks at him, sees how centered and calm Bruce

          It plays funny but Johnny reacts, pulls back.

                        I like it here.  And you need me

          Johnny doesn't understand exactly what that means but
          smiles curiously.

                        You won't get an argument from
                        me.

          He leaves Bruce alone with his father... as Bruce looks
          to his dad...



          Bruce studies himself in the mirror... his hand raises a
