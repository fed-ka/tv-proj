ACT ONE

FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - STARFIELD11

A beat, then a familiar dire rhythm of TAIKO DRUMS fades up as 
12 stars flash brightly and race toward us to wheel in a *
circle, establishing the border of a 3-D LOGO for the Colonial *
Defense Forces, as the drumming segues to a patriotic theme,  *
 vibe to this, and the film stock newsreel  a dated,  There s*
 years old and much played.itself seems degraded, as if it s*

The logo retreats to a corner, where it lingers like the SyFy 
bug as the image of space is replaced by...

EXT. CAPRICA CITY - DAY22

The pyramid stadium and the splendid city.

OFFICIAL VOICE
Caprica City.  Then...

The city become a partial ruins, strafed and bomb-pocked. 

OFFICIAL VOICE (cont d)
...and now.

EXT. GEMENON - DAY33

The stunning religious capital:  Dubai meets ancient Rome.

OFFICIAL VOICE
Gemenon, the holy city of Oranu, then...

The glittering cityscape yields to a similar image of 
devastation (not post-nuclear; more London during the Blitz).

OFFICIAL VOICE (cont d)
...and now.

EXT. AQUARION - DAY44

The Reykjavik-like capital of Heim, powered by sun and wind, 
glaciers at its back, its harbor embracing an icy sea.

OFFICIAL VOICE
Aquarion then...

Now the city is partly destroyed and the icy harbor is filled 
by the spectacular wreckage of a massive Cylon Base Star.

MEDIA IMAGES55

from the Colonial wars, some culled from Tauron civil war 
footage used in Caprica, others from contemporary war footage.

OFFICIAL VOICE
Caprica.  Gemenon.  Tauron.  Once we had 
as many causes to hate each other as we 
had names for our worlds.  Now we have 
 and one cause:  but one name,  human, 
to defeat a ruthless machine enemy bent 
on our destruction.  And after years of 
painful struggle, victory is within 
reach, thanks to the latest addition to *
the Colonial Fleet...  

EXT. SPACE - A MARK II VIPER66

swoops past us as we REVEAL the brand-spanking new BATTLESTAR *
GALACTICA, her artillery pounding a Cylon Base Star while her *
Vipers tear through a swarm of Raiders.

OFFICIAL VOICE
...the Battlestar Galactica, which along *
with its sister ships, Columbia and 
Prometheus, is showing the Cylon no quarter.

INT. GALACTICA - CIC77

The command center a busy hive in the midst of battle, 
COMMANDER SILAS NASH, 40s, presiding coolly at its center.

OFFICIAL VOICE
 armor -- The strength of Galactica s
which can withstand a nuclear blast -- 
is matched by the impregnability of its 
internal systems, which rely on 
hardened, independent computers, which 
leave the Cylons no networks to 
penetrate, but above all...

A LIEUTENANT works out firing solutions at her station, then 
relays them to the XO, who calls them into a corded handset.

OFFICIAL VOICE (cont d)
...on good old-fashioned human ingenuity and 
teamwork.  Yes, our powerful weapons and *
warships give them the tools they need...*"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10      3.


INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY88

Bigger and busier -- thanks to our full CGI treatment -- than 
 ever seen it.  A chiseled, fresh-faced young Viper jock, we ve
DEKE TORNVALD, trots confidently to his plane along with a 
bunch of other pilots who fan out to Vipers and Raptors.

skill and courage of our fighters, men

 the cream and his fellow Viper  jocks, 
of the Colonial militia.

Tornvald s canopy shuts, he gives the CREW CHIEF a thumbs up 
and the plane is towed forward into a launch tube.

INT. GALACTICA - LAUNCH TUBE99

Various angles:  the inner airlock DOOR closes, the CATAPULT 
engages and we experience that classic...

VIPER PILOT POV1010

as we rocket out the tube and into space, joining the fight.

OFFICIAL VOICE
Thanks to their fearless dedication, and 
that of countless soldiers like them, 
this war will be won, and won soon!

The bombastic music fades away, replaced by the lonely sound 
of wind whistling through the tree tops, as we DISSOLVE TO:*

ass over nose, and flying backwards he fires again, taking out 
both his pursuers.

POV ON THE VIEWER

A NIGHT-VISION SNIPER'S POV of a downed Cylon Centurion, lying 
wounded in a rubble-strewn city square.

MARINE (O.S.)
Here he comes again!

More raucous laughter and shouts as a second Centurion 
cautiously comes to its fallen comrade's rescue.  But as it 
begins to drag the wounded Cylon away, a heavy TRACER ROUND 
spirals in and tears off its arm.  Then more rounds tear into 
both Cylons as the Marines hoot and holler appreciatively:  *
 Frak yeah!   Hell Bitchin !    that Toaster up! etc.

Adama experiences a giddy, almost sickly sense of revelation:  
 seeing he sactual combat.  For Jaycie, it s just sick.

She nods to a window and Adama turns to see GALACTICA looming 
up.  No longer the pristine Battlestar from the old newsreel; 
 no less imposing, its hull is scarred in places.  But it s*
with its Viper CAP buzzing around it and support ships riding *
its flanks like pilot fish alongside a Great White.*

ADAMA
Gods... damn.

INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY1616

Adama, his DUFFEL slung over his shoulder, steps off the 
loading ramp of the Transport, then goggles at the size and 
activity of the Hangar Deck.  Flight crew in their orange *
jumpers swarming over Vipers.  Raptors descending on *
elevators.  Jaycie catches up with him.

JAYCIE
You re blocking traffic, rook.

Adama sees a network NEWS TEAM interviewing a Viper pilot by 
 Deke Tornvald, no longer the fresh-faced his plane.  It s
young man from the recruiting video, instead a seasoned ace 
with the SYMBOLS of more than 30 Raider kills painted on his 
plane, and a certain grim cast to his features that he can t 
quite hide as he talks to the news team.

INT. GALACTICA - CIC3030

Adama and Coker stand at attention at the Command and Control 
station, their PERSONNEL FILES lying prominently on the 
backlit table in front of them, while Commander Silas Nash, 
looking somewhat aged like the rest of his ship, confers with 
his XO across the room, occasionally glancing over at them.

Adama sneaks a look at Coker, who s staring rigidly ahead, an 
 hip flask protruding a bit too prominently notices Coker s
from his back pocket.  Quietly, eyes front again:

ADAMA
You gonna offer the Commander a drink?
