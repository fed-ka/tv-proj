      Middle of the ocean. Water calm, not a boat in sight. Except 
      a junky old MOTOR YACHT. 



      The man on the bridge, piloting the yacht, is GABRIEL BLACK, 
      35, athletic, handsome, sharp eyes and a capable demeanor. He 
      cuts the engines and a plume of black diesel smoke envelopes 
      him for a moment and then disappears in the wind. 

      He climbs down the ladder and walks easily along the narrow 
      gunnel on the side of the boat, to the broad bow deck. He 
      stands in the center, the boat bobbing gently on the soft 
      waves, and STARES UP AT THE STARS, LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. 

      After a moment, his HEAD TILTS QUICKLY AND SHARPLY, as if 
      struck by something. Then he stares straight ahead, almost 
        trance-like, and WE SMASHCUT TO: 



      Gabriel standing on the bow of the boat. 

      GABRIEL S POV - the 3D ENVIRONMENT of the TAJ MAHAL HOTEL 
      LOBBY surrounds him, semi-translucent. He s somehow creating 
      a virtual space, out here in the middle of the ocean. 

      Beyond the virtual images, Gabriel also spots an approaching 
      VESSEL on the horizon. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Not yet... I haven t found her. 



      A large INDIAN COAST GUARD VESSEL looms just thirty meters 
      off the port bow. Gabriel, very calmly, holds his hands up in 
      surrender.  INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                3



      Outside the door, a similar CAMERA is aimed down the 
      corridor. 

      CAMERA POV: A FEMALE OFFICER approaches, carrying a CUP OF 
      COFFEE. She types in a series of numbers on the ELECTRIC DOOR 
      LOCK. 



      The docks of the port pass by on either side as Gabriel 
      emerges onto the deck and RUNS. SAILORS SHOUT behind him. One 
      appears in his path with an AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Gabriel drops 
      behind a turret, a barrage of bullets flying past him and 
      ricocheting off the steel of the vessel. 

      The gun continues firing from over Gabriel s shoulder, while 
      twenty sailors come at him from two other directions. Among 
      them is a bleeding and angry Adani, pistol in hand. 

      Gabriel doesn t hesitate, running in the only direction 
      available to him - the edge of the deck and the water below. 

      Bullets swarm as he dives and splashes into the water of the 
      harbour. Adani and the other officers run to the edge of the 
      boat and look down into the murky darkness and see NOTHING. 



      A cow lazily lumbers along the side of the road, chewing the 
      tall grass, as a black SUV zooms by. 



      The black SUV leaves a dust trail behind it as it snakes up 
      higher and higher up the hillside. It finally barrels up over 
      the rise, giving us a VIEW of...

      A HEAVILY FORTIFIED COMPLEX in the middle of Virginia farm 
      country. The compound is comprised of a dozen buildings, a 
      large array of radar dishes spread out across a green 
      pasture, all surrounded by MILITARY VEHICLES and SOLDIERS 
      with DOGS circling the perimeter barbed-wire fence.

      MIRRORS slide under the vehicle, while a MILITARY SERGEANT 
      flips through paperwork. He takes two IDs from the DRIVER and 
      knocks on the back window. It opens, REVEALING RILEY O NEIL. 
      He checks her face against the ID. 

                                  SERGEANT
                    Riley O Neil? Your driver knows 
                    where to take you. There is no

                    rules can result in your immediate

                                  RILEY
                    Yes, Sergeant. 

      Before she can say anything else, he steps away and signals 
      to someone to raise the gate. The gate in front of the SUV 
      swings up and the driver pulls slowly through. On each side 
      of the gate are SOLDIERS, M-16s slung over their shoulders.

      An ICE CREAM TRUCK sits alone in the park along the river 
      bank, across from the high rise buildings on the other side. 
      Inside the ice cream truck is the sniper, his long rifle 
      sticking out through the window. He s Chinese. 



      Gabriel runs out of the building, Riley right behind him, and 
      are immediately greeted by a hail of gunfire from the fleeing 
      TRUCK. Riley dives, knocking Gabriel down. He looks up as it 
      disappears around the corner. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    What the hell is wrong with you? 

                                  RILEY
                    I said wait. 

                                    GABRIEL

      Riley comes right up in his face. 

                                  RILEY
                    Pretend I am! 

      Gabriel stares her down, then breaks away, walking back 
      inside the building.

                                          ACT TWO 



      It s an outdoor paintball arena with various areas set up for 
      battle. There s an old west town, a junkyard, a fake jungle, 
      etc. There s also a collection of corrugated aluminum 
      buildings. 

      Riley and Gabriel get out of one car, Gonzo and Jameson out 
      of the other. On the other side of the wooden fences, kids 
      shoot splatters of red and yellow paint at each other.  

                                  GONZO
                    What do we do about all the kids?

                    We could look around, not engage. 

                                  RILEY
                    I don t think that s a good idea. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Guys? What do you think? 

                                  RILEY
                    It doesn t matter what they think. 
                    We re waiting.  

      Gonzo and Jameson share a look. Gabriel ignores her. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I m going to look around. 

      Gabriel starts walking. Gonzo and Jameson take the cue. 

                                  GONZO
                    We ll go this way. 

      Riley, left alone and frustrated, follows Gabriel.  As she 
      catches up to him...

                                  RILEY
                    You think you re the first 
                    protectee that s given me trouble? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The F-35 is the most expensive 
                    airplane ever built. The first 
                    thing they did was throw it in a 
                    war zone. This thing in my head may 
                    be valuable, but it s no good to 
                    anyone sitting in the hangar. 

                                  RILEY
                    You re no good to anyone if you re 
                    dead either. We re going to have to 
                    come to some kind of understanding. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The only thing to understand is 
                    that I m not a machine. You can t 
                    just shut me off.

      He turns. She instantly realizes...

                    God, I m sorry. I know about your

                                    GABRIEL
                    You believe what you read? You

                    CIA agent, would suddenly fall in

                    Don t ever talk about her in the 
                    past tense again. She s not dead. 

      They reach one of the warehouses. He opens the door.

                      Gabriel... 



      Jameson and Gonzo direct the crowd toward the arriving police 
      cars, and flash their badges to the arriving SWAT unit. 



      Gabriel and Riley emerge into the fading sunlight and 
      flashing lights and sirens. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    We need a medic!

                    The Romans used to say it s bad 
                    luck not to give something to the 
                    person who saves your life. I think 
                    twenty dollars should do it. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You re not giving me twenty 
                    dollars.

                                  RILEY
                    I saved your life, remember? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You want me to give you twenty 
                    dollars? Did you miss the part 
                    where I used my Terminator Vision 
                    to get you out of there? 

      Jameson comes back with the PARAMEDICS. 

                                    JAMESON
                    No sign of Crispin. 

                                  GONZO
                    He s not here. 

      Paramedics take Riley on the stretcher as Gabriel points to 
      one of the Chinese GANGBANGERS in handcuffs - Huang Fu. 

                                    GABRIEL

      A moment frozen in time. We re outside Crispin s home. Two 
      Chinese gunmen are dragging Crispin toward the van. Two other 
      gunmen carry the safe. Crispin strains to see over the 
      shoulder of his kidnapper. HE S STARING DESPERATELY AT THE 
      SAFE. Gabriel walks through the frozen scene, stopping at 
      Crispin s face. He follows his gaze back to the SAFE. 

                                    GABRIEL
                          (to the frozen Crispin)
                    That s not fear on your face, is 
                    it? That s shock. 

      Gabriel looks back at the safe. Then he looks at the dark 
      edges of the hologram his mind has created. DATA STREAMS are 
      everywhere. Faces flashing, JING CONG, DR. CRISPIN, HIS SON, 
      the MICROCHIP being lowered in Gabriel s brain, documents, 
      the surveillance video, Lillian, Amos...



      They exit and STOP SHORT. Walking up the path, holding a 
      bouquet of flowers is Amos. Gabriel whips out his GUN.

                                  AMOS
                    I didn t intend to involve you. The 
                    plan was just to lure Gabriel 
                    outside with me at some point. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Drop the flowers and put your hands 
                    in the air. I m taking you in. 

                                  AMOS
                    You re not taking me anywhere, 
                    Gabriel. I m the one taking you. 

      From each side of the porch, CHINESE GUNMEN APPEAR, their 
      GUNS pointed at Gabriel and Riley. Amos shrugs.

      A gray, blustery day. Lillian walks along the riverbank with 
      a man named SHENG-LI WANG, 50, long white trenchcoat over a 
      perfectly tailored suit. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Several assets of ours have been 
                    taken. As you know, Wang, our two 
                    countries have enjoyed a moratorium 
                    on this type of behavior. 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    Perhaps you can tell me which of 
                    your assets are missing. And are 
                    you sure they haven t defected?

                    Where is Jin Cong? 

      She notices that the name got his attention. 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    Lillian, if your issue is with Jin 
                    Cong, your issue is not with us.

                    Do you expect me to believe that?

                    you turn him over to us.

                                    LILLIAN
                    Do I believe that Jin Cong, one of 
                    your highest ranking officers, has 
                    been disavowed? INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                46


                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    Allow me to put it another way. As 
                    you might say in your old west, we 
                    would accept Cong dead or alive. 

      She barely hides her shock at that statement. He puts out a 
      hand to shake, which she takes. 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG (CONT D)
                    Lillian, we would make an equitable 
                    trade. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    It was wonderful to see you again, 
                    Wang. As always. 

      Lillian smiles and walks toward the waiting SUV. As she s 
      walking she talks. 

                                    LILLIAN (CONT D)
                    Did you get all that? 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



      Mei Zhao, on a stretcher, is wheeled toward a waiting 
      helicopter, but Lillian s chopper is circling above. 

                                    CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER
                    Stand down and drop your weapons! 

      Cong looks over the side of the building at the twenty 
      vehicles and their lights surrounding them. Amos appears at 
      the roof door, his face bloody.

                                  AMOS
                    Cong! 

      Cong turns. Amos waves him back. 



      Chinese thugs sit on the pavement, their hands cuffed behind 
      their backs. Both Crispin and Riley are being attended to at 
      the ambulance as Lillian and Gabriel approach.

                                  RILEY
                    Any sign of Amos? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    No. The garage has twenty-seven 
                    exits. They must have slipped out. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    We let the chip go. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    I m the one who built it. I m 
                    sorry, Lillian. It was a mistake. 

                                  RILEY
                    If anyone is to be blamed, it s me. 
                    I let Amos get away. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    You made a choice. I thought it was 
                    the prudent one. You re his 
                      protector? Is that how this works? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    He s not very good at following 
                    orders. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    If we wanted a robot, we would have 
                    built one. We wanted a human. And 
                    we got one. 

      That affects all of them - Lillian most of all. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                59



      A single lane bridge in the middle of dense forest. TWO PAIRS 
      of headlights emerge from the thick darkness. The TWO SUVs 
      wind their way to the edge of the bridge and stop. At that 
      moment, a pair of HEADLIGHTS IGNITES on the other side of the 
      bridge, from a CAR already waiting. 

      The SUV doors open and the passengers climb out. Lillian, 
      Gabriel, and Riley from one SUV. From the other, Gonzo and 
      Jameson and a HANDCUFFED prisoner, Jin Cong. 

      On the other side of the bridge, Sheng-Li Wang steps out of 
      the car, with two CHINESE AGENTS and begins to walk to the 
      center of the bridge. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Are you going to explain why we re 
                    handing Jin Cong back to the MSS? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    We re making a trade. 

      Gabriel and Riley trade perplexed looks as they follow 
      Lillian out to the center of the bridge, where Gonzo and 
      Jameson hand Cong over to Wang s men. Wang remains. 

                                    LILLIAN (CONT D)
                    You said you had information. About 
                    Amelia Hayes. 

      Gabriel looks up. Riley, too. They re shocked. 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    The Pakistanis claim she is alive. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Where is she? 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    They had her under surveillance as 
                    recently as three months ago. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    I need proof, Wang. 

                                  SHENG-LI WANG
                    She boarded a flight from Punjab to 
                    Zurich on June 12. I m sure you can 
                    find the video yourself. 
                          (shakes Lillian s hand)
                    It s much better when we re 
                    friends, yes? INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                60


      Lillian smiles and turns and they all walk back. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I need to go to Zurich. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    No, you need to go to Nevada. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Nevada? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    The CIA Drone Command Center is 
                    there. They lost one over 
                      Afghanistan. They think it was 
                    hacked. 

                                    GABRIEL
                      Lillian...

                                    LILLIAN
                    Nevada, Gabriel. After that, it s 
                    better for both of us if you don t 
                    tell me your travel plans. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I was just going to say thank you. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    For what? This never happened. 

      She smiles and keeps walking. Gabriel looks at Riley.
