  as a GLOVED HAND STABS INTO FRAME, driving a BLADE into the 
  vested man s chest with great speed and precision -- ZIP ZIP!

                    was stabbed.  


  ANOTHER ANGLE reveals the man in the ski vest is none other than 
  WALLACE BISHOP.  And as he takes a blow to the neck from an 
  UNSEEN ASSAILANT --

                    was immobilized... Then the killer 
                    stabbed him in each lung, silencing 
                    him for good.  

  And as the assailant stabs Bishop twice --

                    new suspect in his murder, now we

  FADE IN:


  Daren Stalton sits on a bench as Sherlock approaches. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Mr. Stalton, thank you for meeting 
                    me.  Kindly stand up.

  Puzzled, Daren stands.  Sherlock pulls a handheld DEVICE out of 
  his pocket, waves it over Daren s body.

                                  DAREN STALTON
                    ...want to tell me what you re

                      Bug-sweeper.  I m checking for 
                    listening devices.   

    Satisfied, Sherlock hands the sweeper to Daren, raises his arms 
  so that Daren can check him.

  Daren sweeps Sherlock.  All clear.  And as he returns the 
  sweeper and Sherlock pockets it...

                    I m curious: How do you feel since 
                    you killed Wallace Bishop?

  Daren just looks at him for a beat.

                    Okay -- we re done.

  He starts to walk away, but Sherlock follows.

  He turns and moves off.  And ON Stalton, who can only watch...

                    Good -- you re awake.

  REVEAL Sherlock is FLASHING a floor lamp (which he s positioned 
  for this purpose) into Joan s face.  His mood is intense.  FILES 
  and PAPERS are everywhere and Sherlock s CHALKBOARD has been 
  divided into two columns --  Wallace Bishop  at the top of one, 
   Leah Stalton  over the other.

                    107 minutes.  Precisely enough time 
                    to cycle through all five stages of 
                    REM and non-REM sleep, leaving your 
                    mind clear for the day s labor.

                    Have I proven that Wallace Bishop 
                    did kill Daren Stalton s sister as 
                    Daren and myself had come to 
                    believe?  Well, in that case, I 
                    have made the opposite of progress.

                    I cannot prove that, nor, 
                      unfortunately, can I prove he was 
                    anywhere else.  After Bishop left 
                    the Army in 1990, his mail and 
                    personal effects went to his 
                    mother s residence in Connecticut, 
                    but nothing suggests that Bishop

                                  SHERLOCK
                    An arrangement that is not unheard 
                    of.  However, Bishop s medical 
                    records show that shortly before he 
                    left the Army, he refilled his 
                    malaria pill prescription and 
                    received a Typhoid booster.

                    Maybe he was planning to stay in

                    Bishop also received a vaccine for

                          (then; angry with himself)
                    Again, not proof.  But a suggestive 
                    detail that I should ve noticed 
                    earlier.  Much like the $30,000 
                    deposit made to Bishop from a shell 
                      corporation in April 1991.  Most 
                    likely a payment for his services 
                    to the oil company.  

  He s clearly frustrated.  Joan attempts to bolster him.

                    It s still not conclusive.  And our

                    killed Wallace Bishop, not Leah

                    Stalton killed an innocent man.

                                  JOAN
                    Maybe Moriarty was right because 
                    he s the one who set Stalton up.

                    An excellent theory, hindered only 
                    by being nigh impossible.

                                  JOAN
                    It s completely possible.  Moriarty 
                    said he did stuff like this for a 
                    living -- 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Daren Stalton saw his sister s 
                    killer running away from her dead 
                    body.  The man s face was etched 
                    into his memory.  How does anyone -- 
                    including Moriarty -- trick him 
                    into killing a different man than 
                    the one he saw?

  He exits.  ON Joan, troubled by this conversation.

    ...Sherlock, Joan, Gregson, and Bell have been standing there,

  As Sherlock emerges onto a sidewalk, The Actuary s cell phone

                    to deliver them in person. 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    The truth, Holmes, is that I hope 
                    we never meet.  My sense is that 
                    would be a great shame.

  He HANGS UP -- but almost instantly, the phone CHIRPS with a

                    Have you heard anything from 
                    Moriarty yet?

  Sherlock hesitates, but only slightly.  His voice betrays 
  nothing.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Afraid not.  I m returning home.  
                    I ll be there soon.

  ON the lie, he HANGS UP and hails a TAXI.  And as the cab pulls *
  over for him --*

  We re looking THROUGH THE BARS OF AN IRON GATE at a rambling but *
  rickety home on the outskirts of the city.  Sherlock steps INTO 
  FRAME.  Checks the address on The Actuary s phone against the 
  one he s arrived at.  He notes the CHAIN that binds the two *
  doors of the gate.  The ends of the chain are linked by a HEAVY *
  PADLOCK that s already been UNLOCKED.  And after he STUDIES the *
  house for the longest moment...

                    What do you think is inside?

  Sherlock TURNS to find Joan approaching.  Hard to say if we ve 
  ever seen him so surprised.  And as Joan holds up a CELL PHONE 
  that displays the same address and note that Sherlock received 
  via The Actuary s phone, she quotes something he said earlier:

                    you d never let Moriarty hurt me.

                    I thought you might try something

  She s obviously angry.  Which only serves to add to Holmes
