In CU a hand moves to turn down an old brown plastic radio from
which Big Dave is doing his morning-man routine.
DJ (V.O.)
Don't walk under a ladder!
Don't spill
any salt, don't...
The radio is turned way down.
We see that the hand belongs to
TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with
a pencil stuck in it.
BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG
working the grill.
The regulars are there:
five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
in for breakfast.
They are the retailers, the oil delivery
man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.
ANNIE walks in the front door, crosses the past the cash
register and walks down the counter.
SALESMAN
I'm sick of them repeats.
TRUDY
I musta seen that Kojak 82 times.
ANNIE
Excuse me.
How far is Camp Crystal Lake?
SALESMAN
OPERATOR
They gonna open that place
Camp Blood?
again?
TRUDY
COP
What is it, Eddie?
Forty
I heard they were gonna try
miles?
it.
EDDIE
OIL MAN
'Bout that.
Lotsa luck.
SALESMAN
(with a wink)
Be an interesting summer.
ANNIE
Can I get a bus or something?
TRUDY
Not likely.
Sam?
You goin' out to the
crossroads?
The OIL MAN nods.
TRUDY
(continuing)
Give her a lift?
That's hallway.
OIL MAN
(paying up)
No sweat, Trudy.
Let's do it to it, kid.
ANNIE
Name's Annie.
OIL MAN
Okay, Annie.
Let's go.
ANNIE steps aside as the OIL MAN heads for the front door.
He
is smirking.
He's fifty, strong, and balding.
He makes no
attempts to hide his appreciation for ANNIE's figure.
They exits.
TRUDY
I wouldn't send my kids to that camp for
all the tea in China.
SALESMAN
(kidding)
I thought you hated your kids.
TRUDY looks around, does a take, then laughs.
CUT TO:
11
As the truck pulls away, we see RALPH through the windshield,
standing at the edge of the road.
He is angry and upset now.
He pats his rats.
The OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.
His two front teeth
are missing on top.
OIL MAN
Must be the fourth time somebody's tried
to reopen that place.
ANNIE
Camp Crystal Lake?
He nods.
OIL MAN
Something always happens up there.
He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again.
DJ (V.O.)
...of bed.
I'm gonna count to three and
then you better get up.
It's 7:24.
A
beautiful day.
Weatherman Dr. Jim says
it's gonna be a nine point five day.
Here's Meatloaf from the Bat Out of Hell
album.
CUT TO:
13
From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.
The
DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.
The
Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.
ANNIE smiles a big delicious
smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat.
ANNIE
Hiya!
I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.
Can you help me out?
Apparently the DRIVER nods, because ANNIE beams at us.
She
tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard.
The DRIVER
accelerates.
CUT TO:
17
Still in the DRIVER's POV, the CAMERA watches as ANNIE looks
around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day.
Things are going
her way.
ANNIE
I can't remember being this excited
about anything.
I want to be a teacher
when I finish at Southern State.
I
guess I've always wanted to work with
children.
I hate it when people call
'em kids.
Sounds like little goats.
The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of
civilization have all but disappeared.
ANNIE still turns and
looks at the CAMERA when she speaks to the DRIVER.
ANNIE
(continuing)
The job market for teachers is supposed
to be the pits these days, but I don't
care.
When you have a dream as long as
I have, you'll do anything...
A look of surprise passes ANNIE's young face.
ANNIE
(continuing)
Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake?
Just
back there?
CUT TO:
19
ANNIE
(frightened, confused)
I think we better stop... Please stop...
Please!
Stop!
The Jeep's speed increases.
ANNIE
(continuing)
Please!
ANNIE grabs for the ignition key, but the DRIVER's hand darts
out and slaps ANNIE away.
We see that this hand is missing its
little finger!
Panicked, without any other recourse, ANNIE looks about her and
then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft
underbrush alongside the narrow road.
CUT TO:
21
From the DRIVER's POV we see ANNIE run, looking back in fear.
CUT TO:
24
In the camper van are three young people.
They are full of
fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
They are instantly likeable.
At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.
He is nice-
looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
He is funny and alert.
Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
American as popcorn.
He is quieter, two years younger and not
as smart as NED.
He has to think things through.
MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.
She is leaning over the front
passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.
She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.
She
enjoys every minute of every day.
She hasn't been touched by
tragedy.
MARCIE
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
NED
There you are dead wrong.
JACK
Ha!
NED
Sometimes I only think about kissing
women.
MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
JACK
Ow!
NED
I was just wondering if you thought
there'd by any other gorgeous women at
Camp Crystal Lake.
Besides yourself.
MARCIE
You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.
MARCIE
(continuing)
How about our last jay?
JACK
Good call.
JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
joint.
NED
What about the dope paragraph in Mr.
Christy's letter?
JACK
Quote:
Controlled substances are
expressly forbidden.
Possession or use
of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds
will means instant dismissal.
Unquote.
MARCIE
We got two weeks before the kids even
arrive.
Then I'll act responsibly.
Until then, hit me.
She takes the lighted joint and tokes.
CUT TO:
28
MARCIE is wide-eyed, looking at the lush surroundings.
MARCIE
It's beautiful...
NED
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't
seen a coat of paint in six years.
CUT TO:
30
The screen has gone completely black.
The door to the shed is
whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
sun.
There is a shape.
The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
on an errand.
As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
etc.
Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.
JACK turns with
a start.
He looks into the CAMERA.
REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
MARCIE
What are those for?
An Indian raid?
She points to the row of hatchets and knives.
JACK
Steve's got a woodlore program.
You see
any life rings?
MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.
She pulls out two
rings.
MARCIE
Here.
Meet me in my cabin after taps.
Okay, Camper?
She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
JACK
For sure.
They exit together.
CUT TO:
37
This is a fairly large single room.
The walls are bare and
uninsulated.
There are a few easels, but for the most part,
the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
wood interior appear silver-colored.
ALICE, her hair in a
bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
on one easel.
On a second easel she has done the preliminary
sketch of the lake itself.
It is also a moody picture.
ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
little, then goes on to her next task.
There is a row of newly-
arrived cardboard boxes.
She opens the first in CU with a
matte knife.
She take out the invoice and checks it against
the first items:
gimp, the plastic string from which all the
campers will make lanyards.
CUT TO:
41
ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.
In CU
her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.
Her
face relaxes until BANG!
The sound of a door slamming echoes
through the room.
The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
the doorway.
It is BILL.
BILL
Sorry.
How you doing?
ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
BILL watches her.
ALICE
Did you want something?
She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.
She doesn't
realize that there is something on top of the box.
BILL
Steve said you were thinking of leaving.
True?
ALICE
Un-hunh.
ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working
tools clatters down, shattering the silence.
ALICE fends off
the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.
ALICE
(continuing)
Oh, my God...
BILL
You okay?
She nods.
BILL
(continuing)
You're lucky.
They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.
BILL looks at her while they work.
BILL
(continuing)
How come you're leaving?
ALICE
It's long and personal.
It has nothing
to do with you or the other kids.
BILL
Maybe I can help?
ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.
This really is a very nice, if
naive, young man.
ALICE
And it's this place.
It makes no sense,
but it spooks me.
BILL
(smiling)
You're right.
It makes no sense.
As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.
CUT TO:
43
In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.
The snake
is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
been since we met her.
The room is small.
There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.
The walls are a light
blue, freshly painted.
The wall on the inside does not go all
the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
she sees.
She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
sexier.
She smiles at herself.
She reaches out in CU.
Open a drawer.
Takes out a towel.
ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.
Bends down and opens
it up.
Takes out a terrycloth robe.
She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.
CUT TO:
55
ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a
towel-turban.
She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
her hairbrush.
She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
hair fall down.
She hums.
Opens her top drawer.
Nothing there.
Opens the next drawer.
Nothing there.
Opens the next drawer.
Nothing there.
ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!
It flails
at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
as having a Navajo bracelet on it.
The snake strikes the
bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.
The snake
falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
Her scream is loud.
CUT TO:
57
ALICE is backed against the wall.
The snake could strike and
get her.
BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.
He looks
at ALICE.
ALICE
(a tight whisper)
There's a fucking snake in here.
BILL sees it.
He freezes, then takes a step forward.
Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.
Blood spurts onto
the floor.
MARCIE and JACK enter.
JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
to see the blood and guts.
MARCIE
Steve never mentioned serpents.
Jack,
would you get some paper towels?
JACK nods and exits.
ALICE
How the... did he get in there?
BILL
Slipped in.
Probably liked the scent of
your perfume.
JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
MARCIE
Thanks.
BILL
You okay now?
ALICE nods.
BILL gives her an extra hug.
Then steps back awkwardly,
stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
MARCIE
Go ahead.
I walk on 'em all the time.
(to JACK)
Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
JACK nods.
He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
underneath the wide-fanged snake.
MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
toweling.
CUT TO:
59
The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the
same room, cut off by a partition.
The kitchen has a couple of
sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and
some windows which look out on the rear.
BRENDA is making a salad for herself.
She is a vegetarian.
MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.
In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.
JACK and BILL are playing.
BRENDA
JACK
She all right?
Get ready for the schneider.
MARCIE
BILL
Yeah.
Scared the hell out
No chance.
of her.
JACK
BRENDA
Four zip.
How'd it get in the drawer?
ALICE walks into the kitchen.
She has washed her face after
getting her act together.
She stands in the doorway to the
kitchen.
MARCIE
How you doin'?
ALICE
Okay.
Can I help?
BRENDA
It's catch as catch can.
I'm making a
salad.
The guys are planning to cook
greaseburgers for themselves.
MARCIE
There's a lot of dishes if you just want
something to do.
ALICE smiles.
Nods.
ALICE
The way I feel, that's perfect.
ALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the
dirty dish pan.
NED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and
pieces of old Indian costumery.
He does a bad dance.
JACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway.
JACK
BILL
What the hell?
Where'd you get that stuff?
MARCIE
BRENDA
Oh, Lord!
Neddy!
JACK
It's gonna be a long summer.
NED
Wait, wait!
When I was finding these
goodies in the shed.
I also found this
letter which a camper never sent home.
Listen.
He takes a letter out of his breechclout.
He pretends to read,
when really we can see that the paper is blank.
NED
(improvising)
Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine
except for the strange man who flies at
night and sucks our counsellor's body...
ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.
She is a very pretty
girl, younger than she first appeared.
NED
(continuing)
And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor.
He says that whenever I'm scared, I can
sleep in his bunk with him.
JACK and BILL laugh.
NED takes off his headdress.
NED
(continuing)
No wonder they lost America.
How could
you sneak around in the bushes wearing
that?
What's to eat?
BRENDA
Whatever you make yourself.
ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.
Does she sees something?
The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
there is something standing there out by a cabin.
But it
stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.
When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE.
Curious.
A cold chill...
ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about
food.
BRENDA
JACK
How can you eat that stuff?
You like them rare?
Looks like dead animals.
BILL
NED
Too bad that Annie never
Cannibals.
It's old

She was supposed

BRENDA
MARCIE

It's
right.
women's lib from here on
out.
NED
The squaws are revolting!
ALICE looks up.
Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
The bulb does not light.
ALICE pulls it again.
BILL
Trouble?
ALICE
Bad bulb or no power.
It's getting a
little gloomy in here.
JACK
Steve taught me how to use the emergency
generator.
The town power lines are
supposed to be real shitty.
NED
God, but I love that macho talk!
Emergency generators!
The Indian used
campfires.
JACK turns to BILL.
JACK
Give me a hand?
BILL
For sure.
CUT TO:
61
JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
standing.
The puddle is somehow significant.
BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
BILL
This is almost like the one at my
uncle's cabin in Maine.
JACK
Here we go.
The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.
In a REVERSE POV we
see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
concentrates.
He bites down on it.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as JACK pulls the starter cord.
The engine
roars into action.
JACK
(yelling)
Now ya' close the switch.
CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
switch.
A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
perfect connection running through his body.
There is a
sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
screams, the generator chugs roughly.
Hundreds of volts are
streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
shoes.
BILL reacts quickly:
knowing better than to touch him and
continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
kick on his friend, severing the contact.
JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.
The
machine stops.
CUT TO:
62
The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.
JACK comes
in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.
He flicks it on.
As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
and knives.
They are all missing.
JACK takes his booty and exits.
The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
CUT TO:
64
ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.
It flickers on as
we hear in the BG the sound of the generator start up.
The
bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily.
NED
What hath God wrought?
BRENDA
That was the telephone.
NED
Ha!
You wily oriental!
The phone was
"Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."
"What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL.
MARCIE
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
NED
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.
It looks as if things
will be okay.
BRENDA
Shows how much you know.
It's something
about tomorrow.
ALICE
Tomorrow is another day.
BRENDA
Right!
Right!
MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
Suddenly ALICE cries out.
Everybody whips around to see.
ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
bottle.
She has cut her finger.
It is not a serious cut, but
the blood is visible.
ALICE
This just plain ain't my day.
BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.
MARCIE
NED
You okay?
Those things can be nasty.
BRENDA
Wash it out real good.
BILL comes up to ALICE.
BILL
Lemme see.
Doesn't look too bad.
That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.
They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
continues.
NED
Who played the role of Gorgon in Star
Trek?
BILL
BRENDA
I don't want you getting

NED
ALICE
Aaaargh!

BILL
MARCIE
How'd it get in there?
Melvin Belli?
ALICE
Somebody probably dropped
something too hard.
NED
Alice, you're just lucky there are no
snakes in the dishwater here.
NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
has just made.
He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
MARCIE
Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
Suddenly NED's face goes red.
His eyes bulge out.
He grabs
his throat and gags.
Coughs, can't clear it.
JACK
What is it?
BILL
Is it stuck?
NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
writhes about.
MARCIE
ALICE
Help him!
Oh, my God!
BILL
JACK
Roll him over!
Get behind him more.
As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.
It's a big finish:
NED
Ta-da!
REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
JACK
Not funny, Ned...
BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
MARCIE
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
what happens...
NED
But it's in the brochure!
"Camp Crystal
Lake has a full drama program."
You
just saw it.
NED tries to laugh it off.
They shake their heads.
MARCIE
walks away.
JACK looks at BILL.
BILL
Chance to get even?
JACK
I'll spot you five points.
NED
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
I'll never do it
again.
NED turns and heads for the door.
ALICE comes up next to him.
The OTHERS are out of earshot now.
BILL and JACK play a little
ping-pong.
NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
stunt.
NED
(continuing)
I'm sorry.
ALICE
Ned?
We're gonna be working together
for a while.
You're a nice guy without
all the entertainment, okay?
NED relaxes.
Nods.
He knows what she means.
He turns to look
at the others.
NED
Tell 'em I'm sorry?
ALICE nods.
ALICE
Sure.
NED
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
z's.
Today wiped me out.
(pause)
Thanks, Alice.
ALICE
You're welcome.
The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.
In the BG,
MARCIE speaks.
MARCIE
I hope that's the last time we see the
Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.
CUT TO:
65
ALICE is just drying her hands.
She stands next to a giant
stack of clean dishes and pots.
BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
and cucumber slices.
BILL and JACK saunter in.
JACK
You just had some lucky shots.
BILL
Where's Ned?
ALICE
He went to bed early.
MARCIE
I don't blame him.
BRENDA
He's probably setting up another one of
his practical jokes.
MARCIE
Yeah, like draining the lake!
They laugh.
JACK
(to MARCIE)
Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
JACK
(continuing)
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
MARCIE
(kidding)
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
small-minded people around here.
(to JACK)
Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
be right with you.
MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
The OTHERS laugh.
CUT TO:
67
The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
nearest bed.
MARCIE
Are you wet?
JACK
Just a little.
Wait a minute, woman.
He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
straight up and gives them some light to see by.
They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
towards his head.
He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
it at the CAMERA.
CUT TO:
69
TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
blanket.
Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
sounds of the rain outside.
The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
dribbled down.
As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
NED lying in the upper bunk.
In a flash of lightning we
realize he is dead:
his throat has been slashed.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
their blanket.
The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
MARCIE's face is contented.
JACK is ready to doze off.
MARCIE
Mmmmmmmph?
JACK
Mmmmmmmph.
MARCIE
Best over...
JACK
Umhummmmph.
MARCIE
Like waves.
It's never been likes waves
before.
JACK
Whassamatta?
MARCIE
Gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.
She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.
While
still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
clothing.
JACK gives her room.
MARCIE
(dressing)
I know this ain't very romantic, but
what can I say?
I don't want to explode.
She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
CUT TO:
71
JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
and lights it.
He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
Something overhead catches his eye.
Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
We hear the toilet flush.
We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
graffiti to herself.
We can only see her from the chest up.
MARCIE
(reading)
"Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
Makit."
"The Yellow Stream by I.P.
Daley."
Not the most original stuff,
kids.
There is a noise outside the stall.
MARCIE
(continuing)
Jack?
She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
playing tricks with her.
MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
exits the stall.
73
MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.
There is
no water.
CUT TO:
PROWLER'S POV:
of MARCIE.
From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
the sink and turn on one of the spigots.
Water rushes into the
sink.
74
MCU MARCIE:
She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
turns off the water.
Again she hears a noise.
She looks
to the row of showers and smiles.
MARCIE
Jack?
The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
MARCIE looks over, smiles.
She thinks someone is trying to
scare her.
MARCIE
(continuing)
Jack?
Neddy?
Don't put me on.
There is a dripping sound.
MARCIE stops at the first shower,
hesitates.
Throws back the first curtain.
There is no one there.
She
reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
empty toilet.
Then reaches in to the shower curtain.
MARCIE
(continuing)
Allee allee infree!
She throws back the curtain.
Again no one is there.
She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
MARCIE
(continuing)
Must be my imagination.
In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.
It happens in a flash.
A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
shower.
A hatchet glints.
MARCIE screams.
The hatchet
strikes.
The flashlight clatters to the floor.
CUT TO:
75
The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
older, but still attractive.
She says good night to her
CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
counter.
Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
coffee.
The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
SANDY
Anything else you want?
STEVE
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Sandy.
SANDY
You can't go back there tonight.
Not in
that stuff.
'Less you wanta get drownded.
STEVE
(drinking quickly)
I got to.
SANDY
Aw.
SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
STEVE
I have six new counsellor up there.
They're all babes in the woods in every
sense of the word.
SANDY
They'll be okay if they know enough to
stay in outta the rain.
How much do I owe you?
SANDY
One night on the town.
STEVE
I mean...
SANDY
...I know what you mean.
Two and a
quarter.
Plus fifteen percent tip to
make up for me spending the night alone.
STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
SANDY
(continuing)
You got a roof for that Jeep?
She rings up the money.
Gives him his change.
He hands her a
tip.
STEVE
Yeah.
I got it on before this--
(indicates the storm outside)
--all started.
SANDY
That's thirty percent.
STEVE
For two lonely nights.
She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
extra makeup.
SANDY
Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
self.
STEVE smiles and leaves.
She watches, then counts her changes
and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.
CUT TO:
77
ALICE enters from the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee.
She hands one to BRENDA, who is curled up on the couch in front
of the fire.
BILL stands to the left of the hearth, picks up
a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.
BRENDA
You think they fell asleep?
BILL
Anything's possible.
My parents taught
me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
ALICE
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
getting back pretty soon.
It wouldn't
look so great if he fell over them.
BILL
Good point.
ALICE
Well, it hasn't been that long.
BRENDA smiles.
BRENDA
Long enough for me.
They laugh.
ALICE
I think we should go wake them up.
Just
in case.
BRENDA
Give them a little while longer.
It's
still early, anyway.
ALICE
I guess...
CUT TO:
81
Lighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the
road.
He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get
rid of the condensation.
From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
ahead of the rain.
Beyond them the headlights make a slight
dent in the night.
In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical
storm.
STEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio.
CUT TO:
83
ALICE has finished her coffee.
BILL enters, shakes the rain
off his poncho and stamps his feet.
BILL
Got to it just in time.
The generator
was running on fumes.
I filled it up.
That should keep it humming until Steve
gets back.
BRENDA gets up.
BRENDA
Good night, Alice.
ALICE
Good night, Brenda.
BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
ALICE watches her go.
A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
she heads off.
BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.
BILL
Help you clean up?
ALICE
Absolutely.
She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups
into the kitchen.
CUT TO:
84
The door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and
slicker.
Her actions are direct and business-like.
BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
examination lamp.
She takes out a toothbrush and some other
toilet articles.
She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.
She put her
lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.
She
stands up, and washes her hands and face.
She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
that Marcie had heard.
BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.
CUT TO:
85
STEVE angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter.
R-r-r-r-rrr... nothing...
He looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view
mirror.
STEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to
flag down the oncoming car.
CUT TO:
87
Under a single hanging lightbulb, BRENDA finishes writing at a
small table.
The weather howls outside.
There's a tapping sound.
BRENDA
looks up.
Listens, yawns, then gets up and starts to take off
her clothes.
CUT TO:
89
The tapping returns.
BRENDA
That could drive a person bug-city.
The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
front door.
CUT TO:
91
BRENDA comes in shaking off her slicker, carrying the knife.
BRENDA
Christ, what a jerk.
The single bulb goes out.
BRENDA
(continuing)
Great.
Now what?
BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a
match.
She fires up the propane lantern.
BRENDA
(continuing)
Looks like I turn in early.
She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.
She
reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear,
revealing something that has been left there.
REACTION SHOT:
Fear spreads across her face.
REVERSE POV:
WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:
A camp hatchet lies across
her pillow.
The shiny blade is marked with blood.
BRENDA turns and runs from her room.
CUT TO:
93
ALICE is at one of the windows.
ALICE
I don't here it anymore.
BILL
Can't hear anything through that wind
and rain.
ALICE
It sounded like Brenda.
BILL
I'll go take a look.
ALICE
Did somebody leave the lights on at the
softball field?
We are looking over at her shoulder.
The distant glimmer
suddenly goes dark.
BILL joins her and looks.
BILL
Where?
ALICE
They're off now.
BILL heads for the door.
BILL
I'll go check on Brenda.
ALICE
Okay.
ALICE turns.
BILL is halfway out the door.
ALICE
(continuing)
I'll go with you.
BILL shrugs.
BILL
If it'll make you feel better.
CUT TO:
99
The rain continues as they drive along.
TIERNEY
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's
Friday the 13th.
They keep statistics.
We get more accidents, more robberies,
more rapes, more homicides, more of
everything when there's a full moon.
It
affects people.
Makes 'em nuts.
STEVE
You've made a science out of coincidence.
The police radio, which has been on "squelch," comes on.
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.)
(filtered)
Sgt. Tierney, Report.
DISPATCHER #2 (V.O.)

TIERNEY has jammed on his brakes and swung the car around.
DISPATCHER #1 (V.O.)
(filtered)
100%.
I'll tell 'em you'll be there in
fifteen minutes.
Out.
TIERNEY bangs the mike down on the holder.
He stops the car.
TIERNEY
Have to drop you here, Steve.
STEVE
Sure.
STEVE gets out quickly.
STEVE
(continuing)
Good luck.
TIERNEY
Another coincidence.
STEVE
Yeah.
CUT TO:
100
The SHOT continues on ALICE as she looks about the empty cabin.
Finally she stops, looking down.
The CAMERA continues to hold
on her face.
ALICE
Bill.
BILL crosses over to ALICE.
They are both looking down, past
the CAMERA LENS.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE:
the bloody hatchet left
on Brenda's pillow.
ANGLE on BILL and ALICE:
(as before).
Their faces are serious.
ALICE
(continuing)
What the fuck is going on here?
CUT TO:
103
The door opens at us.
We see the silhouetted figures of BILL
and ALICE.
BILL flips on the light switch.
The cabin is empty.
Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the
contents neatly laid out.
CUT TO:
105
It is dark inside.
The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE
make their way inside.
ALICE
Marcie?
Brenda?
Jack?
BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers.
ALICE
(continuing)
I think we should call the police, Bill.
BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
and turns back to ALICE.
BILL
Okay.
They exit.
There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
the windows.
The shape is dragging something.
CUT TO:
106
BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.
In the BG,
ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.
On the coffee table in front
of her is a large machete.
BILL's eyes are closing.
He jerks himself awake, then starts
to doze again.
The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
BILL snaps awake.
He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
it on.
BILL
Oh, shit....
He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some
lanterns.
He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong
table.
BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.
HOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers.
CUT TO:
113
The generator stands there quietly.
BILL comes into view,
spraying the interior with lamplight.
In the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately.
It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.
He looks
in--there is enough gas.
He puts the cap back on.
Then his eye catches something.
He looks at the broken plug.
He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.
He
puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.
CUT TO:
115
ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.
ALICE
Bill?!
She gets her bearings and looks around.
Stands up.
She looks
at the bulb overhead.
Pulls its string.
No light.
She sees the lanterns which have been placed around.
ALICE
(continuing)
The generator...
Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a
little.
Smiles.
She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern,
and walks into the kitchen.
CUT TO:
116
ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea
kettle with water.
She puts it on the stove and pops on a
burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
and looks out.
ALICE
Bill?
Bill?
The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning
to desert her.
CUT TO:
117
INSERT:
Whistling tea kettle on the kitchen stove.
CUT TO:
118
ALICE takes the kettle off the flame.
The whistling stops abruptly.
ALICE pours water into the two
cups.
She stirs the coffee.
Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.
CUT TO:
119
ALICE bursts through the front door into CAMERA.
ALICE
Jack!
Marcie!
Help me!
CUT TO:
122
ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
It is not there.
ALICE
The knife!
She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
LOW ANGLE:
as she scrabbles on all fours.
Nothing under the
couch.
ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
lamp.
Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
door.
ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
figure.
ALICE screams.
The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
forties.
She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
This is MRS. VOORHEES.
She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
enough to tell her what the matter is.
ALICE sobs incoherently,
pointing back to the rear window.
MRS. VOORHEES
There now, my dear.
Please.
I can't
help you if you can't talk to me.
There, there now...
ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.
In the BG we can see
the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
ALICE
He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
my God, oh my God... oh God...
MRS. VOORHEES
It will be all right.
I'll take care of
you.
ALICE
Jack?
Marcie?
Ned?
MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
MRS. VOORHEES
It's just this place.
The storm.
That's why you're all upset.
ALICE
No, no, they're all dead...
ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
without looking.
MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
MRS. VOORHEES
I'll go look.
ALICE's face registers the new terror.
ALICE
They'll kill you!
Don't leave me!
MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
MRS. VOORHEES
I'm not afraid.
ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
the back window.
ALICE
All dead?
Neddy?
Oh, Marcie...
ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.
BRENDA's body
sways just out of reach.
MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
MRS. VOORHEES
Oh, my lord...
MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
she picks up the lantern.
ALICE waits at the fireplace.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
So young, so pretty.
What monster could
have done such a thing?
ALICE
Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
MRS. VOORHEES
We shall go straight to the police.
ALICE backs up.
ALICE
The killer is still out there.
MRS. VOORHEES
I will protect you.
MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
Oh, this place... It should never have
been a camp.
Not for children.
They
had so much trouble here.
The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.
A log burns
through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
Camp Blood.
MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
Strokes her soft hair.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
You know a boy drowned the year before
those two others were killed?
An
accident?
It was inadequate supervision.
The counsellors were not paying enough
attention... They were making love when
that boy drowned.
ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.
The hand is missing its little finger!
The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
We should go now.
ALICE
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
MRS. VOORHEES
No.
That won't be necessary.
As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
knife.
ALICE
I don't understand.
MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
JASON (V.O.)
(filtered)
Help me, mommy... save me... please,
mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
save me....
MRS. VOORHEES
(cocking her hand to listen)
I am, Jason.
I am.
ALICE
(a little confused)
Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?
MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.
While her
voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
into her other manifestation.
All of this is in concert with
the visibility of her weapon.
MRS. VOORHEES
It was my son they killed.
They said he
drowned, but I know it was inadequate
supervision...
ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.
She can't see the
knife rise behind her.
ALICE
Mr. Christy will be back soon.
MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
MRS. VOORHEES
No, he won't.
I killed him as well....
The shock of recognition hits ALICE.
In CU her eyes look up
and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
to strike.
ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
MRS. VOORHEES
(continuing)
I couldn't let them start this camp
again, could I?
ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.
She grabs the fireplace
poker.
ALICE
I won't let you!
ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
ALICE
(continuing)
No!
No!
No!
MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
cage.
MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.
MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
deliberately.
Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
CUT TO:
123
ALICE gets to the door and stops.
She fiddles with the side of
the screen... somebody has latched it.
CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
the door, snapping the latch.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
thunder and the lightning.
The THEME is going full-tilt as
ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
TWO-SHOT:
as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
above.
A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.
A rope is looped under
his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
protrudes from his heart.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE in terror.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
of legs which swing from the same big tree.
STROBE SHOT:
of JACK, dead.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.
In the BG we
see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
between herself and ALICE.
CUT TO:
124
ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.
We hear the
SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
bright overhead lights come on.
ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
reveal her hiding place.
She looks for an escape.
There's a window.
She starts for it,
then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
feet.
She carries a machete in her hand.
We see this instrument in
CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
JASON (V.O.)
Help, mommy, I'm drowning!
Oh, mommy,
please....
The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.
She is both
characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
VOICE OF JASON.
ALICE is very still.
Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
VOORHEES rave.
JASON (Lipsync)
Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
breathe... Help me, breathe...
MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.
She
strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
child stops.
MRS. VOORHEES
(in her own voice)
I can't let them kill any more children.
Come out now.
She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
PROWLER.
When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
her path like a barred door.
Before ALICE can think twice,
MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
now ALICE is sandwiched between them.
She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.
On the shelf is a box.
MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
Her machete is coming up in an attack.
ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
leather-working tools.
She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
as she can.
MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
knives.
One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
animal bellow.
ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
JASON (V.O.)
Kill her, mommy!
Kill her!
CUT TO:
127
It is a small cabin.
On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
from the wall.
She rummages in a drawer.
It's empty.
She tries another.
Empty.
ALICE
Where are the goddamned bullets?
The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
ALICE looks around.
CUT TO:
130
ANGLE ON ALICE:
She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
rifle.
The hasp doesn't give.
She gives it another butt
stroke.
It won't give.
A shadow covers ALICE's back.
She
turns.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
blocking the light.
Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
steps slowly toward ALICE.
ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
thing she can.
She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
drops to the floor.
ALICE runs out the door.
CUT TO:
132
ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
then hides there, closing the door behind her.
CUT TO:
134
There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
Then we hear some shuffling around outside.
The lights are
turned on.
JASON (V.O.)
Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
please.
Kill her, mommy.
There is the sound of pots being rustled through.
Then the
sound of another door being slammed.
ALICE relaxes again.
Then there is a silence.
ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
now.
She reaches out for the lock.
Then thinks better of the
idea.
She cases down the door frame to the floor.
On all sides are
the cans of food and cooking implements.
There is a large
skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
ALICE covers her head with her arms.
The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
slowly.
We see it, but she does not.
MRS. VOORHEES' hand
finishes turning and now starts to push gently.
There is
almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
JASON (O.S.)
Come out, come out, wherever you are...
ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
room.
Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
ALICE
Please...
ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
The silence is interrupted by a new sound:
MRS. VOORHEES has
begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
door to the larder.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE... oh, my God...
At first we see nothing on our side.
Then, gradually, we see
little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.
ALICE's
eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
anything...
Larger holes are now made.
MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
to take a peck inside.
We can see her eye at the largest hole.
She goes back to whacking away at the door.
The hole is near
the lock.
It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
ALICE realizes she must defend herself.
She reaches down and
picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
come through the entrance.
MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.
ALICE fends off the
blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
head.
As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
a solid blow on top of her head.
MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
floor.
ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.
She crosses
carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.
There is a
small puddle of blood under her head.
ANGLE ON ALICE:
She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
slowly out of the room.
CUT TO:
135
