    A few live action shots of a simple fishing town gearing up 
    for the day before we come across a sign on a hill for 
    Franklin High School -- over the words,  The Fighting First 
    Mates -- Go Baiters!  andthe mascot, a sailor holding a worm.

    We first see our animation style (a mix of simplistic 
    illustration against a photographic live action background) as  
    A FEW STUDENTS ON BIKES in  Baiters  jackets laden with lumbar-
    breaking book bags struggle up the hill.


    Some STUDENT ATHLETES are running around the track, they pass 
    their coach who stands staring off waiting for the girl he 
    most loves.  This is LARRY (The  Nice Guy .  The smartest guy 
    at the school -- but unfortunately for all he teaches P.E.  A 
    voice of sanity despite being prone to bursts of frustrated 
    anger.)  Larry realizes too late that his students have 
    finished.

                                LARRY
                  Arg!Sorry, one more mile and this 
                  time I ll definitely use the stop 
                  watch!

    YEARBOOK PHOTO: LARRY SLIMP - P.E.  QUOTE:  IS THERE ANY WAY I 
    CAN GET TRANSFERRED OUT OF P.E? 

    Back to action as Larry fires a starter s pistol and the 
    exhausted kids take off for another lap.  Unfortunately a 
    moment later he realizes he s failed to start the watch again.  


    ANDREW is rocking out to the radio. ( The Sissy. )  He 
    shimmies and sways and wiggles his shoulders.  HELEN ( the 
    Know It All ) is behind the wheel (tightly wound, highly 
    frustrated).  


    Helen s car narrowly misses a Prius (covered with bumper 
    stickers) coming right at them.  The cyclists from earlier 
    must also dive out of the way.


    WILLARD ( The Loser.  Dissolute, broken, the very essence of 
    failure) drives his car past a number of nice cars in the 
    parking lot until he reaches the faculty section, where the 
    cars are distinctly worse. 


    The students are rounding the bend as Larry sees Miracle's car 
    pop over a curb and approach.

                                LARRY
                  Miracle!  Here we go...Today s the 
                  day you notice Larry Slimp!

    Larry joins the exhausted runners and sprints in a full-bore 
    out to the front of the pack.  He turns immediately to wave to 
    Miracle's fast approaching Prius.

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  Okay, that s teamwork!  ( Noticing ) 
                  Oh, hey Miracle... just showing the 
                  kids how to run...Miracle?

    But Miracle s Prius is now driving straight at him.  Through 
    the sticker covered window we can barely make out the worried 
    looking eyes of Baby who tries to steer.  Larry dives out of 
    the way, causing the group of cyclists to once again go down.                                                                                      4



    Miracle s Prius rams up into her parking spot, just as she 
    gets the baby buckled in.

                                MIRACLE
                  That was a whole lot of nothing!  
                  (noticing)  Hey, do you have a fever?

    The sweat covered Baby rolls his eyes.  


    Reveal that Miracle s car is inches from Willard s.

                                WILLARD
                  Miracle, I m kind of trapped here. 

                                MIRACLE
                  Oh, that s how I felt about having a 
                  baby with no Daddy.  But the only 
                  protection any of us really need is 
                  prayer.  Right baby? 

    She crosses off as the baby shakes his head in a silent call 
    for help to Willard;  No it isn t. 

    Willard goes to put it in reverse when three black Mercedes
    Maybachspull up to a stop behind him. A driver opens the door 
    and HAPPY emerges (the "Weird one" -- We just might find out 
    that he's UdayHussein- but this is his secret... and in the 
    meantime the teachers just assume he's from Mexico.)

    Happy crosses to the trunk, tosses in his head wrap, throws on 
    a gardener s hat and nonchalantly rakes up leaves.

                                WILLARD
                  Happy... I m kind of stuck here...

    (We will hear the halting and dispassionate O.S. TRANSLATOR 
    over Happy when he speaks. Think  Saddamon trial. )

                  Um, yeah... I don t speak Spanish...  
                  You don t know any German, do you?


    WE REVEAL that Stuart is driving incredibly slowly through the 
    lot in a small, late model Hondacivic.  


    Larry enters and in a friendly way waves to some young female 
    students. 

                                LARRY
                  Hi kids...

    They look away and quickly walk off.  Larry is confused as 
    Miracle approaches.  

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  That was odd.

                                MIRACLE
                  It s probably because of the posters.  
                  But Sue says they re for our safety, 
                  too. 

    Miracle indicates poster that reads:   Don t tempt a teacher!  
    It could cost them their job.   Another shows a drawing of a 
    teacher, his pockets pulled out, with the words  I MIGHT SEEM 
    WORLDLY, BUT I M REALLY QUITE POOR!  (We will see several 
    others throughout the show)   

                                LARRY
                  Why do I have a feeling that this is 
                  because of Andrew.  (THEN) So... hi! 

                                MIRACLE
                  Hi, I just wanted to let you know 
                  I ve started a four-day famine with 
                  my classes...  


                                SUE
                  No, this isn t something we re 
                  helping sell, this is serious.  
                  Drugs.

                                LARRY
                  Wow.  They even find a way in here.

                                SUE
                  I m having Miracle in our science 
                  department take a look at it.  You 
                  obviously know her. 

    Larry is arrested by the name of the woman he loves.  

                                LARRY
                  Know her?  Please... if I were better 
                  with imagery I d call her an angel...

    As he waxes poetical WE SEE THE IMAGE he s trying to describe.  
    Miracle s face on a flying angel.

                                LARRY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  ...whose wings are...as soft as... 
                  breasts, that...grow out of 
                  her...back.  Perfectly balancing her 
                  two...front breasts... 

    The angel s breasts come into view, then her wings turn into 
    breasts, the weight of which flops her over, so she s flying 
    upside down.  She sticks her tongue out, which gestures  come 
    here  like a finger --


    Willard, in a fake moustache guiltily and covertly grabs a 
    stack of dirty magazines. 

                                WILLARD (V.O.)
                  ...I was buying a stack of adult 
                  magazines when I ran into one of the 
                  students.  

    Willard pulls out a credit card, and license to pay.  He takes 
    off his moustache and only then finds himself staring face to 
    face with a frightened looking student. (It doesn t help that 
    Willard wears a faded shirt that reads  ConVIAGRAtulations
    Baiters! 2004. )

    THAT DAY

    Students sit quietly in an empty class room.  They listen to 
    Sue over the P.A. system.

                                SUE (OVER P.A.)
                  ...sowhile faculty attend this 
                  mandatory meeting, students are 
                  encouraged to sit quietly in prayer.  


    Students are gathered around a principal at a podium 
    surrounded by an array of microphones.  Chyronreads: 1991, 
    but the scene is strangely 19th century.  Stove pipe hats, 
    handlebar moustaches, megaphone-y voices.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  It s been a tough year for all of us.   
                  We ve been at war in Iraq.  
                    Transitioningfrom Bush to Clinton.  
                  The beginning of a huge recession.  
                  And a baseball player at the center 
                  of a scandal that broke our hearts.                                                                                    18



                                PRINCIPAL
                  To help us enshrine this capsule of a 
                  time we hope never to return to -- a 
                  pair of celebrities who will never 
                  let us down:  Mr. andMrs. Milli 
                  Vanilli.

    The crowd goes wild as Faband Morvantake the stage in period 
    dress, but with dreadlocks. 

                                MILLI
                  Thank you Franklin High First Mates.  
                  -irstMates.  -irstMates.  -irst
                  Mates.

    The students narrow their eyes noticing the boys are out of 
    sync.

                                SUE (V.O.)
                  The capsule was packed with items 
                  thought soon to be rare.

    Cut to students with late eighties hair packing a time capsule 
    with a sandwich, some pennies, a kitten, and a bottle of wine.

                                SUE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  I m told that among them was a bottle 
                  of Dry Creek Chardonnay that today 
                  might well be worth thousands. 

    The capsule is lowered into a hole. 


    Students practice in the extreme foreground while Larry and 
    Stuart watch from the sidelines.

                                LARRY
                  This is unbelievable.  These guys 
                  just keep getting worse. (calling
                  out)  Come on!  Stay on your man!  
                  He's only twenty-three for God's 
                  sake.

    Larry shares a look of disbelief with Stuart, who joins in.

                                STUART
                  Don't look at him!  Look at me!  
                  That's right, now look at him!  Now 
                  wave to him!  Okay, wave to that 
                  other guy!  Where are the smiles, 
                  gentleman?

    Stuart shares a look of disbelief with Larry.

                                LARRY
                  You've never coached before, have you 
                  Stuart?    

                                STUART
                  Not technically.  I've coated things.  
                  With VapoRubor what have you, but to 
                  me that s not exactly the same as 
                   coaching.   

                                LARRY
                  But, you feel okay?

                                STUART
                  Oh, I feel great.  I think it was 
                  those vitamins you gave me.

                                LARRY
                  Good, and how do your testicles feel?

    Stuart reflects.  We see a series of three quick cutaways. 

    attempts to good-naturedly ride down a handrail, like the 
    others.  The board slips away and Stuart slams down crotch 
    first and slides the remainder rimming onto a trash can with 
    the words  Evapo-TAB!The System-Wide Sniffle Stopper!  ...if 
    you can blink or swallow, you re not taking Evapo-TAB.     

    Darnellrushes up with a camera crew and kicks him in the 
    nuts.  Back to present.                                                                                    22


                                STUART
                  You know, they really don t.  I got a 
                  little bit of a tickle when that 
                  three-quarter scale programming 
                  genius launched a Ferragamointo my 
                  yam-sack... but no...  I guess the 
                  vapo-rub sdoing it s job. (then)  
                  Thanks for asking.

    Stuart hugs Larry.  Larry looks confused.  We rack focus to 
    find Andrew watching, seething.  


    Helen is surrounded by several holes that she's dug.  Sue 
    approaches.  

                                SUE
                  Hello, Helen.  Any luck?

                                HELEN
                  Oh, please.  I know that you get off 
                  on making me look foolish.

                                SUE
                  There's nothing foolish about digging 
                  holes, Helen.  Lots of bugs and 
                  stupid people and small rodents do it 
                  every day and they're certainly not 
                  foolish except for the stupid people.

                                HELEN
                  You just don t want me at the game.

                                SUE
                  Of course I don t.  You re the reason 
                  we had to put up all these stupid 
                  signs.

    Sue gestures to a banner;  DON T LET A TEACHER GIVE YOU AN 
     F : It won t be a great time, When you end up on Dateline. 

                                HELEN
                  Okay!  I m sorry!  I flirted a little 
                  bit with a student!  I was going to 
                  surprise him.

                                SUE
                  You spent three days in his locker!                                                                                    25


                                HELEN
                  Well, obviously that wasn t my 
                  original plan.


                                HELEN
                  Besides, he s in his twenties.  I 
                  think his son goes here!

                                SUE
                  Just find the capsule.  I thought you 
                  were going to ask Happy to help you.

                                HELEN
                  I did.  He started digging a hole 
                  with a backhoe and I haven't seen him 
                  since.  He's just making one giant 
                  hole.  God knows where he is now.


    Helen is there with Sue.

                                HELEN
                  I have no idea where he is now.

                                SUE
                  Probably half way to that vulnerable 
                  chemical plant down the hill.

                                HELEN
                  Boy for a Mexican he sure can dig a 
                  bunker.


    The game is underway and not going well.  Sue approaches 
    Helen, who is feverishly digging.                                                                                    29


                                SUE
                  Helen, you know that if you'd like to 
                  take a break and watch the game I'd 
                  be happy to let you stay late and get 
                  back to the digging.

    Helen looks up from her latest pit.  She's muddy and loving 
    it. 

                                HELEN
                  I've never felt more alive! 

                                SUE
                  Oh, great.  Well, then keep up the 
                  digging.

    ANGLE ON Stuart: who has arrived and spots Willard who is 
    keeping a low profile out of the view of the students.  Stuart 
    waves him over.  Willard nervously waves him off - pointing to 
    Sue nearby.  Stuart waves him over again.  Willard shakes his 
    head and indicates "no".  Stuart calls out.

                                STUART
                      Deutschebog!Willard!  Come over 
                  here!  Willard Deutschebog!Willard 
                    Deutschebogthe German teacher!

    We hear a murmur from the students.  Willard rushes out to 
    keep Stuart from drawing more attention.

                                WILLARD
                  What.

                                STUART
                  Mission accomplished.

                                WILLARD
                  Great.

    Willard starts off.

                                STUART
                  I got rid of that "package" we talked 
                  about.

                                WILLARD
                  Wonderful.

    Willard starts off again.

                                STUART
                  They'll never find it in a hundred 
                  years.

    Stuart raises his hands to high five, but Willard s gone. 

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  (calling after)  Um...you're welcome 
                  for hiding your porno, Willard!

    Stuart storms off in a huff.  Willard looks up, concerned.                                                                                    30


    ANGLE ON: Students in the stands.  They begin chanting in 
    unison;

                                STUDENTS
                  Porno!  Porno!  Porno!  Porno!

    Amid the chanting, Willard notices Sue approaching.  Trying to 
    cover up the situation, Willard joins in the chanting, but 
    slowly changes the stress on the chant.

                                WILLARD
                  Porno! Porn-no! Porn! No Porn!  No 
                  Porn!  No Porn!  ( notices  Sue) Oh, 
                  hi, Sue.  Never too early to keep the 
                  kids away from the horrors of 
                  pornography.

                                SUE
                  I see.  Well, keep up the weird work.

    ANGLE ON Larry, watching his athletes play football in the 
    extreme foreground.  

                                LARRY
                  Come on guys, don't let the hunger 
                  get to you.   The score is tied.  We 
                  can win this thing.

    A HOT DOG VENDOR passes by.

                                HOT DOG VENDOR
                  Hot dogs!  Moist hot delicious hot 
                  Hot Dogs.

    ANGLE ON: Football field.  The RED HAIRED MAN is about to 
    release the football, but, famished, looks up to hot dog 
    vender instead.  He is immediately and brutally tackled.

    ANGLE ON: Stuart approaches Larry.  

                                LARRY
                  Oh, come on.  Don't look over here!

                                STUART
                  Yeah, look at the other guy!  Now 
                  look over here!  Now tell him how you 
                  feelabout him. 

    Stuart stifles a cry. 

                                LARRY
                  Maybe, I should have given them the 
                  steroids.  They just didn't seem to 
                  work for you.

                                STUART
                  Well, maybe they just need a little 
                    encouragement.  A little support.  
                  You shouldn't be afraid to show them 
                  your feminine side.                                                                                    31


    Stuart takes off his jacket and it becomes clear that he has 
    developed female breasts which are visible through his shirt.  
    Larry notices.  Stuart hasn't.

                                LARRY
                  Right.

                                STUART
                  We've all got a feminine side, you 
                  know.

                                LARRY
                  I've heard that said.

    ANGLE ON: Andrew coaching a few listless and lethargic 
    cheerleaders -- a few sneeze.

                                ANDREW
                  Come on, what's the matter with you?  
                  We're in the final moments of the 
                  game here. (offsneeze) And that s 
                  enough with the sneezing!  What, did 
                  no one get their flu shots?  

    A CHEERLEADER passes out.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  All right, I'm going to show these 
                  students what rallying really is.  
                  And I just might show "assistant 
                  coach" Stuart while I'm at it.

    Andrew struts out to the foot of the stands.  He stands stock 
    still for a moment, arms at his sides, then.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  Hit it!

    We hear a click and then the sounds of a radio Announcer.

                                RADIO ANNOUNCER
                  Head on, apply directly to the 
                  forehead!  Head on, apply directly to 
                  the forehead!  Head on...

    Andrew commences a funky dance.  

                                ANDREW
                  (to self) Come on, notice me. Notice 
                  me!

    The students stare off at something in the distance.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  What... What's everybody looking at.

    Andrew looks over to see Stuart, who has grabbed a megaphone 
    and is calling to the crowd.                                                                                    32


                                STUART
                  Come on, guys.  Let's show the boys 
                  what we think of them.  Jump up and 
                  down, everybody!

    Stuart jumps up and down, his new breasts freely swinging.

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Let's shake those shoulders people!

    The crowd is in shock.  Stuart shakes his shoulders now in 
    SLOW MOTION.

                                ANDREW
                  Well, I can t compete with that.  
                  (then)  But I can ask it out.

    Andrew crosses off to do so. 

    ANGLE ON: Football field.  An OPPOSING ATHLETE is distracted 
    by Stuart s energetic pendulousness.  He drops the ball and a 
    red haired Baiter scoops it up and runs the ball the other 
    way.

                                LARRY
                  It's working, Stuart.  We've got the 
                  ball.  We could win this!

    The Baiter tears down field with the ball.  The teachers cheer 
    and hoot.  They're going to win!

    Suddenly the Red Haired Man drops deep into a sinkhole, and 
    the football scatters.  The OPPOSING ATHLETE grabs the ball 
    and now takes it all the way to the other end of the field.

    Happy peers out from the hole.

                      HAPPYTRANSLATOR
    Melema bis  a-aba sho kar ma-(dispassionate) I still remain 
    he-ofa... Sha-vach!in the arena of thethe *
                                                  infidels.  Defecation.

    Happy crosses off, unhappy.

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  We don't have a chance.  There's no 
                  one on the field to stop them.

    Suddenly, and seemingly from nowhere, an over-vitalized Helen 
    charges at the opposing athlete and tackles him on the five 
    yard line.  The whistle blows.  The game is over.

    All the teachers join in the celebration.  Stuart leaps as 
    Happy passes.  

                                HAPPY
                  (broken English)  Nice breast.

                                STUART
                  That s odd.  (then)  I guess  breast  
                  is Spanish for  ass.                                                                                     33


    Back to the celebration.  All are chanting  We won!  We won! 

                                LARRY
                  We won!  We won!


    Sue is addressing the faculty.  Helen is absent.

                                SUE
                  No, it turns out we lost.  Apparently 
                  there's some sort of State athletic 
                  standard that disallows game winning 
                  tackles by school librarians.  

                                LARRY
                  I was actually surprised to see that 
                  had come up before. 

                                ANDREW
                  This was my fault.  I should have 
                  done more work with the cheerleaders.

                                LARRY
                  It wasn't your fault, Andrew.  If 
                  anything it was that moron Miracle's 
                  fault with her thick-headed famine.

    Miracle hangs her head ashamed.  Larry mouths "I love you."

                                STUART
                  Besides Andrew, you did a great job.  
                  You know how kids are.  They don't 
                  want quality dance.  At that age they 
                  just want to stare at my heaving 
                  breasts.  (then)  Well, these are 
                  new. 

                                SUE
                  Yes, I think I've gotten to the 
                  bottom of this.  It seems Miracle 
                  misidentified some pills that Stuart 
                  was taking as steroids, when, in 
                  fact, they were female hormone 
                  replacements.

                                MIRACLE
                  That's the word I was looking for.

                                SUE
                  Of course we still don't know who 
                  they belonged to.  And we certainly 
                  don't want to embarrass anyone.

    Helen enters covered in mud holding a bound package.

                                HELEN
                  I found the time capsule!

    The Teachers cheer as Helen starts cutting it open.                                                                                    34


                                SUE
                  Nice job, Helen.  Oh, by the way, 
                  when you were crouching in that boys 
                  locker you left your hormone 
                  replacement pills.

                                HELEN
                  Oh, yeah...I stopped taking those.  
                  (then)  I guess that explains my 
                  recent love of tackling and digging.

                                STUART
                  So, if I stop taking the pills these 
                  hideous breasts will go away?

                                SUE
                  I assume so.

    A moment as Stuart thinks about this.  Then proudly decides;

                                STUART
                  Then I'm going to stop taking them.

    Sue rolls her eyes.  Helen has unwrapped the package.

                                HELEN
                  I give you, the time capsule.

    Applause as Sue reaches in and pulls out some magazines.  She 
    reads the titles, appalled.

                                SUE
                  "Pacific Rim?"..."The Knob 
                      Hobbyist?"..."Spurts Illustrated?"

                                STUART
                  Wow.  I can't believe you found that 
                  so quickly.  I just had Happy bury 
                  all that pornography yesterday for 
                  Willard.

    All eyes turn to a feebly defensive Willard.

                                WILLARD
                  Actually, "Pacific Rim" is a cooking 
                  magazine.

                                SUE
                  Oh, Willard.  You poor lonely man.  
                  (then)  You're fired.

    Willard is devastated.  He looks to Stuart.  Stuart winks.

                                  END OF ACT THREE
