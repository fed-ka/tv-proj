SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
The platform is crowded with business commuters.
Joel is
among them.
He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.
The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.
He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.
Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.
Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.
Joel talks on a phone.
The wind howls around him.
He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.
JOEL
Hi, Cindy.
Joel.
Listen, I'm not
feeling well this morning.
No.
Food
poisoning, I think.
Sorry it took me so
long to call in, but I've been vomiting.
Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.
He
passes an old man with a metal detector.
They nod at each
other.
Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.
Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.
He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.
JOEL
January 13th, 2006.
Today I skipped work
and took the train out to Montauk.
(thinks)
It's cold.
(thinks some more)
The sky is gray.
(thinks some more)
I don't know what else to say.
Nothing
happens.
Nothing changes.
I saw Naomi
last night.
We had sex.
It was weird to
fall into our old familiar sex life so
easily.
Like no time has passed.
After
two years apart suddenly we're talking
about getting together again.
I guess
that's good.
He has no other thoughts.
He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.
She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.
It's Clementine.
He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.
Once she passed, he watches her walk away.
She
stops and stares out at the ocean.
Joel writes.
JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If I'm constitutionally incapable of
making eye-contact with a woman I don't
know.
I guess I'd better get back to
Naomi.
Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.
He peeks cautiously in a dark window.
Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.
Joel stares out at the ocean.
Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.
Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.
Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.
Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.
He waves back, embarrassed.
She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.
Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.
The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.
He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.
There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.
He gets in.
Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.
There are two dark figures inside.
VOICE-OVER
Them.
He hurries inside the building.
Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.
He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.
He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.
Joel looks for an address.
Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.
It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.
Joel wanders it.
In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.
It's lonely.
PATRICK'S VOICE
See, remember that girl?
The one we did
last week?
The one with the potatoes?
Joel looks up, startled.
STAN'S VOICE
Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.
Was.
On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.
PATRICK'S VOICE
I know.
It's not like... I mean, they
were clean and all.
STAN'S VOICE
Look, just don't tell me this stuff.
I
don't want to know this shit.
PATRICK'S VOICE
Yeah, okay.
STAN'S VOICE
We have work to do.
There's a click and Joel finds himself in --
Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.
They barely look
at the animals.
Clementine watches parents with babies.
JOEL
Oh shit.
I remember this.
(to Clementine)
Want to go?
CLEMENTINE
(pissy)
I want to have a baby.
JOEL
Let's talk about it later.
CLEMENTINE
No.
I want to have a baby.
I have to
have a baby.
JOEL
I don't think we're ready.
CLEMENTINE
You're not ready.
JOEL
Clementine, do you really think you could
take care of a kid?
She turns violently toward him, glaring.
CLEMENTINE
What?!
JOEL
(mumbly)
I don't want to talk about this here.
CLEMENTINE
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Joel looks around.
People are watching.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
You can't fucking say something like that
and say you don't want to talk about it!
JOEL
Clem, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have --
CLEMENTINE
(screaming now)
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love
children!
I'm creative and smart and I'd
make a fucking good mother!
The scene starts to fade.
Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.
JOEL
Oh, thank God.
It's going.
CLEMENTINE
It's you!
It's you who can't commit to
anything!
You have no idea how lucky you
are I'm interested in you!
I don't even
know why I am!
I should just end it
right here, Joel.
Leave you in the zoo.
Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
out with!
She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.
The scene is a husk.
JOEL
It's going, Clementine.
All the crap and
hurt and disappointment.
It's all being
wiped away.
She looks up at him.
CLEMENTINE
I'm glad.
Their eyes lock.
She is fading before his eyes.
JOEL
Me, too.
Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.
Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.
They look up at the stars.
JOEL
...die right now, Clem.
I'm just...
happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm
just exactly where I want to be.
Clementine looks over at him.
Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.
Then they get vague.
The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.
JOEL (CONT'D)
Clem, no!
This can't keep happening.
Please!
Oh, fuck!
Please!
Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.
He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.
MIERZWIAK
We can help you through this.
Why don't
you start now by telling me everything
you can remember about --
JOEL
You have to stop this!
MIERZWIAK
What?
What do you mean?
JOEL
I'm trapped in my head and everything I
love is being erased!
Stop it now!
MIERZWIAK
Yes, but... I'm just something you're
imagining.
What can I do?
I'm in your
head, too.
Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.
CLEMENTINE
Such a beautiful view.
JOEL
(looking at her)
Yes indeed.
(snapping out of memory)
Fuck!
They're erasing you, Clem!
CLEMENTINE
Oh?
JOEL
I hired them to.
We're in my brain.
But
I want it to stop, before I wake up and
don't know you anymore.
CLEMENTINE
Wow.
Um, well... can't you just force
yourself awake?
JOEL
I don't know.
He concentrates.
Nothing happens.
JOEL (CONT'D)
Aaargh!
It's horrible!
I'm trapped!
He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.
But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.
Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.
Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.
CLEMENTINE
Look at you, cutey!
What are we doing?
JOEL
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
shit out of me.
VOICE-OVER
I'm terrified.
I thought if I hung
around the art room long enough, he'd go
home and I could get my bike.
They head toward the bike rack.
Joel's is the only bike
remaining.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Poor Joel.
They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.
JOE EARLY
Hi, Jill.
JOEL
He calls me Jill.
Everyone calls me Jill
after this.
The other kids laughs.
JOEL
Just shut up, Joe.
I'm going home.
JOE EARLY
I don't think so.
We're fighting.
JOEL
I don't want to fight you.
The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."
Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.
joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.
JOE EARLY
C'mon, Jill.
Get up, faggot.
C'mon.
Joel doesn't say anything.
He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.
She's watching him.
She's got a tear in her
eye.
She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.
JOEL
I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
When I tell people this story I leave
that part out.
The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.
It's cold.
Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.
She
points at a house up the beach.
CLEMENTINE
Our house!
Our house!
She runs ahead, laughing.
The scene is decaying.
Joel
chases after her.
JOEL
Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
Remember?
He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:
Joel is one of a group of five year olds.
He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.
The other
boys are goading him.
BOYS
C'mon, Joel, you have to.
Do it already.
Joel doesn't want to.
Clementine watches.
JOEL
I can't.
I have to go home.
I'll do it
later.
VOICE-OVER
I didn't want to do this.
But I had to
or they would've called me a girl.
Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.
The
kids hoot.
VOICE-OVER
I can't believe I did that.
I'm so
ashamed.
A live bird watches from a tree.
Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.
The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.
CLEMENTINE
It's okay.
You were a little kid.
(beat)
This is a great birthday present.
Getting to see you as a boy.
She kisses him and they walk holding hands.
JOEL
(pointing)
That's where I live.
Lived.
Joel looks down at her hand.
It's fading.
The bracelet is
gone.
Clementine is gone.
His childhood house is gone.
Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.
He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.
He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.
They're talking as Howard works.
It
appears to be a very serious discussion.
A car pulls up
outside.
Stan turns to see.
A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.
Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.
The
woman in the window is transfixed.
As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.
Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.
The woman is at her car.
Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.
MIERZWIAK
Hollis!
Hollis!
HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
I knew it, Howard.
I don't even know why
I bothered to copy the damn address.
MIERZWIAK
It didn't start out to be this.
I came
here to work.
It's a one-time mistake.
Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.
Hollis is in her car.
MARY
(heroically)
Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.
And it's not
Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.
I'm a stupid
little girl with a stupid little crush.
I basically forced him into it.
I swear.
Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.
HOLLIS
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the
girl.
Stan is out of the van now, listening.
Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.
There's a long silence.
Then:
MARY
Tell me what?
Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.
Mary looks back and
forth between them.
Hollis starts her car.
HOLLIS
Poor kid.
You can have him.
You did.
She drives off.
Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.
MARY
What, Howard?
MIERZWIAK
We... have a history.
I'm sorry.
You
wanted the procedure.
You wanted it
done... to get past.
I have to finish in
there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk
later.
He shuffles inside.
Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.
Stan watches.
STAN
Let me take you home.
Mary shakes her head "no."
She walks off, dazed.
Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.
PATRICK
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just
happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm
just exactly where I want to be.
Clementine looks over at him.
Their eyes meet.
She sobs.
CLEMENTINE
I want to go home.
She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.
Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.
Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.
CLEMENTINE
I love this book, Joel.
Thank you so
much for telling me about it.
Joel is his father.
The father is drunk and sullen.
He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.
FATHER
Don't be like me, son.
Don't waste your
life.
You'll come to a point someday
where it'll be too late.
You'll be sewn
into your fate...
JOEL
It was horrifying, seeing my father like
that.
There was no hope for me if his life was
such a failure.
And he saw failure in
me, too, written in my future.
Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Joel, you're not sewn in.
He's wrong.
FATHER
...and there'll be nowhere to go except
where you're headed, like a train on a
track.
Inevitable, unalterable.
The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.
Joel walks with Naomi.
NAOMI
So what's going on, Joel?
JOEL
I don't know, I've just been thinking,
maybe we're not happy with each other.
NAOMI
What?
JOEL
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
of, unhappy with each other and --
NAOMI
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
JOEL
I think maybe, we're both so used to
operating at this level that -- How can
one person be unhappy?
If one person is
unhappy, both have to be... by
definition.
NAOMI
Bullshit.
Who is it?
You met someone.
JOEL
No.
I just need some space, maybe.
NAOMI
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
think you have with this chick, once the
thrill wears off, you're just going to be
Joel with the same fucking problems.
JOEL
It's not somebody else.
VOICE-OVER
I hate myself.
Naomi walks off.
Joel watches her.
The scene fades.
Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.
Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.
CARRIE
Is this the right way?
Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.
People and music can be heard.
Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.
People warm themselves at the fire.
Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.
JOEL
You were down by the surf.
I could just
make you out in the dark.
Joel looks down to the water.
There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.
JOEL (CONT'D)
Your back to me.
In that orange
sweatshirt I would come to know so well
and even hate eventually.
At the time I
thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
VOICE-OVER
I remember being drawn to you even then.
I thought, I love this woman because
she's alone down there looking out at the
black ocean.
JOEL (CONT'D)
But I went back to my food.
The next
thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
out of the corner of my eye.
A shot of the orange sleeve.
Joel looks up.
CLEMENTINE
Hi there.
JOEL
Hi.
VOICE-OVER
I was so nervous.
What were you doing
there, I wondered.
Your hair was lime
green.
Green revolution.
A shot of her green hair.
JOEL
You said...
CLEMENTINE
I saw you sitting over here.
By
yourself.
I thought, thank God, someone
normal, who doesn't know how interact at
these things either.
JOEL
Yeah.
I don't ever know what to say.
CLEMENTINE
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
that.
I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
such a loser.
Every time I come to a
party I tell myself I'm going to be
different and it's always exactly the
same and then I hate myself after for
being such a clod.
JOEL
Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
I thought how could you be talking to me
if you couldn't talk to people?
VOICE-OVER
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
was cool that you were sensitive enough
to know what I was feeling and that you
were attracted to it.
CLEMENTINE
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
ones, y'know?
I mean, what kind of
people do well at this stuff?
VOICE-OVER
And I just liked you so much.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
You did?
You liked me?
JOEL
You know what I did.
CLEMENTINE
Yeah, I know.
I'm fishing.
JOEL
You said --
She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.
CLEMENTINE
I'm Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece of
your chicken?
JOEL
And you picked it out of my plate before
I could answer and it felt so intimate
like we were already lovers.
JOEL (CONT'D)
I remember --
VOICE-OVER
The grease on your chin in the bonfire
light.
Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.
CLEMENTINE
Oh God, how horrid.
JOEL
I'm Joel.
VOICE-OVER
No, it was lovely.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Hi, Joel.
So no jokes about my name?
JOEL
You mean, like...
(singing)
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
darlin', Clementine... ?
Huckleberry
Hound?
That sort of thing?
CLEMENTINE
Yeah, like that.
JOEL
Nope.
No jokes.
My favorite thing when
I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
doll.
I think your name is magic.
She smiles.
CLEMENTINE
(eyes welling)
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone
soon.
JOEL
I know.
CLEMENTINE
What do we do?
JOEL
Enjoy it.
Say good-bye.
She nods.
Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.
JOEL (CONT'D)
So you're still on the Zoloft?
VOICE-OVER
Next thing I remember we were walking
down near the surf.
CLEMENTINE
No, I stopped.
I didn't want to feel
like I was being artificially modulated.
JOEL
I know what you mean.
That's why I
stopped.
CLEMENTINE
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
JOEL
I don't think I've slept in a year.
CLEMENTINE
You should try Xanax.
I mean, it's a
chemical and all, but it works... and it
works just having it around, knowing that
it's there.
Like insurance.
JOEL
yeah?
CLEMENTINE
I'll give you a couple.
See what you
think.
JOEL
Okay.
CLEMENTINE
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
JOEL
I love her.
CLEMENTINE
Really?
Me, too!
I don't meet people
who even know who she is and I work in a
book store.
JOEL
I think she's great.
CLEMENTINE
Me too.
There's this poem --
JOEL
Did this conversation come before or
after we saw the house?
CLEMENTINE
I think, before.
JOEL
Seems too coincidental that way.
CLEMENTINE
Yeah, maybe.
Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
don't live...
JOEL
Yeah, yeah.
It goes "Perhaps there is
someone in this world to whom I could
send all these lines"?
CLEMENTINE
Yes!
I love that poem.
It breaks my
heart.
I'm so excited you know it.
(pointing to houses)
Look, houses in which we don't live.
Joel chuckles appreciatively.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
I wish we did.
You married?
JOEL
Um, no.
CLEMENTINE
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.
Joel
is nervous.
JOEL
I do sort of live with somebody though.
CLEMENTINE
Oh.
She walks to the next house, tries the door.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Male or female?
JOEL
Female.
CLEMENTINE
At least I haven't been barking up the
wrong tree.
She finds a window that's unlatched.
She lifts it.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
Cool.
JOEL
What are you doing?
CLEMENTINE
It's freezing out here.
She scrambles in the window.
Joel looks around, panicked.
JOEL
(whisper)
Clementine.
VOICE-OVER
I couldn't believe you did that.
I was
paralyzed with fear.
The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
C'mon, man.
The water's fine.
Nobody's
coming here tonight, believe me.
This
place is closed up.
Electricity's off.
JOEL
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
CLEMENTINE
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
He walks cautiously toward the door.
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
As soon as you walked in.
I knew I had
you.
You knew I knew that, right?
Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.
This scene,
too, is disintegrating.
It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.
Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
of the van.
He and Howard look at each other.
STAN
So, I've got to drop the van off.
MIERZWIAK
Thanks, Stan.
Thanks.
Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna."
He gets out,
crosses to his car.
Mary is sitting on the hood.
STAN
Hey.
MARY
(beat)
Do you swear you didn't know?
STAN
I swear.
MARY
And you never even suspected?
Never saw
us behaving in any unusual way together?
STAN
Once, maybe.
She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.
STAN (CONT'D)
It was here.
At his car.
I was coming
back from a job and spotted you together.
You seemed caught.
I waved.
You
giggled.
MARY
How did I look?
STAN
(beat)
Happy.
Happy with a secret.
Mary starts to cry.
MARY
And after that?
STAN
I never saw you together like that again.
So I figured I was imagining things.
Mary says nothing.
STAN (CONT'D)
I really like you, Mary.
You know that.
MARY
Do you remember anything else?
What I
was wearing?
Was I standing close to
him?
Was I leaning against his car like
I owned it?
How did he look at me when I
giggled?
Tell me everything.
STAN
(thinking)
You were in red.
That red sweater with
the little flowers, I think.
You were
leaning against his car.
(thinking)
He looked a little like a kid.
Kind of
goofy and wide-eyed.
I'd never seen him
look like that before.
Happy.
You
looked beautiful.
You looked in love.
MARY
(heading toward the levator)
Thanks, Stan.
She stops but doesn't turn to face him.
MARY (CONT'D)
You're nice.
(beat)
But I love him.
I knew I loved him.
Now
I know.
He nods.
She waves, heads to the elevator.
Joel waits on the crowded platform.
The platform across the
tracks is empty.
Joel's train arrives.
It's packed.
He
squeezes on with all the other commuters.
The platform is crowded with business commuters.
Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.
Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.
He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.
An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.
Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.
Clementine steps out onto it.
Joel follows nervously.
CLEMENTINE
Don't worry.
It's really solid this time
of year.
JOEL
I don't know.
She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.
JOEL (CONT'D)
This is so beautiful.
She squeezes his hand.
CLEMENTINE
Isn't it?
She runs and slides on the ice.
Joel is by himself now.
JOEL
I don't know.
What if it breaks?
CLEMENTINE
What if?
Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.
Joel
is paralyzed.
He looks back at the shore.
JOEL
I think I should go back.
CLEMENTINE
Joel, come here.
Please.
He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.
She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.
He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.
He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.
She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.
She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.
JOEL
Listen, did you want to make love?
CLEMENTINE
Make love?
JOEL
Have sex.
Y'know --
CLEMENTINE
Oh, um...
JOEL
Because I just am not drunk enough or
stoned enough to make that happen right
now.
CLEMENTINE
That's okay.
I --
JOEL
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to say that.
This seems like the perfect romantic
exotic place to do it and --
CLEMENTINE
Hey, Joel --
JOEL
-- and I'm just too nervous around you
right now.
CLEMENTINE
I'm nervous, too.
JOEL
Yeah?
I wouldn't have thought that.
CLEMENTINE
Well, you obviously don't know me.
JOEL
I'm nervous because I have and enormous
crush on you.
She smiles up at the sky.
CLEMENTINE
Show me which constellations you know.
MONTAGE
We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.
One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.
We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.
Joel drops Clementine off.
She kisses him.
Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
I was by myself in the park because my
friend Davia was sick that day.
I was on
a swing.
There was this smiling man
walking a little bushy dog --
Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
The man said something like, "He's
friendly --"
Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
woman's.
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
"-- he won't bite."
MAN
He won't bite.
You can pet him if you
want...
Shot of the girl petting the dog.
MAN
Do you want to give him a biscuit?
The girl nods.
MAN (CONT'D)
They're in my car.
Why don't you --
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE
Excuse me?
Hello?
