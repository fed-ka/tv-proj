The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
breakfast.

had been through several foster
families.
The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
crap out of him.

Thirty eight, all told.

CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER
"Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
"MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".

Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-

BLOOM
You shuffle when you're thinking
something through. So whatcha
thinking?
STEPHEN
Not a thing.
NARRATOR
This wasn't really true.
Cause in the root of Stephen's
psyche, something now began.
A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
A tale.

BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a
hardware store, pointing. A flashlight, snow boots and
several large coolers are purchased.

BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.

Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:
Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
coolers"
Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.
STEPHEN
Oh - kay. How's it going on the
playground front?
BLOOM
It's great.
STEPHEN
So, on to step eleven, then.
The
Tale. You tell them -
BLOOM
Wait...
Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.
NARRATOR
Must the numbers rattle on?
Must
the fiction end?
BLOOM
I think I need more time to win
their-
STEPHEN
Bloom. They're not your friends.
They're part of this, and this aint
real. Remember, it's a con.
And when it's done, we've just got
us. And we'll be moving on.

So, the tale. You tell them
there's a

Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic
BLOOM
...with blood red eyes?
STEPHEN
(nods)
That's good. He stopped you coming
home from school...

26
STEPHEN
...if you can keep up...
27
28
STEPHEN
Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
He got this greedy glinting look,
the filthy red-eyed leech... and
said he'd tell for thirty bucks.
Something in Bloom's face falls.

In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
children come into sight.
NARRATOR
They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
There it was.
32
33
The light glows just around the next corner... the children
run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
corner...
And the light glows just around the next corner. They
scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
but they're all having the time of their lives.
Bloom included.
Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
of wonder.

NARRATOR
For just one moment, Bloom forgot
himself and ran too fast.
He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
He'd catch the light and find the
treasure...
Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
next corner.
Bloom stops running.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
But the moment passed.
The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
still, a strange expression on his face.
The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
her hand for him to follow.
But he doesn't.
He stays behind, and is soon left alone.

Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
sunlight.
NARRATOR
A bitter ending? Maybe. But
there's sweetness in the mix.
Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.
On it, the con
flow-chart. Numbered boxes.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
The brothers Bloom had found their
calling.
One of the boxes... number six...
NARRATOR (cont'd)
As shown in number six.
BOX #6:
"Cut % O'Henry's"

`Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'

Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.
TITLE CARD:
BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER
A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
the flaming books.
YOUNG MAN
He gets the scarab, you get the
money, I get the girl... so in the
end, everyone gets everything he
wants.
Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
young man folds to the ground.
A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.
VOICE (O.S.)
Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
are you... oh god he's dead,
Victor's dead... you've killed us!
We had it he was right it was all
in the bag and now we're dead, why?
Why, you stupid son of a bitch?
The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
hard.

CONTINUED:

CHARLESTON
Cause the Turk was right. After
seeing her, after that night on the
airstrip, after Cairo everything
changed, and he couldn't see the
play through that one milky eye,
but the Turk was right about one
thing, that there's nothing
beautiful about money. She's
beautiful.
MCGUIRE
This isn't happening...
CHARLESTON
He'll never have her now. She's
free. And I'll never see her in
scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
but it's worth the money and my job
and his life and the rest of my
life that she's free.
MCGUIRE
Charleston. I can't be here...
CHARLESTON
You're not here. Neither of us
are. It's Mowcher's gun.
MCGUIRE
Mowcher is at the bottom of the
Spree with a cowl in his neck!
Charleston gets to his feet.
CHARLESTON
They won't find him for a week, and
the Albino will chalk it up to
Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.
MCGUIRE
Listen to you - four months ago you
were an investment banker! Now
you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
The money's gone. It'll rot in the
Peruvian earth. It's gone.
Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.

CONTINUED: (2)

CHARLESTON
The man named Charleston you met
nine months and a thousand years
ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
dead. If we see each other again
it'll be as strangers. As for the
money... let it rot.
He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
squealing.
Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.
MCGUIRE
Wow.
He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.
MCGUIRE (cont'd)
Wow is the word you're both looking
for. Wow.
The Asian woman nods slightly.
VICTOR
(un-wowishly)
You're a genius, Stephen.
For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.
STEPHEN
We're a genius, Bloom.
Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.
He spits.
BLOOM
Tastes like tin foil.
STEPHEN
So does real blood. Buy you a
drink.
Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
lip.

43
A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
expectant in a surprise-party type way.
A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.
THE TURK
Make way, make room for the
brothers Bloom!
The bar bursts into cheers.
44
44
A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.
THE TURK
Nine months, six countries, three
faked deaths, for one mark. You're
a beautiful antique, my friend.
They clink glasses.
ALL
Proust.

CONTINUED:
44
THE TURK
One thing baffles me. The entire
con would have fallen apart if
Charleston had walked away. How did
you know he'd pull the trigger?
Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.
STEPHEN
Just think of any card.
Got one?
Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.
THE TURK
No.
Stephen shrugs.
STEPHEN
But if I do it enough, eventually
it'll work on someone. And then
it'll be the best card trick in the
world.
Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Ante up.
THE TURK
It's true you never work with the
same crew twice?
STEPHEN
That's true.
THE TURK
Well shit.
Except for the uh, for
her?
STEPHEN
La Chinoise?
THE TURK
Yeah.
Back at the bar - the Asian woman.
The CHINK.
Being hit on
by a weasly ROMANIAN.
ROMANIAN
Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.
19
44
CONTINUED: (2)
44
She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.
STEPHEN
Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
ins and the outs, and so far as I
can tell, speaks three words of
English.
She taps on the bar.
THE CHINK
Jameson.
BARTENDER
Ice?
She says `no' with a look.
THE ALBINO
So she's with you and Bloom till
the end.
STEPHEN
Just till the wind changes.
Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.
She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
bullet bouncing off her.
THE TURK
Where is Bloom?
In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
with a queen of hearts he can't play.
A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
through the curtains.
ROSE
There you are. Hiding?
BLOOM
Yeah.
ROSE
I've been learning.
Stephen likes
to talk about you.
BLOOM
Did he tell you the cave story?
20
44
CONTINUED: (3)
44
ROSE
Is it true?
BLOOM
What else did he tell you?
ROSE
I'm not going to tell it as good as
Stephen. You two kicked around
till your early teens, then stowed
away on a merchant marine freighter
and ended up in St. Petersburg,
where you spent five years under
the tutelage of a shadowy old
swindler named the Diamond Dog.
And he was your Fagin and Stephen
was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
suddenly and badly.
BLOOM
Stephen took his eye out with an
antique rapier.
ROSE
Why did he do that?
BLOOM
And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
on their own to make their fortune
as gentleman thieves. Sounds
romantic.
ROSE
It does.
She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
kiss.
Bloom's eyes stay open.
BLOOM
You want to know how Stephen did
it? With Charleston?
ROSE
It's not the first thing on my
mind.
21
45
45
A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.
BLOOM (O.S.)
He positioned me in the same spot
where, seven years ago,
Charleston's wife stood and told
him she was leaving.
The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
He chose my outfit to mirror her
suit.
Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
Wife's outfit.
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
He even phonetically matched my
final words to hers.
WIFE
This is the end. Charelston, you've
always been a dunce.
Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.
BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
So in the end, everyone gets
everything he wants.
BANG.
46
46
BLOOM
That's what he does, he writes his
cons the way dead Russians write
novels, with thematic arcs and
imbedded symbolism and shit. And
he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
hero. And that's why you think you
want to kiss me. It's a con.
He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
towards the exit, passing Stephen.
22
46
CONTINUED:
46
BLOOM (cont'd)
I need air.
STEPHEN
Who doesn't?
(plays a card)
That's the big 2.
47
51
Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.
A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.
Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.
A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.
STEPHEN
She's right, you know.
BLOOM
Why are you here, Stephen?
STEPHEN
Put on your face, let's eat.
52
57
Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
back of a chair.
Bloom holds the con flowchart.
STEPHEN
...and so that's how it ends, in
Mexico, a burst of violence then a
moment of truth on the beach. What
do you think?
Bloom idly looks over the chart.
BLOOM
You've got something up your
sleeve. This is about me, right?
Somehow.
STEPHEN
This might not be something you
know, but they've all been about
you. Maybe that's why they've none
of them been perfect, I've never
been able to give you what you
really want.
31
57
CONTINUED:
57
BLOOM
I want to be outta all this. So by
definition, this is not going to
give me what I want.
Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.
BLOOM (cont'd)
This will be the last one.
You'll
let me go.
The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
feet, silently going to Stephen's side.
STEPHEN
I will never approach you to do
another con again.
(to the Chink)
Let's make it a red Schwinn.
Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."
58
60
Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
forward.
Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes
PENELOPE
Are you alright?
61
61
Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.
STEPHEN
The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
I know, thank you - in her report,
I missed it. This is actually kind
of great, I'll tell you why.
The Chink lights a cigarette.
BLOOM
You missed it?
STEPHEN
Dostoevsky was an epileptic.
BLOOM
I know.
STEPHEN
His seizures were preceded by an
enlightened euphoria, a sort of
opening of his spiritual eye.
(MORE)
34
61
CONTINUED:
61
STEPHEN (cont'd)
I think the fact that she saw your
face the instant before a seizure
is a pretty goddamn good foot to
start things out on, right?
Bloom stares blankly.
The Chink burps into her stethoscope.
62
62
Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.
BLOOM (V.O.)
The next step is to figure out a
way to insinuate yourself into
their personal life.
Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.
It is MORNING.
Penelope is shaking him.
PENELOPE
I think they took my car.
Could
you drive me home?
BLOOM
Uh.
Yeah.
She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.
PENELOPE
I'm Penelope Stamp.
BLOOM
Bloom.
63
63
Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.
BLOOM (V.O.)
Engagement. Find a connection with
your mark through conversation.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I'm sorry about your Lamborghini.
PENELOPE
S' ok.
Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.
35
63
CONTINUED:
63
BLOOM
Nice area.
(beat)
Jersey.
More silence.
PENELOPE
This car is like riding in a huge
marshmallow.
And still more silence.
BLOOM (V.O.)
Having now deftly set your hook in
the mark's psyche, this would be
the perfect time to tug the line,
64
65
Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.
This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
all again. Three or four times.
BLOOM
...didn't really have anyone except
each other growing up, and our
father was in the antique business,
he had a shop in Charleston. So we
stuck together, my brother Stephen
and me, we and just took over the
shop when dad died. Then we
realized one day, we saw the
dealers who were finding and
selling us the antiques coming from
exotic countries all over the
world, and there was a, almost a
scent they had, when they'd come in
the dusty shop we worked nine to
five in since we were nineteen, the
air would, like before a rain, the
ions would line up, and you could
just smell midnight trains to Paris
and steamer ships and Calcutta
bazaars, and we made the decision,
we just did it, that we want to
have that sort of life. So we did,
and we've been travelling and
treasure hunting the world ever
since, and could you, I'm sorry,
stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
Alright, look.
PENELOPE
I'm really bad at talking to
people.
37
65
CONTINUED:
65
BLOOM
I told you, that's alright.
You want me to go?
PENELOPE
No!
I want to talk to you.
Fuck.
She storms out.
66
66
Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.
BLOOM
So what kind of stuff do you do?
PENELOPE
Nothing.
Maybe you should go.
BLOOM
Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
coffee first.
Very slowly, he sips it.
Each sip becomes a noisier and
noisier slurp.
PENELOPE
I collect hobbies. I see someone
doing something I like, and I get
books and learn how to do it.
BLOOM
Hm.
Anything interesting?
PENELOPE
Not really.
HOBBY MONTAGE
In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
seriousness and skill for Bloom:
Playing the piano.
The classical guitar.
The fiddle.
The
banjo.
Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.
Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.
38
66

Juggling various items.
Riding a unicycle.
Juggling while
riding a unicycle.
Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.
Karate chopping through too much wood.
Breakdancing.
Playing the accordion.
Rapping to a drum machine.
Creating a perfect origami dragon.
END HOBBY MONTAGE
On Bloom's shell-shock face.
BLOOM
Is that it?
PENELOPE
No.
I know a lot of stuff.
BLOOM
You just learned this stuff, here
by yourself?
PENELOPE
Kinda sad.
BLOOM
No. So you just thought, `so I
want to learn this and this,' and
you just did it? How do you plan
to use all these skills?
PENELOPE
I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
just do stuff. Here, look at this
watermelon. It's a camera. You
can make a pinhole camera out of
anything hollowish and dark.
BLOOM
It's gotta warp the image though,
right?
39
66
CONTINUED: (2)
66
PENELOPE
No, yeah it does. That's what -
the Taj Majal taken by a fat
tourist with diarrhea and a point-
and-shoot camera can be the
flattest, dullest, "here's us at
the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go
stick our thumbs up our asses"
picture. But you can look at the
most menial everyday thing, and
depending on how your pinhole
camera eats the light, it's warped
and peculiar and imperfect. It's
not reproduction, it's
storytelling.
BLOOM
It's a lie that tells the truth.
PENELOPE
I dunno about truth. A photograph
is a secret about a secret. The
more it tells you, the less you
know.
BLOOM
What's changed between now and
twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
kinda like a conversation.
PENELOPE
Huh.
Well shit.
67
72
The brothers dress for dinner.
BLOOM
You named the Chink `Yuengling?'
STEPHEN
I was writing in a bar. And she
doesn't drink, how does she know a
Philly beer?
BLOOM
She knows a lot of stuff.
(beat)
Was that who I thought it was on
the East deck this morning?
STEPHEN
Yes it was. Did he spot you?
An ominous glance.
BLOOM
Not yet.
73
75
Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.
48
75
CONTINUED:
75
His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
marks on the stem.
Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.
76
78
Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.
BLOOM (O.S.)
A few years back, when we hit the
top of our art dealing game, she
just appeared.
A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
She's stuck with us. We figure
when she gets bored she'll vanish
with the same lack of noise.
Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.
She
drinks it without looking at him.
49
79
80
Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.
BLOOM
I know you like to throw those
clever little details in, but
you've gotta watch that shit with
her Stephen. She had a lot of time
alone in that house, and she used
it. She did the best Double Dutch
Queens I've ever seen up on the
deck last night.
STEPHEN
Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
cards.
BLOOM
She had them in her purse and cut
them in while I was folding my
napkin.
STEPHEN
Jesus.
BLOOM
That's what I'm saying. She's
different, she knows, sometimes it
feels like she knows everything.
Doesn't that worry you?
STEPHEN
No. But something about her is
worrying you plenty.
BLOOM
She feels like one of your
characters.
52

STEPHEN
The day I con you is the day I die,
Bloom.
BLOOM
I know that.

How did you get the Belgian, on our
budget?
STEPHEN
He's beautiful, right?
BLOOM
I didn't expect him to actually be
Belgian.
STEPHEN
I'm not sure he is.
I'm to bed.
Stephen stands to go, then pauses.
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I've always protected you, right?
The only real danger in this whole
play is that you'll actually fall
in love with her. Look at me.
Don't fall in love with her.

A stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table.
The Curator's hands close it gently and take it away.
56

CONTINUED:

STEPHEN (V.O.)
A book of hours.
PENELOPE (V.O.)
Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
out of me so I don't know it that
well. So that's what he does, he
makes pieces in his collections
disappear, then sells them off via
a trusted middleman.
91
95
Stephen reclines, hat on his face.
Bloom paces.
STEPHEN
Take it easy. She's having fun,
that's the point of this.
BLOOM
She's making a flag for our
"smugglers gang," man. She made me
learn a secret smugglers handshake.
Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
she was writing, in the observation
car? A letter? A journal? No.
She is getting way too into this.
Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.
On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
"Penelope the smuggler."
BLOOM (cont'd)
She's been singing the Smuggler
Song since Athens.
STEPHEN
What Smugglers Song?
59
95
CONTINUED:
95
BLOOM
You know, the one from whatsit, the
Disney thing, that Smuggler Song,
the `We're a band of smugglers hey,
la la la la la, we smuggle by night
and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho
ho, smugglers...' there, this
isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
Smuggler Song. With hand motions.
STEPHEN
The whole point of this was to
sweep her off her feet. Let her
enjoy it.
BLOOM
While it lasts.
STEPHEN
Nothing lasts.
Exit Bloom.
Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
face.
96
96
Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
ATTENDANT runs past.
A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.
Off Bloom's quizzical look:
PENELOPE
Smuggling.
From the snack car.
They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
sacks.
Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.
97
97
Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros,
while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.

BLOOM
Fourteen gins? Are you kidding me?
THE CHINK
Jameson.
BLOOM
I'm not paying for that.
She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.
ATTENDANT
Ice?
She says no with a look, they drink.
BLOOM
She made up the Smuggler Song.
The Chink nods.
Bloom pays for the Jameson.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I thought it was a Disney thing.

The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.
Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
by.
PENELOPE
Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
taken this train before?
BLOOM
Yeah.
PENELOPE
So this is all like fuckin
`whatever' to you.
BLOOM
I usually drink with the Chink in
the snack car, play cards.
PENELOPE
With the who?
61
98
CONTINUED:
98
Oops.
BLOOM
Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
smuggler nickname.
PENELOPE
That's offensive.
BLOOM
I think if it were offensive to
her, she'd let us know.
PENELOPE
Do I get a smuggler nickname?
Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
band into Penelope's luggage.
BLOOM
No.
PENELOPE
I think you're constipated.
In
your fuckin soul.
Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
before giving up.
BLOOM
What?
PENELOPE
You've got a big load of grumpy
petrified poop up your ass, I'm
just calling you out on it. Yeah
I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
you know what? I'm a fuckin
smuggler. If that's your thing,
fuckin tell it like you own it.
When you've got a spotlight in
front of your feet, man, fuckin
jump into it and dance the shit out
of it. Stop fuckin thinking so
much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
Fuck.
A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Whoa.

BLOOM
Look, I'm not-
PENELOPE
Shh.
I love thunderstorms.
Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
confused.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
ha ha ha ha.
Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
falls harder.
Penelope writhes.
Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Oh hooooooooooo ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha oh my GOD, ha whoooo.. whee...
ha... hoo. I... am... so horny.
BLOOM
Nite.
The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.
99

Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.
He
spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.
BLOOM
(playing a card)
That's the big 2.

102
STEPHEN (V.O.)
Bloom and I will secure us lodging,
The brothers set their suitcases on the beds. Bloom finds
the stack of bills in the green rubber band in his.
103
103
STEPHEN (V.O.)
Mrs. Yeungling will scout the
castle museum.
The Chink, in ridiculous tourist garb and a "PROPERTY OF KGB"
t-shirt, takes pictures with one of several cameras around
her neck.
104
105
STEPHEN (V.O.)
Only movie thugs and Russians deal
in suitcases of cash. Draw a
certified check.

CONTINUED:

A cashier hands over an elaborate check, which Penelope signs
and puts in an envelope.
106
106
A baroque spiral staircase, the spine of a high apartment
building. Our intrepid four ring the bell beside an
apartment door.
THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
Who the hell is that?! Who is it?!
STEPHEN
Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.
Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.
They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.
THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
Who the hell are you, what do you
want, who the hell!!!!??
BLOOM
STEPHEN
Max! Max! It's us, Bloom,
Max! Max! It's Stephen and
Stephen, Jesus, Max, easy,
Bloom, easy, whoa, Christ,
whoa!
whoa now!
The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
the other. He squints at them.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
Ah. Good morning. Come in. I
have been drinking.
107
107
A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
skin on his face.
THE CURATOR
Here, off the Basilica, are offices
of administration, and beneath
those, an otherwise inaccessible
section of catacombs. And the
book.
65
107
CONTINUED:
107
BLOOM
Administrative offices.
So how do
you steal the book?
THE CURATOR
The book is already stolen. The
stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
the filing, red tape. As far as
the museum is concerned, the book
does not exist. I am the curator,
I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
baboosh, put the book in a
briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
say, at two.
STEPHEN
Today.
THE CURATOR
Today is not a good day.
STEPHEN
Tomorrow. Now what about this
Argentinian.
THE CURATOR
(blank, then realizes)
Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise
Belguta Rioso. I get his file.
108
108
Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
array of beautiful paintings on the wall.
PENELOPE
Gin is slow death, man.
Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.
The
Curator strolls in.
STEPHEN
We'll see you back at the hotel.
(glances at the Curator)
Soon.
They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.

THE CURATOR
From a private collection on the
island of Ikaria. That one.
BLOOM
Who painted it?
THE CURATOR
I don't know.
PENELOPE
Why is it the last thing you see
every night, and the first thing
you see every morning?
THE CURATOR
That's a story. You have a minute?
He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
painting. Setting the stage.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
My daughter travelled with me when
she was very young, and I'd show
her the places and the art, all the
most joyous and terrifying things
in the world.
Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
sun.
THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I wanted that the world was alive
in the most fantastic way for her.
To built her a pair of wings. Make
these things real. But maybe more
than any other objet d'art, she
loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
story of the stone golem. From a
painting in a small private
collection on the island of Ikaria.
He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
images, which we move across like a picture book.
THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Well Rachel, like most monsters the
Golem was once a human. A boy,
about your age.

THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
And one day the boy was walking
home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
with a good friend of his. They
got very angry and his friend
pushed him a certain way and the
boy fell and struck his head and
died. The boy's friend was very
sad but also very frightened. So
instead of telling the boy's
parents, he did something awful.
He pulled the body into a quarry, a
pit of broken rocks, and hid the
boy beneath a pile of large stones.
Well. Years went by, and the boy's
friend became a young man, and one
day while drinking in town (which
in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
he heard that a well was being
built near the forest... with the
stones from the quarry. He ran to
the quarry to find it nearly
empty... no stones, no body. He
ran to the well where the masons
were finishing their work. `Did
they find anything strange in the
quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
hoping they'd arrest him for the
awful crime on the spot. But no,
they said, motioning to the well.
Nothing strange. Just stones.
They left him alone there at the
well, and he stood looking into it
as the sun fell behind the
mountains and twilight set the
world in a deep, still silence.
The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.
Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
that follows.
Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
pulls him back down into the depths of the well.
Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
Curator, sitting very still.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
My daughter died nineteen years ago
today. She was six. She went out
to play one afternoon and vanished.
(MORE)

108
CONTINUED: (3)
108
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
The next morning we found her, in a
stone well on a neighboring
property. I climbed down to her,
but slipped and broke my leg, and
while we waited for the rescue team
to pull us out she died in my arms.
If you've had a child... my whole
everything just focused down to one
thing, to hold her and make her
feel safe. But no matter what I
said to her, I couldn't stop her
shaking, crying. Her last moments
on this earth were filled with
terror. Of a stone golem.
He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
It was the first painting I
`acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
some night the golem will come for
me.
109
109
Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope.
THE CURATOR
Mademoiselle.
Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on
the staircase. The Curator comes out.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
It is you I do business with, yes?
PENELOPE
Right.
Oh, right.
She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.
He lets go, and smiles apologetically.
THE CURATOR
Au revoir.
69
110
111
Stephen, up in the window watching them approach.
He recedes
into the room.
112
113
Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil.
A smell breaks his concentration.
BLOOM
Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
cane.
Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.
DIAMOND DOG
Bloom. How long has it been?
(sits, orders)
Tea.
(to Bloom)
Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
long while.
BLOOM
If I call Stephen down he'll kill
you.
70
113
CONTINUED:
113
DIAMOND DOG
Well then please don't call Stephen
down. Look at you, you're
terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
a look. I'm an old man with no
depth perception. You don't have
to be scared of me.
The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
It's been a funny thing, watching
you boys take what I taught you and
eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
footnote in the lives of the
Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
The curse of all bad fathers - that
my presence on this earth after I
die will not live on the lips of
admiring men, but will sink into
the murky backwaters of my
children's psyches.
BLOOM
Is this profundity?
Cause you can
skip it.
DIAMOND DOG
Ha!
Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.
The Dog scoots next to Bloom.
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
When I first took you boys in,
showed you the ropes, haunting St.
Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
crave that youthful joy. Even
today.
The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.
There is something
horrible about this.
Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.
BLOOM
Don't touch me.
DIAMOND DOG
You probably won't believe I loved
you boys very much.
71
113
CONTINUED: (2)
113
BLOOM
You're going to take your hand away
or I'm going to break your arm,
there's nothing between.
He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.
DIAMOND DOG
But love, you know. We know, folks
like us, you can always blink and
realize that it's a fiction, and
like Peter walking on water or
Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
if you look down in doubt you'll
fall. That's the price of our
lives, the wax in our wings. One
day Stephen's going to fall. It
may be glorious, but he's going to
fall hard and he won't be there to
tell you what to do and protect
you. When he's gone, remember me.
The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.
Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-
When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
Hello Stephen.
Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
the Dog's hand.
Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
pocket.
114
116
Bloom flops into bed.
He turns and looks at the wall.
Right on the other side of it...
117
117
Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.
She closes
her eyes.
73
118
118
Bloom's breathing slows.
He closes his eyes.
A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
through the wall. Penelope snoring.
Bloom smiles slightly.
What a cute snore.
The snoring deepens slightly.
The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
dawn.
Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.
119
119
Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
step judiciously back. No response.
STEPHEN
Max?
BLOOM
We're a little early...
120
120
Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.
And totally empty.
Picked clean down to the bare walls.
The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
well... broken on the floor.
Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.
PENELOPE
The Golem came for him. In my
dream. Crawled out of the painting
and killed him in a horrible way.
74
120
CONTINUED:
120
BLOOM
Well at least he had the decency to
just skip out on us, not do
something tacky like fake his own
death.
Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.
THE CURATOR
(sotto)
You're a little early.
Bloom quickly closes it.
STEPHEN
I don't get it. If he was
hightailing it he could have waited
eight hours till we traded the
million for the book, and had some
traveling money. Well. Back to
antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
lost.
(to Penelope)
And you got to see Prague, which is
nice.
Penelope's eyes widen with realization.
PENELOPE
Oh.
BLOOM
You should stay in the city for
awhile, they have these amazing
puppet show opera things-
But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.
STEPHEN
Oh?
121
124
The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.
Penelope appreciates her.
Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.
STEPHEN
There's a smoke detector in these
empty rooms in the east tower. So
we plant and set off a tiny -
(to the Chink)
TINY tiny, tiny charge.
The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
and you'll have exactly four and a
half minutes to get through the
access hatch, into the catacombs,
get the book and get out before the
fire department arrives.
Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.
78
125
125
Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.
Going over the
floorplan one more time.
BLOOM
So straight down the corridor,
again, tell me where.
PENELOPE
Second left, third right, access
hatch behind the copier, I need to
sleeeeeeep...
BLOOM
The abort code if we need to abort
is "corned beef." For some reason.
PENELOPE
Bloom, I need to sleep.
He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
open handbag on the table.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Is this Yeungling's backpack?
BLOOM
Yeah.
She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
bomb beside the handbag.
PENELOPE
You know what I feel?
BLOOM
Horny?
PENELOPE
Scared. All my big talk.
But this
isn't a story, it's real.
Fuckin
scary.
She kisses him.
He kisses her back.
79
125
CONTINUED:
125
The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.
Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.
126
127
Bloom half wakes.
Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.
Sunlight
on her body and her sleeping face.
Distant KNOCKING.
From the next room over.
Bloom's eyes snap open.
He scampers.
128
129
He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.
STEPHEN
Ready?
130
130
The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.
131
131
Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.
132
133
An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.
134
135
The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.
136
144
Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.
Penelope
weaves through the halls.
145
145
Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.
Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
wall.
PENELOPE
I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
lips off to break into a castle in
Prague.
Revealing an access hatch.
146
146
Tiny, earthy.
Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.
Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
HOURS reverently.
147
148
Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
around her, soldiers searching the castle.
Voices right outside the hatch.
She slides the wimpy little
bolt shut. It rattles.
She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.
84
149
150
Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
bag, hangs from her teeth.
Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.
Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!
151
151
A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.
It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
through it, but exactly where that person is.
The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.
152
152
Penelope freezes.
A beat of silence.
The tin gives way, and she plummets...
153
153
...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
soldier in the head.
Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.
85
153
CONTINUED:
153
And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
plastic bag in her teeth.
She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.
Lets the bag drop
from her teeth.
And opens her mouth to speak.
154
157
Stephen bails Bloom out.
STEPHEN
An apple?
BLOOM
Yeah, but it was part of an
epiphany.
158
159
Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.
As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
two mini bottles of gin.
He kisses her.
160
160
Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
into her suitcase.
A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.
161
165
Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.
Stephen picks up the con flowchart.
STEPHEN
The last box in our last con. Let
them begin the beguine. How's it
feel?
BLOOM
She's something special, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Uh huh.
BLOOM
Can I...
He stares at his drink.
90
165
CONTINUED:
165
BLOOM (cont'd)
Can I just have a little more time?
Just a few days. I want to keep
her, like this, I don't want this
to just end. Don't make me do
this.
STEPHEN
Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
Don't be pathetic. Make you?
Jesus. I told you not to fall for
her-
BLOOM
I'm not gonna do this.
Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
in the eye. Finds his answer.
STEPHEN
I don't believe you.
He goes back to packing.
166
168
Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.
91
168
CONTINUED:
168
PENELOPE
Bloom.
What?
Deep breath.
BLOOM
My brother and I are con men. All
things considered, we might be the
most respected con man team working
today. And everything since you
hit me with your Lamborghini, all
of this, it's all fake. It's all a
con.
169
172
Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.
STEPHEN (O.S.)
You have to switch it on at the
base.
A beat.
Bloom does.
Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.
But not
angry. Much more sad than angry.
BLOOM
So I've told her our whole play.
And I'm here. To take her money
back. How's that make you feel?
STEPHEN
Disappointed.
BLOOM
This isn't the ending you wanted?
STEPHEN
It doesn't matter now. This is the
way it ends. So let's get it over
with.
BLOOM
Where's the money?
93
172
CONTINUED:
172
STEPHEN
I ate it.
BLOOM
Give me the money, Stephen.
STEPHEN
No.
PENELOPE
I don't want the money.
BLOOM
He's not going to keep a single
piece of you.
Stephen stands.
STEPHEN
I'm sorry you fell in love with
her. But she's a mark. And all of
this, all of it is a con. Every
moment you shared with her, you
were just playing the part of a man
falling in love. That's what
you're afraid of, right? That you
don't know the difference? Or
maybe that there is no difference.
That that's what love is.
PENELOPE
We're leaving.
STEPHEN
(to Bloom)
No. You're too scared to leave.
You're scared to ride off into a
sunset that isn't painted
tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
beautiful but they turn into dark
uncertain nights. If you were
ready for that, you wouldn't be
here. The money is in my bedroom.
Right behind me. But in my story
you don't get the money or the
sunset or the girl.
A long beat.
The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.
PENELOPE
Bloom.
Let's just go.
Please.
94
172
CONTINUED: (2)
172
Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.
Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
Bloom's leg and brings him down.
Then they are fighting.
Penelope watches, horrified.
A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
apart, thirty years worth of a fight.
Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.
Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.
And goes off with a deafening rapport.
Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.
Penelope screams.
Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.
STEPHEN
Tastes like tin foil.
And sinks to the ground.
Bloom's eyes glaze.
He crawls to his brother.
Takes him in
his arms.
BLOOM
I'm sorry.
Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
being a part of this moment.
Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
her.
PENELOPE
Bloom...
He doesn't move from his brother.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
I'm sorry.
She leaves.
95
172
CONTINUED: (3)
172
For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
in the middle of the broken room.
Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
walking off into the distance down the beach.
From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
mask.
Stephen stands.
Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
blood packets.
Bloom steps outside.
173
180
Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
holds his tear stained face in his hands.
This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
phone chirps away.
Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.
Stephen hastily answers it.

Hello?

Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother.

Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.
Bloom enters wearily.
Sits in a chair.
Watches her.
In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.
Shuffling
cards.
A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
segueing us into...
185
185
On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline.
TITLE CARD - Shanghai
A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.
As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.

185
CONTINUED:
185
The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of
disappointment.
186
186
The four sit with drinks.
PENELOPE
So what's the next job?
STEPHEN
Before we do the next job, we need
to liquidate our assets from the
last job.
PENELOPE
But you've got-
STEPHEN
Your money from the last job, well
that's profit, not capital, the
three of us have already split it
up. So step one: sell the book of
hours.
PENELOPE
I thought it was fake.
STEPHEN
With all your random expertise we
couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
isn't worth two point five million,
we could maybe catch four hundred
grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
we buy it from?
BLOOM
Minskie.
STEPHEN
Perfect, we'll sell it right back
to him.
The Chink hands him a piece of paper.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
If he wasn't dead.
BLOOM
Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
Roche, if we want to go state-side.
102
186
CONTINUED:
186
STEPHEN
All traceable. With Minskie out
we'd have to go deep black market
if we wanted to be a hundred
percent clear. There's only one
place that's deep enough for that.
Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
they don't look happy.
PENELOPE
Where?
187
187
BLOOM
Russia. It's like `cancer', I
don't even like saying the word.
Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.
STEPHEN
We're obviously not going to deal
with real Russians. They'll be our
guys in a phony set up, they'll
take our phony book and give her
phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
and simple.
Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.
Gets a blank face.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
So.
We go to St. Petersburg.
At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
Stephen, but Stephen presses on.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
She does the hand-off with our fake
"Russians." But while we're
driving out of town, everything
goes bad.
He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"
103
187
CONTINUED:
187
STEPHEN (cont'd)
We discover we were sold a
counterfeit book in the first
place, which we've now sold to
Russian smugglers. We discover
this when the Russian mob starts
taking us out one by one. Oh shit.
He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."
STEPHEN (cont'd)
First they ambush our car,
destroying the money. Then they
take me out, then the Chink, and
finally you Bloom, in a heroic
death that allows Penelope to
barely escape with her life.
Devastated but reborn with the
knowledge that you loved her so
much you died so she could live,
she drives off into a romantic life
of adventure and peril, on the run
from imaginary Russians.
He points to the third box, "The End."
STEPHEN (cont'd)
What do you think?
CUT TO:
188
189
Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack.
The phone rings.
Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up.
STEPHEN
Our "Russians" have arrived.
190
190
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a
red suitcase.
104
190
CONTINUED:
190
BLOOM
Who'd you get, anyway?
STEPHEN
Hm?
BLOOM
To play the "Russians?"
DING.
The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.
DIAMOND DOG
My boys.
191
191
Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.
192
192
BLOOM
I don't understand. Tell me so I
understand. Three months ago you
were ready to blind the old bastard-
STEPHEN
We need someone who can pass for
the Russian mob to buy our fake
book. The Dog's got his big store
right here in St. Petersburg.
BLOOM
Alright, fuckin stop. You want
this to finish in St. Petersburg,
you want this to end with the Dog
for some what thematic something?
Fine but don't tell it like a
story, let's say it. Twenty three
years ago and I can still smell,
that blood red apartment of his,
the smell of that place. I hate
him Stephen but this isn't that,
this is I don't trust him.
105
192
CONTINUED:
192
STEPHEN
What's he gonna do? Steal our fake
money?
(beat)
I've thought this one out, believe
me. And we can't end it without
him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.
193
193
The red leather suitcase on the bar.
DIAMOND DOG
Stephen, still the grand architect
with your symbols. Red for
temptation, white for salvation.
The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.
Examines it with a
loupe.
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
Impressive, boys.
BLOOM
It's trash. There's visible cross
hatching in Franklin's eye.
Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
Franklin's eye on the bills.
DIAMOND DOG
Hm.
I'll be damned.
(closes case)
Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
handing over a rag bag like this,
it should be a steel attache.
STEPHEN
This'll
do. We'll do the drop off
at your
store. Make it scary,
think a
movie version of the
Russian
mafia, but don't hassle
her.
DIAMOND DOG
Alright.
The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
on his bandaged hand.
He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.
106
193
CONTINUED:
193
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
I look forward to meeting the lady.
Take care, boys.
Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.
194
194
The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.
STEPHEN
So. Our fake Russian attack. One
small charge will simulate a bullet
hit, and blow out the back window.
The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
the rear windshield.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
So that one bang, then we roll off
the road. Once we get clear of the
car the Chink sets off the final
charge, incinerating the car and
the money in the trunk. This'll
all happen exactly twenty seconds
after we cross the main bridge out
of town. After the bridge.
Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
jacket.
BLOOM
Ok.
195
195
Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.
The Chink is
expressionless.
BLOOM
You've been awful quiet.
She doesn't react.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I'm doing this for her.
But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.
107
196
196
Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.
PENELOPE
Tomorrow it all starts.
She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
for the last time.
When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.
197
201
The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.
Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.
He looks weary.
He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.
She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
He breathes, closes his eyes.
An explosion shatters the front passenger window.
Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.
The bridge is still a quarter mile away.
In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
screams, tires screeching.
202
203
A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.
The
brothers lock eyes for a split second.
204
205
Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.
Slumped against a tree.
Penelope hunches over him.
BLOOM
What happened?
PENELOPE
Are you alright?
BLOOM
What happened?
PENELOPE
Yeungling went to get another car.
BLOOM
Where's Stephen?
PENELOPE
We don't know. He was gone.
Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.
Runs his
fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.
Goes to where Stephen fell.
Lying in the grass, a manila
envelope.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
We're going to find him. If he
escaped, he'll contact us. If
they've got him, it's for ransom.
110
205
CONTINUED:
205
BLOOM
Who's got him?
PENELOPE
The Russians.
The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.
206
208
A dive.
The chef on the phone.
CHEF
Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.
Yes, ok.
ALL THE COOKS
Blooooom!
He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.
209
209
Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.
112
209
CONTINUED:
209
BLOOM
Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
So I've got "We are all assholes in
our own theatrical enterprises."
You sure?
This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.
CHEF
And then it end with "Goodbye shit
head."
BLOOM
Shit head?
CHEF
But it is different meaning in
Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
head" if you have affection for
shit.
210
212
A badly lit apartment hallway.
Bloom approaches a door,
Penelope behind him.
His breathing becomes hard.
His face contorts.
He crumples
next to the door.
PENELOPE
What's in there? Tell me who this
guy is.
Bloom's breathing steadies.
BLOOM
He's just an old man.
He tries the knob.
It opens.
213
213
Blood red walls.
Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.
Bloom creeps
down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.
Breathes
through his nose, chokes.
BLOOM
Dog!
I came back.
He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.
Empty.
He lowers his gun, switches on the light.
Penelope enters.
Sniffs the air.
PENELOPE
Moth balls.
Bloom almost laughs.
BLOOM
Is that what that smell is?
BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
of a double barrel shotgun.
115
213
CONTINUED:
213
Bloom spins, gun drawn.
Penelope screams.
Then a moment of stillness.
The shotgun barrel quivers.
It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.
Penelope approaches him slowly.
PENELOPE
(in Russian)
It's okay. Honey, it's alright.
The shotgun sinks to the ground.
Penelope strokes his hair
back from his face.
Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.
BLOOM
Ask him if anyone else is here.
She does.
BOY
Nyet.
BLOOM
Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.
PENELOPE
Diamond Dog?
(in Russian)
Where is the Diamond Dog?
BOY
(in English)
The Dog of Diamonds is gone.
Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
gets a quick answer.
BLOOM
Get the car started.
PENELOPE
What about him?
BLOOM
It's alright.
116
213
CONTINUED: (2)
213
She believes him, and goes.
Bloom kneels in front of the
boy.
BLOOM (cont'd)
You don't need to be afraid of him
anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
come back here again. He doesn't
concern you anymore. Understand?
It's gonna be ok.
The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.
214
215
The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
Penelope holds a note.
PENELOPE
It's a ransom note. It says they
have Stephen, it says they want the
money wired to a specific account,
they give a bank to do it at and a
manager to ask for.
(MORE)
117
215
CONTINUED:
215
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Then an address to come to, at two
p.m. In two hours.
BLOOM
I'll wire the money from my
account, and we'll go get Stephen.
PENELOPE
It's a lot.
BLOOM
How much?
PENELOPE
I'll do it, I want to, I've got
plenty-
BLOOM
How much are they asking for?
PENELOPE
One point seven five million.
A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.
BLOOM
Oh.
Oh oh. No no NO.
He punches the dashboard.
BLOOM (cont'd)
No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if
that's what this is, if that's all
that this is, no NO NO.
PENELOPE
What are you talking about?
BLOOM
There's another possibility that I
should of, I'm a fucking idiot.
This might all be a con. By my
brother. To get me - oh god - he
wanted me to face the Dog, to end
it, and he gets your money. Oh
god. I'm going to be sick.
PENELOPE
Would he do that? To you?
BLOOM
I don't know. Yes.
Yes of course
he would.
(MORE)
118
215
CONTINUED: (2)
215
BLOOM (cont'd)
To tell a story so well it becomes
real. The perfect con. That's his
whole, goddammit, that's what.
PENELOPE
But you don't know. Let's transfer
the money. You don't know.
BLOOM
Son of a bitch.
PENELOPE
You don't know. This is your
brother's life. I'm gonna wire the
money.
216
218
No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.
Bloom
steps lightly, deeper into the theater.
BLOOM
Stephen!
219
219
A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.
Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.
BLOOM
Stephen!
A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
face. He spins, trapped in its glare.
A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.
When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
feet ahead of him towards the stage.
Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.
With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.
220
220
Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
forms of light and black.
BLOOM
(unsteady)
Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
Let's blow this one hat town.
Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
lighting Stephen's face.
Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.
Bloom cries and rushes towards him...
120
220
CONTINUED:
220
STEPHEN
No!
No Bloom, freeze.
He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.
BLOOM
Stephen, who is it?
Is it the Dog?
STEPHEN
Did Penelope wire the money?
BLOOM
Yeah.
STEPHEN
They're calling to check right now.
Don't move. I'm alright.
The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
for a moment then flips it closed.
Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
stands, cut loose.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
coming to you.
He takes a couple wobbly steps.
Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...
And the utility lamp switches off.
BLOOM
No!
Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
the blackness.
Stephen drops flat to the ground.
The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
strobing the scene like stage lightning.
Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
lies on his stomach out in the open.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Stephen!
121
220
CONTINUED: (2)
220
STEPHEN
Stay back!
But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
unloading three more rounds into the dark.
The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.
Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.
Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.
Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
him.
He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
through the torn backdrop.
Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
lobby.
Silence.
Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.
BLOOM
Please tell me this is all gonna be
ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
that's makeup, and that you just
gave me what I always wanted and
pulled off the perfect con.
A long, long moment.
Stephen coughs, spits.
Then a wry grin spreads across his
face.
STEPHEN
You said it, not me.
He stands, the shakiness gone.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Can I get a `wow' for this one?
BLOOM
You son of a bitch.
122
220
CONTINUED: (3)
220
Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.
Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.
He wipes
them, wipes blood from his lip.
STEPHEN
Tastes like tin foil. Alright
here's what I want you to do. The
Chink split?
BLOOM
Yeah.
Clean exit.
STEPHEN
How?
BLOOM
Car bomb.
A hint of relief in Stephen's face.
STEPHEN
Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
back to Helsinki, take that flight
to Rio. Lay low like we said.
Play out the on-the-run-from-
vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
fun for her. Play it like I'm
dead, actually - that'll add some
gravity to everything, that'll be
nice. And I'll see you when I see
you.
BLOOM
Soon?
STEPHEN
I hope not. Last thing you need is
me hanging around. Anyway, how
could I top this?
Bloom hugs him again.
BLOOM
I love you. Bye.
He turns to go.
STEPHEN
Hey.
Think of any card.
123
220
CONTINUED: (4)
220
Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.
BLOOM
Alright.
Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Stephen. That's it.
(grins)
That's the best card trick I've
ever seen. I just wish you had a
bigger audience.
STEPHEN
You're the only audience I've ever
needed.
Wink.
Bloom leaves.
Stephen watches him go.
221
222
Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
the spotlight's glare.
Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.
Sits.
Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
it.
Then slides is up his sleeve.
Blood trickles down his hand.
124
223
223
Bloom wakes with a start.
PENELOPE
Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
coming up, we're almost at the
border. Were you dreaming about
Stephen?
She strokes his hair back from his face.
He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.
Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.
Now a dark shade of brown.
Bloom looks at this shirt.
All the blood, it's all brown.
He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.
Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.
BLOOM
Pull over.
Pull over!!
224
225
RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
with silenced pistols.
The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.
226
