A HAND REACHES INTO THE FRAME and swats at the intercom 
button-- miss.  Again, BEEP.  The hand flails once more and 
manages to depress the button.  We hear the voice of--

As the pace of their love making increases, Julia glances 
over to the desk clock on the floor beside her.

JULIA
Oh my God is that the time?

DA WARREN

No. No, no, I think it s fast.

Warren pulls his pants up from his ankles. He reconnects the

DA WARREN

I/E. SEDAN - CA ROUTE 14 - LATER

Cliff drives with one eye on the road as he scolds his new 
partner. Diane stares out at the blurring chaparral.

CLIFF

CLIFF (CONT'D)
And since I m also your supervising 
officer, let me say that if you 
ever, ever, put your hands on 
another suspect in my custody, I 
will have your badge,  you 
understand me?  Are we clear?

No response.  Cliff pulls over and stares Diane down. 

DIANE
(A beat.  Cold:)
As a bell.

Cliff puts the car in drive.

PRELAP:

JULIA (V.O.)
Stalking is a crime of intimacy.  A 
crime of power, in which the 
stalker seeks to control every 
 life.  There facet of the victim s
is a pattern.  A progression...



A well-attended presentation for the judicial board.  Julia s 
nervous.  The five POLITICIANS on the dais listen, their 
expressions blank, inscrutable. 

JULIA
...Inappropriate gifts, repeated 
phone calls, threatening letters, 
 home, appearances at the victim s
their workplace, threats to the 
 friends and--victim s

At the center of the dais, sits the most powerful man in the 
 eyes room.  We can almost hear REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN s
rolling as Julia signals for the next slide, entitled:

 BEHAVIOR AS AGGRAVATING FACTOR POWERPOINT SLIDE:   STALKING
IN PROSECUTION OF VIOLENT FELONIES 

JULIA (CONT D)
--co-workers, violence against 
pets, vandalism and even--  

REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN
(To the others on dais:)
 sorry, pets?  Did she say pets?I m10.


The other Politicians chuckle.  Julia is thrown.  Aware she s 
losing them, Julia signals her assistant, BRIAN GILMAN (28, 
slick).  Brian clicks.  A graph appears.

JULIA
Formal studies in Germany have 
shown a connection between the 
escalation of violence and--

REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN
Yes, I know we all share your 
concern for the doggies Julia.  
Even the German ones.

More chuckles from the dais.  Julia glances at DA Warren, who 
is seated in the first row.  He avoids her eyes.

JULIA
Pardon me?

REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN
No, pardon me, because I m no fancy 
lawyer, but all these crimes you re 
talking about here, assault, 
murder, what have you.  I was under 
the impression that these things 
are already illegal. 

JULIA
Yes sir, but in stalking cases, 
violence is only the final act in a 
campaign of psychological terrorism-

REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN
Uh-huh, crank calls, nasty notes, I 
get it.  You have a fine record as 
a prosecutor especially your work 
with celebrities.

JULIA
Hold on--

REP. LAWRENCE COLEMAN
So it is with all due respect that 
I ask you how in the hell you 
expect the members of this 
 committee to spend the taxpayers 
good time and money funding a task 
force just so you can send somebody 
to prison for being a pest? 

JULIA

Julia watches Coleman s focus go over her head.  She turns to 
see the TELEVISION NEWS CAMERAS at the back of the room.

affordable ways to prevent actual

pursues a fuming Julia down the stairs.

BRIAN

BRIAN

JULIA
Well too bad for you.  Because my 
side is losing.  My side let thirty-
six sociopaths walk out the door 
this year because violating a 
restraining order is a frigging 
misdemeanor-- There he is!  DA 
Warren!  Jacob!

Julia pursues DA Warren through the crowd.  He glances back 
and then continues, as if he heard nothing.  Julia finally 
grasps his shoulder.

JULIA (CONT D)
Jacob, you said Coleman would back 
my task force.  What just happened?  12.


WARREN
(An aside:)

JULIA

But Warren turns his back, already fielding questions from 
 crushed.reporters.  Brian pulls Julia away.  She s

BRIAN

prosecutor Julia.  But that s not a 
courtroom in there.  

JULIA
Then what the hell is it?

BRIAN
In there... it s an election year.  
Look, we can still petition DA 
Warren for discretionary funds.  
s enough  not much but maybe it It s
for a limited version of your task 
force.

JULIA
You think this is about an anti-
stalking task force?  No, Brian.  
This is about me.
(Off Brian:)
A task force has no oversight 
Brian.  It would be my own thing.  
My people, my rules.  This is how 
an ADA makes a name for herself.  
It s the only way.  Coleman and his 
flunkies know it.  And when they 
 saying, give it to you, they re
re ready to  one of us.  You you re
take the next step.  DA, mayor, who 
 knows... But when they don t...
 well, they just don t.

Brian watches Julia disappear into the crowd.


I/E. SEDAN - LOS ANGELES - LATER

Awkward silence.  Cliff, feeling guilty for his earlier 
tirade, steals glances at Diane while he drives.  He adjusts 
the rearview and... she has nice legs.  Cliff adjusts the

Diane tilts the mirror back at Cliff and gets out of the car.  
Cliff tries to follow but nearly hangs himself on his 
seatbelt.  By the time he gets free, Diane is halfway across 
the lot.  Cliff jumps from the car and calls after Diane.

CLIFF (CONT D)
Hey come on!  I was just trying to

Cliff glances around at the gawking cops.  He blushes then, 
to save some face:

 HOUSE - LATERI/E. DIANE S

Diane wears the day s frustration on her face as she parks in 
the drive way.  En route to the front door, Diane s attention 
snaps to a passing car.  Her hand releases the button of her 
jacket and we glimpse the 9mm in her shoulder holster.  The 
car pulls away.  Diane exhales.

Jane bursts in.  She stops.  Ivy is waiting on her sofa.

Brian, Cox, Romero, and Tim. 

JULIA
...The violent act that ends in 
blood and smoke and flashing lights 
begins, sometimes, in silence.  It 
goes unspoken and unseen.  The 
victims are the lonely ones, the 
frightened ones, the meek, the 
ashamed.  They suffer at the hands 
of predators they know, and those 
they have never met.  Each of them 
waiting, helpless, as their 
tormentors move ever closer to that 
invisible line and then...

Today, the line is no longer 
invisible.  The line is here.  The 
line is us.  We will be what stands 
between.  We are the line.  And 
those who cross us, will find only 
retribution on the other side.

Tim hits a button.

Everyone waits... waits... the phones begin to ring, slowly 
at first, then more calls, and more calls until, the phones
