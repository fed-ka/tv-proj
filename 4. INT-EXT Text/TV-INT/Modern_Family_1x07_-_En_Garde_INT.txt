      Our three families have gathered to watch a juniors  fencing 
      tournament.  Cameron is video taping the proceedings.  
      Mitchell has Lily in a Baby Bjorn.  The families cheer on a 
      masked young fencer while Haley barely looks up from her cell 
      phone as she texts furiously.  The fencer feints to the left 
      then lands a solid chest hit.  More cheers.  He retreats to 
      his corner, removes his mask and we see that it is Manny.

      Manny scores hit after hit winning this match.  Jay goes nuts.  
      He hi-fives Phil really hard. Phil grabs his hand in pain.

      camera to a telescoping pole.  He sweeps the camera over the

                Can you guys ask all the questions now 
                so I don t have to keep lifting this?

      A BUZZER sounds to signal the start of the match.

                                JAY
                Okay, go get  em!

      Manny runs off.  He takes his place in his corner as Caroline 
      takes her place.

                Excuse me, is this seat taken?

                                JAY
                It s all yours.

      She notices the shirts.  

                                DENISE
                Oh, is Manny your boy?

                Yes.  

                                DENISE
                He s quite good.  I saw him earlier.

                Thank you.  Is she your daughter?

                                DENISE
                  Caroline?  No.  Sadly, her parents 
                have passed away.  I m her nurse down 
                at children s hospital.  But all my 
                patients are like family to me.

      Phil shows the house to Krista and her husband MR. DONALD 
      FLUM.  We hear Luke and THE FLUM S SON upstairs laughing.  

                                MR. DONALD FLUM 
                Well, our boys are enjoying *

                come home, but nothing compares with  *
                that sound right there.*

      We hear Luke scream O.S.  The camera swings around to catch 
      him topple down the last few steps off the staircase.  *
      Everyone rushes over.  Phil just keeps smiling his salesman 
      smile.  The Flum s son looks on in shock.

      The match hasn t started yet.  Nurse Denise continues to chat 
      with Gloria and Jay.

                She s our little miracle.  I only wish 
                her dad had made it back from

      way toward Denise, helped by other NURSES AND ORDERLIES. 
      Denise gets up and makes room for them.

      Jay gives the  Cut it off  sign, brushing his fingers across 
      his neck.  Manny, misunderstanding, smiles, gives a thumbs up 
      and draws his sword across his own neck promising to defeat 
      her.

                                JAY
                Maybe we should pull the fire alarm.*

      ANGLE ON Manny and Caroline meeting in the center of the 
      pitch.

                                MANNY

                                CAROLINE
                Bring it, big boy!

      They each drop their masks. 


      Mitchell and Claire sit on a curb by the parking lot.  There 
      is slightly less visible animosity between them.    

                                MITCHELL
                Look, I m glad Dad s proud of Manny.  *
                But... I don t know... it would have 
                been nice to see him that proud of 
                us... of me.  

                                CLAIRE
                      (laughing a little)
                And you thought the path to Dad s 
                approval was through figure skating? 
                I m pretty sure his proudest moment 
                came when you finally hung up the fire 
                red unitard.

                                MITCHELL
                I never claimed any of this was 
                  rational.  I m sorry for being such a 
                pill.  

                                CLAIRE
                No.  Believe it or not I always felt 
                bad that I quit.  I know how much you *
                loved skating.

                                MITCHELL
                I never really loved skating.

                What?MODERN FAMILY "En Garde"     9/10/09  Shooting Draft                25.


                                MITCHELL
                Okay, this is going to sound a little 
                gay... 

                                CLAIRE
                I can take it.

                                MITCHELL
                When you and I skated together, you 
                weren t the mean older sister and I 
                wasn t the clingy little brother.  We 
                were a team.  And let s face it, as 
                  teenagers, or when Mom and Dad got 
                  divorced, and even now, we re always *
                on opposing sides.  I guess I... miss 
                being on your team.

      Claire starts to tear up.

                                CLAIRE
                Wow.  That is... a little gay.

      Claire gets up and starts to walk away.

                                MITCHELL
                Where are you going?

      Claire stops then turns around.  

                                CLAIRE
                Get up.

                                MITCHELL
                What?

      Claire strikes a skating pose.  

                                MITCHELL (CONT D)
                Oh my god, you re not serious?

                                CLAIRE
                Just don t drop me.

      Mitchell assumes a skating position as Claire starts running 
      toward him.


      Manny and Caroline begin their match.  Manny is destroying 
      her.  After few hits he seems as though he s taunting her.  

      Jay and Gloria slump down in their chairs as Nurse Denise and 
      the sick kids look on in horror.  We WIDEN to reveal Cameron

                Put it away or lose it.


      Manny shows off with an incredibly cocky move to win the match.  
      He whips off his mask, dances around and celebrates.  There is 
        a smattering of nervous applause from Jay, Gloria, Cameron, 
      Haley, and Alex.  Cameron and the girls are zipping up 
      sweatshirts to conceal their Manny t-shirts from the crowd.
