MACHETE (MEXICAN FEDERALE OFFICER CRUZ) drives with ROOKIE
OFFICER ERHMAN riding shotgun. A rosary swings back and forth
on the rearview mirror.
CHIEF TORREZ's yells crackle through the police radio.
TORREZ
(ON RADIO)
Officer Cruz! Stand down! Do not
attempt to take the safehouse
alone! Officer Cruz! You hear me!?
OFFICER ERHMAN
Torrez sounds mad. You going to
answer him?
Machete glares. Erhman nervously picks up the radio.
OFFICER ERHMAN (CONT'D)
On route to target, no need for
assistance.
TORREZ
(ON RADIO)
Machete, you son of a bitch! I told
you to wait! Set up a perimeter and
wait for further orders. You hear
me, Pendejo!?
Machete slowly takes the radio from Erhman. He hangs up.
Machete guns the engine.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 2.
OFFICER ERHMAN
What are you doing? We're going to
set up a perimeter right? You heard
the boss.
Machete pulls his Machete, sticks it up to Erhman's face.
MACHETE
This is the boss.
Ehrman crosses himself.
A phalanx of ARMED GUARDS emerge from the dead cars. They
narrow their weapons at MACHETE's barrelling patrolcar.
OFFICER ERHMAN
Hijo de puta!
Machete FLOORS it directly through the DEAD CARS and right
through the FRONT WALL of the fleapit.
INT MEXICAN HOTEL, LOBBY - DAY
Erhman flies THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD into the far wall. The
car stops in front of the check-in desk.
Machete steps out. The dust clears.
More ARMED MEN stream from the office.
MACHETE sideswipes the first THUG with his MACHETE, swinging
him around to face the fire of the others.
THUG ragdolls around like a marionette long enough for
Machete to slash one of the men's wrists, sending his aim
wild and taking out the others.
Machete kicks open a door.
Naked girl on the bed. As if she was expecting him.
MACHETE
Get dressed.
He checks the windows.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 3.
CHICA
It's too hot for clothes.
Checks her eyes.
She's been drugged.
He lifts her, ass over his shoulder.
CHICA (CONT'D)
Hey... what's your name?
She tries to read the nametag on his uniform, upside-down.
A THUG with an UZI runs out spraying bullets.
Machete spins and impales his face into the wall. THUG's Uzi
falls into the girl's hands.
MORE THUGS emerge from the end of the hallway.
She absently pulls the trigger, ripping into the pursuing
men. Blood sprays the walls like Jackson Pollock.
New THUGS emerge from the front of the hallway. Machete spins
around and the girl unloads another spray.
CHICA
Oh... wow.
The Uzi's out of ammo. The girl frowns and drops it.
The fucked-up patrolcar blocks the way out, for now. Machete
resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants.
Girl arches her back, her crotch in Machete's face, then
slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose,
mouth.
MACHETE
We need to go. Now.
CHICA
In what? That?
The patrolcar isn't going anywhere.
She rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 4.
CHICA (CONT'D)
That looks like me.
She reaches into his pants.
CHICA (CONT'D)
What's this long, hard thing?
MACHETE
My machete.
CHICA
Is it sharp?
Machete looks into her eyes. She smiles drunkenly.
CHICA (CONT'D)
Good.
She yanks it, drawing it into his femoral artery. Hard.
He falls to the ground. He didn't see this coming.
She kicks him backwards.
He feels life escaping him. His point of view as:
She reaches down BETWEEN HER LEGS.
Fumbles with her CROTCH.
Pulls out a small cell phone from her snatch.
CHICA (CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE)
I got him.
More life escapes him. Double crossed. He's ready to give up.
CHICA (CONT'D)
(HANGING UP)
Pobrecito.
CHIEF TORREZ steps in.
GIRL
Como hice? (Sub: How'd I do?)
TORREZ
Bueno... pero no tanto. (Sub:
Good... but not that good.)
He shoots her once; she drops, then he empties the gun into
her body, making her do a spider dance on the floor.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 5.
TORREZ (CONT'D)
You had to stick your neck where it
didn't belong, amigo.
MACHETE
Torrez?
Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes
backwards onto the floor.
A SECOND MAN enters. This is DRUGLORD.
DRUGLORD
No, not Torrez. El Santo Muerte,
pendejo. (I'm Saint Death,
pendejo.)
DRUGLORD draws a Samurai sword and SLICES Machete like
carving meat. We don't see it.
DRUGLORD (CONT'D)
Quemalo. Quemalo todo. (Sub: Burn
it. Burn it all.)
Druglord walks out. Through Machete's blurred vision we see
Torrez and other officers lighting rags dipped in bottles of
tequila and throwing them into the corners of the room.
The place goes up as they run out.
Machete crawls and collapses as the flames rise around him
AND WE
CUT TO BLACK.
TITLE CARD: THREE YEARS LATER
ELEKTRA RIVERS, 20s, lies naked, soaking in a bubble bath.
She stretches, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her bod.
She's having her "private time," caressing every inch of her
body with a phallic loofah. She oohs and ahhs with the joys
of pleasuring herself in the tub.
Headlights appear through the venetian blinds. She stops.
Sounds of people getting out of a car, laughing, shushing
each other. Then a key in a lock, struggling to open it. A
door forcibly opens.
More sounds of fumbling and shushing.
Dim lights silhouette two people getting naked and getting
physical.
Lights come on. ELEKTRA stands in a bathrobe.
COUPLE are stunned. Especially since the naked woman in bed
looks just like ELEKTRA.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 7.
ELEKTRA
Jesus, Sis. How long have you known
this one? Twenty minutes?
NAKED MAN
What the fuck? You're a twin? Hot.
SIS in bed covers up.
SIS
Mind your own business.
ELEKTRA
I'm trying to. I've got to get
ready for work. And you're in my
room.
NAKED MAN
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you join us?
ELEKTRA
What a charmer. You sure know how
to pick `em, Sis.
SIS
Fuck off.
(TO MAN)
Get out.
NAKED MAN
What?
SIS
You've been kicked off the island.
Get the fuck out.
Naked Man cold-cocks Sis. She's out.
NAKED MAN
Talk nice. And you--get that robe
off and get up here.
ELEKTRA
Sure thing. I like a man who takes
control.
She sidles up to the man, straddles him in bed, pushes his
hands up to the bedrail and snaps the cuffs on him, cuffing
him to the bed.
NAKED MAN
What the fuck?
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 8.
ELEKTRA
You're under arrest, dick.
She pulls a handgun from her robe, pistolwhips him good.
NAKED MAN
You're a cop?
She hits speed-dial on a cellphone.
ELEKTRA
Yeah, this is Agent Elektra Rivers,
Homeland Security. I could use some
unis at the corner of Newning and
Drake for an assault. Suspect in
custody.
NAKED MAN
You're fucking hot.
ELEKTRA
(clicking phone shut)
Yeah. Thanks. I gotta get dressed
now.
NAKED MAN
Can I watch?
ELEKTRA
Suit yourself.
She strips off the robe, giving him an eyeful.
Benz drives, Machete rides shotgun.
BENZ
You speak English?
MACHETE
$70 a day for yardwork. Hundred for
roofing. One-twenty-five for
septic. Sewage.
BENZ
$125?
MACHETE
I cost the most, because I'm the
best there is.
BENZ
Naturally.
They drive by a CATHOLIC CHURCH. A Mexican-American PADRE
sweeps the steps.
BENZ (CONT'D)
You can call me Benz.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 14.
MACHETE
Like the car.
BENZ
You're sharp. That's right. Just
like the car.
MACHETE
What are you looking for, Mr. Benz?
BENZ
Have you ever killed anyone before?
Machete eyes the church as they drive by.
Benz hits the lights. The place is nice. Machete don't care.
BENZ
Drink?
Benz pours two tequila shots. They shoot em.
BENZ (CONT'D)
Like angels pissing down my throat.
Benz points Machete to sit behind the desk.
He flips open a manila folder, inside is an 8 X 10 of a well-
dressed 40-something man.
BENZ (CONT'D)
Do you know this man?
Machete shakes his head no.
BENZ (CONT'D)
State Senator John McLaughlin,
Independent from Cocksucker County.
As you know, illegal immigrants
such as yourself are being forced
out of our country at an alarming
rate. If he had his druthers, he'd
ship you back to old Meh-Hee-Co.
That's his platform: Ship `em back.
(MORE)
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 15.
BENZ (CONT'D)
But first, he'd make you build a
wall along the border for no pay.
Not so much as a thank you then get
the fuck out.
Benz sees this doesn't impress Machete.
BENZ (CONT'D)
What?
MACHETE
That doesn't sound like your
problem.
BENZ
That's where you're wrong, friend.
What our senator fails to realize
is that this country runs on
illegal labor. Thrives on it. Keeps
costs down, keeps the wheels
moving. Bust that, and the world
stops turning. You've chaos and
shit.
MACHETE
What do you want me to do?
BENZ
For the good of both our peoples,
our new senator must die. And for
that I will pay you $150,000 cash.
Benz flicks the lights. Tables are laid out with weaponry.
Machete walks past the automatics and blades. He stops at a
machete.
BENZ
You like the machete, huh? Strictly
low-tech, but good close-up, or if
you're trying to make a
particularly brutal point. But it's
entirely unsuited to our purposes.
Here. Have a look at this.
He shows him an unassembled sniper rifle. As he lists the
specs, he snaps it together perfect.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 16.
BENZ (CONT'D)
(specific dialogue about the
weapon, the laser-sight on it, the
ammo it uses, then) Cheer up,
Charlie. This is your golden
ticket.
Benz drops a hollow point sniper shell into Machete's hand.
Senator JOHN MCLAUGHLIN sits while a foppish Italian cuts his
hair.
A REPORTER sits across from him.
REPORTER
But isn't this anti-immigration
platform a hard sell in this part
of the country, where so many
voters have strong ethnic
backgrounds?
MCLAUGHLIN
Not at all. Those voters are here
legally.
(MORE)
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 17.
MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)
It cheapens their experience, their
hard work, to have people jumping
the border, taking advantage of
loopholes in our system. It makes a
mockery of everything they've
worked for and turns it into a big
steaming pile of--
A hand covers the reporter's recorder. It's Benz.
BENZ
Thank you, that'll be all.
The reporter half-smiles. Benz ushers her out and turns to
the hairdresser.
BENZ (CONT'D)
Who the fuck is this?
MCLAUGHLIN
It's Mario. He's my goddamn
hairdresser.
BENZ
Get out. Get the fuck out.
Mario leaves.
MCLAUGHLIN
I've got to look good for my
constituency.
BENZ
You're in here with a reporter and
a fucking shampoo queen, for Christ
sake.
MCLAUGHLIN
Mario's the best.
BENZ
People want to know you're one of
them. From now on, No manicures, no
massages, no English tailored
suits.
MCLAUGHLIN
Who died up your ass, Benz? I'm
elected, you sonofabitch. The
people have spoken, by a slim
margin maybe, but they picked me.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 18.
BENZ
And they'll be picking through your
trash looking for a reason to fuck
you up. I'm doing everything I can
to make your Von problem go away.
Don't add more fuel to the fire.
MCLAUGHLIN
Von... that fat sonofabitch. What
does he say?
BENZ
I don't give a damn. As long as he
lays low and doesn't take a step
out of his little tree fort, he and
his boys can play soldier till Hell
freezes over.
Machete in JANITOR uniform pushes a mop and bucket to the
elevator and steps inside.
A woman in a business suit, hair pinned back and glasses
stops the elevator door.
WOMAN
You!
Machete freezes.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
You're not Cisco. You're new here,
aren't you? Well, one of the
toilets in the ladies' is busted
again, and you need to clean it up
snappy.
MACHETE
This is Cisco's floor. I'm on 11.
WOMAN
But this is an emergency!
MACHETE
Find Cisco.
The elevator doors shut.
Machete wheels a mop and bucket. He pulls a plastic bag out
of the gray water and enters the stairwell.
Machete zips up the gray coveralls but the blood starts to
seep through. He pushes the mop and bucket and a small
trickle of blood runs down the mop handle from where it leans
against Machete's shoulder and into the bucket.
He walks briskly to the elevator and slips inside.
The elevator stops on the sixth floor. A GUARD enters,
talking on a 2-way.
GUARD
(INTO RADIO)
Roger. I'm on my way.
Machete pushes the bucket and mop out. The guard notices
blood on the floor.
GUARD (CONT'D)
Hey!
He reaches for Machete but Machete pulls a hidden blade from
the mop handle and jacks the guy with quick, sharp thrusts
into his neck. The guard slides backwards into the elevator
as the door closes.
Machete pushes the bucket and mop towards an open office.
There's a fire escape out the window. He heads towards it.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 22.
Elevator opens as the WOMAN complaining about the toilets
earlier steps in and sees GUARD lying in pool of BLOOD. She
SCREAMS.
Benz presses his jacket against the bloody wound at
McLaughlin's leg.
MCLAUGHLIN
The fuck was that?
BENZ
I'd say it was a fucking gift from
the Gods.
MCLAUGHLIN
What are you talking about?
BENZ
Get ready for your numbers to rise
like Lazarus. A thousand bucks says
it was some bean-eating wetback
just took a potshot at you. It will
put the fear of God into the ethics
commission. Now we get you to the
hospital, you make your bedside
speech and you're set.
McLaughlin looks at Benz, taking it all in.
MCLAUGHLIN
Fix me a goddamn drink.
The two patrolmen are young, hyped.
PATROLMAN
This is fucking big. This guy took
a shot at a Representative.
COP
Senator.
PATROLMAN
Same fucking thing. He could die,
and we caught him.
COP
Yeah, we did. They're gonna hang
him like Saddam.
PATROLMAN
We're fuckin' heroes, buddy.
The patrol car zips in and out of traffic.
COP
I'm gonna call it in. Unless you
want to do it.
PATROLMAN
No. You go ahead. You're good at
it.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 24.
COP
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean? That I'm not good at the
action stuff? Just the pussy stuff?
PATROLMAN
Did I fuckin' say that?
COP
Did you fuckin' mean it?
PATROLMAN
Look, you and me both apprehended
this fuckin' suspect. We frisked
him and we cuffed him and now we're
bringin' him downtown. We're gonna
get a medal for this.
COP
I didn't frisk him.
PATROLMAN
Yeah, you did.
COP
I'm telling you. I didn't frisk
him. You must have done it.
PATROLMAN
I didn't frisk him. I thought you--
Suddenly, a bolus of BLOOD appears at the driver's mouth.
COP
Jesus fuck! What's wrong, man?
In the backseat, Machete has his MACHETE in his cuffed hands,
stuck through the driver's seat and into the guy's chest.
Machete twists the blade and the driver turns the wheel in
the direction -- MACHETE is STEERING THE CAR from the
BACKSEAT with the MACHETE stuck through the DRIVER!
PATROLMAN
(SPITTING BLOOD)
Oh, fuck!
His foot goes like iron to the floor, gunning the engine.
COP
Slow down, man!
Machete jerks the blade to one side and the COP CAR veers
into oncoming traffic.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 25.
COP (CONT'D)
Holy shit!
The cop tries to grab the wheel but Machete jerks the blade
in the opposite direction and the COP CAR wrecks, spilling
sideways and sliding across the pavement.
Machete slides out through the busted glass and frees his
hands on the blade, then limps towards--
ELEKTRA looks up from her teriyaki and martini to the muted
TV mounted on the wall.
ELEKTRA
Hey, turn that up, would you?
TV REPORTER
(ON TV)
...at the scene of an incredible
accident just moments after the
attempt on State Senator
McLaughlin's life and we're not
sure if this individual was in
custody or was hit by the vehicle
but he appears to be injured--
Elektra's phone rings. It's her BOSS.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 26.
ELEKTRA
I'm watching it.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
Don't watch it. Get on it now! I
want that suspect.
ELEKTRA
What do you know?
BOSS
I only know what you know, and
right know, you don't know dick.
ELEKTRA
I'm gone, relax.
SNIPER who took a shot at MACHETE watches as the cops sift
through the mess left behind.
SNIPER
(ON PHONE)
I think he's toast.
BENZ
(ON PHONE)
Don't think. Know. Check the
hospital. Check the morgue. Fucking
verify.
ELEKTRA arrives. SNIPER gets an eyeful as she crosses the
yellow tape barrier.
SNIPER
(HANGING UP)
Now that's what I call a fuckable
ass.
SNIPER drives off.
COUNTY MEDICAL is noisy and dirty.
A SEXY SPANISH NURSE wheels Machete down the corridor and
into a room.
Her tattoos poke out from under her tiny nurse uniform.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 27.
NURSE
(quietly in Spanish)
They don't know you're here yet.
You were brought in as a Juan Doe.
Innocent bystander.
He's barely conscious; his vision blurred.
DOC FELIX checks X-Rays. Nurse gives him a kiss.
NURSE
Here he is, Doc.
DOC FELIX
Good girl.
She bends over and gives Doc an eyeful.
NURSE
Hey Doc... I can feel your eyeballs
in my uterus.
Doc slips a surgical glove on.
DOC FELIX
Let's investigate that.
Machete coughs into semi-consciousness.
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
Oh hey, the hero has awoken. Check
it out.
(Holds up X-Rays)
This is amazing. You can see the
bullet rebounded, entered the back
of the cranium and was stopped by
another bullet already lodged in
the bone. I've never seen anything
like it. If he hadn't been shot
before he would be dead now.
There's a lesson in there
somewhere...
A GRUFF SECURITY GUARD walks in and HANDCUFFS Machete to the
side of the gurney.
SECURITY GUARD
You're going to tell me who you're
working for or I'll bury your spic
ass and have your wife turning
tricks for tacos by breakfast.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 28.
DOC FELIX
Hey, buddy. This is a patient of
mine. He's in a fragile state. He's
got a bullet in his cranium.
SECURITY GUARD
This wetback tried to kill the
Senator, Doc! It's all over the TV.
DOC FELIX
Yeah? In that case you better let
me keep him alive so you can beat
the truth out of him. And collect
the reward.
The Guard lightens up.
SECURITY GUARD
You're alright, Doc. You know how
it is, they take our welfare money.
There ain't none left for us decent
folk... Now you get him lucid so I
can torture him good.
DOC FELIX
Lucid. That's a good word. Go get a
coffee and donut out in the lobby.
I'll come get you when he's ready.
SECURITY GUARD
I'll be waiting.
He leaves. Doc locks the door.
Nurse pulls a leather pouch out from under her garter belt.
Inside are three hypodermic needles; Orange, Red and Black.
Sniper and two THUGS pass SECURITY GUARD making a mess of a
powdered donut.
Doc uncaps the Orange syringe.
Machete struggles.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 29.
DOC FELIX
(IN PERFECT SPANISH)
Don't worry, amigo, this is not my
country. I'm from Cuba; one hundred
percent. She's from Puerto Rico.
We're all Children of the Sun.
The Nurse gives Machete a kiss, Doc slaps her ass.
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
Leave him alone.
(BEAT)
Now these are my friends.
(taps the needles)
They will cheer you up special
until these bullet holes feel like
little butterfly kisses.
The Nurse blows a kiss at them.
Doc stabs the Orange one into Machete's arm.
Machete's eyes SNAP open.
The heart monitor speeds up.
Doc tosses the needle into the trash can and pulls out the
Red one.
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
This one here...
The GUARD bangs on the door.
SECURITY GUARD (0.C.)
Hurry up in there!
Doc Felix panics.
DOC FELIX
...is for me.
He stabs his own leg with it.
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
Oh wow, that hit the spot... all
the spots!
Doc's head vibrates.
The GUARD bangs the door.
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
This one, I call this one "Popeye."
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 30.
Felix stabs the Black into Machete's leg.
He jolts awake and breaks his shackles.
The heart monitor EXPLODES.
The GUARD KICKS the door in. Machete knocks him out.
Machete peeks from the doorway.
SNIPER and his men walking up.
He shuts the door. He's cornered.
MACHETE
Another way out?
DOC FELIX
Wait, I got something.
Doc hands him a wicked tool made of long curved surgical
steel called a--
DOC FELIX (CONT'D)
SKULL SCRAPER. We use this to
scrape the bones clean. It cuts
through flesh like butta.
Machete slips the Nurses belt off and STRAPS the surgical
tool to his arm like captain hook.
MACHETE
Thanks.
DOC FELIX
Vaya con Dios.
Machete clamps an OXYGEN CANISTER to the back of the gurney.
Lays on it and shoots the valve.
It EXPLODES him through the door.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 31.
A middle aged couple is having a nice drive listening to the
local RUSH LIMBAUGH spew vitriol about illegals.
They look up, smiles fade.
COUPLES POV : Machete falls face first towards them.
He CRASHES through the windshield into their laps.
The car drives through the front window of a coffee shop.
Machete climbs out, into the night.
She enters. Mclaughlin is making a statement on the phone.
Benz gives her a hard look, waves her away to wait.
MCLAUGHLIN
(ON PHONE)
This act... this cowardly act...
(MORE)
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 32.
MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)
will not end my struggle, to keep
our country safe from those who
would destroy it. God bless
everyone who stood with me today, I
will return to the fight. And God
Bless America.
Benz takes the phone from him.
BENZ
No further statements. We only hope
that the perpetrator is brought to
swift justice in an American court.
Elektra flashes a badge at McLaughlin. Benz hangs up.
ELEKTRA
Elektra Rivers, Department of
Homeland Security.
BENZ
This is a state matter. We've
already talked to--
ELEKTRA
DHS has jurisdiction over everyone
so give it a rest, Mr--
BENZ
Booth. Michael Booth.
MCLAUGHLIN
I don't know what I can do to help
you in here, Agent Rivers. You want
to find the bastard did this, go
look for him.
ELEKTRA
I appreciate that, sir, and I
ASSURE YOU--
McLaughlin spits on her shoe.
MCLAUGHLIN
You can't assure dick. Just ask
what you want and then you can be
on your way.
She keeps her steely resolve as she pulls out a small note
pad.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 33.
ELEKTRA
Is the shooter known to you, I
mean, did you have any warnings or
communication before today?
MCLAUGHLIN
No.
ELEKTRA looks over at Benz, gets nothing.
ELEKTRA
My expertise is in profiling and
assessing risks of potentially
dangerous individuals who are in
this country illegally.
BENZ
Looks like you missed one.
Burn. Then, not missing a beat--
ELEKTRA
Would you like additional DHS
officers assigned to your security
detail?
BENZ
The senator is trying to project an
image of resilience, not fear. Now
I'm sure you'll agree, the Senator
has had a very trying day.
ELEKTRA
Here's my card, in case you change
your mind. Or you think of anything
else.
She hands Benz her card.
BENZ
You'll be the first person I call.
Elektra leaves and Benz drops the card in the trash.
Luz helps Machete to the bed.
LUZ
You'll be safe here.
Luz sets a pot to boil with all kinds of herbs.
Luz returns with the boiling pot and sets the briefcase down.
MACHETE
Did you open it?
LUZ
No.
Machete nods and Luz opens it. It's filled with cut
newspaper. She shows him.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 35.
LUZ (CONT'D)
Nothing worth nothing here, unless
you were going to make a pinata.
Now lie back.
Machete lays down.
Luz scoops the boiling goop onto his wounds.
LUZ (CONT'D)
You know what this is, right?
Machete nods yes.
LUZ (CONT'D)
Works every time. When the sun
rises, you'll be good.
Machete feels her long legs up.
MACHETE
I don't know about that.
LUZ
Cuidado, chico. You might burn
yourself.
She places a Mexican blanket on him.
MACHETE
Why are you helping me?
LUZ
You know why Machete.
MACHETE
You know me?
LUZ
No, but I know the myth of the last
honest cop in Mexico.
MACHETE
The myth might be better.
LUZ
Cada uno lleva su cruz (sub. We
each have our cross to bear)
Machete pulls her down onto him.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 36.
Elektra comes in. Place looks deserted.
ELEKTRA
McGraw? McGraw, are you here?
No answer.
Elektra unholsters her sidearm, and scopes the place out.
Thumping coming from the bedroom.
She assumes her best vigilant stance and kicks open the door.
Ranger MCGRAW (late 20s) lies in bed while SIS rides him like
a cowgirl should, not missing a beat.
ELEKTRA
Goddamnit! You're fucking my
sister?
MCGRAW
Your sister? Holy shit. I thought
it was you.
ELEKTRA
Fuckin' liar.
Sis rides on, not giving a shit.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Did you at least get me the files?
MCGRAW
Sure I did.
McGraw is preoccupied with the business at hand.
ELEKTRA
Well, where the hell are they?
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 37.
MCGRAW
Uh... uh... uhh...
ELEKTRA
Never mind. I see `em.
She snatches a file from the bedside table.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
If you need me, I'll be in the
bath. Slut.
SIS
Bitch.
Elektra exits. McGraw howls.
Benz sits at the head of the table eating with his wife, JUNE
and daughter, APRIL.
JUNE
The nerve. An honest, dedicated
American like John. What on earth
were they thinking?
BENZ
They weren't, dear. They weren't.
JUNE
I worry more about April. What kind
of world are we leaving her?
APRIL
I think Cole is going to ask me to
marry him.
JUNE
Oh, honey that's--
APRIL
But I don't want to marry him.
JUNE
Terrible.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 38.
APRIL
I mean, look at me. I'm not ready
for that kind of commission.
BENZ
Commitment.
APRIL
That either. I have priorities.
JUNE
Good for you.
BENZ
School, career. Those come first.
APRIL
I'm talking about my modeling.
BENZ
You're a beautiful girl, April, but
that's a tough nut to crack.
APRIL
No it isn't. Do you know how many
hits I've gotten on my website?
BENZ
You have a website?
(TO JUNE)
She has a website. You know about
this?
June nods yes.
APRIL
I know what the online public
wants, and they want me. All of me.
Cole's just going to have to wait.
Benz sees Sniper coming up the driveway.
BENZ
We'll talk about this later. I'll
be in my office.
Benz walks off.
JUNE
(whispering to April)
Are there cute guys on there? You
need me to inspect them I think.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 39.
APRIL
(WHISPERING)
No way! You're such a slut, Mom!
You're a Cougar slut!
They laugh.
Benz enters to find Sniper already there, pouring himself a
drink. TV is on mute in the background.
BENZ
I hope you've got something to
celebrate.
Artist's sketch of MACHETE fills the TV screen.
SNIPER
He's off the grid. Sonofabitch
disappeared.
Benz points to a map of the city on his desk.
BENZ
I picked him up here. Find out if
anyone's seen him. He couldn't have
done it on his own. He has help.
Find the help.
Machete wakes up, alone.
A note on the pillow reads - breakfast in oven.
CUT TO:
Machete opens the oven door and takes out a plate of steaming
MIGAS.
He eats and looks around at Luz's pictures on the walls; Luz
as a young girl on a farm in Mexico, Protesting at a
university, Newspaper articles about the riots, in Rebel gear
in the mountains, the pictures reveal a serious past behind
the hot taco lady.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 40.
Druglord being serviced by a trio of women.
TORREZ, older, enters. DRUGLORD is unfazed, keeps right on
trucking.
TORREZ
He's alive.
Druglord stops in mid-fuck.
DRUGLORD
Go.
The first girl leaves off.
DRUGLORD (CONT'D)
All of you.
The other girls follow her and exit.
DRUGLORD (CONT'D)
Where?
TORREZ
Texas.
DRUGLORD
Take all the men you need. But
bring him back alive. I want to
kill him with my own hands.
Elektra sits at her desk, going over Machete's file. Photos
of Machete in Federale uniform, mugshots of YOUNG MACHETE.
Pulls a sheet that reads: PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION in Spanish.
ELEKTRA
(TO HERSELF)
"Problems with authority. Prone to
violence. Fatalistic, ruled by a
sense of destiny and purpose."
BEGIN FLASHBACK
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 41.
Barefoot women cut white powder.
Preacher Dad bursts in with a Bible in one hand and a lit
TORCH in the other. Shouting in Spanish. Women scatter as he
sets fire to everything inside.
KILLER 1 plays foosball in the back. The ball pops into the
air.
A hand catches it; reveal young Machete.
Killer 1 reaches for the ball. Young Machete CHOPS his hand
OFF.
Killer 1 falls; another CHOP, blood sprays Young Machete's
face, he doesn't blink.
KILLER 2 on the phone. He looks down at Bloody Young Machete.
MACHETE STABS the man THROUGH the GLASS booth.
KILLER 4 sits on the couch watching a spanish sitcom.
MED SHOT - he's laughing hysterically - His smile fades.
A stream of blood pours down between his eyes.
He falls forward revealing a knife buried in his head and
Young Machete standing calmly.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 43.
A cell door SLAMS on Young Machete's face.
ELEKTRA
(v.o.)
"Recommendation: Total lockdown."
END FLASHBACK
Boss enters.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 44.
BOSS
You look like you've seen a ghost.
ELEKTRA
No. But I read the ghost's file. My
local contact Mcgraw got it from
the hot sheets down south.
BOSS
Local contact?
ELEKTRA
Ex-boyfriend. Whatever.
BOSS
And?
ELEKTRA
He's dangerous.
BOSS
I knew there was a reason we kept
you on here. It's your brilliant
insights.
ELEKTRA
I'm working on it.
BOSS
Get him. The hammer's coming down
on us hard for this, so if you fuck
up, it's not just your ass on the
chopping block, it's mine.
ELEKTRA
You want me to put this background
on the air?
BOSS
I could give a fuck. Just get him.
Machete steps into the confessional.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 45.
The little door slides open, wooden cross "windows" light the
scene.
MACHETE
Bless me, Padre, for I have sinned.
It's been a long fucking time since
my last confession.
PADRE
I was wondering when you were going
to show yourself. They're combing
the city for you. How long before
they get your file and track down
your stepbrother, the priest?
MACHETE
Sorry, bro. I mean, Padre.
PADRE
You were wrong to come here. How
long have you been here anyway?
MACHETE
Few weeks.
PADRE
Why didn't you come to me before?
MACHETE
Didn't need you before.
PADRE
What do you think I can do for you?
Give you absolution? You have to be
sorry for your sins, first.
MACHETE
I'm not sorry.
PADRE
I'm not surprised.
MACHETE
They used me.
PADRE
They use all of us. Welcome to the
real world.
MACHETE
They need to pay.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 46.
PADRE
In money or blood?
MACHETE
Either. Both.
PADRE
I am a man of faith. I took a vow
of peace. You want me to help you
kill all these men?
MACHETE
Yes, bro. I mean, Padre.
PADRE
I'll see what I can do.
Padre shakes his head, makes the sign of the cross.
Machete follows Padre into the church sacristy, a plush
bachelor pad.
MACHETE
When I get the money, I'll give
some to the church.
PADRE
You think Jesus wants your blood
money, Judas?
Machete shrugs. Padre lights a cigar and pours them two
drinks.
PADRE (CONT'D)
How much blood money are we talking
about?
MACHETE
A hundred-fifty thousand.
PADRE
(SPIT-TAKE)
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I want you
to say ten Our Fathers, ten Hail
Marys and ten Glory Be's, and I
want you to light a candle for Dad.
Machete eyes a bank of security monitors. Different
surveillance shots of the interior and exterior of the
church.
PADRE (CONT'D)
I had them installed last year. Too
many things were walking away from
the altar, the collection plate.
Check this out.
Padre points at a kneeler in front of a rustic altar-looking
armoire. Machete kneels.
Padre opens the armoire revealing an HD TV inside.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 48.
PADRE (CONT'D)
No time for that now. You need to
see this. I Tivo'd it earlier.
News footage of the sniper attack plays. Machete sees himself
on the big screen.
MACHETE
Stop it.
Padre pauses.
Machete picks out BENZ helping MCLAUGHLIN into the LIMO.
MACHETE (CONT'D)
That one. He's the one who hired
me. Benz.
PADRE
That's Michael Booth. McLaughlin's
aide or something. Cabrones, los
dos. Why would he hire you to kill
his boss?
The video replays part of the interview with McLaughlin from
earlier.
MCLAUGHLIN
(ON TV)
.....that I may return to the
senate and fight on.
NEWS ANCHOR
(voice-over on TV)
Polls show McLaughlin's numbers are
surging since the assassination
attempt and officials say they've
put a hold on the ethics committee
investigation into McLaughlin's
ties to the Freedom Force militia.
Meanwhile, police continue to scour
the city for the perpetrator. If
you have any information on the
whereabouts of this man--
Machete's mug fills the screen. Padre clicks it off.
MACHETE
Where does he live?
PADRE
Machete, you can't just kill
everyone!
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 49.
MACHETE
I'll leave some for you.
PADRE
That's not what I meant.
Benz sits behind McLaughlin's desk. Sniper across from him.
SNIPER
Lead's ran cold. He's underground.
Probably back in the homeland by
now.
Benz's fax machine powers on. Benz snaps his fingers and
Sniper pulls the fax as it's coming out.
SNIPER (CONT'D)
Ho-ly shit. Who knew that your
Mexican day laborer was a goddamn
Federale?!
Phone rings. Benz answers.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 50.
BENZ
Yeah.
MACHETE
(ON PHONE)
My money.
BENZ
Holy Mother of Christ. You've got
some balls. You missed, asshole.
MACHETE
Or else.
BENZ
Or else what?...Hello?
Machete hangs up.
He drives the windy road to Benz's estate.
Benz enters to find the phone ringing. He answers.
BENZ
June? April?
MACHETE
(ON PHONE)
Or else this.
BENZ
Where is my wife and daughter!?!
Click.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 52.
Padre opens the back of the hearse and sees the naked mom and
daughter passed out inside.
PADRE
Holy...
Padre crosses himself.
Machete gets back into Elektra's car. Elektra looks across
him at Luz.
ELEKTRA
"Feelings of righteousness and
purpose."
MACHETE
Drive.
In the rear view mirror; A TRUCK SPEEDS towards them.
ELEKTRA
Sure thing, Boss.
The truck REAR ENDS them, sending Elektra's car over the
curb. They rattle around inside like ragdolls.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Sonofabitch!
She jumps out, pissed.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
What the fuck, man?
The Militia men open fire, her windows shatter.
She ducks back in, peels out. The truck revs up and pursues.
A second TRUCK joins the chase.
They sandwich Elektra's car between them.
Machete chops off the driver's hand of the right-side truck
and the truck veers off, crashing.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 56.
They keep up the gunfire. A slug catches Machete's shoulder.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
My gun!
Machete unholsters it and fires at the truck. The handcannon
shatters the engine block and the truck flips.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
You're shot.
MACHETE
No hospital.
ELEKTRA
Let me bring you to a safehouse. I
can negotiate your safety. We'll
bring Booth down together.
MACHETE
Onions.
ELEKTRA
You want onions?! Oh shit, you're
delirious, dying. Don't die please.
MACHETE
Onions!
ELEKTRA
What? What do you do with...
It's a mess.
Machete chops onions. A pot boils over with thick green
fluid.
He pours the boiling green gunk into a bowl.
MACHETE
Come here.
ELEKTRA
What, is this some "old Aztec" shit
that's supposed to heal you?
MACHETE
Yes.
He sucks the mixture up with a TURKEY BASTER.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 57.
Hands it to her. It smells nasty.
ELEKTRA
What do I do with this?
Machete points to the hole in his shoulder.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Wait, you want this gunk squirted
in there...I don't...
Machete takes a swig of Tequila.
MACHETE
Do it.
ELEKTRA
I....can't.
She takes a swig, pops a pill and stares at the bloody hole.
She holds her arm up ready...
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Fuck.
She JAMS the baster in. The fluid squirts in the hole and
SIZZLES.
Elektra watches in awe as dark green fluid dribbles out of
the wound, followed by a thick yellow goo with veins and
lumps of flesh.
It bubbles like a volcano, she peers in and suddenly...
It BURSTS and SPRAYS pus and flesh chunks all over her.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Ahhhh!
Elektra runs screaming into the bathroom.
April and June rouse from two small cots in a drugged and
drunken stupor. They're surprised to find they're naked in a
windowless room. There's a small webcam in a corner.
APRIL
Mom? Where are we? I'm scared.
JUNE
Me, too, honey.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 58.
APRIL
What is this place?
POV: WEBCAM. Grainy B&W; image.
They embrace, huddle.
Elektra walks out in a hot new outfit, blow drying her hair.
ELEKTRA
That was disgusting.
Machete smashes knife handles off and fits the blades into a
belt under his jacket.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Do you mind not breaking knives in
the house? It's kind of one of my
rules. I mean...
Elektra's phone rings. It's Boss.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Oh shit. All right. I'm going to
tell him what you told me. Wish me
luck.
MACHETE
Luck.
ELEKTRA
(ANSWERING PHONE)
Yeah.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
Where the hell have you been?
ELEKTRA
I had a little fender bender.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
Goddamnit! I said where have you
been?
ELEKTRA
Calm down! I have him right now.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 59.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
You do?
ELEKTRA
Yes, but it's complicated. He's
innocent. Sort of.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
Sonofabitch. What kind of Stockholm
Syndrome bullshit are you trying to
pull?
ELEKTRA
Just listen. Michael Booth
orchestrated the assassination
attempt on McLaughlin's life.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
His own advisor?
ELEKTRA
That's right. This was all some
kind of hare-brained scheme to call
off the ethics investigation. I
think I can get Machete to testify.
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
You do, huh? Well that doesn't
matter because no charges are going
to be filed against Booth.
ELEKTRA
What?
BOSS
(ON PHONE)
The order's come down from top
brass: No more black eyes on DHS.
Bring in the Mexican. Dead or
alive. Now are you gonna DO your
fucking job or are you gonna LOSE
your fucking job?
Elektra is stunned.
BOSS (CONT'D)
(ON PHONE)
Agent Rivers! Agent Rivers! Answer
me, goddamnit!
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 60.
Elektra hangs up, throws the cellphone into the bowl of green
onion gunk.
She looks around for Machete, but he's disappeared while she
was on the phone.
Padre sits at a computer, with streaming webcam video of June
and April on the screen.
PADRE
What do you want me to do with
this? We can't keep them locked up
forever.
Makeshift infirmary for the wounded.
Von oversees the patching up of several of his men.
VON
The day is upon us, my friends.
We'll take down the interloper, and
anyone who gets in our way.
Subdued chorus of mild approval.
VON (CONT'D)
Do you believe in freedom?!
Louder chants of "yeah!"
VON (CONT'D)
Will you die for freedom!
Louder -- "YEAH!"
VON (CONT'D)
If that's what it takes to make you
free, I will kill you with my own
bare hands, Amen.
The men look at each other as if trying to gauge the big
man's sanity.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 61.
VON (CONT'D)
Heal up, brothers. Heal up good.
The day is upon us.
Sniper patrols the streets, looking for Machete.
His cellphone beeps with notice of a video message -- LINK TO
APRIL'S WEBSITE.
He checks it out -- the WEBCAM footage of April and June
naked in the windowless room.
SNIPER
Oh shit.
Benz calls him. He clicks over from the message with his
bluetooh earpiece so he can still see the webcam video.
SNIPER
Yeah.
BENZ
(ON PHONE)
You seeing this?
SNIPER
Yeah.
BENZ
(ON PHONE)
We have to find him. We have to
find him now! I'm going to rip his
heart out with my teeth!
Luz ducks and runs through the truck, as bullets blast apart
everything. She grabs a gun and shoots back through the
windows.
Shrapnel sprays her face, a huge SLIVER of GLASS SINKS into
her eye.
She yanks it out and shoots back.
LUZ
Hijo de Puta!
Luz is shot in the chest, she flies back blood spewing out.
She sees the men reloading through the window.
Luz is bleeding, one eye gouged out, fading fast.
LUZ (CONT'D)
You're coming with me Maricons!
With her last strength Luz opens the gas valves on the stove
and passes out.
Booth smashes down a door.
It's the room where June and April were.
It's empty. The nuns' robes are on the floor.
Sniper and a few of the henchmen hold a battered Padre down
on the ground.
SNIPER
Where is he?
PADRE
In your nightmares.
Sniper looks to Booth, who nods.
Sniper hammers a nail into Padre's hand. Padre grits his
teeth against the pain.
PADRE (CONT'D)
(TO BOOTH)
You're afraid to get your hands
dirty, so you make others carry out
your sins.
Sniper raises the hammer again, but Booth stills his hand,
takes the hammer.
Booth leans over Padre's other hand.
BENZ
You want to be a martyr? I'm good
at making martyrs.
Booth raises the hammer.
PADRE
Like McLaughlin?
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 66.
BENZ
That's right. In our own way, we
can all be like Christ. Too bad for
you, you chose the worst way.
He slams another nail into Padre's other hand.
PADRE
You're so drunk with power, you
ordered the hit on your own boss.
BENZ
This is the boss.
Booth hammers the nails in one by one. Bloody Padre screams.
BENZ (CONT'D)
Now for the last time... where are
my wife and daughter?
Padre, beaten and bloody, laughs.
Benz puts two in his chest. Padre expires.
Machete sees Padre crucified.
Elektra sits in a bench at the rear of the church.
ELEKTRA
I came back to look for you, and I
found him like... this.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 67.
Machete seems oblivious to Elektra. Focused on Padre's
lifeless crucified body.
FLASH CUT FLASHBACK
YOUNG MACHETE dropping the sugarcane sword and picking up the
MACHETE...
Swinging wildly, chopping up the bad guys...
PREACHER DAD's dead body...
Another boy's hand picks up the preacher's collar...
Puts it on... YOUNG PADRE...
YOUNG PADRE watches SWAT team surrounding treehouse...

END FLASHBACK
ELEKTRA
(IN SPANISH)
"The more things change--"
MACHETE ELEKTRA
(in Spanish) (in Spanish)
"--the more they stay the "--the more they stay the
same." same."
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
That's what my Grandma used to say.
MACHETE
The guards told me that before they
beat me.
ELEKTRA
I'm sorry.
MACHETE
You came to arrest me?
ELEKTRA
Not me. I'm out. But others will.
MACHETE
Out?
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 68.
ELEKTRA
They don't care about Booth. They
just want to wipe you out. You're
an embarrassment to the feds. I
guess I am, too.
She comes close to him.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
You could have killed me.
MACHETE
(SMILING)
The day's still young.
ELEKTRA
I want to help you.
She kisses him once, again. Again.
MACHETE
Help me find Booth.
Elektra weighs it.
ELEKTRA
First things first, I need a drink.
Elektra and Machete walk in laughing with a bottle of
Tequila. She flops down on the couch.
ELEKTRA
Shit my heel is broke.
MACHETE
Give it here.
ELEKTRA
It's nice having a man around. It's
been a while.
Machete pulls out some tools and fixes her heels.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
How long awhile you ask? Well,
About two years.
Machete looks up.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 69.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Oh that got your attention? Hmm,
Actually you're better than my last
boyfriend. He never listened. I
don't know why I got so desperate.
Don't want to grow old alone I
guess. You ever get that feeling
you're alone and that you'll never
meet that one person...
Machete's POV: He sees Elektra talking, but only hears a
monkey like jabbering coming out of her mouth.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Are you listening to me?
Machete takes a drink off the Tequila bottle.
MACHETE
Si.
ELEKTRA
Give me that bottle.
He hands it to her. She swigs.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
So what happens now, when you get
him, that's it? It's over?
Elektra hears a noise in the back of the house.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Did you hear that? Stay here.
Elektra runs into the back.
Machete hears a scream from the bedroom. He heads towards it.
Machete enters. The lights are low.
Elektra grabs him from behind, gropes him.
ELEKTRA
Oh wow...is that a machete in your
pocket or...
MACHETE
You're borracha.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 70.
She pushes him down on the bed and stands over him. She's in
lingerie.
ELEKTRA
I'm gonna fuck your brains out old
man!
She pushes him back onto the bed.
She tears her clothes off, jumps on him and fucks his brains
out.
Elektra's on top; manic, yelling, scratching. The bed frame
CRACKS
Machete sees a SHADOW of a man through the window curtain and
another...
He tries to push her off him.
She WON'T let him! She's an animal, screeches and yells in
SPANISH.
Machete grabs the gun off the night table, just as the HIT
SQUAD gets there.
He manages to keep Elektra happy as he BLASTS the MASKED
HITMEN coming in.
They crash through the windows and doors as he finishes
everyone off at once.
Elektra lets out a final scream and collapses on him.
ELEKTRA
Wow that was...
She notices the carnage.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Oh my god...did I wake the
neighbors?
They get up. She pulls the ski mask off a dead gunman.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 71.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
This is one of ours. He works for
the agency.
MACHETE
Come on!
They grab guns and run out.
Back to the moment Luz has passed out in the truck.
Pancho barks; BITES Luz on the ASS and pulls her out of the
Taco Truck seconds before it explodes.
CUT TO:
Sniper struggles as they drag him toward a circular saw.
SNIPER
No! No!
MACHETE
Looking for someone?
SNIPER
Oh my God... Please... No. Please!
NO!!!
They bring Sniper up to the saw and grind away at him.
Luz and Pancho look on.
Booth walks towards McLaughlin's room, cellphone in hand,
trying to reach Sniper. Only gets a gurgling, buzzing sound.
BENZ
Goddamn A T & T.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 74.
Booth enters McLaughlin's hospital room. McLaughlin is
dressed in a suit and a girl is brushing his hair while
another brightens his cheeks with a little makeup.
MCLAUGHLIN
Where the fuck have you been?
BENZ
Taking care of business.
MCLAUGHLIN
My business is here. Did you see
those crews out there? They expect
a statement.
(noticing Booth's ragged
APPEARANCE)
Jesus, what happened to you?
BENZ
Nothing. Just had a little talk
with a priest.
MCLAUGHLIN
Well, what am I going to tell `em?
BENZ
Whatever you tell them, I'm sure
it'll be golden.
(off McLaughlin's blank
LOOK)
Just feed them the line about
standing steadfast in the face of
terrorism, continuing the fight.
You know it by heart.
McLaughlin looks relieved.
MCLAUGHLIN
I do. All right. Once this is done,
you need to take a vacation. You
need some air.
BENZ
Maybe.
MCLAUGHLIN
No doubt about it. You're losing
your marbles, Booth.
The girl finishes the makeup and hair job, and smiles at
McLaughlin.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 75.
MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)
It's showtime.
McLaughlin stands and exits, Booth right behind them. As they
leave, we focus on the TV set in McLaughlin's room, showing
the front of the hospital and the news crews outside.
Suddenly the ticker shows BREAKING NEWS... SHOOTOUT AT LOCAL
CHURCH RELATED TO MCLAUGHLIN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT? EXCLUSIVE
VIDEO... DEVELOPING...
McLaughlin stumbling.
MCLAUGHLIN
Could somebody fucking help me? I
think I'm having a heart attack.
Booth takes hold of him and ushers him out the back door.
Booth drives. McLaughlin pops vicodins with a bottle of
Maker's Mark.
MCLAUGHLIN
What did you do, Booth? You
jeopardized my career with that
wetback! He could have fucking
killed me!
BENZ
Not with that scope.
MCLAUGHLIN
You stupid sonofabitch. You pull
something like this, without
consulting me?! You fucked me. You
are a stupid sonofabitch. The press
is going to demand answers! You got
another brilliant solution for
that?
They stop.
Suddenly, MACHETE is standing on top of the limo. He's
throwing knives into the open sunroof.
McLaughlin is pinned to the seat.
Booth exits the vehicle and hightails it. Machete pursues.
Von's phone rings. Von sits on a couch watching the news.
Booth's mug fills the screen. Von makes no sudden move to
answer.
MAN
Shouldn't you--?
VON
Let him stew awhile.
Von mutes the TV, answers the phone.
VON (CONT'D)
Von here.
Benz drives.
BENZ
Where are you, goddamnit!? I'm
bringing him up.
VON
Up? Up where?
BENZ
Up your fat, fishbelly ass!
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 79.
VON
Fine. Bring him here. Papa Von's
got a big surprise a-waiting.
Sis is being savagely attacked by Torrez.
Elektra hears it, but thinks it's Sis fucking.
ELEKTRA
Fucking shit, bitch. Make him pay
for a goddamn hotel.
Thuds get louder, then stop.
Elektra looks up.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Sis?
Bedroom door opens slowly.
Elektra sees the horror inside. Puts a hand to her mouth to
staunch the flow of projectile vomit.
Then she's taken from behind by Torrez's henchmen.
TORREZ
She was just a warmup. Now I'm
ready for dessert.
He edges in.
Booth is secured in the brig.
Booth flings hot coffee in the guard's face, jerks his belt
and smashes the guy's face into the bars. Snags the keys and
escapes from the brig. He pulls a few bucks out of his pocket
and flings them down Sonny-style on the prone guard.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 81.
Booth and Von showdown. Booth slaughters Von with an American
flag through the throat, coming out his spine at the back of
the neck.
BENZ
Glory, glory, hallelujah.
Machete skids into the warehouse. Fuel barrels line a far
wall.
Torrez is ready for him.
TORREZ
All roads lead to Hell, eh,
Machete?
Machete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two
images blur into one.
TORREZ (CONT'D)
Most people die in the fire, but
you survived, you unlucky bastard.
MACHETE
I was born in the fire. It wasn't
luck.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83.
TORREZ
Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good
job picking melons. While I bought
the world.
MACHETE
What good is it...
TORREZ.
.. for a man to gain the whole
world yet forfeit his soul? Mark
8:36. I know it better than you
Machete. Your father taught it to
me, too!
Torrez ATTACKS Machete
The two FIGHT with sword and machete.
Elektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows
from the samurai swords.
One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety.
The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand
and slash Torrez across the front.
On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften.
TORREZ
(IN SPANISH)
Machete, we were friends. We stood
for something...
Machete impales TORREZ between the eyes.
Blood shoots out his mouth.
MACHETE
I'm still standing...Puta.
Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead.
EXPLOSIONS and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN.
