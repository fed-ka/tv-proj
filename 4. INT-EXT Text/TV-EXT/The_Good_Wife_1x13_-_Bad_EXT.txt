      MARCO.  30, African-American.  He glares at an approaching 
      Alicia and Sweeney.  A weirder trio you could not imagine.

                    Sweeney.  What you need?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #112    "Bad"    YELLOW COLLATED    12/16/09    37.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Just a minute of your time, Marco.

                                  MARCO
                    My time s like anything else.  One 
                    hundred percent negotiable.

    But Sweeney s already forking over a pair of fifties.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    Marco, this is my lawyer.  I need 
                    you to tell her where I was the day 
                    my wife disappeared.

                                  MARCO
                          (shrugs)
                    I got here about three-thirty like 
                    I always do.  You rolled up after 
                    that, looking to score some opie--

                                  SWEENEY
                          (to Alicia)
                    Opium.  Sometimes mixed with hash.

                                  MARCO
                    You bought me out and took off.  
                    After that-- hell if I know.

      Alicia looks at Sweeney in disbelief.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    I lit up in my car.  Next thing I 
                    remember, I was at home, waiting 
                    for Carolyn.  Now you see why I 
                    didn t tell you before?

                                  ALICIA
                    You didn t do it?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Kill Carolyn?  No.

                                  ALICIA
                    So why the games, the jokes?

                                  MARCO
                    Do you guys mind?  I m working here.

      Right.  Sweeney and Alicia start away, Sweeney considering 
      Alicia s question...

                                  SWEENEY
                    You know when I started to get the 
                    best tables in restaurants?  The 
                    day they thought I killed my wife.   

      Alicia just stares at him, baffled. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Is it really that important to get 
                    the best tables in restaurant?

                                  SWEENEY
                          (looks at her oddly)
                    Of course.  Why do you look at me the 
                    way you do; why am I on the front 
                    page of the Chicago Sun-Times; why 
                    does Page Sixcare what play I saw 
                    last night?  If your wife is dead, 
                    and everyone thinks you did it, 
                    well... what s the difference? 


      ...suddenly in a field, POLICE DOGS howling ghostly in the 
      morning fog, as we drift through the white-out finding...

      ...Chicago PD digging.  Three police dogs alongside the cops, 
      intent on a patch of ground.  Something found.
