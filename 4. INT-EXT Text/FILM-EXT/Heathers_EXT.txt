SUBURBAN STREET--DAY
VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is
jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.
Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.
NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY
VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an
increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.
PROMENADE--DAY
VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.
THE SAWYER HOME--DAY
Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto
the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.
She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as
the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative
wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.
INY.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY
VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she
launches into voice-over narration.
VERONICA (V.O.)
Heather told me she teaches people
Real Life.
Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the
mirror then rambles off.
SCHOOL PARKING LOT
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking
lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a
car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.
VERONICA (V.O.)
..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers
are the same. Didn't you see The
Breakfast Club?
BETTY FINN'S TABLE
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY
FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS.
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl
in the commercials and the videos.
JOCKS' TABLE
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts
of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.
HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
I'm the blonde in the bikini on the
horse holding a Pepsi can.
THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY
Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA and
the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard holding
different colored mallets next to matching balls. HEATHER
CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
God, they won't expell him. They'll
just suspend him for a week or something.
HEATHER CHANDLER
He used a real gun. They should
throw his ass in jail.
VERONICA
No way. He used blanks. All J.D.
really did was ruin two pairs of
pants...Maybe not even that...
(giggling)
Can you bleach out urine stains?
HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S
green one.
HEATHER CHANDLER
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought
you were giving up on high school guys.
VERONICA
Never say never.
HEATHER DUKE
What are you going to do, Heather?
Take the two shots or send me out?
The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous faces.
HEATHER CHANDLER
Did you have a brain tumor for
breakfast? First you ask if you can
be red, knowing that I'm always red...
HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings
her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent
green one rocketing into a flower bed.
HEATHER DUKE
Shit.
HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
HEATHER CHANDLER
(to HEATHER DUKE)
Damn. It's your turn Heather.
HEATHER DUKE
No, it's Heather's turn.
HEATHER MCNAMARA hits her ball through a wicket and squeals.
HEATHER CHANDLER
Anyway, I can say never to high
school. I've got David.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
King David.
HEATHER CHANDLER
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll
understand the diff between a Remington
University man like David and a
Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam-
thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.
HEATHER DUKE tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
No way, no day!
VERONICA
Give it up girl!
As her friends howl, HEATHER DUKE slams her ball out of the
flower bed. The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes
through a wicket. HEATHER DUKE squeals in delight.
VERONICA
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Holy shit!
God, that was unbelievable!
HEATHER CHANDLER
What. A. Shot.
HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
VERONICA begins setting up her shot.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
So tonight's the night. Are you
two excited?
HEATHER CHANDLER
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her
first Remington Party. Blow it tonight
girl and it's keggers with kids all
next year.
VERONICA
(missing her shot)
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've
been set up with? Witty and urbane
pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
HEATHER CHANDLER
Don't worry. David says he's very
so he's very.
HEATHER CHANDLER again hits her ball into HEATHER DUKE'S.
HEATHER DUKE
Why?
HEATHER CHANDLER
Why not?
HEATHER CHANDLER slams HEATHER DUKE's ball back into the
flower bed. VERONICA'S MOM calls out the back screen door.
MOM
Heather, your Mother's here.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Come on whoever wants a ride.
As the HEATHERS head into the house, VERONICA picks up HEATHER
DUKE'S ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets.
Veronica's MOM, carrying a tray of pate, and DAD, carrying a
Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table.
DAD
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
VERONICA
All right.
VERONICA sinks into the empty middle deck chair.
DAD
So what was the first week of
Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
VERONICA
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
MOM
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
VERONICA
I guess.
MOM
Any contestants worth mentioning?
VERONICA
Maybe. There's kind of a dark
horse now in the running.
DAD
(looking up)
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
me why I read this spy crap.
VERONICA
(smiling)
Because you're an idiot.
DAD
Oh yeah, that's it.
DAD immediately returns to reading with a wide grin.
MOM
(shaking her head)
You two....
VERONICA
Great pate, but I'm going to have
to motor if I want to be ready for
the party tonight.
OUTSIDE 7-11--NIGHT
A Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with
HEATHER CHANDLER at the wheel. VERONICA pops out of the
car, into the store. HEATHER CHANDLER clamors to her.
HEATHER CHANDLER
Corn nuts!
ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY
NIGHT
The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...
THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT
The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's
backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
together by the first wicket.
J.D. (V.O.)
Goddamn, no wonder you looked so
mangled when I came through the window.
Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.
VERONICA (V.O.)
I've always treated Heather's teen
queen power plays as bullshit.....
As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a
rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.
VERONICA (V.O.)
But I'm really scared. Who am I going
to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound
like an Afterschool Special.
The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
resting side by side at another wicket.
J.D. (V.O.)
That was my first game of Strip
Croquet, you know. I thank you.
VERONICA (V.O.)
You're welcome. It's a lot more
interesting than just flinging
off your clothes and boning away
on the neighbor's swing set.
VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her
panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.
J.D. (O.S.)
Well, I don't know. There's
something to be said for...Ouch!
VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an
artful pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss.
VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle.
VERONICA
What a night.
J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on
it, closing her eyes tightly.
VERONICA
What a life. I almost moved into high
school out of sixth grade because I
was some genius. We all decided to
chuck the idea because I'd have
trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.
VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and
gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she
murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.
VERONICA
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use
my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss
to wear and how to hit three keggers
before curfew. Some genius.
J.D.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that
deserves to die.
VERONICA
Killing her won't solve anything.
J.D.
A well-timed lightning bolt through
her window and Monday morning, all
the other heathers, shit, everybody
would be cast fucking adrift.
VERONICA
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
J.D.
See the condoms in the grass over
there. We killed tonight, Veronica.
We murdered our baby.
VERONICA
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
J.D.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
VERONICA
There's a big difference between
the most popular girl in the school
and dead sperm.
They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.
J.D.
I guess I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about.
VERONICA
I know exactly what the hell you're
talking about and you're right, you
don't know what the hell you're
talking about. Let's just grow up,
be adults, and die.
J.D.
Good plan.
VERONICA
But before that, I'd like to see
Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DAY
Pulling their coats over their wet clothes, VERONICA and the
HEATHERS come out of the school.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
VERONICA
Uh-huh.
HEATHER DUKE
T.V. cameras!
In the distance, a T.V. CAMERA CREW is interviewing STUDENTS.
HEATHER DUKE dashes toward them. HEATHER MCNAMARA freezes.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!
HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward
the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch
on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a nearby trashcan.
THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK
Just as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are
seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them.
Pate is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette.
DAD
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
VERONICA walks into view and sits down.
VERONICA
All right.
DAD
So what was the first day after
Heather's suicide like?
VERONICA
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
MOM
Terrible thing. So will we get to
meet this dark horse prom contender?
VERONICA
Maybe.
DAD
(looking at his cigarette)
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
me why I smoke these damn things?
VERONICA
(smiling)
Because you're an idiot.
DAD
Oh yeah, that's it.
DAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin.
MOM
(shaking her head)
You two....
VERONICA
Greate pate, but I'm going to have
to motor if I want to be ready for
the funeral tomorrow.
CHURCH PARKING LOT--DAY
KURT KELLY and RAM stand by RAM'S van.
KURT
We on tonight man?
RAM
I still got to talk to Heather,
dude. Weird funeral, huh?
KURT
Pretty weird.
Geeks RODNEY, FAT CYNIC, and BRACES thrust by KURT and RAM.
BRACES obliviously steps on KURT's foot.
KURT
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
RAM
Let's kick his ass.
KURT
Cool off, we're seniors.
RAM
Goddamn Geek!
BRACES gives them "the finger".
BRACES
(awkwardly defiant)
Sit and spin.
KURT and RAM turn to each other more amused than angered.
KURT
That little prick.
The bolting Jocks effortlessly catch BRACES and put him into a
hunched-over position. The other Geeks look on, ashamed.
KURT
All right you piece of shit fag,
do you like to suck big dicks?
BRACES
Cut it out!
RAM pushes BRACES down harder.
KURT
Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.
RODNEY
Leave him alone, Kurt.
J.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT,
wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that
reads THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked.
RAM (O.S.)
Say it!
BRACES
Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.
Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries.
BRACES
I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm!
I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?
KURT
I'm sure your friends are happy
to hear that.
(with a lisp)
Right, guys?
ANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT
VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet
lately, consoling me and stuff.
It'll be really very. Promise.
Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off
his face as his friends glumly watch on.
VERONICA
All right, but I hope it isn't
going to be one of those nights where
they get shitfaced and take us to a
pasture to tip cows.
COW PASTURE--NIGHT
A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM
scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA
and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.
KURT
Is it sleeping, dude?
RAM
I think so, man.
KURT
Then get over on my side. Oh shit,
cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
RAM
Punch it in!
KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the
COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but
VERONICA glares it away.
KURT
Count of three, guy.
KURT AND RAM
One. Two. Three!
An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes
against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA.
DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT
KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.
KURT
"When I get that feeling, I need
sexual healing....."
VERONICA
Yeah, right, asshole.
VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately
stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's
intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline.
Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT
squints up the hill and falls over backwards.
J.D.
What is this shit?
VERONICA
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A
double date. I tried to tell you
at the funeral but you rode off.
KURT
(still face down)
"Feel like making bah da dah bah da
dah, feel like making love."
J.D.
Another fucking Heather.
(harshly laughs)
I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior
tonight. Seven high schools in seven
states and the only thing different
was my locker combination. We've broke
through the peer pressure cooker. So
what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..
VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.
VERONICA
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
J.D.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn,
takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.
KURT
"And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."
SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT
A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk
through the parking lot toward the woods.
RAM
(singing)
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever
need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello
Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
KURT
Shut the fuck up, all right.
RAM
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is
some of the finest pussy in the school
and we don't even have to buy it a
hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.
CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT
VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods.
She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT
and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.
KURT
Hi Veronica.
VERONICA
(forced cheerfulness)
Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
RAM smacks his hands together.
RAM
So do we just start fucking?
VERONICA
I've made a circle on each end of
the clearing. Ram, you come over here.
KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.
A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at
the opposite end of the foggy clearing.
VERONICA
When you get in the circle, strip.
The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.
RAM
What about you?
VERONICA
I was hoping you'd rip my clothes
off me, sport.
RAM
Oh. Good idea.
KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.
VERONICA
Count of three, guys.
RAM giggles in anticipation.
VERONICA
One.
KURT finally cracks a smile.
VERONICA
Two.
J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his
right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.
J.D.
Three.
J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead.
VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using
both hands, she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs
away onto the path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.
VERONICA
Shucks.
J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.
J.D.
Did you miss him completely?
VERONICA
(giggling)
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth
it just to see the look on....
J.D.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling
and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.
THE PATH
A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.
OFF THE PATH
J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees.
THE CLEARING
VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.
THE PATH
KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly
moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun.
KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan.
THE CLEARING
VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He
does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding
and dead, dead, dead.
KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.
J.D.
Now!
In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips
around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.
SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT
Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car
already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER shouts.
MILNER
I heard it that time!
McCORD
Wha?
MILNER
Another gunshot! From the woods!
McCORD
Shit, let's roll.
The two officer explode out of the car.
THE CLEARING
J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA
zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.
VERONICA
Kurt doesn't look too good.
J.D.
Remember he's left-handed.
A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.
MILNER (O.S.)
Keep going until you hit the clearing!
J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run
into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into
the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.
McCORD
Mother of Shit!
MILNER
Call in!
MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.
MILNER
I heard something out there. I'm
checking it out.
MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is
holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.
McCORD
This is Officer McCord and I've got
two dead bodies in the woods behind
Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of
them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.
IN THE WOODS
VERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos.
ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS
MILNER blindly barrels through the woods.
JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS
VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up
a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.
J.D.
Faster!
IN THE WOODS
MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.
THE HILL
VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.
MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam
the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.
THE SAWYER CAR
VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin
taking off their clothes.
THE HILL
MILNER continues to move up the hill.
THE SAWYER CAR
VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.
OUTSIDE THE CAR
MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-
talkie startles him.
McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?
MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie.
MILNER
Think what I heard was just a
stinking owl. All I got is two kids
making out in the backseat of a
car. Should I pry them apart?
McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
Forget it. I got all the answers
back here, partner.
THE SAWYER CAR
Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They
catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.
THE CLEARING
MILNER runs back into the clearing.
MILNER
What's the deal?
McCORD
Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot
each other.
MILNER
That's Kurt Kelly!
McCORD
Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.
MILNER
Oh my God, suicide? Why?
McCORD
Does this answer your question?
McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the
bottles of Perrier water.
MILNER
Oh man, they were fags!
McCORD
Listen up, "We could never reveal our
forbidden love to an uncaring and
ununderstanding world."
MILNER
Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade
magazine Honorable Mention...
MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.
MILNER
Wait a second. How did they shoot
each other if we heard two separate
sets of gunshots?
McCORD
Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm
high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't
try to analyze it. The quarterback
buggering the linebacker. What a waste.
MILNER
Oh the humanity.
STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING
VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.
THE SAWYER CAR
A battered VERONICA climbs into the front seat, pulling on her
blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D. rumbles
from the back as other cars begin to fill the lot.
VERONICA
We killed them, didn't we?
J.D.
Of course.
VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm
of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the
lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh
of VERONICA's hand as she wails away.
VERONICA
Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in
outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.
J.D.
You believed it because you wanted
to believe it. Your true feelings were
too gross and icky for you to face.
VERONICA
I did not want them dead.
J.D.
Did to.
VERONICA
Did not.
J.D.
Did to.
VERONICA
Did not.
J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-to's".
VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and
singing "We're Off to See the Wizard." J.D.'s "did-to's"
get louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.
PARKING LOT
HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering
through the parking lot to contemplate Veronica's hiccuping car
and its sparring occupants.
HEATHER DUKE
Ah, young love.
The SQUEALING GIRL bounds up to the Heathers.
SQUEELING GIRL
Did you hear? School's cancelled
today because Kurt and Ram killed
themselves in a repressed
homosexual suicide pact.
HEATHER DUKE
(incredulous, but amused)
No way!
THE SAWYER CAR
J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit
cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes
the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.
J.D.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt
and Ram had nothing to offer the school
but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
VERONICA
(looking to her burnt hand)
Sure. Can we make an ice run
before the funeral?
STUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out.
CEMETERY GROUNDS--DAY
A typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY,
stands over his son's open grave. FATHER FAUST and a
seated mixture of ADULTS and STUDENTS watch on.
MR. KELLY
If there's any way you can hear me,
Kurt buddy, I don't care that you
really were some pansy. You're my
flesh-and-blood. You made me proud.
I love my homosexual son. My son's
gay and I love him!
In dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D.
VERONICA
Your son's dead and you love him.
J.D.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would
react to a son with a limp wrist
with a pulse?
They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her.
She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is soaked
in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated grimace.
SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY
BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in
delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.
BETTY
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
VERONICA
Don't get cocky, girl.
BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.
BETTY
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as
exciting as your other friends.
VERONICA
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
BETTY once again bends and raises.
BETTY
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
VERONICA
(warmly)
Shoot.
BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.
VERONICA
Betty, your daydreams are a lot
better than my realities, believe
me. I'm afraid though it's time to
get your butt kicked.
BETTY
Ronnie!
VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead
hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she
determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.
BETTY
Hey, you're not settling for the two
shots are you? Knock me out girl.
It's the only way.
VERONICA
It's not my style, okay?
BETTY
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing
toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does
not budge as the ball whizzes past her.
HEATHER DUKE
Brav-o!
BETTY FINN
(nervously)
I've got to get going, Veronica.
See you at the studio.
VERONICA
Sure. See ya.
HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and
fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Croquet won't be the same without Heather.
HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN.
HEATHER DUKE
Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The
Whitney James Teenage Suicide
Prevention T.V. Special isn't going
to be taped at the studios. It's
going to be done in the Park.
BETTY
But I thought...
HEATHER DUKE
(heading back)
It's going to be like a big picnic.
Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!
LATER IN THE GAME
HEATHER DUKE's red ball slams into HEATHER MCNAMARA's green one.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
Shit.
VERONICA
So did you call people to tell them
how to get to the studio tonight?
HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER MACNAMARA's ball into
the flower bed.
HEATHER DUKE
Back off. I called everyone, even that
Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone
a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!
HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.
VERONICA
You're so polluted. Talking down to
people, making fake notes....
VERONICA blows her shot.
HEATHER DUKE
I don't see what gives you the right
to lecture, Ronnie. You were
soulmates with Betty Finn until you
realized you're the cover of
Seventeen magazine and she's the
before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.
HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares
to send it.
HEATHER DUKE
Some people just don't matter. Why
should those who do carry their
weight? Am I right?
As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her
own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two
balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.
VERONICA
No, you're wrong. It's not even
your turn.
The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying
against a tree, pipes in.
HEATHER MCNAMARA
She's right.....Boy, croquet's not
the same without Heather.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT
In the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit
in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing
Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad.
EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler
CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket.
CLYDE
What the fuck?
NEWS SET
Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone.
VERONICA
The world wants winners, I guess.
Not people stained with loserness.
WHITNEY JAMES
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like
it. Can I use that. It'd be
dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
VERONICA
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll
excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
WHITNEY JAMES
Sure. Ciao.
STUDIO FLOOR
Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio
lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE
grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air.
PAULINE
Everyone take their places on the stage!
(to Veronica)
Isn't this thrilling?!
VERONICA
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
PAULINE
What, the wine? I realize you're all
under 21, but it seemed like such a
perfect touch.
(shouting upward)
Could we get some more light up here?
THE STAGE
The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage.
Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a
seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar.
VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and
the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks
into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.
PAULINE
Our schools have been torn apart by
tragedy. Let's fuse them back together
through love. Let's clasp hands and
connect ourselves in one mighty circuit
like a dove.
The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp
hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through
a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage.
PAULINE (O.S.)
Let's begin a new happiness...
VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a
console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the
circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around
the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES.
PAULINE
...with no more suicide...
STUDENTS
(eeriely)
Oh yeah...
Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at
the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D.
He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.
J.D.
Holy traumatic experiences, Batman.
I'm sorry you felt you had to put
yourself through all that shit. I
told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in
the past already, right?
PAULINE
No more problems....
Devastated,
VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console.
VERONICA
Oh yeah.
VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle
of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground
around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES.
J.D.
Cute.
WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before
coolly leaning over to her microphone.
WHITNEY JAMES
Let's go for another take.
OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS
VERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She
kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the
station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types.
OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT
VERONICA pops out the studio door, running faster.
GRAVELLY ROAD
She sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound
against sharp pebbles.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK
VERONICA now barrels through the neighborhood park. She looks
to her outcast classmates. In tableau, they stare back. BETTY
FINN on a park carousel spins in and out of view.
PROMENADE
VERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer
remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the
ticket window to a bored female cashier.
CASHIER
Bargain matinees are for the first
show only.
MARTHA
Oh, I forgot.
MARTHA puts two crumpled bucks through the window. The
CASHIER shines a cruelly patronizing smile.
BLEACHERS--DAY
The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a bleacher of Jocks.
STAIRCASE WINDOW
HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of
the staircase window.
OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOUSE--NIGHT
J.D. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs
suavely crossed. He looks up to Veronica's bedroom window and
hears another whimper emerge. He puts a cigarette in his mouth
and lights it with a smile.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM
VERONICA curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her
eyes.....tighter and tighter as J.D.'s voice.
J.D. (O.S.)
"You can't ever find a place nice
and peaceful because there isn't any."
VERONICA flops around to see J.D. kneeling over her on her bed
reading Heather Duke's copy of The Catcher in the Rye.
J.D.
Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-
I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-
so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give
it a try, underline something.
J.D. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone
position, tossing the book to an enraged VERONICA.
VERONICA
Get off my bed, you sick psycho!
You think you're a rebel! You're
not a rebel! You're a sick psycho!
Do you think you're a rebel? Do you
think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
J.D.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's
call the whole thing off...Hold it!
VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she
holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into
the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that
place and peers in.
J.D.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I
love it. I usually go for whole
sentences myself, but hey this is
perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
VERONICA
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm
not on your side....
J.D. obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing
VERONICA up like an enthusiastic camp counselor.
OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT
J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with
his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began
dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He
checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads
toward the house.
VERONICA'S BEDROOM
VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie.
THE SAWYER FRONT YARD
J.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house.
FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING
The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front
of the school. STUDENTS pour out.
SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING
STUDENTS come out of their cars.
THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL
DAY
VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges
outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically
bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.
A strange voice kills it.
J.D. (O.S.)
Color me impressed.
J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting
from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks
through his assasinated vocal cords.
J.D.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
VERONICA
(vertigo city)
I thought I...you..
J.D.
You've got power, Veronica. Power I
didn't think you had. The slate is
clean.
J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
his torso. The green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.
J.D.
Pretend I did blow up the school. All
the schools. Now that you're dead,
what are you gonna do with your life?
VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.
VERONICA
Perfecto.
J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his
crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.
THE PEP ASSEMBLY
The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-
down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the
bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense
of excitement.
THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL
VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and
her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in
bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
to go inside.
