To establish.
A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads,
"GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!" A JANITOR opens the glass and
starts removing the letters.
Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
thicket on the outskirts of the school property.
ELIZABETH (V.0.)
And I can't believe it's all over. This
year flew by. And even though I'll never
teach again professionally, I've realized
that I don't need a blackboard and
classroom to set an example.
Elizabeth comes up behind them.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Hand it over.
The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
the burnouts hands her the joint.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Everything.
The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
This was a warning. Next time, I don't
call the principal. I call the cops.
Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
school THE FINGER.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
Woo-hoo!
A couple students look at her strangely.
ANGLE ON
The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"
DIM-LOOKING KID
(struggling to read)
You are... Illit... Illit...
Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
hits him.
She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"
JANITOR
Slow down!
CHYRON: BAD TEACHER
A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
reads "HERS."
A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into
the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license
plate reads "HERS."
9.
Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at
a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken
and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough
syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.
LYNN
You have that thing going around, huh?
ELIZABETH
LYNN
Are you excited for tomorrow?
ELIZABETH
Is tomorrow Saturday?
LYNN
No, it's the first day of school.
ELIZABETH
Wait, I thought I had a week to get my
class together.
LYNN
Yeah, that was last week.
ELIZABETH
(under her breath)
Fuck my ass.
LYNN
If you hate teaching so much, why don't
you just get another job?
ELIZABETH
And do what? Sell perfume at the mall?
Work at a day care center?
(slurps her big gulp)
You know, when I first got into teaching,
I thought I was doing it for all the
right reasons: short hours, summers off,
no accountability.
LYNN
I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.
ELIZABETH
From now on, my full-time job will be
finding a guy who will take care of me --
LYNN
Oh god, I pray for that --
ELIZABETH
And that makes a shit ton of money and
doesn't ask too many questions.
(licking her fingers)
I spent most of my summer hanging out at
the bars near where the Bulls practice.
Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
settle down. And they all wear condoms.
And then they take the condoms with them.
That's how paranoid they are that a girl
will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
into a condom.
LYNN
You're gonna find someone great.
ELIZABETH
I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean,
I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I
get my new tits, I'll probably be a --
13.
LYNN
You don't want to do that. You're
already so pretty.
ELIZABETH
I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a
chance against all those Barbies dolls
out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may
she rest in peace.
Lynn checks her watch.
LYNN
We should finish up. Wally's doing that big
orientation for teachers in the auditorium.
ELIZABETH
Yeah, I'm not going to that.
LYNN
But it's mandatory.
ELIZABETH
("I'm so scared")
Ooohhh...
LYNN
Yeah, I probably won't go either. I
don't know I might. I'll probably go,
but just sit in the back. Maybe leave
early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it
by ear. Or just stay till the end.
Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.
LYNN (CONT'D)
This was fun.
ELIZABETH
Yeah, it was alright. When you said you
were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it
was going to be nicer, but this was okay.
LYNN
Sorry.
ELIZABETH
It's okay. You can get me next time.
Elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around.
ELIZABETH
(on phone, whispering)
So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy.
She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the
back tire of a late-model CAMRY.
25.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(on phone, whispering)
I'm dying and I need money for surgery.
Really? Nothing? Don't you get social
security or something?
Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash.
Garrett stands at the school entrance, holding a giant
cardboard sign that reads "CAR WASH" as a few CARS pull in.
Chase, and the other popular girls, are dressed in
seventh-grade sexy -- they've tied off their shirts.
The BOYS run around spraying each other, but mostly
spraying Garrett. Garrett laughs, mistakenly thinking
that he's part of the fun.
GARRETT
Oh, I'm gonna get you guys!
A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters.
Tristan, the bully, cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge
at Garrett.
TRISTAN
(NOTICING SOMETHING)
Whoa.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Tristan's gaze. ELIZABETH steps out
of her car. She's wearing HIGH HEELS, DAISY DUKES and a
BIKINI TOP. She looks both spectacular and ridiculous.
A couple of PARENTS look over at Elizabeth, in shock.
ELIZABETH
(calling to Parents)
Sorry I'm late.
MOTHER
(to other PARENTS)
I'm going to say something about her
outfit.
The MOTHERS vigorously nod in agreement. A DAD pipes in.
DAD
(staring hard at Elizabeth)
Well, if it helps raise money...
The other DADS vigorously nod in agreement.
BEGIN CAR WASH MONTAGE:
--Elizabeth holds the "Carwash" sign. A LINE of CARS
forms. An OLDER MAN in an immaculately clean CADILLAC,
rolls down his window and hands her money.
--Elizabeth washes in SLO MO, shakes out her hair as she
gets WET. The BOYS and their FATHERS stare at her.
--The GIRLS try to mimic Elizabeth's seductive behavior.
Their MOTHERS run over and pull them away.
--The Older Man in the Cadillac comes back to have his
car re-washed.
END MONTAGE
34.
The carwash is wrapping up. Elizabeth counts money at a
makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal
lockbox. She glances around and then shoves a large
clump of cash into her DAISY DUKES.
VOICE (O.S.)
What are you doing?
Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a TRUCK,
clearly spying.
ELIZABETH
Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy.
SASHA
Are you stealing our money?
ELIZABETH
How dare you?! I'm here early on a
Saturday for you guys. And for the
record, nobody likes a tattle tale.
SASHA
I haven't tattled. Yet.
ELIZABETH
Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and
flunk your ass. How will that look on
your resume?
SASHA
(TEARS UP)
I didn't say I would say anything.
ELIZABETH
Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta
finish counting this money.
Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
See you Monday!
Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves
back.
ANGLE ON
ANY, across the street, watching through binoculars.
She's straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a
sheen of recently-applied suntan lotion. She takes a sip
from her Camelbak, and pedals away.
35.
At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene.
The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights
a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales.
KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS.
Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha,
bundled in her winter coat, waving.
ELIZABETH
(through the window)
What do you want?
Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth
doesn't.
SASHA
Is that marijuana?
ELIZABETH
It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave
it to me. Not that it's any of your
business.
48.
SASHA
Oh, okay. Feel better.
(THEN)
My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here.
Sasha pulls out a tupperware container.
ELIZABETH
(peering through window)
Are those oatmeal raisin?
SASHA
Sugar.
Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window
a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her
window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie.
ELIZABETH
You have anything to drink?
Sasha shakes her head.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Word to the wise: stop dressing like
you're running for congress.
SASHA
I don't want to run for congress. I want
to be president.
ELIZABETH
See? That's what I'm talking about.
Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna
get punched. You really want to be
President or is that what your parents
tell to be?
Sasha shrugs.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
You don't have to decide right now. Who
knows? Maybe you wake up one day and
decide that you love giving massages and
you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus
tips. Think about it.
SASHA
If I think about it, will I get extra
credit?
ELIZABETH
(shakes her head)
Hopeless. Watch your feet.
49.
Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car.
Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that
reads, "Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!"
Elizabeth walks up to the door. It's locked. She shakes
the door.
ELIZABETH
Seriously?
She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Why's the store closed?
The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely.
HOMELESS GUY
It's Christmas.
ELIZABETH
Seriously?
Elizabeth looks around. The streets are empty. Not a
person in sight.
HOMELESS GUY
Merry Christmas!
ELIZABETH
Whatever.
(then, stops)
Hey, you got a lighter?
HOMELESS GUY
I don't smoke. It's bad for you.
Elizabeth walks back to her car, empty-handed. A MINI-
VAN passes. Stops. Reverses..
The window rolls down. It's Garrett and his Mom.
GARRETT
Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett!
MELODY
Merry Christmas, Ms. Halsey!
ELIZABETH
MELODY
Having a nice Christmas?
ELIZABETH
MELODY
What are you doing the rest of the day?
Going to see your family?
ELIZABETH
(UNCONVINCING)
I'm probably going to meet up with some
people. We're having a big potluck, so...
Elizabeth-shuffles her feet.
MELODY
Ms. Halsey.
(then, extremely maternal)
Elizabeth. Would you like to have
Christmas with us?
We hear the familiar riff of Shawn Mullin's "Lullaby."
CUT TO:
The class is split up into mini-sections of four desks
each. The students are quietly and dutifully working.
As Elizabeth reads papers and grades them, we HEAR the
various student's voices.
TRISTAN (V.0.)
Atticus Finch is a good lawer because
he's a good person whose a layer.
Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR --
ELIZABETH (V.0.)
Proofread.
JUMP CUT TO:
QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth grades another paper. She's
growing more agitated and is now feverishly writing.
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Wrong!!!
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Is this English?
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Are you fucking kidding me?
Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's
clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we
HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan
runs to the door and peeks out.
SPENCER
Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool.
ELIZABETH
Sit down.
Elizabeth races to the window.
ELIZABETH'S POV
The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next
to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Balls.
She races back to her desk.
66.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D
Keep reading.
Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,
obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook
and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we
SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.
Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her
way through the second and then the third, the chewing
becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.
Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police
Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by
Principal Snur and Amy.
PRINCIPAL SNUR
Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This
will only take a second.
Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes
her mouth, breathes normally.
ELIZABETH
Sorry. I had something caught in my
throat.
The German Shepherd continues barking.
POLICE OFFICER #1
What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?
The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,
almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.
GARRETT
Ahhh!!!
The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.
POLICE OFFICER #1
(holding up Corn Chips)
All clear. Dog must've responded to
these. Happens.
Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this."
Amy glares back.
Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.
AMY
(grasping at straws, to Garrett)
Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food
is still contraband. That's detention,
Buster.
PRINCIPAL SNUR
Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call
off this witch-hunt.
ELIZABETH
(pointedly to Amy)
Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll
excuse me, my class has a state test to
prepare for.
Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,
the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Whoa.
CHASE
Are you okay, Ms. Halsey?
Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.
ELIZABETH
Class dismissed.
SASHA
But the bell didn't ring.
ELIZABETH
Get out of my face.
(then, to Garrett)
And leave the corn chips.
The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES
idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she
still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(to no one)
But first, a nap.
DISSOLVE TO:
Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a
backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.
FRAT GUY
Hi there.
ELIZABETH
Is Tucker here?
FRAT GUY
(DISAPPOINTED)
Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's
here.
(then, back to Elizabeth)
So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate
Ho's" party tonight?
Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty
pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a
tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.
TUCKER
The lot is empty except for Elizabeth's car.
A LUXURY BUS idles curbside. Parents see off their kids.
Scott and Elizabeth are checking kids in. Principal Snur
walks up.
PRINCIPAL SNUR
All set?
SCOTT
I think we're good.
PRINCIPAL SNUR
Elizabeth, thanks again for hopping in
last minute. You really saved us.
ELIZABETH
Is Amy going to be okay?
PRINCIPAL SNUR
She'll be fine. But to be honest, I
think she was scaring some of the kids.
ELIZABETH
I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's
in my thoughts.
ANGLE ON
Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face
is completely blistered, scaly and red from the POISON
IVY. The kids have every reason to be scared by her.
She gets into her car and slams the door.
AMY
(banging on steering wheel)
Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge!
Amy watches as the MAINTENANCE GUY sorts through his keys
and tries to unlocks the desk.
AMY
(nervous, too loud)
I never lose my keys!
MAINTENANCE GUY
What's wrong with your face?
AMY
What's wrong with your face?!?!
MAINTENANCE GUY
Just making conversation.
He finds the right key and opens the desk.
MAINTENANCE GUY (CONT'D)
All set.
AMY
(buying it back)
Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos!
The Maintenance Man exits.
Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it.
She pulls out the "Annie" wig.
AMY (CONT'D)
Busted.
She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out
from the front page. Amy's eyes narrow. She runs to the
floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in
her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the
two, clocking the I.S.A.T. address.
AMY (CONT'D)
Looks like somebody's in big, big
trouble.
To establish.
Elizabeth and Scott stand with the kids in the lobby area.
86.
SCOTT
Alright, guys, count-off.
The students begin their count-off.
STUDENT #1
1.
SASHA
2!
STUDENT #3
3.
TRISTAN
69.
He bumps knuckles with his friend.
GARRETT
5.
As the students continue counting off, we
CUT TO:
D.C. Montage:
--Elizabeth and Scott walk with the kids through
ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY. Elizabeth snaps her gum.
--Elizabeth, Scott and the kids follow a TOUR GUIDE
through the WHITE HOUSE. Elizabeth takes the gum from
her mouth and looks for a place to toss it. She doesn't
see a trash can and quickly sticks it to the bottom of an
antique table.
--Chase has Elizabeth take a "Charlie's Angels" posed
picture of her and her minions. Elizabeth takes the picture
before they're fully posed and hands the camera back.
END MONTAGE.
Amy's car ZOOMS past the camera.
The students take pictures. Garrett walks up to chase.
GARRETT
Hey, you want me to take your picture?
CHASE
No.
GARRETT
Alright, well let me know. I've got my
camera and my battery's fully charged.
She turns away.
GARRETT (CONT'D)
Awesome.
ANGLE ON
88.
.Scott, who stares up at the memorial and looks choked up.
Elizabeth walks up behind him eating a fruit roll-up.
ELIZABETH
(OFFERING)
Fruit roll-up?
SCOTT
(RE JEFFERSON)
I'm so conflicted about this man. Did
you know that he had slaves?
Elizabeth tries to dislodge a piece of the fruit roll-up
from the back of her mouth with her tongue.
ELIZABETH
Yeah, everyone knows that.
SCOTT
I just hate slavery so, so much. An
unquestionable evil. I hate it.
Elizabeth continues struggling with the fruit.
ELIZABETH
Slavery's the worst.
SCOTT
If I could go back in time and undo
slavery, I would.
Elizabeth gives him a sideways glance, like "no shit."
ELIZABETH
You really hate slavery, huh?
SCOTT
I hate it.
Elizabeth finally dislodges the chunk of fruit roll-up.
ELIZABETH
(re fruit roll-up)
Got it.
SCOTT
(staring straight ahead)
You get it.
Scott squeezes Elizabeth's shoulder.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Thanks for listening.
89.
ELIZABETH
Hey, I want you to know you can talk to
me about anything. Slavery, the
Holocaust, relationships.
Scott smiles. Elizabeth smiles. They lock eyes -- a
moment.
The kids listen to a TOUR GUIDE on the steps of the
memorial. Garrett sneaks furtive glances at Chase.
Elizabeth stands away from the group, on her cell.
ELIZABETH
(ON PHONE)
Wally. Why would I cheat? If I'm guilty
of anything, it's teaching too hard.
Great... I've got nothing to hide.
She ends the call.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Fuck!
Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and
all of the students look over at Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)
What?!
The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing.
TOUR GUIDE
And does anyone know what Abraham
Lincoln's nickname was?
Sasha's hand shoots up.
SASHA
Honest Abe.
92.
TOUR GUIDE
"Honest Abe", that's right. Because
Lincoln always said what was on his mind,
even if that meant being unpopular.
Abraham Lincoln always showed great
courage.
Garrett takes this in. He looks over at Chase and then,
after a beat, raises his hand.
TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
Yes?
GARRETT
I love Chase Streeter-Rossi.
All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified.
TOUR GUIDE
Okay then. Any other questions?
GARRETT
(presses, turns to Chase)
I love you, Chase. I've always loved
you. And even though you pretty much
stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I
don't care. I remember the Chase that
wrote me a card when my dad was
overweight and had to go to the hospital
because of his heart --
SASHA
That was from the whole class.
GARRETT
Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a
different card.
(CONTINUING)
And then, a year later, when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer, you
wrote me another card. What happened to
us? Remember when we had a sleepover in
the second grade and you wet your bed and
you were so embarrassed and you made me
promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I
never did and I never will. I know we're
really young, but remember Romeo and
Juliet were only 13. A lot of people
don't know that. So there it is. My
heart on a sleeve.
(goes into rhyming verse)
Don't let me leave / Always believe /
A beat. Chase stares at Garrett.
93.
CHASE
Gross.
Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the
class joins in. Garrett runs down the steps, away from
everyone.
SCOTT
Alright, guys, let's settle down.
The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain.
TOUR GUIDE
(POINTING)
And these columns here are Doric columns.
Now let's move inside to see the interior
murals painted by Jules Guerin.
The Tour Guide leads the group inside. Elizabeth looks
back and sees Garrett on the steps, his head in his
hands. She rolls her eyes and walks down to him.
ELIZABETH
Hey, Abe Lincoln, get up. Tour's not
over.
GARRETT
(UPSET)
She just laughed at me. Called me gross.
ELIZABETH
You'll get over it. Get up.
GARRETT
I'm not going back. Leave me alone!
ELIZABETH
Now.
GARRETT
No!
Garrett runs off.
ELIZABETH
Hey, come back here you little --
Elizabeth starts running after him in heels. She
immediately breaks a heel.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
MOTHER --
She breaks the other heel.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Fucker.
The students stand by their bus. Scott addresses them.
SCOTT
Who had a good time in D.C.?
The students let out a cheer.
SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
Who ate too many french fries at lunch?
The students let out another cheer.
SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
Alright, let's do our final count-off.
STUDENT #1
SASHA
STUDENT #3
TRISTAN
A beat.
STUDENT #6
6.
STUDENT #7
7.
,SCOTT
Wait, wait. Where's 5? Who's 5?
Everyone looks around.
SASHA
I think it's Garrett Tiara.
SCOTT
Garrett! Garrett!
Nothing. Scott looks around, stricken.
SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
And where's Ms. Halsey?
Nothing.
SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
Alright, everyone on the bus!
CUT TO:
Elizabeth searches for Garrett.
ELIZABETH
Garrett! Garrett!
Her cell phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID: "HOT
SCOTT." She puts the phone back in her purse.
We're no longer in the tourist areas. A STRAY DOG walks
down the middle of the street. SIRENS WAIL. PROSTITUTES
hail Johns with catcalls. Elizabeth, still in her broken
heels, walks down the gritty street. -
ELIZABETH
(CALLING)
Garrett! Garrett!
Her phone RINGS. She checks the CALLER ID -- "HOT SCOTT."
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(ANSWERING PHONE)
I'm looking for him! Stop fucking
calling me!
She powers her phone off and continues down the street.
She passes two PROSTITUTES.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young
kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of
a cry baby. Have you seen him?
PROSTITUTE #1
Fuck you.
ELIZABETH
Fantastic.
PROSTITUTE #2
You best step off, bitch, because this is
my block. This here's Poetry's block.
ELIZABETH
Poetry?
PROSTITUTE #1
Cause that's how she fuck.
PROSTITUTE #2
I fuck like that. Lyrical.
Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles.
ELIZABETH
Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend.
Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to
hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming
up by a trash can fire.
HOMELESS MAN #1
Won't get a cab in this neighborhood.
A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the
passenger window and leans out.
JOHN
Hey, sweetheart. How much for a titty
fuck?
ELIZABETH
I need a ride.
JOHN
Oh yeah, I need a ride, too. Right
through those titties.
ELIZABETH
No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and
me pointing mace at your face. I'll give
you ten bucks.
JOHN
(A BEAT)
This is weird. Twenty.
Elizabeth hops in.
CUT TO:
MIDNIGHT. PARENTS are waiting. A few console Garrett's
mom, Melody. A few LOCAL NEWS VANS idle nearby.
SPENCER'S MOM
(TO MELODY)
He's gonna be alright. The police will
find him. I'm sure they're back at the
hotel. Probably just a mix-up.
The bus pulls up to the curb and stops. Scott steps off
first, clearly confused by the crowd and TV cameras.
Immediately, a reporter thrusts a mic into his face.
REPORTER
What can you. tell us about the alleged
romance between Elizabeth Halsey and a 13
year old student?
SCOTT
(CONFUSED)
What?
The students step off and the Parents swarm them.
PARENT #1
Oh baby, are you okay? Did she touch
you?
Sasha's parents engulf her in a hug.
SASHA'S MOTHER
Oh Sasha!
(then, to Sasha's Dad)
You expect this stuff to happen in
Florida, not here.
Garrett walks up to a drab building where he sees
Elizabeth on the curb waiting for him. There's a tiny
sign that reads "Office of the Poet Laureate."
ELIZABETH
It's closed. Won't be open till morning.
Come on. Let's get back to the hotel.
I'm sure everyone's mad at you.
Garrett stands his ground.
GARRETT
I'm not leaving without talking to the
poet laureate.
ELIZABETH
Do you think that some Shel Silverstein
wannabe is going to tell you the meaning
of life?
GARRETT
What do you care?
ELIZABETH
I'm here, right?
GARRETT
You have to be here. You're a teacher.
ELIZABETH
Not for long. I'm getting fired for
cheating as soon as we get back.
Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth.
GARRETT
So. you came looking for me on your own?
ELIZABETH
Yup.
(holds up her shoes)
And you owe me a new pair of
Nanette Lepores.
GARRETT
I just want to know what to say to Chase
to get her to like me.
ELIZABETH
You know what you should do?
What?
ELIZABETH
Just go out and sleep with as many girls,
as you possibly can. Get her out of your
head.
GARRETT
They'll probably reject me, too.
ELIZABETH
Yeah, probably. But life's about how you
deal with rejection. You can either hide
in a corner and cry or you can get
stronger every time. And I figure a kid
like you with not much going for him --
if he were to choose the latter -- might
end up becoming a pretty strong man.
GARRETT
(TOUCHED)
