    TOM RONSTADT - wild haired, thirties - sits alone in his *
      flashy London flat, he looks terrible.  He stares vacantly *
    at the muted TV screen.  Slowly, turns away and he looks *
      around his fancy pad - full expensive things.  *

    His face shows contempt.*

    We go closer and closer on TOM s face as he realises just *
    how screwed his life is.

      Silence.

      Then...  The LANDLINE STARTS TO RING.

    He doesn t move, just stares at it. It rings and rings and 
      rings...



      TOM s face as he drives.  Emotionless.  He pushes a button 
    on the CD drive and music strikes out.

      Loud music, to eradicate the pain.  

      Hard cut to titles.

                                  EXILE



      Inside, we find TOM sitting in the plastic cafe drinking 
      coffee.  He is toying with his mobile. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      2.

    He looks around at all the people going about their lives.  
    We cut back to his face, lost, ashen, a man who s whole 
      life has fallen apart.  He looks down at his mobile, the 
      word HOME is highlighted, he is debating whether to call, 
    but can t bring himself to, and as he stares at those four 
      simple letters, we

                                                                  HARD CUT TO:*



      TOM, looking terrible - hungover, high, wasted - doing the *
      walk of shame through the magazine office, all eyes are on *
    him - he isn tliked - as a SECURITY GUARD leads him from *
    the building.  Clearly sacked.*

                                  TOM*
                          (screams at the room)*
                    Screw you!*

    He tears down a LARGE MAGAZINE COVER POSTER.*

    The SECURITY GUARD grabs his arm up his back and escorts *
    him out, everyone watching.  And he looks like what he is, *
      a man who has lost the plot big time.*

    As he exits, TOM catches the eye of an attractive woman *
      across the room, JANE FINCH, hold a beat, she looks away. *

                                                                        BACK TO:*



    TOM - on his knees - doing a line of coke off the closed 
      toilet lid.  This is no big deal, in fact, for him, it s 
      very much the norm.   He snorts back, better.



    TOM ringing on the doorbell.  Long and insistent.  Until 
      eventually... it opens and there stands

      NANCY RONSTADT.  His older sister.  Think Clare Rushbrook, 
    but with a face that frowns more than it smiles. 

      Who, upon setting eyes on him, laughs.

                                  NANCY
                    Jesus, you must be in the shit.



    TOM is led through the house by NANCY (she s wearing 
      marigolds, clearly in the middle of something), he eyes it 
      like a museum, part of his past that has changed, but not 
      changed very much in his many manyyears of absence.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      6.

                                  TOM
                    Were you ever tempted to 
                    decorate?

                                  NANCY
                    I ve been busy.

      Said with pointed emphasis.  

    TOM can hear a loud male booming voice from somewhere in 
    the house. It stops him in his tracks.

                                  TOM
                    Where is he?

                                  NANCY
                    His study.  

                                  TOM
                    Who s he talking to?

                                  NANCY
                    Wendy.

    Off TOM s blank expression.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    His assistant.

      NANCY takes in the expression on TOM s face, the fear at 
      meeting his father again after all this time.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    Shall I tell him you re here? 

                                  TOM
                    Will he give a shit?



    Now we see what NANCY was in the middle of - a mountain of 
      washing up, laundry and house chores.

      N.BSome of the kitchen cupboards have locks on them. *

      NANCY pours TOM a whisky.  He watches the small measure.  

                                  NANCY
                    They finally sacked you then?

                                  TOM
                    Yep. 

                                  NANCY
                    Can t say I m surprised.

                    Thanks sis.

                                  NANCY
                    Let s face it Tom, it d had been 
                    in the post - there s only so 
                    long you can behave like a prick 
                    before people get tired of it.

    He smiles, loves his sister s unsentimental manner.  She 
      hands him the whisky.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    So what we talking? Flying visit? 
                    Hiding from the shitstorm? Or has 
                    your guilty conscience finally 
                    got the better of you - 

                                  TOM 
                    Just fancied being somewhere as

                                  NANCY
                    You picked the right place then.

    He necks it in one gulp.  Hands the glass back to her.  

                                  TOM
                    Any chance of a drink this time.

    She eyes him with derision.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Occupational hazard. Or it was.

      NANCY just stares at him.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I m finished.

                    They close the door on you.  I ve 
                    seen it happen to other people -

                                  NANCY 
                    Self pity.  Such an attractive 
                    emotion -

    He crosses the kitchen and slowly, thoughtfully, refills 
    his own glass.  Hold the look between them.  There s a lot 
    of history in that one look.

                    Fantastic. Top of the world. Life 
                    just couldn t get peachier. 

    She motions to all the domestic crap that surrounds her in 
    an ironic fashion -

    An anger bursts from her -

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    I ve needed your help, your

                    none of it was ever forthcoming -

    TOM and NANCY head towards Tom s old room carrying pillows 
    and freshly laundered bedding.

                    You didn t tell me he had

                    I stopped telling you anything, 
                    because I could tell you weren t 
                      interested.  

      They enter the room.

      NANCY - almost by force of habit - starts making his bed. 
    TOM takes in his old bedroom.

                    This last couple of years he s

    TOM lying in bed, awake, smoking.  Thinking.  This empty 
      room that was once his childhood bedroom.



      TOM, in boxers and T-shirt, pads into the living room.  He 
      eyes the dated decor, glances at the photos which adorn the 
      wall.  Finds one of his father and his MOTHER.  They are 
      smiling, to all intents and purposes a happy couple.

    TOM goes close, examines her face. The mother he adored.



    TOM pads along the landing and stops at the door of 


      SAM S OFFICE2222

      There s trepidation. This office means something.  And we 
      flashback to:

      Twenty years ago.  Younger TOM (17) standing hidden on the 
      landing outside his father s office. Voices are raised 
      inside - we don t hear exactly what - a man and a woman 
      yelling at each other...  Then suddenly the woman - WENDY, 
    his secretary, late 30s, plain - comes storming out, TOM 
      affects nonchalance and she strides past and away.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      14.

      CONTINUED:2222

    TOM passes the office door, which is ajar, and sees his 
      father sliding a LARGE FILE back into a high shelf.

    End flash.

    TOM stares at that same office door, he reaches for the 
      handle and slowly, perhaps nervously, enters.  It s dark, 
      illuminated only by street light.  He stands in the 
      doorway, just staring at the shelves.

    He flicks the light on.

    He eyes the rows and rows of FILES AND PAPERS.

      Flashback: Different night. Younger TOM creeps into the 
      study, starts looking around at things.

      TOM s face as he remembers this past event.  It s a painful 
      memory and cuts like an old wound.

      Flashback: YOUNGER TOM starts opening up a file.  Delving 
      through.  Then... he finds something.

      PHOTOGRAPHY NEGATIVES.

      There s a name written on the negatives in bold lettering: 

      METZLER.

      They fall to the floor and TOM reach down to pick them up, 
    but as he does so he drops the file and the entire contents 
      skid out.  Shit!  As he swoops to collect them he hears a 
      noise, looks up, scared - 

                                  SAMUEL (IN FLASHBACK)
                    What the fuckd  you think you re 
                    doing?

                                  TOM
                          (manages to squeak)
                    Who s Metzler?

    And we hard cut to

    TOM switching out the light.  Slamming the door closed. WE 
      stay on TOM s face.  Memory still haunts him.



    TOM - fully clothed - heads for the front door, escaping, 
    he peeps it open, and as quietly as he can, leaves.



    TOM and NANCY sitting with drinks, low music playing.

                    All of the above.

    He smiles.  But then it quickly fades.  He s not a 
        confessionalkind of guy but he needs this outlet -

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                      I imploded.  Wasn t in control

      SAMUEL plays the piano, his fingers move across the keys 
      with grace. Of all the things he can tdo anymore, this is 
    one he can- he plays beautifully.

    TOM stands close, watches, examining the father he no 
      longer recognises.



    TOM trying to cook, burning things.  He s hopeless at this *
    and his task isn t helped by the combination locks on all *
    the kitchen cupboards.  He despairs...*



    TOM and SAMUEL eat bought in pizza.  SAMUEL eyes his son 
      suspiciously throughout.  Eventually...

                    Isn t it time you cut your hair!



    TOM trying to get SAMUEL into bed. There s an unholy 
      struggle and the two of them almost end up on the floor.

                                  TOM
                    Lie down, liedown.

      SAMUEL springs to his feet.

                    It s bedtime.  Dad!

      More struggle.  SAMUEL blows raspberries.

      SAMUEL - twenty years ago - laying into a cowering 18 year 
    old TOM.  He hits and hits and hits.  Horrific violence.

    End flashback.

      They are still staring at each other.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Nothing changes.

    TOM makes to leave.

                                  SAMUEL
                    I want Nancy!

                                  TOM
                    Don t we all!

      SAMUEL follows TOM out and yells -

                                  SAMUEL
                    You useless little shit!

    TOM bounds back with an aggression that seems like he could 
      murder his father. SAMUEL retreats, but TOM grabs him and 
    in one movement, pins him to the bed.

                                  TOM

    TOM suddenly stops as he sees the terrified face of his 
      father beneath him.  He flees the room.



    TOM kicking the landing wall in sheer frustration.  He 
      slumps to the floor, spent.  From his position on the floor 
    he can see the slightly open door of 

      SAMUEL S OFFICE

    He stares at it and FLASHBACK TO

      TOM, as a teenager, peering through the crack in the 
      slightly open door, fascinated/concerned by what he sees:

      REVERSE ANGLE: SAMUEL looking through a FILE, his face 
      starting to buckle and contort.  The contents of the file 
      clearly very upsetting.  He suddenly slams it closed.

    TOM scarperswithout being seen.  End flashback.

      TOM, still sitting on the floor, reacts to the memory of 
    his father s tears.  It s a disturbing image.



      SAMUEL, asleep now, passed out, exhausted.  We find TOM 
      staring at him.  Just looking at his father.

    The man that gave life to him.  The man that hurt him.  And 
    now - almost a stranger.



    The Friendship pub.  TOM still in pain, enters.  As he does 
    so, he encounters TWO MEN YELLING INTO EACH OTHER S FACES.  
      They re seconds from extreme violence. 

    TOM sidesteps them, with a wry look.  He enters.

    TOM heads to the bar.   He looks round the place.  It s 
      clearly changed a lot since he was last here.

    But it s still a dump.

      It s the antithesis of the kind of London drinkerys TOM has 
    got used to. A few locals cast him vague  recognition  
      looks, but none really care that much. 

    TOM eyes the arse of the thirtysomething ginger barmaid, 
      MANDY, as she refills the bottle coolers. She s seen better 
      days but she is still in good shape.

    As she rises, she clocks him looking.

                                  TOM 
                    Pint of lager, whisky chaser.

                          smile)
                    And whatever you re having.

    She gives him a tight smile.  Starts pulling the pint.  TOM 
      looks around, and by way of conversation...

                    Busy for a Thursday.

    She just stares at him.

    As TOM delves in his wallet for a note, she eyes him 
      carefully, as if mentally assessing something.

    TOM feeding coins into the jukebox.  He flips through the 
      various albums as the BARMAID sweeps past collecting 
      glasses.  She stares at him, until he turns to face her.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    It s the holiday that always 
                    stays with me, probably rose 
                    tinted but it feels like we were 
                      actually...

    TOM searches for the right word.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (it chokes him a bit)
                    Happy.  

      Nothing from Sam.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    No rows, no tension.  None of 
                    your outbursts.

      Silence.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    What changed, dad? We were happy? 
                    Weren t we? Then it all fell *
                    apart...

      TOM s pushing it here, trying to get a reaction.  He fails.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    What s my name?

      Nothing from Sam.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Tom.  ThomasMartin. And that s 
                    Nancy.  NancyJennifer.

    He nods.  He knows Nancy.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    We re your family.  FAMILY.

      SAMUEL slowly nods, thoughtful. TOM looks back at the faces 
      before him, a lost innocence.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (almost to himself)
                    What happened to us -

                                  SAMUEL
                    Bayside Lodge.

                                  TOM

                                  SAMUEL 
                    The hotel. Terrible service. And 
                    they had a bloody great peacock 
                    in the beer garden...

    TOM looks at his father, affected by this bizarre 
      fragmentation of his memory banks.



      Back window boarded up from where Samuel smashed it.

    TOM sitting alone drinking.  Deep in thought.  He picks up 
    the phone and dials.   It s answered by machine.

                                  TOM 
                    Nancy, wherever you re hiding, 
                    come back - I m gonna stay okay.  
                    I ll help out with him.  You can

                    whatever it is you re missing.  
                    Just please, come back -



      Morning.  TOM gets out of bed, he opens the curtains and 
      sees HIS FLASHY CAR parked outside the house.

    He smiles.

      MARY, a Downs Syndrome woman, in store uniform, waves back.  
      This woman is Tom s age and will crop up in later episodes.

                                  TOM
                    Did he not have any savings -

                                  NANCY
                    Spent.

                    Tiny, only just covers the 
                    household stuff.

    TOM sighs, didn t realise the extent...

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    So if we re gonna do this, we do 
                    it properly, right, cash in the 
                    pot, which means no more spunking

    She smiles.  Heads away. As she does so, TOM catches sight 
    of someone - a bloke in his thirties, bit lardy.

                    Shit!

    He quickly, hastily, dodges out of the way.  He flings 
      himself behind a LARGE STOCKING TROLLEY.  Crouches down.

    He peers round, seeing if lardy bloke has gone, he hasn t.

      YOUNG SPOTTY SHOP ASSISTANT appears next to trolley, stares 
    at TOM with a confused expression.

                                  SPOTTY ASSISTANT

      ASSISTANT stares at him.

                                  SPOTTY ASSISTANT
                    You lost something?

                                  TOM 
                    No.  I m hiding.  Just get on 
                    with what you re doing.

                                  SPOTTY ASSISTANT
                    You can t sit there, I m afraid.

                                  TOM
                    Why not?

                    It s a floor, what do you think s 
                    going to happen - 

                                  SPOTTY ASSISTANT
                    Something might fall on you.

                                  TOM
                    We re in the cerealaisle.

    TOM peers around the trolley, lardy is still there.

                                  SPOTTY ASSISTANT
                    I ll have to ask you to move.

    TOM stares at him.

                    I m guessing not, with the acne. 
                    And the terrible haircut. But 
                    when you do, all this tension

                    the floor, refusing to move -

      SPOTTY ASSISTANT grabs his trolley and pushes it towards 
       Brendan  leaving TOM completely exposed.  LARDY turns.

    TOM rises to his feet as if he was never behind the 
      trolley.  Acts natural -

    And we now realise that Mickey is the bloke he saw on the 
      family photoin Mandy s house - her husband.

      MIKE grabs TOM and pulls him in for a squeeze.  TOM reacts 
    as the air is pushed from his lungs.

                    Can t complain.  

    But we should sense that this is all bravado, he s a man 
    who is deeply disappointedwith his life.

    TOM glances across at MANDY serving.

                                  TOM 
                    Same again?

      MIKE waggles his long slim glass.

                    I m on the slim fast.  If I drink 
                    beer I ll be starving.

    TOM heads to the bar.  Where he stands next to an old bloke 
      watching QVC on the mute TV. 

                                  TOM 
                    Enjoying that?

                    It s just on, innit.

    TOM despairs. MANDY appears. He proffers a big open smile.

                                  TOM 
                    Lager for me and a spritzer for

                    Look, he works away -

                                  TOM
                    I don t need the justification. 
                    You wanted it, you got it.

    TOM looks across at MIKE who drinks and contemplates.

                                  MANDY

    He looks at her, there s a secret smile between them.  
      Actually some proper attraction here, which surprises TOM.

                                  MANDY
                    It s crap between us. Together

                    for a night -

    TOM nods, gets that.  As she places the pints down, she 
      surreptitiously strokes his hand.

                    Five eighty.

    TOM secretly returns the finger stroke, then glances at the 
    OLD BLOKE who has seen this.  He motions to him,  nose .

    TOM and MANDY laugh.  MIKE is completely oblivious.



      WHISKY gets poured - ample measures - into two glasses.

    TOM and MIKE sit on the same couch where Tom got off with 
      Mandy.  They re both pretty oiled by now.

                                  TOM 
                    ...he was always possessive of 
                    his study - said it was full of 
                    sensitive journo stuff, so, 
                     cause I wanted to be like him, I *
                    started to wonder what sort of 
                    juice he kept in there... 

      Flashback to the scene we saw earlier:  Younger TOM creeps 
      into the study, starts looking around at things.

                                  TOM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    One night, after a few toots, I 
                    just thought  fuck it , went in, 
                    started nosing around... most of 
                    it was pretty dull to be honest, 
                    Lancashire news, bits of county 
                    court stuff,  but then I came 
                    across this file...

      YOUNGER TOM starts opening the file.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    There was something about it, the 
                    way it was positioned, the way it 
                    had three elastic bands wrapped 
                    round it... it was enticing. 

      YOUNGER TOM s face drops, perplexed.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Inside there was reams of paper, 
                    printouts, research, all kinds of 
                    guff, too much to get through. 
                    I d just started skim reading it 
                    when these negatives fall out -

    In flashback we see the PHOTOGRAPHY NEGATIVES fall to the 
      floor and TOM reach down to pick them up, but as he does so 
    he drops the file and the contents skid out. 

                                  TOM (IN FLASHBACK) (CONT'D)
                    Shit.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I lean down to get them and the 
                    whole file goes over. So there I 
                    am clearing it up when suddenly 
                    there s this noise behind me.  I 
                    turn around and there he is.

      SAMUEL stares down at the YOUNGER TOM.

                    my life, he charges over, fists 
                    already clenched and yells -

                    I had no answer. Not even a 
                    feeble lie... 

    TOM looks up terrified, manages to squeak the words.

                                  TOM (IN FLASHBACK) (CONT'D)
                    Who s Metzler?

                    And that s when he lost it. 

    The Savage Beating.  Fists and feet, anger and screams.

      Then stop.  Back on TOM s face, still pained by the memory. 

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    It was like something snapped...

                    What do you think was in there?
                    What didn t he want you to see?

    TOM can t answer.  They stare at each other.

                    can t even put his shoes on the

                    All I can remember is this

      Flashback to TOM looking at the name written on the 
      negatives in bold lettering METZLER.

      This registers for Mike.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Only person it links to is Donald 
                    Metzler, local entrepreneur, big

    TOM sitting in the semi darkness of the study where it all 
      happened.  More whisky on the go.  He takes in the room, 
      contemplative. Dark thoughts swirling. 

      Jump cutsas he looks around the office.  PHOTOS from the 
      past of his dad - the working journalist. Papers and 
      cuttings still litter the surfaces.  Letters and 
      correspondence.  Bills and invoices.

      TOM s eyes scanning.  Trying to work out who his father is, 
    the genial hard working man of newspapers or the violent 
      psycho who attacked him unprovoked. 

    He finds his hand trying the DESK DRAWER before him. It s 
      locked.  He pulls at it and feels it wobble.  All his anger 
    and frustration comes out on that drawer as he pulls and 
      smashes and pulls until...    

      PING.  Out it flips, spilling the contents onto the floor.

    TOM sits on the floor now, surrounded by the contents - a 
    sea of ageing paper awash around him.

    He examines something carefully.

    On TOM s face.  Thinking.  Questioning.  Bemused.

    We then see what he is looking at - it s an old BANK 
      STATEMENT, from years ago - 1980s.

    His eyes scan down the PAYMENTS IN column.There are *
      regular payments from J CLEEVE.*

    TOM knows this is significant.



    TOM gently shaking NANCY awake.  She s snatched from deep 
      sleep.

                    What!



    TOM hands NANCY - now in dressing gown - a drink.  She is 
      examining the bank statements.  A pile of them.

                                  TOM
                    Someone s been paying him money.  
                    And he hasn t oncedipped in in
                    all those years - doesn t that 
                    start a few bells ringing, Nancy?  

      Suddenly the door burstsopen and SAMUEL is stood there in 
    his pyjamas. TOM jumps put of his skin.

      NANCY laughs.  In fact, howls.

      SAMUEL moves slowly towards them.

                                  NANCY 
                    He s sleepwalking. Come on, you 
                    can help me get him upstairs.  



      Solicitor s office.  TOM and NANCY sit with SAMUEL opposite 
    an OLD SCHOOL SOLICITOR.  He peruses paperwork.

                                  NANCY
                    Doctor s letter confirms his 
                    condition and there s a report 
                    from the respite unit outlining 
                    the care they ve been providing.

                                  SOLICITOR
                    Yes, I can read.

      NANCY looks as though she could deck the smarmy get. TOM 
      gives her a calming gesture.  

      SAMUEL, in suit and tie, is on best behaviour.

                                  SOLICITOR (CONT'D)
                    My problem, and it s a very real 
                    problem, in legal terms, is that 
                    your father sits before me, 
                    appearing, to all intents and 
                    purposes, like a man very much in 
                    charge of his faculties.

      Solicitor smiles at SAMUEL, who smiles back.

    TOM could kill him.

                                  TOM
                    He has good days and bad days.

                                  SOLICITOR
                    Don t we all.

      Solicitor smiles again at SAMUEL. He smiles back.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      49.

                                  NANCY
                    We re not after his cash.

                                  SOLICITOR
                    You wouldn t be the first.

                            (controlling her temper)
                    Dad didn t even know the account 
                    existed, we ve got debts up to 
                    our ears and we need access to 
                    this money, withouthaving to 
                    rely on his say so - 

                                  SOLICITOR
                          (solicitor)
                    And is this something you 
                    endorse, Mister Ronstadt?

                                  SAMUEL
                    No.

      Simple as that.  TOM and NANCY are furious. Solicitor gives 
      them a belligerent look.

                                  TOM
                    The man s got Alzheimer s.

      Solicitor isn t for budging.



      TOM, NANCY and SAMUEL walk away in silence.  TOM and NANCY 
      still have enraged faces.  Suddenly SAMUEL stops dead and 
      calm as you like, starts undoing his trousers.

                                  NANCY
                    Dad, Dad...

                                  TOM
                    No, lethim -

    TOM darts back towards the main office.

                                  NANCY
                    Where you going?

                                  TOM
                    To get that smug prick.



      NANCY is getting dressed up for a night out.  TOM standing 
      close by, assessing her outfit as she talks.

                                  NANCY
                    Don t tell him bad news. 

                                  TOM
                    Like his wife s death -

                                  NANCY
                    His mind jumps about, past and 
                    present get confused. 

                                  TOM
                    How do you put up with it?

                                  NANCY
                    With great difficulty. 

                                  TOM 
                    You wearing that dress?

                                  NANCY
                          (sarc)
                    No, I m just trying it on for a 
                    future occasion - 
                          (annoyed, looks at 
                            herself in mirror)
                    What s up with it?

                                  TOM
                    It s a bit - and don t take this 
                    the wrong way - tarty.

                                  NANCY
                    Don t take this the wrong way -

                                  TOM
                    When was the last time you went 
                    dating, the late 80s?

                                  NANCY
                    It s not a date.

                                  TOM
                    A man s taking you for dinner and

                                  TOM
                    Yeh, well he wants to get inside 
                      a different hole tonight, and 
                    that dress tells him he can -

      NANCY marches to her wardrobe and thrusts it open -

                                  NANCY
                    Fine, fashion guru, youchoose -

    TOM assesses the collection.

                                  TOM
                    When did you get so into bauge?

    She shoots him a killer look.  He starts rifling through.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    So what you re saying is, if I 
                    wanna ask him about the past I ve 
                    no chance of getting a proper 
                    answer -

                                  NANCY 
                    He doesn t know what he s 
                    forgotten so it s difficult to 
                    talk to him about it - prompts 
                    help. Music, smells. And talk in 
                    the present- even if you re 
                    asking about the past -

                                  TOM
                    What kind of music?

                                  NANCY
                    Anything really, stuff that might 
                    have been around at the time you 
                    wanna talk about - 

    TOM appears with a dress, assesses it, thinks better.

                    Didn t you date a dentist once

                                  NANCY 
                    So?

                                  TOM
                    What s that all about?

                                  NANCY
                    I don t get out much!

    TOM hands NANCY a dress - bright red, long flowing.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    Are you for real?

                                  TOM
                    Trust me, it says available, not
                    desperate - have we still got all 
                    my old compilation tapes?

                                  NANCY
                    Try the loft, what didn t get 
                    burned went up there -

    TOM leaves.  NANCY assesses the dress in the mirror.



    TOM erects a step ladder on the landing, he climbs up and 
      pushes back the loft hole.  With a FLASHLIGHT he peers into 
    the darkness of the loft.  It s dusty and mucky in there - 
    and piled with years and years of stuff.

      Carved into one of the beams are the words TOM 4 SARAH 4 
      EVER.  TOM smiles at them.

                                  TOM
                    Sarah, babe, what happened?

    He starts to flash the light on to various items - an old 
      rocking horse, dozens of binliners containing bedding and 
    so on, old appliances, three large piles of fading 
      newspapers and so on. 

      Until... eventually his flashlight falls on to an old 1980s 
      style suitcase, it has a combination lock.

    TOM awkwardly manoeuvres over to it.  Lodging the 
      flashlight under his chin he opens it.

      Inside is various stuff, including - A PORTABLE CASSETTE 
      PLAYER, single speaker.  And next to it there s a LONG THIN 
      CASSETTE CASE in bright blue, small black metal handle.

    He grabs them and descends.              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      54.



    TOM - amused by nostalgia - glances through the old C90 
      cassette s - compilations he made when he was younger.  
      They look like antiquated museum pieces now.

    He chooses one - entitled TOTALLY FAB CHART HITS - and 
      slides it into the player.  

      Level 42 blast out.

                                  TOM
                    So not totallyfab.



    TOM sitting with SAMUEL.  The portable cassette player is 
      playing music from the early  90s.  TOM has a very intense 
      look on his face as he chooses his words carefully.

                                  TOM
                    How s work? Is the editor still 
                    getting on your nerves?

                                  SAMUEL
                    The guy s an idiot. Calls himself 
                    Oxford educated, he couldn t 
                    write fuck on a dusty blind.

      They laugh.

                                  TOM
                    Do you think you d ever fancy 
                    being editor - or do you prefer 
                    being at the coal face -

                                  SAMUEL
                    Hacks write.  That s what we do.  
                    We put the truth on the page. 
                    Editors go to lunch and talk 
                    figures with accountants.   

                                  TOM
                          (as casual as he can 
                          make it)
                    But... do you never get tired of 
                    digging, it must get hard - it 
                    must be stressful, all that 
                    pressure, do you ever feel it 
                    building up, all that anger-

                                  SAMUEL
                    Never.

      Hold the look between them.  Suddenly the music abruptly 
      stops in that way cassette s do - the music has been taped  
      over something - voices.  A heated phone conversation.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      55.

                    Then what are you saying -

                    This isn t an accusation, it s a

                    Then phrase it like a bloody 
                    question, because to me Sam it 
                    sounds like a bloody -

      Suddenly, SAMUEL springs from his chair - wild, agitated - 
    and grabs the cassette player - the voices continue (will 
      script separately) as he fumbles to eject the cassette - 

                                  TOM
                    Dad.  Dad!

      SAMUEL starts trying to destroy the cassette, dragging the 
      tape from inside the casing - screwing it up in his hand as 
    he feverishly pulls at the thin black tape.  

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Dad, stopit.

    TOM springs to stop him.

                          (overly emotional)
                    I didn t want it.  I told him.  I *
                    TOLD HIM!!!  Why did she let him 
                    in the house -

    He sinks to the floor, still clutching the semi unravelled 
      tape.  He kicks out, then punches the sofa with both hands - 
      like a tantrum child.

    TOM approaches him, a picture of extreme calm.

                                  TOM
                    Who didn t you want?

                    Who came here?

      SAMUEL looks at him like he might actually start to give 
      some kind of coherent explanation.  Then...

                                  SAMUEL
                    Go to hell!

      SAMUEL scrambles out of the room. Leaving TOM to slowly 
      exhale; shaken, startled and more curious than before.              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      56.



    TOM carefully winding the tape back inside the cassette 
      with a pencil. 

    TOM finding a set of headphones.

    TOM placing the cassette back into the player.  

    TOM listening to the tape.  Music.  Then voices.  We just 
      catch glimpses of the phone conversation.

      TOM s face as he gets to a part that amazes him.  He 
      presses STOP.  Then REWIND. Then STOP.  Then PLAY. 

    And now we hear what he has just heard: 

                                  VOICE 2
                    You re a journalist, Sam, you 
                    should know what agreement means.

                                  VOICE (SAM)
                    I know perfectly well what 
                       agreement  means -

                                  VOICE 2
                    Then you ll know that exposing me 
                    means exposing yourself.

                                  VOICE (SAM)
                    I can live with that.

                                  VOICE 2
                      Honourable.  You re such an 
                      honourableman.  

                                  VOICE (SAM)
                    Honour s got nothing to do with 
                    it -

                                  VOICE 2
                    Except you re forgetting one 
                    thing, Mister Upstanding Member 
                    of the Community... 

      Crackle on the tape.  Voices distorted.   And TOM realises 
    the machine is chewing the crinkled tape up.

                                  TOM
                    Shit, shit!

    TOM presses STOP and drags the tape out, it has spooled and 
    is now in pretty bad state.  TOM stares at the tape.

    He notices something.  The sticker saying  Totally fab 
      tunes  is one he placed over the original tape.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      57.

      Slowly, carefully, he starts to peel off the white sticker 
    he placed there many years before. The strip peels off and 
      written underneath, in biro, on the original tape, is the 
      word METZLER.   

      Hold on TOM s face.

      DOORBELL rings. TOM jumps up and heads

      DOWNSTAIRS. He swings the door open to find MIKE standing 
      there.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Mike, that s weird, I was just 
                    about to -

      Whack! 

      MIKE punches him in the face. TOM flies backwards.

                                  MIKE
                    Bastard! You fucked her in my
                    house. In mybed!

                                  TOM
                    I didn t know! I swear!

      MIKE goes in for another punch but TOM, nursing his bust 
      nose, dodges him.  MIKE hits the wall.  It hurts.

      MIKE curses, winces with pain.

                                  MIKE
                          (shaking with anger)
                    You deserve everything you get! 
                    You useless...washed up...prick! 

                                  TOM
                    I m sorry! Mike, Mike...

      MIKE stomps away, clutching his bust hand.  TOM - blood 
      dripping from his nose - chases after him.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Mike, mate... 

                                  MIKE
                          (with real venom)
                    Stay out of my life!

      MIKE just carries on walking, appalled. TOM watches him go.  
      Disappointed in himself.



    TOM pours himself a modest measure of whisky, he stares at 
    it as he contemplates what he s about to do.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      58.

      Then downs it in one.



    TOM walks along the upstairs corridor.  Ahead he sees the 
      toilet door ajar.  Geared up now, he can t back out, he has 
    to do the thing he has wanted to do for so many years -

    TOM goes to the door, opens it.

      SAMUEL is sitting on the toilet.  

    TOM stares at the side of his father s head for a long 
      time, before eventually uttering -

                                  TOM
                    Why did you beat me? 
                          (Silence)
                    Look at me.
                          (Silence)
                    That night, why did you react 
                    that way -
                          (Silence)
                    Dad, lookat me - LOOK AT ME.

      SAMUEL slowly turns.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Who were you protecting?

      SAMUEL says nothing.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Because... to do what you did, it 
                    must have been something so 
                    big... something...
                          (his voice cracks)
                    ...that utterly terrified you -

      SAMUEL says nothing. 

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I know it s still in there.

    TOM taps his head.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    And believe me, I m gonna get it 
                    out -  

      SAMUEL smirks, looks directly at TOM with utter contempt, 
      then kicks the door closed. 

    TOM stands, door closed in his face.  He takes a deep 
      breath and slowly walks away.
