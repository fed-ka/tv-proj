                  Mystery... 

      A hush falls over the crowd. Around the room, GIANT PLACARDS 
      display the PHOTOGRAPH of a handsome, roguish man - NICK 
      CASTLE - and advertise his latest potboiler,  STORM S END.

                  What is it about a dark and stormy 
                  night that sets our pulses racing? 
                  What is it about a hard-boiled 
                  detective, a femme fatale, and the 
                  cold steel of a gun that keeps our 
                  bedside lamps glowing until the wee 
                  hours of the morning?        Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     2.


      Waiting nearby is NICKCASTLE himself, late-thirties and a 
      rock star of the literary world. Dressed in jeans, leather, 
    and three days growth, he s the kind of trouble every woman 
      hopes to find. And a couple of them have, much to his delight.

      Gina glancesover in time to witness this. A fleetingglimpse

    But he says it a little too quickly.

    As Gina walks away, Castle calls after her...

                  Right. So what s the big deal?

                                  CASTLE
                  You remissing the point...

      Martha holds up her hand.

                                  MARTHA
                  Hang on. I just got a hit on my Grey-
                  dar.

      She s locked in on a SILVER FOX (70s) across the room. 
      Country club looks, spray-on tan.As he liftshis glass of 
      champagne to his lips Martha scanshis fingers.

                  For letting her move in? I think it s 
                  sweet.

                                  CASTLE
                  Won t be sweet when I strangleher in 
                  her sleep.

    The bartenderputs the two glasses of champagne on the bar. 
      Castle slides one of the champagne flutesdown to Alexis.

                                  ALEXIS
                  You do know I monly fifteen right?

      Castle shrugsit off.

                  You rean old soul.

                  You know, when I was your age...
                          (he stops himself)
                  Ah.Can t tell that one... Wildly
                    inappropriate. Which is, oddly, my 
                  point. Don t you want to have wildly
                  inappropriate stories that you can t 
                  tell your children?

                                  ALEXIS
                  I think you vegot enough of those for

      A WOMAN floats face down in a pool. She wears a GREEN EVENING 
      GOWN and a TIARA.A knife sticks out of her back like a 
      dorsalfin.

      Beckett and Castle stand with Uniforms.

                  minutes ago.

                                  BECKETT

                                    MAINTENANCE MAN
                  This time of year, no one uses it 
                  much. We were gonnadrain it at the 
                  end of the week.

                                  BECKETT
                  When were you up here last?

                                    MAINTENANCE MAN
                  Yesterday afternoon.

                  You mind showing us her apartment?

                                    MAINTENANCE MAN
                  No. Of course.

      Beckett starts to follow, but sees Castle hovering over Lanie 
    as she examines the body. She sighs.

                                  BECKETT
                  Anybody have a leash?

    ON LANIE - examining the body. Castle leansin close behind 
      her, startlingher.

                                  CASTLE
                  Sorry. Hi. NickCastle. I m

                                  BECKETT
                  I told you to wait over there.

                                  CASTLE
                  I got lonely.

    She turns to Lanie.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have a C.O.D?

                                  LANIE
                  Not until the full exam.But I don t 
                  think she was stabbed.

                                  BECKETT
                  She s got a knife stickingout of her 
                  back.

      Castle jumpsin.

                                  CASTLE
                  Lack of blood around the wound suggests 
                  she was dead before it was inserted. 
                  And there s no foamaround the mouth, 
                  so we know she didn t drown.

                                  LANIE
                  Oh, you regood.

                                  CASTLE
                  She was killed and posed.Like the 
                  others.

                                  BECKETT
                  Mr.Castle. Can I have a word?

      Beckett pullshim aside. Castle flasheshis innocent eyes.

                                  CASTLE
                  Something wrong?

                                  BECKETT
                  Don t try to change the subject.

                                  CASTLE
                  I mnot. Listen, did Fiskand Tisdale
                  know each other?

                                  BECKETT
                  We haven t found a connection, aside 
                  from your books.

                                  CASTLE
                  What about motive? 

      Beckett s phone rings.

                                  BECKETT
                  He s a serial killers. He doesn t need 
                  motive.
                          (answering)
                  Beckett... Yeah.You have an address? 
                  Yeah... Got it. Thanks.
                          (hangsup the phone)
                  We got a match off the print.


      Beckett s car pullsup followed by SQUAD CARS.


    And boundsdown the steps, his arm waving.

                  TAXI!

      BECKETT burstsout the front door to see Castle disappearing
      into the rear of a yellow cab. Beckett seethes.


      Stone lions stand guard on either side of the statelysteps.

                  Swing low, sweet chariot, coming forth 
                  to carry me home. 



      Beckett watches the three of them get into a town car. Castle 
      turns as he gets in and locks eyes with her. Then shutsthe 
      door behind him.


      Castle and Beckett emerge.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     51.


                                  BECKETT
                  What was that about?

                                  CASTLE
                  He s dying.

                                  BECKETT
                  Who s dying? Tisdale?

      Down the street is a Sabrettsvendor.

                  You want a hot dog? I want a hot dog.

      Castle crossesto the hot dog stand. Beckett catches up.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Two please.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle...

                                  CASTLE
                  A Buddhistwalks up to a hot dog 
                  vendor. Vendor says  What can I get 
                  you, pal?  The Buddhistsays Make me 
                  one with everything.

    She looks at him. What the hell are you talking about.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  The guy says that llbe two fifty. The 
                  Buddhisthands him a five and asks for 
                  change. The guy just smiles and says 
                   Change comes from within. 

      With unbelievable speed, she grabshis nose between her thumb
    and forefinger.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  OWOWOW.What are you doing?

                                  BECKETT
                  Getting your attention. Now that I 
                  have it, what makes you think he s 
                  dying?

                                  CASTLE
                  Okayokayokay.

      Beckett looks over at the hot dog vendor.

                                  BECKETT

    She releases Castle. He rubshis nose. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Okay.First clue - the pictures on the 
                  wall. He s thinnernow. Sick thin, not 
                  workoutthin.

                                  BECKETT
                  His daughter was just murdered...

                                  CASTLE
                  Second clue - the way he touched his 
                  hair. Like he was self-conscious. 

                                  BECKETT
                  You think it was a piece?

                                  CASTLE
                  A good one, but it s new for him. The 
                    chemo srelatively recent.

                                  BECKETT
                  So he s fighting cancer. That doesn t 
                  make him terminal.

                                  CASTLE
                  It s a much better story if he is. You 
                  interview the brother?

                                  BECKETT
                  There was never a reason to.

                                  CASTLE
                  Well, now there is.


      Craneslift a shipping container off a ship.


      Beckett and Castle get out of their car. Signs indicate that 
      we reat TISDALEIMPORT/EXPORT. Out by the loading dock 
        HARRISONTISDALE, late twenties, signs invoiceswhile talking 
    on his cell.

                  Anyone stop in to see me today?

                                  DOORMAN
                  No. You expecting someone?

    But Harrisonignores him.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     58.



      Beckett s car pulls to a stop around the corner from 
      Tisdale sapartment building. Two SQUAD CARS pull up behind 
      her. Beckett gets out of the car, followed by Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, do me a favor and grab the 
                  warrant from the glove compartment.

      Castle reaches back into the car and pulls out the warrant. 
    As he does, Beckett grabs his wrist and HANDCUFFS him to the 
      grab handle above the car door. She smiles.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     59.


                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  This time you re staying put.

      Beckett snatches the warrant and heads up the sidewalk.

                                  CASTLE
                  OK.Very funny. C monKate!Joke s 
                  over! Kate!

    She rounds the corner and is gone. Castle looks at his cuffed
      hand, and then slides his other hand into his pocket and 
      pullsout his wallet.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Cuffme once, shameon you. Cuffme 
                  twice...

    He opens his wallet, fishesinside. Pullsout a HANDCUFFKEY.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  ... Shameon me.

    But the key slipsand with one hand cuffedhe can t catch it. 
    It hits the ground. He goes to pick it up, but because he s 
      cuffedhis hand can t reach the ground.


      Castle has his shoe and sockoff and is trying to pick up the 
    key with his toes.He s almost go it. No. Drops it. It s 
      fartheraway now.


      Castle s toessqueeze the handcuffkey, and gently lift it up 
    to his hand. He snatchesit from his toes.As he goes to 
      unlockhis cuffs, he spotssomething strange -

      DOWN THE ALLEY he sees HARRISONTISDALEquietly descending
    the building s fire escape, clutchinga trashbag. No one 
      seems to be following him.

                                  CASTLE
                  Hey... Hey!

      Castle quickly uncuffshimself and grabshis shoe.


      Castle dodgestraffic as he runs across the street, cell 
      phone in one hand, shoe in the other, racing to the alley.

                                  CASTLE
                  He s coming down the fire escape.

      BACK ON BECKETT rushingto the window. She throwsit open and 
      climbsout onto the...      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     61.



      FIRE ESCAPE - Beckett spotsHarrisonbelow her.

                                  BECKETT
                  Freeze!

      Harrisonlooks up. Sees her. And jumpsdown to the alley. He 
      hits pavement, but the BAG snagson the fire escape, ripping
      open. Evidence spillingeverywhere. Harrison sees Castle 
      racing toward him and Beckett descendingfrom the fire 
      escape. He turns and runs down the alley, with Castle chasing
      after him.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  Castle, stop!

                                  CASTLE
                  I got  em!I got  em.

      Castle s still holding his shoe as he runs. He finally tosses
    it aside. Beckett swearsunder her breath as she finally gets 
    to the bottom of the fire escape. She drops down to the 
      pavementin time to see Harrisonand Castle disappear around 
    the corner. She chasesafter them both, gun drawn.

    She ROUNDS THE CORNER to find Harrisonusing CASTLE as a 
      shield, holding a gun to his temple. Castle s a tadsheepish.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Whoops.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Stay back!

      Harrisonbacks away, pulling Castle with him.

                                  BECKETT
                  Don t be stupid. There s nowhere to go.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  I said stay back.

    But Beckett keeps her gun trained on him. Harrisonpulls
      Castle around the corner, heading for a subway entrance.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, you okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  Fine. Except psychohere needs a 
                  breath mint.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     62.


                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Shut up.

                                  CASTLE
                  No, you shut up.

                                  HARRISON TISDALE
                  I llblow your head off.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, you renot helping.

      They reach the subway entrance, HarrisonpullsCastle down 
    the steps, keeping him as a shield. Beckett follows. Some 
      UNIFORMShave joined her.


    The sun rises over the city.
