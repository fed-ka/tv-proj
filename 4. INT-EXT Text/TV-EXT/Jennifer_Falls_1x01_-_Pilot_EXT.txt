      JENNIFER, ONE HER CELL PHONE AND HER DAUGHTER GRETCHEN (16, 
      ENTITLED BUT REACHABLE) UNLOAD BOXES FROM A SMALL U-HAUL VAN.

                                  JENNIFER

                (ON CELL)  Mom...  Mom... I don t want 

                a party.  

                                  GRETCHEN

                I don t want to live at Grandma s.  How 

                can we be broke?  You made so much money.

                                  JENNIFER

                (TO GRETCHEN)  We spent so much more.    

                Remember all those Christmases in 

                Aspen and summers in Tuscany?  So does 

                the bank.  (ON PHONE)  Mom, you re not 

                  listening.

                                  GRETCHEN

                So we have nothing?

                                  JENNIFER

                No, no.  We still have mountains of debt.  

                (ON CELL)  Mom, this is just temporary.  

                I don t want you to make a fuss. 

      THEY ENTER THE HOUSE, CARRYING BOXES.

                                                                            RESET TO:


      LORNA (30S, EFFICIENT-LOOKING), MAGGIE S ASSISTANT, IS AT A 
      LITTLE RECEPTION DESK.  JENNIFER ENTERS. 

                                  JENNIFER

                Is my mom in?  

                                  LORNA

                No.  Sorry.  

      MAGGIE COMES OUT OF HER OFFICE.

                                  MAGGIE

                Hi, sweetie.  Come on in.

      JENNIFER GOES IN WITH HER MOTHER AS LORNA STARES AT HER.

                                                                            RESET TO:


      JENNIFER AND DINA ARE KICKING BACK ON THE PATIO FURNITURE, 
      HAVING BEERS.

                                  DINA

                It s so weird to be at your Mom s 

                house drinking beers that we didn t 

                swipe from her.

                                  JENNIFER

                No, I swiped them.  I m totally broke. 

                Hey, you know what I have?

      SHE LOOKS AROUND THEN PULLS OUT TWO CIGARETTES.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)

                You smoke?

                                  DINA

                No.  Do you?

                                  JENNIFER

                God, no.  I just want to be bad.

                                  DINA

                I m in.

      THEY LIGHT UP AND COUGH, LAUGH AT THEMSELVES.  THEY DRINK 
      THEIR BEERS, LOOKING OUT INTO THE NIGHT SKY.

                                  JENNIFER

                How did I get so angry?

                                  DINA

                 Get?   You were born angry.  You ve 

                been yelling at people since you were 

                three years old."Epidode Title"49.


                                  JENNIFER

                No, I haven t.

                                  DINA

                You made Zoe Lee cry in pre-school.

                                  JENNIFER

                                  DINA

                And Seth Gorman in sixth grade.

                                  JENNIFER

                                  DINA

                                  JENNIFER

                Do you have a life of your own?  

                (THEN)  Gunderson made me dress for 

                gym when I was bloated.

                                  DINA

                Just saying.  You have issues, girl.

                                  JENNIFER

                Okay, okay.  You re right.  I have 

                issues.  I m working on them.  (BEAT)  

                I looked like a friggin  bratwurst!  

                  Gunderson didn t care.

                                  DINA

                Let it go.  (SITS UP, ALARMED)  What 

                was that?"Epidode Title"50.


                                  JENNIFER

                What?

                                  DINA

                I heard a noise.  Are you sure your 

                mom went to bed?

                                  JENNIFER

                Oh, my God, you re not still scared of 

                my mom, are you?

                                  DINA

                No, it s just, you know, it s her 

                house, we re smoking...

                                  JENNIFER

                (LAUGHS)  What is she going to do, 

                tell your mom?  Jesus, Dina, you re 

                forty years old.

      THEY HEAR THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR OPEN.

                                  GRETCHEN (O.S.)

                Mom?

                                  JENNIFER

                Run!

      THEY RUN OFF INTO THE DARKNESS, THEIR CIGARETTES GLOWING IN 
      RETREAT.

                                  GRETCHEN

                Mom, I can totally see you.

                                                                              FADE OUT
