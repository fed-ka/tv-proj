    MOVING THOUGH A DENSE, DARK FOG - NIGHT

    Nothing is visible but the wet, thick blanket around us... 
    until we catch GLIMPSES of nearby CITY LIGHTS.  Looming 
    CLIFFS.  A BRIDGE.  Finally, we emerge from the fog to find --

    EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 

    ON THE WATER, SKIMMING the surface LOW AND FAST until we hit --

    EXT. FISHERMAN'S WHARF (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    CAMERA STILL AT WATER LEVEL - but we can SEE the normally 
    packed tourist trap is deserted.  The naval battleships, 
    fishing boats - empty, dark, eerie.  CAMERA MOVES TO -- 

    EXT. BENEATH THE DOCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    -- PUSH INTO THE BLACKNESS - suddenly, a PAIR OF EYES catch 
    the light.  A MAN, in a small motorboat, eyes darting, breath 
    short.  He s afraid... or excited.  This is IRWIN LAZAREV, 
    30 s.  He looks up as BOOTS STEP overhead.  PAN UP TO --

    THE DOCK DIRECTLY ABOVE 

    FOUR MEN - quickly, quietly unload crates of iced FISH from 
    a FISHING BOAT, and stack them onto a forklift.  Two of the 
    men look like RUSSIAN FISHERMEN, but both have GUNS in their 
    belts.  Clearly, they do more than just fish.  The other two 
    men, JULIUS and STAN, are American.  Decidedly not 
    fishermen.  Both are armed.  Dangerous.

    Julius spins as a CRATE tips over.  Its contents spill out - 
    fish, ice, and a sealed BRICK OF WHITE POWDER, marked with 
    the image of a LAUGHING DOG.  He hurries to repack it -- 

    UNDER THE DOCK - Ice DROPS down on Irwin, hitting his boat 
    with sharp KNOCKS.  He holds his breath...

    ABOVE DOCK - Julius stops - did he hear something? 

                                        FISHERMAN #1
                                (Russian accent)
                        That is the last one.

    Julius shakes it off as the two Fishermen climb onto their 
    boat, start the ENGINE.  The two camps share a terse nod.  
      Transaction complete.  As the fishing boat MOTORS out of port, 
    Julius climbs into the FORKLIFT - starts the motor...                                                                                      2.


                                        JULIUS
                        Check the ties.

    ON STAN - as he moves in front of the crates, out of Julius  
    view.  He doesn t see Irwin come up on him with a PIPE aimed 
    at his head - BAM!  The fork lift MOTOR drowns the sound.  

    ON JULIUS - waiting - then something catches his eye --

    IRWIN S SMALL, EMPTY MOTORBOAT 

    -- as it floats out from under the pier where it was hidden.  
    Someone is here.  Julius pulls his gun - circles the forklift - 
    FINDS STAN lying there unconscious.  

    JULIUS SPINS - just as A PIPE HITS him.  He drops.  Irwin KICKS 
    his gun away, goes to move him.  But the half-conscious Julius 
    struggles, twists around, then SEES Irwin s face.  Stops.

                                        JULIUS
                        Wait, I... know you.
                              (as Irwin steps back)
                        You crazy?  No one steals from 
                        Schiller. 

    Irwin tries to hide it, but is clearly in over his head, and 
    Julius knows it.  He sits up with more confidence --

                                        JULIUS
                        Walk away - maybe he just kills you.  
                        Do this - your whole family s dead.  

                                        IRWIN
                        You re right... Schiller can t find 
                        out who did it.

    With that, he pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS 
    Julius in the head.  Does the same to Stan.  He then SHOOTS 
    several holes into the MOTORBOAT to sink it.  As Irwin 
    hurries to FORKLIFT and drives it up the dock --

    CLOSE ON FEET PEDALING A BIKE - DAYBREAK

    -- up a very steep hill.  PAN UP TO the rider, MARTA 
    WALRAVEN, 40 s.  She pushes hard; intense, focused.  
    Exercise is her religion.  Her meditation.  INCLUDE --

    EXT. MT. TAMALPAIS - MARIN COUNTY (CONTINUOUS) - DAYBREAK

    The pedaling gets harder, the mountain steeper.  But this woman 
    is capable of almost anything, though she may not know it yet.  
    Finally, she CRESTS the mountain.  Exhales heavily as she floats 
    over the flat surface.  Made it!  She stops for some water, 
    taking in the SPECTACULAR VIEW OF THE BAY AREA.                                                                                      3.


                                        DINA (O.C.)
                        You are a complete bitch!

    Marta laughs as her best friend, DINA TOMLIN, 40 s, walks her 
    bike up.  Though sweaty, Dina is perfectly manicured, dyed, 
    preserved.  Her style contrasts Marta s earthy naturalism.  

                                        DINA
                        You said we d do an intermediate ride.

                                        MARTA
                        This is intermediate.  Admit it, you 
                        feel great.  Clearer.  Stronger --

                                        DINA
                        Strength is overrated.  I can hire 
                        people to lift things.

    Marta laughs again.  Clips into her bike and pushes off.   

                                        MARTA
                        Race you to the bottom.

                                        DINA
                        Bitch! 

    ON MARTA, wind in her face as she coasts downhill, her reward.

    INT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - KITCHEN/GREAT ROOM - MORNING

      10-year-old BORIS bursts into the great room, chased by his 
    brother, GABRIEL, 17.  Gabriel is handsome in a techno-geek way.  
    Boris is slight, sensitive, immediately lovable. 

                                        GABRIEL (O.S.)
                        I let you borrow them a week ago --

                                        BORIS (O.S.)
                        -- I gave them back!

    INCLUDE MARTA in the kitchen, hurriedly cleaning up breakfast 
    dishes, dressed for her day.  The kitchen has top-of-the-line 
      everything, windows overlooking Sausalito Harbor.  But it s 
    homey, littered with soccer cleats, newspapers, homework.  

                      MARTAGABRIEL
    Guys, stop --(gets Boris in a 
                                                    headlock)
                                                -- They re Bose headphones.  
                                                You know how much they cost?

                                        BORIS
                        They re - in my locker at school.                                                                                      4.


                                        MARTA
                        Gabriel, enough! 

    They keep fighting.  Marta s husband enters, FRANKLIN, 40 s, 
    handsome, jeans, T-shirt, flip flops - his work attire.  He 
    gives Marta a quick kiss - and digs around the counter as -- 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Where are my keys, babe?  Steven s 
                        waiting for me at the Marina --

                                        MARTA 
                              (re: the fighting boys)
                        Franklin, can you do something here?

    Franklin glances at the situation, assess it --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Boris - kick him in the shins.

    Boris KICKS Gabriel.  

                                        GABRIEL
                        Ow!

    Boris runs past Franklin, who musses his hair affectionately.  
    Then Franklin sees Marta s appalled look --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What?  He needs to toughen up.  You re 
                        the one who s worried about the 
                        bullies at school.  

    Marta might argue, but they re interrupted by their daughter, 
    NATALIE, 16.  Pretty, artsy, off-beat bohemian.  To Marta --

                                        NATALIE
                        Can I have a hundred dollars?  I need 
                        new brushes and paint.  

                                        MARTA 
                        What happened to your allowance money? 

                                        NATALIE 
                        Dad?

                                        MARTA
                        Natalie. 

    But Franklin distractedly pulls out a wad of cash, peels off two 
    fifties, points to his cheek.  Natalie kisses it, exits as --

                                        NATALIE
                        Thank you, Daddy.                                                                                      5.


                                        MARTA
                        Way to set boundaries, babe.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Artists need paint.  S all good.  Come 
                        on, keys, where you at...

    Marta s not happy, but acquiesces.  All the tenacity we saw 
    in her exercise takes a back to keep the peace.  Then 
    Gabriel FLINGS a set of keys at Franklin s shoulder --  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Ow!

                                        GABRIEL
                        Toughen up, Dad.

    Clearly not enamored of his father.  Gabriel exits.  Marta 
    picks up the keys (we might NOTE a small PLASTIC SAILBOAT 
    dangling from the chain).  Looks at Franklin, concerned --

                                        MARTA
                        You need to talk to him --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Damn, left my phone upstairs.  

    He grabs the keys, kisses her again, hurries out.  Off Marta -- 

    EXT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - MOTOR COURT - MORNING 

    The house is built of wood, stone, and glass, well 
    integrated into its natural surroundings.  It's all about 
      understatement, which is important to this family.  

    BORIS exits the front door, backpack on.  He looks over his 
    shoulder - no one s behind him.  He hurries to an AUDI SEDAN --

    INT. AUDI SEDAN (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING

    Boris climbs in, glances around one more time - reaches into 
    the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and pulls out a HANDGUN.  He weighs 
    it, unsure, afraid.  He s startled by the SOUND of Gabriel 
    and Natalie exiting the house, piling into Gabriel s VOLVO.

    Boris quickly slips the GUN into his backpack.  His fingers 
    are still on the zipper when - the DRIVER S SIDE DOOR OPENS - 
    FRANKLIN climbs in.  But he sees his son, realizes -- 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Crap.  It s Friday.  

    Franklin leans out the window as Marta exits the house, 
    heading for her LEXUS HYBRID SUV.                                                                                        6.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        Marta!  Can you take Boris? 

                                        MARTA 
                        I have to meet my sister in the city.

    Franklin s look pleads with her.  Which pisses her off.  But 
    she sees Boris s worried little face... 

                                        MARTA 
                        Fine.  Yeah.  It s fine.

    BORIS climbs out, heads for her Lexus.  FRANKLIN drives off, 
    not realizing what s missing from his glove compartment as --  

    INT. MARTA S LEXUS (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING

    -- Boris climbs into the passenger seat, Marta at the wheel.  

                                        MARTA
                        Classic rock.  Reggae.  Jazz.

    He shrugs.  She glances at him, worried.  Kisses his face.

                                        BORIS
                        ... Classic rock?

    She smiles, loves this boy.  She punches in a station, 
    shifts into gear.  PUSH IN ON BORIS  BACKPACK...

    INT. BRIDAL SHOP - UNION SQUARE, SF - DAY 

    Marta hustles into the upscale shop - stops, gasps at the 
    sight of her younger sister, KATRINA  KAT  LAZAREV, 30 s, 
    beautiful in her wedding dress.  Kat is sweet, fun, loyal, 
    but immature, untested.  And in a state of complete stress.  

                                        MARTA
                        It s perfect.

                                        KAT
                        At least one thing is.

    -- as Kat shoots an exasperated look to -- 

    THEIR MOTHER, VERA LAZAREV, 60 s, strewn across a chaise.  
    Bitter, melodramatic, extremely well-heeled.  

                                        KAT
                        She won t come to the wedding if Dad 
                        brings the Poodle.

                                        MARTA
                        Seriously?                                                                                        7.

                        You could ask him not to bring her.

                                        KAT
                        Then he won t come. 

                                        MARTA
                        We ll put you at different tables.

                        attendant, handing out paper towels.  

                                        MARTA

                                        IRWIN (O.S.)
                        Who s causing you stress!? --

    The women turn as IRWIN enters.  Still on edge from our 
    opening scene.  Roguishly handsome, brash, charming.

                                        IRWIN
                        -- I ll break their legs.

                                        VERA 
                        Irwin, give your sad, old mother a hug.  

    He does so.  Vera adoringly grabs his face. 

                                        VERA
                        Where have you been lately?  You look 
                        exhausted. 

                                        IRWIN
                        So many women, so little time.

    She swats his arm reproachingly but chuckles, proud.  

                                        IRWIN
                        I can t stay.  Just dropping this off --
                                (pulls out a TIE)
                        For your starving artist, who can t 
                        afford a tie for his own wedding --                                                                                        8.

                        -- Not today, Irwin --

                                        IRWIN
                        Fortunately, he has no problem accepting 
                        loans - ties from me, checks from Dad --

                                        KAT
                        Joe doesn t even know about those!

    -- as she sits, head in hands.  Marta pulls Irwin aside --

                                        IRWIN
                        Corset s cutting off her sense of humor --

                                        MARTA
                        Mom won t come to the wedding if Dad 
                        brings Felicity.  Will you talk to him?

                                        IRWIN
                        Like he d do anything for me?  Look, 
                        don t worry about the Poodle, Dad s 
                        just her temporary safety net. 

                                        MARTA
                        You mean her ATM. 

                                        IRWIN
                        That too.  She had to get a restraining 
                        order against her last boyfriend.  
                        Guy s a pro boxer, Valentin Petrov --

                                        MARTA
                        Does Dad know?

                                        IRWIN
                        No - hey, I gotta go talk business 
                        with Franklin.  Good mood?  Bad mood?

                                        MARTA
                        He s Franklin.   S all good.  

    She says it with some annoyance.  Irwin kisses her cheek, then 
    Kat s, then Vera s, races out.  Off Marta, an idea brewing...

    EXT. MARINA - SAUSALITO - DAY

    Small boats, yachts, sailboats, fishing charters, dry storage 
      facilities, fuel dock.  FIND THE OFFICE, located in a 
    HOUSEBOAT.  The door SWINGS OPEN - Franklin exits with Irwin.  
    They re partners, in-laws and, though they argue, old friends.

                                        IRWIN
                        It s a unique opportunity --                                                                                       9.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        I m not interested in that crap --

                                        IRWIN
                        We need to expand, diversify --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        So you always say.  But we re still in 
                        business because we keep it small.  
                        Buy from the same grower.  Store it 
                        off-site.  And we do not diversify.  

    They approach a BOAT on which STEVEN TOMLIN, 40, works.  
    He s the foot-soldier, not the general, prefers it that way.

                                        IRWIN
                        Help me out, Steven.  

                                        STEVEN
                        I could use the income, Frankie.  
                        Dina s gallery is costing me --

                                        IRWIN
                        -- and I have a lead on a buyer.   
                        Maybe we should put it to a vote --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        A minute ago, it was an  opportunity.   
                        Now there s a buyer and a vote?  What 
                        else don t I know --

                                        STEVEN
                        -- Psst - heads up...

    ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE DOCK

    FBI AGENT JAMES LEEFLANG heads toward them.  Late 30 s.  Neat, 
    smart.  Anger brewing beneath the surface, but kept well in 
    check.  His younger PARTNER, CELIA TREJO, waits up the dock.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What re they doing here? ... Irwin?

    Irwin deflects by giving Leeflang a friendly wave as he nears --

                                        IRWIN
                        Agent Leeflang.  It s been a while.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        We ve been focusing on bigger fish.  

                                        STEVEN
                        Good for us, bad for the big fish.                                                                                    10.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        One big fish in particular.  I believe 
                        you know Schiller.  

    A chill runs down Franklin s spine.  But he hides it.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Seems he got ripped off two nights ago.  
                        Two men were killed.  Right on the 
                        docks where the load was delivered.  We 
                        figured the sellers wanted to hold onto 
                        both ends of the deal.  

                                        IRWIN
                        Case solved.  Thanks for stopping by.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Then we found a sunken motorboat under 
                        the dock.  Bullet holes in it.  Someone 
                        else was there and drove the load out.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Which all has nothing to do with us --  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Whoever did it knew the time and place 
                        of the off-load.  Hard information to 
                        come by without ties to the Bratva.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We re not Bratva.  I m not even Russian.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        You became both when you married a 
                        Lazarev.  

                                        STEVEN
                                (holding up his cell phone)
                        Ethnic profiling.  Caught on tape.

    He laughs nervously.  No one else does.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Here s the thing.  Forensics can tell 
                        where a boat is from, just by the 
                        algae on its hull.  Seems that motor-
                        boat came from right around... here.
                              (no response, glances at Irwin)
                        Maybe you got tired of being small time.

                                        STEVEN
                        Yeah, maybe we lost our minds.                                                                                     11.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        Either way, Schiller will figure it 
                        out.  Which means whoever did it is 
                        dead.  Everyone he cares about is dead.  
                        Unless... he lets the Bureau help him.

    Again, they have no reaction.  Leeflang just shrugs.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        You have my number.

    Leeflang heads back up the dock with a satisfied expression.  
    They watch him disappear.  The second he s gone, Franklin 
    SPINS on Irwin -- 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What did you do?!

                                        IRWIN
                        -- No one s gonna find out --

                                        STEVEN
                        -- Wait, what? --

    Franklin violently PINS Irwin against a boat, choking him --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What did you do to us?

                                        IRWIN 
                        I - told you - I wanted to expand... 

    Franklin recoils, as if hit.  Steven paces, freaked out.  

                                        STEVEN
                        You said - you had product.  You never 
                        said it was Schiller s!  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        My God.  You killed two people. 

                                        IRWIN
                        Trust me, they were not good guys.   
                        Look, it s safe in the J Boat --

                                        STEVEN
                        It s here!?  

    Franklin leans against the boat, horror washing over him --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We re all dead.

    Off him - HEAR THE RING OF A SCHOOL BELL --                                                                                    12.


    EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY 

    CLOSE ON BORIS S BACKPACK - as we HEAR the sound of children 
    at play.  INCLUDE Boris, wearing his backpack, walking 
    across the blacktop at recess, toward the periphery to --

    A SECLUDED KNOT OF REDWOOD TREES - where he finds TRENT, 13.  
    Trent leans against a tree, listening to his iPod with BOSE 
      HEADPHONES.  Boris approaches with trepidation.  

                                        TRENT
                        Look.  It s Doris.

                                        BORIS 
                        Will you please return my headphones?

                                        TRENT  
                        What headphones?

                                        BORIS 
                        The ones on your head.  You borrowed 
                        them last week.  

                                        TRENT
                        You re saying I stole them. 

                                        BORIS 
                        Give me my headphones. 

    Trent picks up a pinecone, PELTS Boris with it.

                                        BORIS
                        Don t do that.

    But Trent keeps LOBBING PINE CONES, unaware of the ticking 
    time bomb in Boris  backpack - for which Boris now reaches --

                                        TRENT
                        What did you say, Doris?

    -- Suddenly, Boris PULLS OUT THE HANDGUN.  Trent rears back --

                                        BORIS
                        Give me my headphones.

    OFF his intensity, the gun shaking in his hands -- 

    EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - THE RICHMOND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

    CLOSE ON MARTA - aware only of Kat's wedding crisis.  She 
    strides through the drab, treeless ethnic neighborhood.  Store 
    SIGNS written in Russian.  She passes two BABUSHKAS who wave, 
    friendly.  Everyone knows each other here.  Marta arrives at --                                                                                    13.


    EXT. CAFE ROSSIYA (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

    A traditional Russian restaurant.  Leaning in the doorway, 
    is LUTHER, 40, her father's bodyguard.  Deadly calm, but 
    wry, lean, muscular.  He smokes a cigarette.  Marta smiles. 

                                        MARTA
                        You the doorman now?

                                        LUTHER
                        They won t let me light up inside.

                                        MARTA
                        Good.  Maybe you ll quit smoking.

                                        LUTHER
                                (deadpan)
                        Yes.  That s very likely.

                                        MARTA
                                (smiling)
                        Is he here? 

                                        LUTHER
                        In his office.

    Marta gives Luther a friendly kiss on the cheek.  For a 
    split second, his eyes linger on her.  We might sense he has 
    a soft spot for her.  He holds the door open --

    INT. CAFE ROSSIYA (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

    -- Marta enters this Old World restaurant: wood paneling, 
    heavy rugs on the floors, ornate light fixtures.  As Marta s 
    eyes adjust to the dim lighting, she SEES --

    MARTA S POV - ANDREI LAZAREV, 60 S

    -- holding court at a back table, his  office.   Charismatic, 
    commands respect, a man of appetites, but aging well.  

    He's surrounded by several MEN in their 60's, speaking in 
    low tones.  This is old school Russian mob.  A dying breed.  
    An ENVELOPE of cash is slid across the table to Andrei.  

    Marta turns away, wants nothing to do with his business.  
    Frankly, doesn t love being here.  She waits by the bar.  
    Her father then sees her, dissolves his meeting with a wave.

                                        ANDREI
                        We ll finish this later.  

    As they leave, he goes to Marta with open arms.  They hug --                                                                                    14.


                                        ANDREI
                        Devochka moya.  You never visit.

                                        MARTA
                        I m here now, Dad.

                                        ANDREI
                        Do you want to eat?  I ll have Sasha 
                        bring you some pelmeni.

                                        MARTA
                        I can t stay.  I just... Dad... Mom 
                        doesn t want the Poo - Felicity, at 
                        the wedding.  

                                        ANDREI
                        Does she know how much it s costing me?

                                        MARTA
                        She won t come. 

                                        ANDREI
                        Then she can pay for the band, and the  
                        caterer, and the invitations - and 
                        Felicity s dress --

    They re interrupted by a SQUEAL.  FELICITY, AKA the POODLE, 
    enters and sees Marta.  Killer body, trashy style, well-
    meaning but oblivious.  She scurries to Marta, hugging her.

                                        FELICITY 
                        Hi hi hi hi hi!

                                        MARTA 
                        Hi, Felicity.

                                        FELICITY
                        Aren t you so excited for the wedding 
                        tomorrow?  Andrei bought me the most 
                        amazing dress.  You have to see it --   

    Marta shoots her father a pleading look, but he s a man 
    whose own needs come first.  Felicity pulls her toward the 
    back, to A LOCKED DOOR - which she quickly unlocks --

    INT. CAFE ROSSIYA - THE BACK ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

    -- Felicity pulls Marta inside and reaches into a closet.  
    Marta notices a large stack of ROLEX BOXES.  Again, she 
    doesn t want to know, turns away --

                                        MARTA
                        Felicity - Kat added some last minute 
                        guests to the wedding and --                                                                                    15.


                                        FELICITY
                        Feel the material!

    She pulls out the small piece of fabric that is her dress.  

                                        MARTA
                        That is... a statement.

                                        FELICITY
                        I know!  

                                        MARTA 
                        Anyway, we were hoping you could help 
                        redo seat assignments, place cards --

                                        FELICITY
                        Oh my God.  I m so glad you asked!    

    She hugs Marta again.  For a second, Marta feels bad.  Then 
    she hands Felicity a list --  

                                        MARTA
                        Yeah, well, here are their names.  
                        They ve all rsvp d --

                                        FELICITY
                              (re: the list, face falling)
                        ... Valentin Petrov will be there?

                                        MARTA 
                        Yes, the boxer.  Do you know him?   

                                        FELICITY
                        No, I - I m sorry... I, God, I ve been 
                        fighting something... a cold... 

                                        MARTA
                        Oh, well, just feel better by tomorrow.

    That seems unlikely, given how green Felicity looks.  Marta 
    can t help a tiny smile.  Her cell RINGS - she answers -- 

                                        MARTA
                        Hello?  Yes, it is... 

    She stops abruptly, horror growing on her face...

    EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

    Marta pulls up in her Lexus to FIND a SQUAD CAR at the curb.  
    She SEES, in the back seat, BORIS, looking small, terrified.  
    TEARS spring to her eyes as she climbs out and starts toward 
    him.  But the PRINCIPAL blocks her path --                                                                                    16.


                                        PRINCIPAL
                        We were lucky, Mrs. Walraven - I 
                        happened to be nearby and contained the 
                        situation before anyone else saw...

    She nods, keeps moving, but the Principal stops her again.

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        The police will let us handle it, and 
                        the other boy s parents have agreed, 
                        but only if Boris is expelled.

                                        MARTA
                                (flaring, spins on him)
                        And the monster who s been bullying 
                        him?  Will he be expelled? --

                    PRINCIPALMARTA 
    He wasn t the one with the -- I ve been telling you 
    gun --about him for months, and 
                                                you ve done nothing --

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        -- You could appeal.  But the police 
                        would be forced to build a case 
                        against Boris.  Which could lead to an 
                          investigation of your entire family.  
                                (pointed)
                        Do you understand, Mrs. Walraven?

    The threat is clear.  Marta seethes but can do nothing.  
    Frustration, fury, shame course through her as the Principal 
    walks away.  Marta turns back to the squad car...  

    PUSH IN ON HER FACE, as she looks at Boris.  Her baby.  And 
    she has failed him.  It s a terrible moment.  Then we see 
    something click in her mind.  A decision.  

    INT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGH

    Marta descends the stairs and enters to find Franklin 
    sucking down a beer.  Glancing out the window nervously.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Is Boris alright? 

                                        MARTA
                        No.  He s not.  

    Franklin nods, distracted, anxious... though not about Boris.

                                        MARTA
                        This is my fault.  I swore I d never 
                        expose them to the life I grew up in...                                                                                    17.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        Babe, they don t know anything about it.

                                        MARTA
                        I let Irwin pull you into to this... 
                         side business.   You kept promising 
                        to get out.  And I kept doing nothing.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        The kids have never been exposed --

                                        MARTA 
                        He had your gun!  We pay those private 
                        school tuitions with your drug money.  
                        We re lucky Boris only got expelled.  He 
                        could have killed someone or gone to 
                        jail - his life could have ended today.

    The shame and guilt finally hit Franklin.  He sits heavily.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        You re right.  Jesus.  I m... sorry.

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin.  I mean it this time.  You 
                        have to quit that business.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I... I m not sure that s --

                                        MARTA 
                        -- After Kat s wedding tomorrow, we ll 
                        make a plan to downsize.  We can sell 
                        the house.  I can help at the Marina 
                        like I used to.  Make the charter 
                        business profitable again --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I... can t now, things are complicated. 

                                        MARTA 
                        -- You don t understand, Franklin.  
                                (looks him in the eye)
                        I will protect my kids.  At any cost.  
                        So if you don t get out now - I will 
                        take the children.  And I will leave 
                        you.  

    It s clear she means every word.  Off her, fierce --

                                    END OF ACT I                                                                                     18.


                                        ACT II

    CLOSE ON HUEY LEWIS!

    (Or some other semi-famous Bay Area musician) SINGING his 
    big hit  POWER OF LOVE  (or something).  WIDEN TO INCLUDE --

    INT. MARINA CLUBHOUSE - RECEPTION - EVENING

    Huey performs for this raucous party of boisterous, half-
    crocked Russian  migr s, and doughy, conservative 
    Midwesterners.  Platters of food everywhere.  Libations 
    flowing.  Toasts being made --  

    ON THE DANCE FLOOR - FIND radiant bride KAT, and groom, JOE 
    CRUMB, 30 s.  He wears a suit and Irwin s tie, but an 
    artist s long hair and tattoos.  Still, he's a sweet, 
    Midwest transplant who adores his bride.  The SONG ENDS  --  

                                        HUEY
                        Thank you!  Thanks!  I have time for 
                        one more, but I ll need some help... 
                        from my old friend Andrei!

    Andrei feigns embarrassment, but climbs on stage.  He s 
    beyond awful, but the crowd loves him --

    ANGLE ON A TABLE 

    Marta sits next to Vera, who holds BORIS in her lap - he 
    still looks at sea.  Franklin sits on Marta s other side, 
      distracted, drinking too much.  Marta resists the impulse to 
    assuage him.  She lets loose a piercing two-finger WHISTLE --

                                        MARTA
                        Rock on, Dad!

    She punches  devil s horns  fingers in the air.  Even Vera 
    has to smile at Andrei s antics. 

                                        VERA
                        What a ham.

    Marta glances at Franklin, who does another shot of vodka.  

    Suddenly, Marta s best friend, DINA, lurches up behind them, 
    bejeweled, designer-dressed, her husband in tow, (who we 
    discover is) STEVEN.  Steven and Franklin share a silent 
    look, and then a shot of vodka.  Dina is oblivious --

                                        DINA
                        Kat looks stunning!  It reminds me of 
                        your wedding dress...                                                                                     19.


    Marta and Franklin s eyes meet briefly.  It was so long ago.  

                                        DINA
                         Cept Kat didn t barf all over hers.  

                                        MARTA
                        I was nervous!  

                                        DINA
                        I still got you down the aisle.

                                        MARTA
                        That you did. 

    Marta, laughing, pulls her into a hug.  These two are tight.  

                                        DINA
                        Get up and dance, you two!  

    -- as Dina drags Steven out to the dance floor.  Marta smiles.  
    Then sees Franklin pouring another shot.  She s concerned.

                                        MARTA
                        You want a pirozhki to go with that?  
                        They re from Dad s restaurant.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I m good.

                                        MARTA
                        I ll get you one.

    Marta rises, heads past - GABRIEL and NATALIE, who watch the 
    drunken dancing.  STAY ON THEM as Natalie eyes Franklin --

                                        NATALIE
                        What s wrong with Dad?

                                        GABRIEL
                        Probably feeling like the moron he is 
                        for leaving a frickin  gun in his car.

                                        NATALIE
                                (surprised by his hostility)
                        Or it s  cause you ve been such a jerk 
                        to him lately.  What s your problem?

    Gabriel debates answering but walks away instead.  FOLLOW 
    HIM PAST - IRWIN, who we STAY ON as he talks on his cell --

                                        IRWIN
                        Near the Alameda bridge.  In an hour? 

    -- he looks up as ANDREI passes him, disdainful --                                                                                    20.


                                        ANDREI 
                        It s your sister s wedding.  Hang up.

    Irwin flushes with shame, resentment.  ANDREI CONTINUES PAST --

    THE BUFFET TABLE - where Marta loads a plate.  She glances 
    at JOE, as a DRUNK RUSSIAN slips an ENVELOPE, his gift to 
    the couple, into Joe s pocket.  He heartily claps Joe on the 
    back, then stumbles away.  Joe, curious, pulls out the 
    envelope, reels at the CASH inside.  Marta approaches -- 

                                        MARTA
                        Careful, Joe.  There s always a catch.

    She s emotional, but Joe doesn t quite get it.  She SEES -- 

    ANGLE ON FRANKLIN 

    Irwin approaches him with Steven in tow.  Irwin leans in.

                                        IRWIN
                        My buyer wants in.  Let me walk you 
                        through it.

    Irwin nods toward the exit, heads out.  Steven shrugs, follows 
    suit.  Franklin sighs, rises, heads out, but glances over at --

    MARTA - He forces an unconvincing smile as he exits.  Marta, 
    concerned, begins to follow, when DINA dances up, grabbing her.  

                                        DINA
                        Why aren t you dancing?

                                        MARTA
                        Where are Franklin and Steven going?  

                                        DINA
                        I don t know and I don t care.  Ya 
                        can t touch this! --

    -- as she breaks into a ridiculous hammer dance.  Marta 
    laughs, gives up and joins Dina on the DANCE FLOOR, both 
    doing hammer dances.  Natalie, nearby, is mortified.  

    EXT. MARINA - NIGHT

    -- The MUSIC wafts over the bobbing vessels as we land on a 
    sleek J BOAT.  HEAR the men s voices inside --  

    INT. J BOAT HOLD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    START ON A FALSE WALL as a KEY unlocks it - it s pulled aside 
    to REVEAL the sealed BRICKS OF LAUGHING DOG COCAINE.  INCLUDE 
    Franklin, who stares at it in disbelief.  Irwin s proud.                                                                                     21.


                                        STEVEN
                        Smells like rotten fish.

                                        IRWIN
                        Covers the product scent in case of 
                        dogs.  It s okay, they re sealed tight. 

    He tosses Steven a BRICK.  Steven slices into it.  Takes out 
    a credit card and begins cutting a line.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We can t sell this.  The only thing we 
                        have going for us is that Schiller 
                        knows we re not in this business --

                                        STEVEN
                                (snorting a line)
                        ... It s good. 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Seriously, Steven?

                                        IRWIN
                        My buyer has no connection to 
                        Schiller.  He s from Japan.  Has an 
                        official at a Yokohama port.  We ll 
                        use our export contacts on this end --
                              (off Franklin s look)
                        What?  You have a better plan?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We dump it.

                                        STEVEN
                        Throw away seventy-five keys?  

                                        IRWIN
                        My buyer s ready to negotiate.  He s 
                        in Oakland for the night.  I ll slip 
                        away, you ll say I never left.  
                              (see Franklin s struggling)
                        Hey, I don t want force you --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- You already did, Irwin.  The second 
                        you stole this.

    Irwin shrugs.  Franklin debates a terrible decision.  Finally --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Christ.  I ll do it.  But only to make 
                        sure it s done right.  Then I m out.                                                                                      22.


                                        IRWIN
                        Sure.  Out.  Over.  Done. 

    -- as Irwin kneels by a bench, lifts the cushion - reaches 
    into a compartment - SEE THREE GUNS in there.  He grabs one.  

                                        STEVEN
                        We keeping the load here?

                                        IRWIN
                        Safest place for it, since Frankie 
                        registered this boat under a fake name.  
                        Can t be traced to us.  

    He then faces Franklin.  Hugs him, sincere, grateful. 

                                        IRWIN
                        This is gonna be good for us.  

    Franklin just looks at him, emotional, torn.  Irwin climbs 
    out.  Steven follows, looks back at Franklin with concern --

                                        STEVEN
                        You coming?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I just... need a minute. 

    Steven climbs up out of the hold.  Franklin, alone, looks at all 
    that coke.  Hates it.  He closes the false wall.  LOCKS IT.  

    A long beat.  He pulls out his CELL PHONE.  Debates his next 
    move, tormented.  Then Franklin dials a number...

    INT. MARINA CLUBHOUSE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

    ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Dina dances with the coked-up Steven, 
    who masks his condition - or Dina s choosing to ignore it.

    NEWLYWEDS KAT AND JOE - dance cheek to cheek.  Loving.  
      Passionate.  Ready to spend their lives together.  

                                        JOE
                        My family s a little afraid for me. 

                                        KAT
                        Why?

    Joe nods to a TABLE of drunk, carousing THUGS.  Kat laughs.

                                        KAT
                        They're my father's friends.  I don t 
                        even know them.                                                                                    23.


                                        JOE
                        I knew about your family... but, man.

                                        KAT
                        You married me, not my family.

                                        JOE
                        So we re staying away from all that?

                                        KAT
                        It s just you and me.  The Crumbs.  

                                        JOE
                        You re seriously going to take my name.

                                        KAT
                        Kat Crumb.  I love it. 

    They kiss.  Joe pulls her close.  PICK UP Kat's mother, 
    VERA, who passes them - STAY WITH VERA as she goes to -- 

    THE BAR - Vera sidles up to ANDREI, who s doing a shot.  

                                        VERA
                        You didn t bring your poodle?

                                        ANDREI
                        I don t know who you mean.
                                (then)
                        She s sick.

                                        VERA
                        Aw.  Poor lamb.  And poor you.  I know 
                        how much you love to dance.

    Andrei eyes her, the booze fueling whatever buried feelings 
    he might still have for her... This as FRANKLIN passes them.  
    STAY WITH FRANKLIN, who looks like a wreck.  He approaches --

    MARTA S TABLE - She looks up, sees his face.  She rises as 
    he offers her his hand --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Dance with me?

                                        MARTA
                        Is everything okay?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I want to dance with my wife.

                                        MARTA
                                (beat, smiles)
                        Is that so?                                                                                    24.


    ON THE DANCE FLOOR - As Marta and Franklin move together.  

                                        MARTA
                        Did you tell Irwin and Steven?  That 
                        you want out?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I m working on it.

    He pulls her closer.  Then he nods toward someone -- 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Wow.  

    Marta follows his gaze to --

    ANDREI AND VERA - dancing together.  What's worse, Andrei's 
    HAND furtively moves down to Vera's butt. 

    Marta buries her head in Franklin's shoulder.

                                        MARTA
                        My eyes, my eyes!

    Franklin can't help but laugh, as he spins her... off them, 
    their first shared laugh of the night...

    EXT. RICHMOND BRIDGE - NIGHT

    IRWIN'S BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE drives across the long steel 
    bridge toward the East Bay.  As it reaches the other side... 

    INT./EXT. ESCALADE - SAME

    Irwin drives.  Then he sees, in the REARVIEW MIRROR - AN UNMARKED 
    SEDAN rev up behind him.  Its RED & BLUES FLASH, a SIREN blaring.  

                                        IRWIN
                        Nonononono....

    Irwin SPEEDS up, but a SECOND SEDAN pulls up, then two more.  

    Irwin pulls over to the SHOULDER, POUNDING on the wheel in 
    frustration.  He watches FBI AGENTS pour out of the sedans -- 

    EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    LEEFLANG sidles up to the driver's window, knocks on it.  It 
    rolls down to reveal a now smiling Irwin.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Please step out of the car.

    As Irwin gets out, TREJO initiates a SEARCH of his vehicle.                                                                                      25.


                                        IRWIN
                        Since when is the FBI issuing speeding 
                        tickets?  

                                        LEEFLANG
                         Fraid speeding is the least of your 
                        concerns.

    He holds up a document.  Irwin takes it, surprised.

                                        IRWIN
                        A warrant?  For what?  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Hands on the hood, please.

    Irwin spreads eagle on the hood.  Leeflang pats him down as --

                                        IRWIN
                        There was no tail - I was looking. 
                        How d you know I d be here?  

    Trejo approaches, carrying IRWIN S GUN.

                                        TREJO
                        Serial numbers are filed off.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        This isn t good, Irwin.  A convicted 
                        felon in possession of a weapon.  
                        It ll buy you some jail time.

                                        IRWIN
                        Not enough to make it worth all this.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Maybe.  But see... Schiller has people 
                        on the inside.  I can t help you in 
                        there.  But I can help you out here -    
                        if you want to discuss Schiller s 
                        missing product.  

    He looks at Irwin.  Waiting.  But Irwin smiles cheekily.

                                        IRWIN
                        I ll take that speeding ticket now.

    Leeflang just looks at him as ANOTHER AGENT leads him away.  

                                        TREJO
                        So that s our endgame here?  Throw him 
                        in the pen and hope he talks?                                                                                      26.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        He won t talk.  Has too much to prove.  
                        But I agreed to get him out of the way 
                        on a minor charge.  Part of the deal.

                                        TREJO
                        Your tipster better come through.

    Leeflang knows this all too well.  Off him, tense --  

    INT. MARINA CLUBHOUSE - RECEPTION - NIGHT

    The party is winding down; a few remaining couples slow 
    dance, including FRANKLIN and MARTA.  He gazes at her, glad 
    he has her.  Then someone TAPS him on the shoulder --  

    STEVEN is there, holding a cell phone.  Glaring.  

                                        STEVEN
                        Come on.

    He strides outside.  Marta gives Franklin a questioning look.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        He s high.  I ll deal with him.

    He kisses Marta.  She might follow, but she SEES BORIS 
    sitting alone.  She goes to him. 

                                        MARTA
                        I thought you went home with Grandma.

                                        BORIS
                      I haven t seen her.

                                        MARTA
                        In that case, you re gonna have to 
                        dance with me. 

    He shyly lets her pull him to the dance floor.  She glances 
    at the door, SEES Franklin and Steven in a tense discussion --

    EXT. MARINA CLUBHOUSE - RECEPTION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    Steven is in Franklin s face.  

                                        STEVEN
                        They just  happened  to pull Irwin 
                        over now.  With a gun in his car.  We 
                        were the only ones who knew!

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Why would I tip them?                                                                                    27.


                                        STEVEN
                         Cause you re afraid to go through 
                        with this.  You d rather have him in 
                        jail, you chickenshit - am I next?!  
                        You goddamn coward -- !

    -- He SHOVES Franklin, who SHOVES back.  Steven THROWS A 
    PUNCH.  Franklin blocks him.  They scuffle.  MARTA - hurries 
    out.  GUESTS follow, shocked.  Appalled.

                                        MARTA
                        Stop this!

    KAT AND JOE exit, horrified.  Franklin shoves Steven down.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        You re high, Steven.  Go home.

                                        STEVEN
                        I ll kill you!  

    -- as he jumps up and LUNGES at Franklin, KNOCKING him down.  
    Punching him.  Franklin swings back, defending himself.  
    Finally, LUTHER appears, PULLS Steven off Franklin --

                                        LUTHER
                        Calm down, brother.  

    Steven struggles against Luther s iron hold.  Dina runs up --

                                        DINA
                        What the hell, Steven!
                              (to Luther)
                        Will you just - let him go?

                                        LUTHER
                                (beat, to Steven)
                        It s a party, man.

                                        STEVEN
                        A party, yeah.  

    Finally, Luther lets him go.  Steven pulls away, PISSED.  He 
    glares at Franklin, then storms off.  Dina is mortified.  

                                        DINA
                        I m... so sorry.

    She shoots Marta an apologetic look, hurries after Steven.  
    Marta goes to Franklin, who forces a smile for the crowd --

                                        FRANKLIN
                         S all good folks.  We re celebrating 
                        the happy couple here, right?                                                                                      28.


    He gestures towards the Clubhouse.  People are reluctant, 
    but slowly move inside.  Marta just pulls Franklin away --

    EXT. ANOTHER DOCK - NIGHT 

    Marta pulls Franklin to a dark, private area.

                                        MARTA
                        Was that about you getting out?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I - don t know.  It s a mess --

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin.  I meant what I said.

                    FRANKLINMARTA
    I know.  I will leave --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- I know! 

    A long pause.  Finally, he looks at her.  Dead serious.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        If this is what you really want, I can 
                        get out --

                                        MARTA
                        -- It s what I want --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- But we d have to go.  Leave 
                          everything.  

                                        MARTA
                        What are you talking about?  You ll 
                        just... stop.  Go legit --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- Marta, we re in The Life --

                                        MARTA
                        You re barely connected --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        You don t know - over the years, 
                        protection fees, my trade routes - it 
                        keeps me tangled up - and now --
                                (stops himself)
                        We d have to take the kids and go --

                                        MARTA
                        -- Go where?                                                                                    29.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        I don t know.  But we could never come 
                        back.  We d leave everything, the 
                        Marina, the family --  

                                        MARTA
                        -- Gabriel has S.A.T s.  And Boris --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        This is the only way, Marta.
                                (looks into her eyes)
                        Do you want out? 

    They stare at each other, overwhelmed by the intensity of 
    the moment.  This man is the father of Marta s children, the 
    love of her life.  But what he s asking... then...

                                        MARTA
                        Yes.  

    The word takes her by surprise.  Then with more conviction --

                                        MARTA
                        Yes.  I want that.    

    She laughs.  So does he.  It s just so absurd.  And 
    exhilarating.  They hold each other, then kiss... 

    INT. MARTA AND FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

    Marta and Franklin make love as they haven't in a long time.  
    We see the passion of their connection.  Their deep 
    attraction to, and love for each other.  Off them...

    EXT. SAUSALITO BAY - MORNING

    The sun rises on this lovely hamlet - who d ever want to leave it?

    INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 

    CLOSE ON SEVERAL LISTS - packing lists, to do lists, notes to self.  
    INCLUDE MARTA, who is abuzz with energy.  At the counter, BORIS 
    eats his Lucky Charms.  FRANKLIN strides in, jangling his car keys.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Come on, Bor, we re gonna go work on 
                        the boat!

                                        BORIS
                        It s Saturday. 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We gotta get it in shape.  Might be 
                        using it soon.                                                                                      30.


    He and Marta share a conspiratorial smile.  Then Franklin 
    tosses his keys to Boris. 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I ll let you drive.

    Boris grins, slips the keys in his pocket.  Franklin puts 
    his arm around Marta, kissing her.  They're like newlyweds.  

    Then Franklin GRABS up Boris, THROWS him over his shoulder 
    in a fireman s carry - Boris laughs --

                                        BORIS
                        Put me down!

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Not  til you swab them decks, matey.

    -- as Franklin carries him out.  Marta smiles after them.  
    She moves to put the Lucky Charms away - then SEES -
    FRANKLIN S KEYS - lying on the floor.  Clearly, they fell 
    out of Boris' pocket.  She kneels, picks them up --

    Then she HEARS something outside - a MOTORCYCLE, then a 
    sickening POP POP POP!  Everything stops down to SLOW MOTION 
    as she realizes - it was the sound of AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE.  

    Marta shoves Franklin s keys into the POCKET OF HER HOODIE 
    as she BOLTS for the door --

    EXT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - MOTOR COURT (CONTINUOUS)- MORNING

    -- Marta BURSTS out to FIND --

    FRANKLIN lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood.  

    BORIS standing beside his father, in shock, frozen.  

    Marta runs to Boris, covers his eyes.  Then looks down at her 
    husband.  She releases Boris, who seems almost catatonic --

    Marta kneels beside Franklin, the life bleeding out of him.  
    She tries to stem the bleeding, putting pressure on a wound.  

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin!  Can you hear me?!  
                                (yelling)
                        Help me!!!  Someone HELP ME!!!

    As we PULL UP AND BACK on her SCREAMING for help.  Weeping 
    over Franklin's body...

                                    END OF ACT II                                                                                    31.


                                        ACT III

    INT. A LONG HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

    Empty, but for one NURSE walking toward us, carrying a 
    plastic bag.  The SQUISH SQUISH of her shoes is the only 
    sound we hear.  As she nears, INCLUDE -- 

    MARTA - dazed, lifeless, watching the Nurse approach,  
    staring at THE BAG - the print of Franklin s shirt visible 
    through the clear plastic.  The Nurse offers it to Marta.

                                        NURSE
                        Your husband s personal affects.  
                              (off Marta s blank look)
                        I need to ask you about arrangements...

    Marta doesn t hear her.  She turns, looks at --

    HER CHILDREN - a dazed BORIS sits with ANDREI and VERA.  
    GABRIEL sits on the floor, emotions raging.  KAT, JOE and 
    LUTHER are there.  Joe holds a weeping NATALIE.  

    AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL - POLICE hover.  LEEFLANG is with 
    them, watching the family closely.  

    ON THE NURSE - as she offers Marta a sheet of paper --

                                        NURSE
                        This is a list of funeral homes - if 
                        you haven t already engaged one.

    Marta just stares at it, tears rising again.  Luther 
      intercedes, guides the Nurse away with a firm hand --

                                        LUTHER 
                        I ll be handling arrangements...

    Marta breaks down.  Kat comes to her.  Holds her.   

                                        KAT
                        Oh, honey...

                                        MARTA
                        Boris saw it.  He saw everything.  I 
                        can t even imagine... 

                                        KAT
                        Children are strong.  Stronger than us.

    ANGLE ON LEEFLANG

    -- SEEING the depth of Marta s grief.  He feels something he 
    rarely does: sympathy.  His partner, Celia Trejo appears --                                                                                    32.


                                        TREJO
                        James.  It wasn t in his personal 
                        effects.  Maybe one of them has it.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        I doubt they even know about it.

                                        TREJO
                        Someone must.  Or he wouldn t be dead.  

    He can t disagree.  He turns to go, pulling out his PHONE --

    ANGLE ON BORIS AND ANDREI

    As Vera steps away, Andrei pulls Boris closer, affectionate.  

                                        ANDREI
                        You saw what happened, didn t you?
                              (off Boris  shrug)
                        If the police question you, you can 
                        say what you saw.  Just tell them.  
                        But if they want to know other things 
                        about us.  Just say you don t know.  
                        That s all.  We re not their business.

                                        BORIS
                        There was a motorcycle.

                                        ANDREI
                        That s good.  You tell them that.

    Another generation being indoctrinated.  

    ON THE END OF THE HALL - DINA PUSHES THROUGH

    -- hurries to the family, tear-stained.  Something hardens 
    in Marta s eyes as Dina approaches --

                                        DINA
                        I came as soon as I heard --

    Dina tries to hug Marta - but Marta backs up.

                                        MARTA
                        I think you should leave.

                                        DINA
                        What?  Of course I m not leaving --

                                        KAT
                        It s not you.  It s just too much --

                                        MARTA
                        -- Why isn t Steven here?                                                                                    33.


                                        DINA
                        I m... sure he s coming -- 

                                        MARTA 
                        -- What did he and Franklin fight 
                        about last night? 

                                        DINA 
                        I don t know.  Business?  Irwin would 
                        know -- 

                                        MARTA
                        Steven threatened to kill Franklin.  
                        Now Franklin s dead.  

                                        DINA
                        My God, Marta, he d never do that.

                                        MARTA
                                (pointedly)
                        Are you sure?

    -- and for just a millisecond, Dina isn t.  Marta sees it.

                                        MARTA
                        Tell him to stay the hell away from my 
                        family.

    Dina sees Marta has shut her out.  Devastated, she retreats.  

    Marta s strength is tapped out.  She crumbles.  Gabriel goes 
    to her.  Holds her.  Marta reaches for Boris, pulls him into 
    the hug.  Natalie joins in.  Off this tableau of grief...

    INT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

    The kids enter - dazed, devastated.  The house feels empty.  
    Gabriel goes off in one direction.  Natalie in another.  
    Boris just stands there with a thousand yard stare.  

    Marta comes in behind him.  Sees he s at sea.  It s 
    heartbreaking.  She gently guides him upstairs.  

    INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    Natalie tears her  pretty  SKETCHES out of her pad.  Begins 
    a dark black charcoal sketch of something haunting, grim. 

    EXT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

    Gabriel approaches the pool.  Stares at it.  JUMPS into it 
    fully dressed.  Sinks to the bottom and stays there.  Off 
    him, we PULL UP AND BACK ON THE POOL to INCLUDE --                                                                                    34.


    EXT. BACK OF THE WALRAVEN HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    THROUGH THE WALLS OF GLASS, we SEE THE FAMILY, each member in 
      a different room, separate, alone.  
    -- LIVING ROOM - Natalie scratching her grief into her sketch 
    pad; 
    -- BORIS  ROOM - Boris standing in his pajamas at the window.  
    -- MARTA S ROOM - Marta sitting on the edge of her bed in a 
    her robe.  Just... dazed.  Hollow.   

    INT. MARTA S ROOM - SAME

    ON MARTA still sitting on the bed.  Overwhelmed.  STAY ON 
    HER as NIGHT TURNS TO DAY and we FIND OURSELVES --

    INT. MARTA AND FRANKLIN'S ROOM - MORNING

    Marta has been here all night.  KAT appears in the doorway, 
    gently knocks on the jamb, goes to Marta, kneels by her.

                                        KAT
                        Are you hungry?  Do you need anything?

                                        MARTA 
                        I need... to know.  

    Marta looks up; Kat sees the anger in her face.  

                                        MARTA
                        I need to know who did this.

                                        KAT
                        We ll find out.  Dad has... people --

                                        MARTA
                        No.  I want to look this murderer in 
                        the eye.  If it was Steven...

                                        KAT
                                (nods, completely gets it)
                        Maybe Dina was right, Irwin might know 
                        what they were fighting about --

    Marta abruptly rises.  Pulls on a sweater, grabs her purse --

                                        MARTA 
                        Can you stay with the kids? --

    -- Before Kat can answer, Marta s gone.

    INT. PRISON - VISITORS ROOM - DAY 

    Marta sits at a table across from IRWIN.  They talk in whispers, 
    cautious not to be overheard.  They re both emotional.                                                                                    35.


                                        IRWIN 
                        We ll find out who did this.  

                                        MARTA 
                        I might already know... Steven...

                                        IRWIN
                        Steven?  No, I don t see it --

                                        MARTA
                        They fought at the wedding.  Do you 
                        know why?

    Irwin debates how to respond.  Finally, with some reluctance --

                                        IRWIN
                        If I had to guess, I d say it was 
                        about... Schiller.

                                        MARTA 
                                (reacts, chilled)
                        You have nothing to do with him.

                                        IRWIN
                        We... took something of his.  A large 
                        amount.  We thought we pulled it off.  

                                        MARTA
                        That... makes no sense.  Even Dad is 
                        afraid of Schiller.  Franklin wouldn t 
                        put us in that kind of danger --  

                                        IRWIN
                        -- It was Franklin s idea.  

    She looks at him, not believing, but he s so convincing.

                                        IRWIN
                        -- He wanted one last pay day, to cash 
                        out.  I don t know why.

                                        MARTA
                        I... asked him to quit...

                                        IRWIN
                        This isn t your fault, sweetie.  We 
                        don t know what he was thinking.  

    She s still confused, trying to decipher it all.

                                        IRWIN
                        The only thing we can do now is get 
                        rid of the load. 
                              (off her dazed nod)
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    36.

                                        IRWIN (CONT'D)
                        It s in the J Boat, berth sixteen.  
                        There s a false wall - Franklin s keys 
                        will unlock it.  I have a Japanese buyer 
                        with no ties to Schiller --

                                        MARTA 
                        What are you talking about?  

                                        IRWIN
                        You have to pick up where Franklin 
                        left off.  Steven can do the legwork -- 

                                        MARTA
                        Are you crazy?  I have three kids.

                                        IRWIN
                        Marta, listen to me.  Schiller has 
                        guys in here.  If I can t buy 
                          protection, I won t last long.  

    She feels for him, loves her brother.  She makes a decision.  

                                        MARTA
                        I have to give it back to Schiller.  

                                        IRWIN
                        What?

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin did this, and he paid the 
                        price.  I ll return the stash, the 
                        debt will be settled.  You ll be safe, 
                        the kids will be safe.  

                                        IRWIN
                        You re wrong, Marta - Marta!

    But Marta is already striding out.  Off her decisive face...

    INT. STEVEN & DINA'S HOUSE - DAY

    Expensive art, designer furnishings.  They live beyond their 
    means, but have great taste.  LOUD MUSIC PLAYS as STEVEN 
    works out on a ROWING MACHINE.  He s stressed, trying to 
    figure things out.  He stops.  SNORTS a spoonful of coke.  

    DINA enters.  Watches him for a moment.  Then comes up 
    behind him.  Wordlessly, she begins to rub his neck.  Then 
    kiss it.  Her hands move up his thighs.  

    Steven pulls her close.  As they kiss, she whispers, breathless --

                                        DINA
                        Just tell me...                                                                                      37.


                                        STEVEN
                        ... What should I tell you?

                                        DINA
                        ... I want to know... what you did...

                                        STEVEN
                        ... I do a lot of things...

                                        DINA
                        ... You were mad.  Maybe he... 
                        deserved it... 

    It takes a beat for her question to sink in.  He pulls away --

                                        DINA
                        You can tell me.

                                        STEVEN
                        Why would you even - I can t believe 
                        you asked me that.

    Steven storms out the front door.  OFF DINA, distressed --

    EXT. STEVEN & DINA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - AFTERNOON

    -- STEVEN exits - and is immediately GRABBED from behind.  A 
    SECOND MAN WITH A KNIFE SLASHES Steven s face, then his 
    CHEST, cutting through his t-shirt.  Then his forearm.  

    Steven drops, bleeding.  He looks up at the knife wielder, 
    LEON, 30 s, slick, detached, chillingly graceful.

                                        LEON
                        It will be major arteries next.

    Leon s younger, meaner associate, WALL, 20 s, leans down --

                                        WALL
                        You took something that belongs to Mr. 
                        Schiller.

                                        STEVEN
                        It wasn t me!  I swear! - AGH!

    -- As Leon SLASHES Steven s other arm - off his SCREAM --  

    INT. STEVEN AND DINA S HOUSE - SAME

    -- The MUSIC is still loud.  Dina hears nothing outside --

    EXT. STEVEN AND DINA S HOUSE - SAME

    Steven, bloodied, terrified, looks up at the two hit men --                                                                                    38.


                                        STEVEN
                      I didn t take it --
                                (holds up a hand)
                        -- but I know where it is!  

    Wall hoists Steven up.  They drag him to their car --

    EXT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - MOTOR COURT/INT. LEXUS - EVENING

    As MARTA S LEXUS pulls in, Marta is stunned to find the 
    driveway crammed with unmarked SEDANS.  AGENTS carry boxes 
    and computers out of the house --

    INT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

    Marta BURSTS in, aghast at the agents digging through her 
    things, furniture upended.  Open, empty drawers.  

    Marta SEES Natalie holding a frightened Boris.  Natalie s 
    scared, too.  Marta rushes to them.  Gabriel joins them as --

                                        NATALIE
                        They have a warrant, Mom.

                                        MARTA
                        It ll be alright.  Gabriel, drive them 
                        over to Kat and Joe s.  I ll join you 
                        after I straighten this out.

                                        GABRIEL
                        Come on, buddy, let s blow this 
                        clambake.

    He takes Boris  hand.  They head out with Natalie.  Marta 
    then turns to find herself facing Leeflang.  

                                        LEEFLANG 
                        Mrs. Walraven.  I m Agent James 
                        Leeflang --

                                        MARTA
                        -- My husband is barely cold.  My 
                        children are still in shock.  And you 
                        do this to us?

                                        LEEFLANG
                        We needed to get in before anything 
                        could be removed.

                                        MARTA
                        Tell me what the hell you re looking 
                        for.  I ll find it and you can get out.                                                                                    39.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        A computer memory stick.  We ve 
                        already searched your husband s car, 
                        his place of business --

                                        MARTA
                        -- How do you know there is a stick?

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Franklin called me the night before he 
                        was shot.  He planned to give it to me 
                        in the morning.  

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin.  Was going to give 
                        something... to you.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        He made a deal; he wanted you safe --

                                        MARTA
                        -- You don t know what he wanted.  You 
                        did not know my husband.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Maybe I knew him better than you did. 

    A beat - then Marta turns, heads for the stairs.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        You can t go up there.  We haven t --

                                        MARTA
                        I m barely holding it together here.  
                        So I m going to get myself and my 
                        children a change of clothes.  And I m 
                        going to leave before I explode.

    She turns, disappears up the stairs.  Leeflang taps Trejo --

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Watch her.

    INT. MARTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

    Marta enters, pulling off her clothes.  Trejo comes in right 
    behind her, watching every move.  It s humiliating.  Marta 
    digs through a pile of clothes.  Pulls on a T-shirt, mutters --  

                                        MARTA
                        Should be looking for whoever killed 
                        my husband - not destroying someone s 
                        home - traumatizing children...                                                                                     40.


    -- She grabs the HOODIE she wore the morning Franklin got 
    shot.  Slips it on.  All under the watchful eye of Trejo.  

    INT. MARTA S LEXUS/EXT. MARINA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

    Marta pulls into the lot, parks.  As she opens the door, she 
    digs FRANKLIN S KEYS out of her pocket - but stops, SEEING 
    something on them...

    -- THE SMALL PLASTIC SAILBOAT dangling from the chain.  She 
    PULLS IT APART - to reveal a memory stick.  She s devastated...

                                        MARTA
                        Oh, Franklin...

    A long beat - but she inhales courage and gets out --

    EXT. MARINA - NIGHT

    Marta heads down the dock to BERTH SIXTEEN, the J BOAT.  She 
    climbs aboard with trepidation.  Then climbs down into --

    INT. J BOAT HOLD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    Marta looks around, finds the false wall.  She pulls out 
    Franklin s keys, UNLOCKS the wall - PULLS IT ASIDE -- 

    TO FIND that the secret compartment is EMPTY.  Marta is 
    flummoxed... then suddenly --  

    She HEARS footsteps above.  Panicked, she looks for a weapon 
    - pulls open cabinets, then SEES the seat cushion askew.  
    She digs into the cabinet under the seat, FINDS A GUN --

    -- Just as STEVEN is thrown down the ladder with a THUD.   

    LEON and WALL descend the ladder... to find themselves 
    facing the GUN.  Marta clearly knows how to use it... though 
    she s never aimed one at a human being before.  

                                        MARTA
                        Get off my boat.

                                        WALL
                        Your boat?  You re Walraven s wife?

    He and Leon share a look.  Leon eyes Marta. 

                                        LEON
                        Something was stolen from Mr. 
                        Schiller.  He wants it back. 

    Marta just keeps aiming her gun.  Leon gives Steven a small kick.                                                                                    41.


                                        LEON
                        This asshole says it was here.  In 
                        that compartment.  So either he's 
                        lying or someone moved it.  

    Leon steps toward her - she COCKS THE GUN.  

                                        MARTA
                        I told you to leave.

                                        LEON
                        Your husband s dead.  Your brother s 
                        in jail.  That leaves you and little 
                        Stevie here responsible for Mr. 
                        Schiller s property.  

                                        MARTA
                        Me?  I had nothing to do with it.

                                        LEON
                        You ll return what was taken, or its 
                        cash value.

                                        WALL
                        About one point five million, plus 
                        interest.  

                                        LEON
                        I would do this soon.

    The two hit men start back up the ladder. 

                                        MARTA
                        I don t want any part of this.  This 
                        isn t my business.

                                        LEON
                        It is now.

    And they leave.  OFF MARTA, in way over her head...

                                  END OF ACT III                                                                                    42.


                                        ACT IV

    INT. MARTA'S LEXUS - NIGHT

    Marta drives.  Steven lays in the passenger seat.  Bloodied, 
    with bandages from a first aid kit on his wounds.  He looks 
    like hell.  The car goes over a bump.  He groans in pain.     

                                        MARTA
                        Oh for God s sake.  Let me take you to 
                          a hospital.

                                        STEVEN
                        No.  The cuts aren t deep.  
                                (silence, then...)
                        Franklin moved the stash.  Irwin was in 
                        jail so it had to be Franklin.  Or you.  
                              (off her sharp look)
                        You had his keys.  You obviously knew 
                        where it was.

                                        MARTA
                        Or you moved it, sold it, and are 
                        lying so they don t kill you.

                                        STEVEN
                        That wouldn t be much of a plan.

                                        MARTA
                        You re not much of a planner.

    EXT. STEVEN'S HOUSE/INT. LEXUS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    -- The Lexus stops.  Steven starts to climb out, but Marta 
    stops him.  Looks him in the eye.

                                        MARTA
                        Did you kill him?

                                        STEVEN
                        No!  No, I did not kill Franklin!  Why 
                        the hell would I do that?

                                        MARTA
                        To keep it all for yourself.  

    He just shakes his head.  The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE come on.  

                                        MARTA
                        If you did it, I ll make sure you pay.  

                                        STEVEN
                        If you took that stash, I ll make sure 
                        you pay.                                                                                    43.


    DINA steps out of the house in her robe.  Steven exits the 
    car.  She sees his bloodied clothing.  Hurries over --

                                        DINA
                        My God!  What happened?

                                        STEVEN
                        ... Someone... jumped me at the 
                        Marina.  Mugged me.  Marta found me.

    It's a lame excuse.  Marta doesn t confirm or deny.  A 
    beat... SEE Dina decide to accept it.  She turns to Marta --

                                        DINA
                        Thank God they didn t hurt you, too.

    It's genuine concern.  Marta s moved, they share a look... 
    the beginning of a rapprochement.  Then Marta drives off --

    INT. KAT & JOE S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Kat opens the door for Marta, who walks into her embrace.  
    Exhausted.  JOE and NATALIE are washing dishes.  

                                        KAT
                        I was just making up a bed for you.

                                        MARTA
                        Thank you... for everything.

    Kat nods, moves off.  Marta goes to Natalie, kisses, holds 
    her.  Natalie pulls away, doesn t want to look like a kid...

    INT. KAT AND JOE S APARTMENT - LOFT - NIGHT

    Marta ducks a low beam, FINDS Boris asleep on a futon.  
    Gabriel lies next to him, working on his computer.  Marta 
    gently kisses Boris.  Then crawls next to Gabriel.  

                                        MARTA
                        I m so sorry you have to go through 
                        all this.  

                                        GABRIEL
                        It s not your fault.  

    They lean on each other.  A beat. 

                                        MARTA
                        I thought they took all our computers.

                                        GABRIEL
                        This one was in my locker at school.  
                        My entire music library is on it.                                                                                      44.


                                        MARTA
                        Can I borrow it?

                                        GABRIEL
                        Um, you re not exactly tech savvy...

    She pulls out Franklin s keys, shows him the MEMORY STICK.

                                        MARTA
                        I need to see what s on this... It was 
                        your father s.

    A beat.  Gabriel hands her the laptop.  

    INT. KAT & JOE S APARTMENT - GUEST ALCOVE - NIGHT

    Marta sits on the bed with the laptop and tries to open the 
    memory stick, but AN ICON POPS UP:  Password protected.   

    She PUNCHES several keys, frustration building.  Finally, 
    rather than kill the computer, she sets it aside.  Then 
    curls into a ball to keep from screaming with rage...

    INT. ROSSIYA RESTAURANT - MORNING

    Marta sits with Andrei.  LUTHER sits behind them, drinking 
    espresso, listening.  Andrei POUNDS the table in frustration --

                                        ANDREI
                        There s not a goddamn thing I can do.  
                        All my money is tied up in assets.  
                        Whatever s left goes to your mother, 
                        and to Kat and her starving artist...

                                        MARTA
                        I know.

                                        ANDREI
                        But you have assets, right?  Savings 
                        accounts.  Kids  college funds.  

                                        MARTA
                        I - yes, I ll - talk to the bank.  
                        Franklin handled all our finances.  

                                        LUTHER
                        He must have hidden some cash.  

                                        MARTA
                        ... I don t know.  How can I not know?
                                (realizing)
                        I should send the kids away.  They re 
                        not safe.                                                                                    45.


                                        ANDREI
                        There is no  away.   Not for Schiller.  
                        But if you keep them here, Luther can 
                        protect them.

                                        MARTA
                        Can you at least talk to Schiller?

    Andrei and Luther share a look.  Andrei darkens, haunted.

                                        ANDREI
                        It might make things worse.  This  new 
                        Bratva,  people like Schiller.  They 
                        have no code, no country, no identity.  
                        They re everywhere, but you never see 
                        them when they come for you...

    He s distressing Marta more.  Luther intercedes.

                                        LUTHER
                        Without your father, you can claim 
                        ignorance.  

                                        ANDREI
                        Yes, a grieving widow trying to fix a 
                        husband s mistake.  Schiller might 
                        give you more latitude. 
                                (takes her hand, emotional)
                        This kills me, that I can do nothing.  

                                        MARTA
                        Loaning me Luther, that s not nothing.
                                (beat, then)
                        Do you think Schiller killed Franklin?  

                                        ANDREI
                        I don t know.  But it wouldn t even be 
                        close to the worst thing he s done.

    Off Marta, taking that in...

    EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - MILL VALLEY - DAY

    Marta climbs out of her car, walks toward the bank, but SEES 
    LEEFLANG exit the bank, head for his car.  She stops him --

                                        MARTA
                        What are you doing at my bank?

                        Hey.  You re not the victim here --  

    She s obviously hit a button.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        -- People like you, you re worse than 
                        the criminals.  You don t commit the 
                        crimes, but you condone them by doing 
                        nothing.  And when your world goes to 
                        hell, you blame everyone but yourself.

    As he walks away, Marta chokes back a sob.  He s given voice 
    to her deepest fear and shame.  And it's devastating.  

    INT. KAT & JOE S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Marta enters, defeated, but resolved with her course of 
    action, moving fast before she changes her mind.  She starts 
    toward the guest alcove - toward the memory stick - but 
    STOPS abruptly when she sees --

    NATALIE, sketching as always.  But her hair has been DYED 
    PITCH BLACK.  She looks at Marta defiantly.  Marta is about 
    to say something - but there are more pressing matters.  The 
    memory stick.  Marta simply turns, heads directly for --

    INT. GUEST ALCOVE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

    -- Marta enters, FINDS Gabriel on her bed, looking at his 
    COMPUTER.  She stops short when she sees the memory stick 
    plugged into it.  Gabriel s face is dark.  Bitter.

                                        GABRIEL
                        I got past the password protections --

                        -- That was not for your eyes!

                        I wanted to help.

    She sees the pain in his eyes.  It hurts her.  She softens.  
    He pushes the laptop to her.                                                                                     47.

                        Mom, everyone s in here.  Uncle Irwin.  
                        Steven.  Grandpa --

    Marta doesn t believe it.  He shows her, scrolling through --

                        Photographs, accounts, dates.  Was Dad 
                        gonna hand all this over?

                        he was just a pot exporter --

                        You knew?

                        Few weeks ago I dropped by the Marina 
                        at night.  Saw some stuff.  Wasn t a 
                        big deal, it just... changed things.

                                        MARTA
                        Does Natalie -- ?

                                        GABRIEL
                        No.  She thinks Dad walked on water.  
                        Turns out he was a piece of --

                                        MARTA
                        -- Hey, whatever your father did, was 
                        to protect you.  

                                        GABRIEL
                        You wouldn t have done it.  You d have 
                        found another way.

    Her hopeless expression suggests there may be no other way.  
    Gabriel sees her distress.  Kisses her cheek, starts out --

                                        GABRIEL
                        By the way, he left you a message.  

    Marta, reeling, looks at the computer monitor.  Sees 
    Franklin's FACE frozen in a video.  He looks like a 
    stranger.  She just has to push play to hear it...

    EXT. MT. TAMALPAIS - DAYBREAK

    ON FEET PEDALING - attacking the pedals like she's trying to 
    kill them.  INCLUDE MARTA, breathing hard, but unrelenting.  
    More intense than we've ever seen her.  

                                                                        CUT AWAY TO:

    INT. MARTA S ROOM - NIGHT [FLASHBACK TO LAST NIGHT]

    CLOSE ON THE LAP TOP as Marta presses  play.   A VIDEO OF 
    FRANKLIN BEGINS.  He speaks directly to camera, emotional, 
    scared.  Tears spring to Marta s eyes at the sight of him.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Hi Marta... man, I m praying you never 
                        see this,  cause if you re watching - 
                        then something went really wrong --

    EXT. MT. TAMALPAIS - DAYBREAK 

    BACK ON MARTA, biking, pushing harder and harder...

    EXT. WALRAVEN HOUSE - STREET - EVENING

    Marta exits, fully dressed, high heels.  She strides to 
    Leeflang and Trejo s SEDAN.  Hands him the MEMORY STICK --  

    EXT. MT. TAMALPAIS - DAYBREAK 

    BACK ON MARTA, fighting thirst, pain, but she keeps pushing...

                                        FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                      I just want to say I m... so sorry.  I 
                        didn t want to leave you.  To leave 
                        you with all this...

    INT. LEEFLANG'S SEDAN - EVENING 

    BACK ON LEEFLANG, laptop is on his lap.  Trejo next to him.  
    CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER - as they watch the same video --

                                        FRANKLIN 
                        I love you and the kids so much.  I... 
                        tried to keep them safe...  

    INT. MARTA S ROOM - NIGHT [FLASHBACK TO LAST NIGHT]

    ON MARTA still watching the video, sobs now choking her.  
    She s wracked with grief - and more than that - rage --                                                                                      49.

                        ... But now it s up to you...

    EXT. MT. TAMALPAIS - DAYBREAK

    Marta finally reaches the crest, FLOATS over flat land...

                                        FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                        Don't trust anyone but yourself...

    INT. LEEFLANG'S SEDAN - EVENING

    BACK ON LEEFLANG, TREJO and the VIDEO --

                        That s a Federal offense, if we can 
                        prove it --

                                        LEEFLANG
                        -- She wouldn t make it that easy.

                        James, she s a housewife.

    But Leeflang s face tells us he suspects there s a hell of a 
    lot more to Marta than that.  Off him, begrudgingly impressed --

    INT. A LONG, DARK HALLWAY - NIGHT

    START ON MARTA'S HIGH HEELS.  Walking down a corridor - 
    echoing against the slick wood flooring.  

    INCLUDE MARTA.  Moving toward us down this sleek corporate 
    hallway.  Her face is grim, clinging to courage.  She reaches 
    a door.  Takes a beat, then PUSHES IT OPEN, entering --  

    INT. SCHILLER'S OFFICE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 

    A HUGE ROOM with a spectacular view of THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  
    The d cor is stark, ultra modern, restrained elegance.  In the 
    corner is a DESK OF HIGH-TECH COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, manned by an 
    ASIAN CPA-LOOKING GUY.  

    Behind an enormous desk sits CHRISTIAN SCHILLER.  Handsome, 
      immaculate, a deadly wolf in very expensive sheep's clothing.  

    THREE WELL-DRESSED COLUMBIAN MEN sit facing him.  But Marta 
    just strides to his desk.                                                                                      50.


    He s not surprised (we SEE a SECURITY MONITOR on his desk of 
    the hallway).  She DROPS a fat POUCH in front of him.  Dirt 
    still clings to it --

                                        MARTA
                        Here.  Now, leave me alone, Mr. 
                        Schiller.  

    Leon and Wall appear next to her - but Schiller raises a 
    hand.  They back off.  Schiller turns to the Colombians.

                                        SCHILLER
                        Si me disculpan un momento, por favor.

    The Colombians rise.  They head out, eying her as they pass.  
    Their FACES are hard, intimidating.  Schiller nods to Leon, 
    Wall and the CPA-looking guy.  They all leave.

    Marta s alone with Schiller now.  He rises.  She sees the 
    power in his build, the confidence with which he carries 
    himself as he rounds the desk toward her.  

                                        SCHILLER
                        Mrs. Walraven.  I m assuming you 
                        haven t been searched.  May I?

    She doesn t say yes or no, but allows Schiller to remove her 
    jacket, which he does slowly.  He frisks her.  Not invasive, 
    but thorough.  Almost sensual.  She is stoic.  As he 
    finishes, she faces him, strong, insistent -- 

                                        MARTA
                        There s five hundred thousand in that 
                        pouch.  It s all I have.  And it s 
                        enough.  You ve already taken my 
                        husband from me.  

    He walks in a slow circle around her.  His eyes taking in 
    every detail.  Gauging every reaction.  Every breath.  

                                        SCHILLER
                        Why would I kill your husband?

                                        MARTA
                        He... stole from you.  

                                        SCHILLER
                        Yes.  And I want my property back. 

                                        MARTA
                        I don t know where it is.                                                                                    51.


                                        SCHILLER
                        But your husband knew.  So ask 
                        yourself, would killing him get me 
                        what I want?

    She doesn t know the answer to that.  Is Schiller messing 
    with her?  He sits on the edge of his desk in front of her.  

                                        SCHILLER
                        There are two things that matter in 
                        the world of business: money and 
                        trust.  Money usually isn t the 
                        problem.  One can always get money 
                        back.  But trust - once you ve lost 
                        it, you have nothing.  
                                (then)
                        Do you understand?  Your husband cost 
                        me the trust of... some associates.  

                                        MARTA
                        There s nothing I can do about that.

                                        SCHILLER
                        Actually, we can help each other.

                                        MARTA
                        I don t want your help.

                                        SCHILLER
                        Are you close to your brother?  Prison 
                        is a dangerous place --

                                        MARTA
                        -- What do you want from me?

                                        SCHILLER
                        I need to replace what was taken.  
                        There s a new consignment coming in.  
                        You have a trade route, port contacts, 
                        customs officials --  

                                        MARTA
                        -- I don t.  I know nothing about it.

                                        SCHILLER
                        Steven can help you with the nuts and 
                        bolts.  But I don t want him in 
                        charge.  You seem far more... capable.

                                        MARTA
                        You want me to import --

                                        SCHILLER
                        -- One consignment.                                                                                    52.


    There s a long beat as they size each other up.  Finally...

                                        MARTA
                        Then you ll leave us alone?

    He walks her to the door, pulls it open for her as --

                                        SCHILLER
                        Remember what matters, Mrs. Walraven.  
                        Money...

    -- as he offers her the POUCH of cash --

                                        SCHILLER
                        ... and trust.

    They share a look.  Guarded, charged.  She warily takes the 
    pouch from him.  He smiles.  As he closes the door --

    -- WE HOLD ON MARTA S FACE.  Trapped but, we can see, 
    determined to do whatever it takes.  Off the door SHUTTING --
