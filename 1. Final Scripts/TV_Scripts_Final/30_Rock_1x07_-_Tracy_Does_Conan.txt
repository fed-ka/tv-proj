      FADE IN:


      INT. LIZ S APARTMENT - MORNING11*

      DENNIS is eating cereal with his mouth open and reading about 
      some snowboarder on the back of the Cheerios box.  LIZ, ready *
      for work, is at the sink putting together her own breakfast.   *
      She notices something.*

                                  LIZ
                    Why is there hair everywhere?  Did *
                    you shave in the kitchen?  *

                                  DENNIS
                    The water in here is better.*

      Liz bites her tongue and sits down across from Dennis.*

                                    DENNIS*
                          (re: Cheerios box)*
                      Snowboarding is baloney!  I coulda 
                    been a snowboarder.  It's just 
                      skateboarding on snow.

                                  LIZ   
                    You can't skateboard. *

                                    DENNIS*
                    Look at this ski-jumping idiot, *
                    Bodie Miller.  What kind of fruity *
                    name is Bodie?*

                                  LIZ*
                    Are the Olympics on it?  This *
                    cereal s like eight months old.*

                                    DENNIS*
                    When me and you have kids, I m *
                    giving  em normal names, like *
                    Shannon and Rick. *

                                  LIZ*
                    What?  When we what?*

                                    DENNIS*
                    Have kids, dummy!*

      She watches him eat his cereal and mouth-breathe at the same 
      time.  CLOSE UP:  Dennis mouth-breathing.  She can't take it 
      anymore.  She pushes her food away.*  30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  1A.

                    I gotta go.  *
                          (then)*
                    Are you gonna be home tonight?  I 
                    need to talk to you about 
                      something. 

                                  DENNIS
                    Yeah.  All right.

                    I should be home early, okay?*

                                  DENNIS
                    Yeah.  Come here, sweetheart.

      Dennis grabs her.*

                                  LIZ
                    Dennis, I just did my hair --

      He musses her hair like she s a little boy.  She sighs and *
      leaves for work.*

      INT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - MEZZANINE - DAY22

      A room on the mezzanine floor is set up for a blood drive.  
      Liz is finishing up giving blood.  A RED CROSS NURSE attends 
      to her.*

                                  NURSE
                    Now make sure you drink plenty of *
                    fluids and get something to eat.  *
                    And don t do anything strenuous *
                    tonight.
                          (joking)
                    Don t hit the clubs.

                          (chuckles)
                    No, I m going straight home.  I m 
                    breaking up with my boyfriend 
                    tonight.  I can t take it anymore.  

      The nurse looks over her donor form.

                                  NURSE
                    Hmm.  Thirty-five.  Single.  No 
                    children.  Three sexual partners in 
                    the last ten years.  I don t know,

      Liz is horrified.  The nurse offers her a choice of cookie.

                                  NURSE
                    Chocolate chip or butter crunch?

      Liz takes a cookie and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. STUDIO BACKSTAGE/JENNA S DRESSING ROOM - DAY33

      Liz gets to the studio and is unwrapping her cookie when she 
      walks by Jenna s dressing room and sees JENNA crying.  PETE 
      is consoling her.  Liz rushes in.

                                  PETE
                            (sympathetically to Jenna)
                    I know.  This business is unfair.

                                  LIZ
                    What happened?

                                  PETE
                    Jenna was supposed to do the Conan 
                    show tonight but --

                                  JENNA
                          (crying)
                    I got bumped.

                                  LIZ
                    Oh, well, that stuff happens.

                                  PETE
                    Jack bumped her and put Tracy on 
                    instead.*

                                  LIZ
                    What?!  Uch, that guy does not get *
                    actors.  The other day he told Josh *
                     to stop being so unlikable. *

      Liz puts her cookie down and tries to help. 

                                  LIZ

                    I just feel like everything always 
                    gets taken away from me!

                                  LIZ
                    That's not true.  What about that 
                    movie you made last summer?  

                                  JENNA
                     The Rural Juror ? 

      Nobody can understand the title.  When said conversationally, 
      it sounds like,  The Rrrr Jrrr. 

                                  LIZ
                    Yeah, the  Rrr-- ... that one.   *

      Liz and Pete share a look,  The what? *

      EXT. RURAL JUROR SET - DAYA3A3*

      THE 2ND AC holds a clapper up to the lens.  The title  Rural *
      Juror  is prominently displayed, less prominent is the *
      director  C. Affleck. *

                                  2ND AC *
                     Rural Juror,  apple, take one. *

      He claps the sticks and starts to cross away revealing Jenna *
      in the shot.  As he crosses:*

                    Does Jack Donaghy even know that 
                    I'm in  The Rural Juror ?  I mean, 
                    maybe if he knew that I have a film 
                    career he would treat me with more 
                    respect.

                    that you are in a feature film 
                    called...  The Rrrr Jrrr.   

      Jenna exits.  Pete is baffled.

                    What the hell is her movie called?

                    I don't know.  She's been talking

                    The look s about right.

      Pete goofs around with Liz and Clariss.

                          (handsome guy voice)
                    Do you find me handsome?  Would you 
                    like to travel with me to Aspen, 
                    Colorado, in my aeroplane?

      Liz and Clariss laugh.  They turn and realize that JACK has 
      been standing in the doorway this whole time.  Pete is 
        embarrassed.

                                  JACK
                    I know you're wearing that as a 
                    joke, but it makes you look younger 
                    and more powerful.  You should 
                    consider it. 

      Pete laughs nervously.

                                  JACK
                      Seriously.  Your natural appearance

                    Yeah, I don t know, Jack.  The guy

                    out with me during the commercial

                                  JACK
                    Then let me clarify.  I wasn t 
                    joking.  Pete, did you know that *
                    men with full heads of hair earn on *
                    average seventeen percent more than *
                    their bald counterparts?*

                                  PETE
                    I did not know that.*

                                  JACK
                    Perhaps that s because bald men are *
                    generally less informed than those *
                    of us with hair.  Here s what I *
                    want you to do; try the wig for a *
                    week.  Experience your full 
                      potential.

                                  PETE
                    Oh... kay.

                                  JACK*
                    I know you re skeptical, Pete.  But *
                    I want to show you something.*

      Jack starts to reach for his hair as if he s going to pull *
      off a wig, then:*

                                  JACK*
                    I m kidding, I m not one of you *
                    people.  I mean, come on.*

                    doctor put him on a new medication, 
                    and I guess he s having some kind

      Pete peels off into hair and make-up as Liz knocks on Tracy s 
      dressing room door.

                    Tray?  Can I come in?

      There s no answer.  Concerned, Liz opens the door and looks 
      around the empty room, then looks up.  Tracy has somehow 
      wedged himself up in a corner where the walls meet the 
      ceiling.

      BACKSTAGE - AFTERNOON

      Liz frantically tries to handle the situation.  Dotcom looks *
      on worried as Tracy, on his hands and knees, uses a straw to *
      hungrily suck the electricity out of a wall socket.*

                                  LIZ
                    Tracy, who is your doctor?

                    Dr. Spaceman!  Dr. Spaceman!

                    Oh brother.  Look through his *
                    stuff.  Find his medication.

      Liz finds an empty pill bottle.  CLOSE UP: The label reads, 
      "Dr. L. Spaceman.  24 E. 71st St."  

                                  LIZ
                    I owe you an apology, T.

      She dials the number.  We intercut with Dr. Spaceman s 
      office.  THE DOCTOR answers the phone.  

                                  DR. SPACEMAN
                    This is Dr. Leo Spa-chem-en.  

      Liz absorbs this, then:

                                  LIZ
                    Hi.  I work with Tracy Jordan and I 
                    think he s having a reaction to 
                    some new medication you put him on?

                                  DR. SPACEMAN
                    Ah, I was afraid this might happen.  
                    He s on so many different 
                      neuroleptics and tricyclics there s 
                    no telling how they ll mix.  But

                    What exactly are you treating him 
                    for?

                                  DR. SPACEMAN
                    There's not really a name for what 
                    Tracy has.  I've been trying to get 
                    it recognized by the Diagnostic and 
                      Statistical Manual of psychiatry as 
                       Spachemen's Disease  because that 
                    would be great for me.  Basically 
                    it s erratic tendencies and 
                    delusions brought on by excessive 
                      notoriety, and certainly not helped 
                    by my wildly experimental 
                      treatments.
                          (hearing himself)
                    Boy, I m being awfully open with 
                    you, miss.  I should not have taken 
                    those blue things.

                                  LIZ
                    So is Tracy dangerous?  

                                  DR. SPACEMAN
                    No, he should be fine so long as 
                    you keep him away from bright 
                    lights, loud music and crowds.

      Liz realizes this is not good.

                                  DR. SPACEMAN (CONT D)
                    I'll call in a prescription for 
                    something to settle him down as 
                    soon as possible.  Do you need 
                    anything for yourself?

                                  LIZ
                    No.  Thank you.  Just where do I 
                    pick up Tracy s prescription?

      KENNETH enters as Liz writes something down on a pad of 
      paper.

                                    KENNETH

      involves a series of hallways and elevators.  It s a hike.

                     When I first met Jack Welch, I 
                    thought this guy is such a good 
                    golfer he makes Bob Darnell look

                                  LIZ
                    I have a bigger problem, Jack.  I

                    Maybe you should just let Jenna do 
                    it and put Tracy on in a few weeks.

                                  JACK
                    Jenna's not a star, Liz.  She's 
                    very capable, but she's not a star.  

                                  LIZ
                    She's got a movie coming out next

      Liz struggles with the title.

      Liz changes her tactic.  

                                  LIZ
                    Tracy's acting nuts.  He s having 
                    some problem with his medication.

                                  JACK
                    Did you call Dr. Spachemen?

      Liz is surprised that Jack knows Tracy's doctor.  

                                  LIZ
                    Yes, I did. 

                                  JACK

                    excellent physician.  And a pretty *
                    good dentist. *

      Liz notices Tracy run through frame on the monitor behind Jack.

                                                                ON THE MONITOR:

      Tracy runs onto the set, interrupting rehearsal.  He grabs a *

                    Good.

      Jack puts his glasses back on and goes back to his speech.  
      Liz exits to find Tracy.  On her way out, she passes Pete, 
      now wearing the wig.  She doesn't have time for anything more

      sees nothing.  He is worried.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. 46TH AND 8TH - LATE AFTERNOON3131

      Kenneth hurries back to Rock Center with the medicine.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. CONAN HALLWAY/CONAN DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER3232*

      Liz runs down the hallway exhausted.  She goes into the *
      dressing room.  *

                                                                            CUT TO:*


      INT. CONAN ELEVATOR BANK/CONAN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATERA32A32*

      At the end of the hall, Kenneth gets off the elevator holding 
      a little drug store bag, running Broadcast News-style.  He 
      rounds a corner and runs into a TOUR GROUP that is blocking 
      the hall.  Kenneth is too polite to force his way through.  30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  29.

                                    KENNETH
                    Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Page coming 
                      through...

      The group ignores him.  Suddenly a booming voice is heard at 
      the other end of the hallway.  

                                  PETE (O.S.)
                            (authoritative)
                    Let him through!

      The crowd parts immediately.  Kenneth sees Pete standing at 
      the end of the hallway, his wigged head glistening in the 
      light.  Kenneth gasps in awe.  Pete grabs the medicine from 
      him.  They both take off down the hallway.  As they run 
      Kenneth keeps trying to take Pete s hand.  Pete won t let 
      him.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. BACKSTAGE AT CONAN/CONAN STUDIO - CONTINUOUS3333

      Pete runs in and hands the pills to Liz.   

                                  LIZ
                    Gimme.

      Liz opens the bottles, tries to stuff pills in Tracy s mouth 
      and hold his jaw shut, like you would do to a dog.  Tracy 
      resists.  She practically has to straddle him to do this.  He 
      keeps spitting the pills out.  Once some pills are in, she 
      force feeds him some water from the prop table.  

      On the monitor, Conan introduces Tracy.  

                                  CONAN O BRIEN
                    You may know my first guest tonight 
                    from his numerous hit movies 
                    including  President Homeboy  and 
                     Honky Grandma Be Trippin .   Or 
                    you might know him from his last 
                      appearance on this show, when he 
                    tried to stab me in the face.  
                    Please welcome Tracy Jordan.

      The Max Weinberg 7 play Tracy on with the  TGS  theme.  Tracy 
      goes out.  Liz and Pete watch nervously from backstage.  
      Tracy seems great.  He smiles and dances to his play-on 
      music.   30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  30.

                                  PETE
                          (pats her on the back)
                    You really went above and beyond 
                    for that guy today.

                                  LIZ
                    I just hope we get away with it.

      They watch the monitor.  Tracy is still dancing to his play-
      on music.  He dances for about 30 full seconds.  A really 
      long time.  Conan chuckles.

                                  LIZ
                          (worried)
                    This is going on a little long.

      Beat.  More dancing.  THE CROWD is clapping along, enjoying *
      it.  Tracy has his hands on his belt buckle.  Oh no!  Is he *
      going to take his pants off?

                                  PETE
                          (to the monitor)
                    Don t do it!

                                  LIZ
                    Pants on!  Pants on!

                                  PETE
                    Go to the chair, buddy.

                                  LIZ
                    Sit down, Tracy.  Sit down.

      Tracy starts to wildly dance his way over to the chair.*

                                  PETE
                    Atta boy.

      Tracy continues to dance like a madman and finally falls into *
      the chair.  We cut to Conan's "single." *

                                  CONAN O BRIEN
                    Okay.  Well, Tracy, thanks for *
                    being here.  It s been a little *
                    while, hasn t it? *

      CUT TO:  Tracy is totally asleep.  Mouth agape.  Drooling.  
      He does not wake up.  After an awkward beat:   30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  31.

                                  CONAN O BRIEN
                    Aaaand he s asleep.  All right.  *
                    Well, at least he didn t murder me.  *
                    Tracy Jordan, everybody!  *

      The audience laughs and applauds at the craziness and they go *
      to commercial.  

      BACKSTAGE:  Liz is exhausted, but relieved.  Pete, still in *
      his wig, looks at Liz and nods with self-satisfaction.*

                                  PETE*
                          (smugly)*
                    Good work, kid.*

      He winks at Liz.*

                                  LIZ*
                    Gimme that!*

      She rips the wig off Pete s head, turns, and sees the little *
      blue man giving her the thumbs-up.  She rubs her eyes and 
      looks again.  Nothing there.

                                  LIZ
                    I really gotta eat something.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. LIZ S APARTMENT - LATER3434

      Liz gets home; Dennis is playing Xbox Live at the foot of the 
      bed.  SFX:  The sounds of Halo.  Explosions, gunfire...

                                  HALO VOICE (V.O.)
                    Lost the lead.

      Liz is so exhausted; she forgot that she was actually going 
      to fix her own life tonight.  

                                  LIZ
                    Hey.

                                  DENNIS
                    What s up?  I didn't know what you 
                    wanted so I ordered you a 
                      cheeseburger. 

      Liz could almost weep with happiness as she grabs the cold 
      hamburger, falls on her bed and unwraps it.    30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  31A.

                    Oh, Dennis, thank you, thank you, 
                    thank you.

                                  DENNIS
                    What did you want to talk to me 
                    about?  30 ROCK 106: "Tracy Does Conan"  32.
  Shooting Draft (White)9/29/06


      She doesn t have the strength to get into it.

                                  LIZ
                    Nothing.  I forget.

      She crawls under the covers with her clothes on.  

                                  LIZ
                    I just want to listen to you play 
                    Halo 'til I fall asleep. 

      He plays Halo.  SFX:  Explosion.  *

                                  DENNIS
                    That s baloney!  How did that *
                    grenade not kill him?  He was right *
                    next to it --  Oh, now I m dead?!  *
                    Liz, this controller is defective!*

                                  LIZ
                    Mmm-hmmm.

      Liz falls asleep on her hamburger, momentarily content.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
