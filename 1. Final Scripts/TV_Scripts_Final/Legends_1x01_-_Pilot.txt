Martin sees himself in the large convex rearview mirror -- 
his reflection MORPHING with every throb of pain, from Martin 
Odum... to Lincoln Ditmann... to Martin as three other deep

Like a fever dream -- the sounds of his own voice in 
different guises (Lincoln et al) overlap into a garbled mess.  
Martin clamps his hands over his ears and jams his eyes 
closed to make it stop.

They stop.  Eleven bucks and change on the meter.  Martin, in  
a muck sweat, digs into his pocket, fishes out a twenty.

Martin takes a deep breath...
