                So you just watch and see how it s 
                done. Don t worry if she s fat or 
                weird, this s just practice. And don t 
                mention divorce, it s a downer--

                maybe it s for the best, I don t know 
                if I m quite ready for this, I look 
                like a professional gambler and I do 
                have lots of work--

                                DAN
