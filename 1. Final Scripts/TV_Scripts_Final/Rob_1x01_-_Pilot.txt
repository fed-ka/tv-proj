Pretty crazy.  We really did it.  We 

just married each other.

ROB

No.  I mean, when we decided to get

the time we got to Vegas, I was 

completely sober, and I actually had a 

really bad hangover, and it still 

seemed like a great idea.

MAGGIE

Me too.

THEY KISS, AS IF ROB HAD SAID SOMETHING REALLY ROMANTIC.

MAGGIE (CONT D)

I knew we were going to get married 

six weeks ago.

ROB

The day we met?3.

to this boring architect, and then he

gremlin on the wing, and we were

FERNANDO

I am a self-made man, Rob.  I play by 

the rules.  Why should others be 

allowed to break them?

in life end up cleaning leaves out of 

 driveways.other people s

ROB

years of grad school.

FERNANDO

I am a great American patriot, Rob.  

Baseball and apple pie.  Although I do 

not like baseball or apple pie.  They 

are a bland Anglo sport and a bland 

Anglo food.  But the principles behind 

them, I honor.  Do you?

ROB

FERNANDO

We shall see.

PEPE, A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WALKS BY, SULLENLY LISTENING TO

through to him where I cannot.  With 

your blue-collar lifestyle and radical 

politics.

ROB

Maybe.

FERNANDO

If you could take an interest in him, 

I would be grateful.

ROB

Sure, yeah.  Take him under my wing, 

teach him to fly?  Can do.  I will get 

that done.  

ROB GOES OVER AND SITS NEXT TO PEPE ON THE COUCH.  HE REALLY 
HAS NO DESIRE OR IDEA HOW TO TALK TO A 12-YEAR-OLD.25.


ROB (CONT D)

So, uh, Pepe.  What are you interested 

in?

PEPE

 your problem?What?  What s

ROB

Don t worry, I don t want to talk to 

you either.  I m just trying to get 

through the day.  

PEPE

Are you trying to be my Big Brother or 

something?

MEANWHILE, BIG MAGGIE WALKS UP BEHIND THEM, TOTALLY PLEASED 
THAT ROB IS TAKING AN INTEREST IN PEPE.

ROB

No interest in them.  And even if I 

 at like the did like kids, you re

 not worst possible age.  Well, that s

fair.  You ve got acne coming.  But 

still.

BIG MAGGIE IS HORRIFIED AND BETRAYED.  SHE HEADS OVER TO 
FERNANDO ACROSS THE ROOM.26.


PEPE

Is this some kind of bullcrap where 

you turn around and say you understand 

my feelings and you want to be my 

mentor?

ROB

God, no.  You can go ahead and put 

 give your headphones back on, I don t

a crap.

PEPE

And your mom loves me.  I told you --

MAGGIE

Oh, good.  My parents already treat me 

 make her like a little girl who can t

own decisions, and the last thing I 

need is for them to think I ran off 

and married some weird jerk.

FERNANDO AND BIG MAGGIE COME OVER.  THEY LOOK SERIOUS.  THEY

FERNANDO, MAGGIE, AND BIG MAGGIE EXIT UPSTAIRS.  ROB IS LEFT 
ALONE WITH THE COUSINS, AUNTS, AND UNCLES.  HE NODS HIS HEAD 
AT THEM WARILY.

ROB TAKES A BIG SCOOP OF GUACAMOLE AND ACCIDENTALLY DROPS IT 
ON THE FLOOR.  HE LOOKS AROUND TO MAKE SURE NO ONE SAW AND 
TRIES TO PUSH IT UNDER THE COUCH WITH HIS FOOT.

 COMES OVER TO ROB.HECTOR (30 S)

HECTOR

HALF THE PILLS FALL INTO A HALF-OPEN DRAWER.  

HE QUICKLY STARTS PUTTING PILLS BACK IN THE BOTTLE BEFORE 
ANYONE COMES IN.  HE DIGS THROUGH THE DRAWER TO FIND THE REST 
OF THE PILLS, AND PULLS A DRAWER OUT TOO FAR AND THE ENTIRE 
 UNDERWEAR SPILLS ON THE FLOOR.  AS ROB DRAWERFUL OF MEN S
