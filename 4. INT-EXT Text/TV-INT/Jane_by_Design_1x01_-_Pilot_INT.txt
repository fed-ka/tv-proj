                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER)
                    This night...

      A couple stare dreamily at one another across the table. The 
      guy s a catch. A blonde girl straight out of Sex In The City. 

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    This was the night that changed my 
                    life forever.  

      He produces a whopper of an engagement ring, dropping to one 
      knee.  She contains a squeal, quickly nodding  Yes!    

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    The perfect guy.  The perfect ring.  

      The celebratory POPPING of a champagne cork. 

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    Only... That s not me.  

      FREEZE FRAME: on the girls beaming, blushing face. 

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    That. Is Jane Pipsky. 

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:



                                  MAN S VOICE (O.C.)
                    Jane? 

      JANE QUIMBY (16, long brown hair, pretty but quirky) yawns 
      awake as her dad, GARRET (mid-30 s) leans in the door.  

                                  GARRET (CONT D)
                    Time for school, kiddo. 

      Garret wrestles with the tie at his neck as he exits.  

                                  GARRET (CONT D)
                    And, I could really use some help 
                    with this... thing.                                                                                       2.


                                  JANE
                    I ll be there in a sec. 

      Jane pulls herself out of bed, reviewing her reflection.  

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    This.  Is me.  Jane Quimby.

      Over-sized men s pajamas, hair loose around her shoulders.   

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    You re probably wondering,  What s 
                      a sixteen-year-old, high school 
                    nobody got to do with a twenty-
                      something, hipster career girl?  
                    Other than a first name?  The 
                      answer...?  More than anyone knows.   

      She shuffles into the closet past A GIANT COLLAGE...

      TITLE SEQUENCE OVER: A mish-mash of images: 1970 s British 
      Vogue clippings, Japanese anime cut-outs, vintage fabric 
      swatches, a Parsons School of Design brochure, and row upon 
      row of black-and-white polaroids featuring Jane and her best 
      friend, BILLY, at various ages from six years and up.  

      Jane magically reappears wearing a vintage band jacket, cargo 
      pants, pink pumps and a quickly pleated side braid.

                                  GARRET (PRE-LAP)
                    What would I do without you? 



      Jane s fingers loop her father s second-hand tie into a knot.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I don t know... date, go out?  
                    Do things guys in their 30 s do 
                    when they aren t single father s 
                    with a teenage daughter at home?  

      Her checks out the tie in the side of the toaster.  Perfect.  
      It s clear that Jane gets her good looks from Garrett.  Tall, 
      dark, handsome. He could easily pass as Jane s older brother. 

                                  GARRET
                    I don t want do that stuff. I ve 
                    already got everything I need.  
                          (off Jane s arched brow) 
                    Except a job.  Which, I m getting.  
                    Today. I m gonna turn this around 
                    for us, Janey.  You ll see.                                                                                        3.


      Kisses her forehead. 

                                  GARRET (CONT'D)
                    Wish me luck. 

      Big smile from Jane as Garret exits, a spring in his step. 

                                  JANE
                    Good luck, dad. 

      As soon as the door closes behind Garret, Jane s smile fades.  
      Her eyes dart to the stack of UNPAID BILLS on the counter. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    We need it.  



      Jane grimaces behind the wheel.  

                                  JANE
                    Can we just... 

      Stopping Billy as he reaches for the door handle. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Wait.  

                                  BILLY
                    For what? 

                                  JANE
                    I don t know?  The humiliation to 
                    fade?  Just a little?  

      Jane closes her eyes, a deep  Zen  breath. Her eyes pop open.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Okay, let s go.                                                                                       5.



      RING!  First bell sounds as...

      Jane and Billy grab books at their lockers.  Jane can t help 
      but stare as a pack of students pass.  

      At their center; NICK FOREST (17, blonde, baseball star.) 

                                  BILLY
                            (girl-voice, teasing)
                    Oh, Nick. 

                                  JANE
                    He s beautiful, okay?  You can t 
                    blame me for looking.  
                          (then)
                    Maybe I d be less invisible if I 
                    tried out for cheerleading?

      Billy gives her a look.  Seriously?   

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I m just thinking out loud here.  
                    The guy hasn t made eye contact 
                    with me since seventh grade.  

                                  BILLY
                    Yeah, well... I warned you not to 
                    let him touch your boobs. 

                                  JANE
                    It was Truth or Dare. I couldn t 
                    risk it. Besides, I barely had 
                    boobs.  And I was wearing a bra. 

                                  BILLY
                    Whatever.  Hooch. 

      Jane gives him a playful punch in the arm. 

                                  JANE
                    You wish.                                                                                          6.



      A final wave back at Billy as Jane races in to class, sliding 
      in at her desk just as the final bell RINGS! 

      She spots LULU POPE (16, mean teen queen with the Chloe bag) 
      giving her the evil eye.  Jane quickly looks away. 

                                  LULU
                    Pssst.  Plain Jane. 

      Deep breath.  Jane looks back over; ready for it. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes, Lulu? 

                                  LULU
                    Where d you get that outfit?
                          (not missing a beat)
                    Summer sale at Salvation Army? 

      Jane shoots her  the bird  just as...

      Their TEACHER walks in.  Jane quickly puts her hand down.  

                                    TEACHER
                    Jane Quimby.  I saw that.  
                          (points to the door)
                    Office.  Now. 

      Jane bites her lip, grabs her books and heads for the door as 
      Lulu watches from her desk with a satisfied smirk. 

                                  JANE (PRE-LAP)
                    She s a bitch. 



      Jane sits across the desk from her guidance counselor, RITA 
      HUGHES; still young enough not to be disillusioned, but with 
      the wardrobe of someone who clearly makes less than 25K/year.    

                                  JANE
                    Lulu Pope is a raving bitch. 

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Jane...

                                  JANE
                    I m just being honest.                                                                                       7.


                                  MISS HUGHES
                    And, I appreciate that.  But, let s 
                    take it down a notch, okay? 

                                  JANE
                    She s just so mean.  And, for no 
                    good reason. I mean, what is it 
                    about me that inspires her wrath?  
                    Is there something wrong with me?   

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    There s nothing  wrong  with you, 
                    Jane. Look... 
                          (pep talk)
                    One day, you re gonna look back on 
                    all of this, on high school, and 
                    you re gonna realize that the 
                    things kids like Lulu don t like 
                    about you... that you re smart and 
                    unique and interesting... those are 
                    the qualities that you re gonna be 
                      appreciated for as an adult. 

      The look on Jane s face says it all:  She desperately wants 
      to, but she doesn t believe a word she s hearing. 

                                  JANE
                    Feels a long way off.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    I know it does.  But, trust me... 
                    That day is gonna be here before 
                    you know it.  

      She smiles across the desk, encouraging.  

                                  MISS HUGHES (CONT D)
                    Okay, remember... I was very angry 
                    and gave you a stern talking to.  

      Jane stands, smiles. 

                                  JANE
                    Thanks, Miss Hughes. 

      She turns to go; then turns back.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Don t take this wrong way, but... 
                    that shirt?  The cut?  You should 
                    unbutton it a couple, roll up the 
                    sleeves.  It would really help.                                                                                        8.


                                  MISS HUGHES
                    My shirt s fine, Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    Right.  Sorry. 

      Jane exits, door closing.  A beat.  And then... 

      Miss Hughes unclasps two buttons, rolls her sleeves, and 
      checks her reflection. 110% better.  She smiles to herself.  



      Jane sails in, throws down her backpack and... stops in her 
      tracks as she spots her dad, Garret, at the stove.    

                                  GARRET
                    Hey, kiddo!  How was school today? 

                                  JANE
                          (face sinking)
                    Good.  

      Garret turns, wearing an apron and a big grin.  

                                  GARRET
                    I roasted a chicken.  Your 
                    favorite. 

                                  JANE
                    That s great, Dad.  

      Jane has to ask, even though she s pretty sure she knows.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    So... How was the interview?  

                                  GARRET
                    Yeah, it wasn t great.  Wasn t a 
                    good match. You know how it goes. 

      He proudly sets two loaded-up plates on the table.  

                                  GARRET (CONT D)
                    Dig in. 

      Jane stands, looking at him; her brow furrowed. 

                                  GARRET (CONT D)
                    What?  You don t want chicken?                                                                                        9.


                                  JANE
                    It s been seven months.  The job 
                    search, it s...

      A wounded look crosses his face.

                                  GARRET
                    You re a kid, Jane.  You don t know 
                    what it s like out there.  

                                  JANE
                    I know what it s like here.  The 
                    bills and the calls and...

      He cuts her off, angrily.  

                                  GARRET
                    Enough.  I m trying, Janey.  I know 
                    you don t believe it.  But, I am. 

                                  JANE
                          (softening)
                    Dad...

                                  GARRET
                    I ll figure it out, okay?   

      He stands abruptly, brushing past as he exits.  A sigh from 
      Jane, she feels bad for having pushed him about it.  



      Jane cleans up, scraping her dinner plate in the trash when, 
      suddenly, something catches her eye.  

      She reaches in to the garbage and pulls out a crumpled letter 
      from the bank.  Jane smooths it out:  FORECLOSURE NOTICE. 



      The snapping of computer keys as Jane quickly scrolls and 
      searches and Google s after school job listings. 

      She stops, brightening as she reads.  

      ON SCREEN: A listing for paid internships at Urban Outfitters 
      corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. 

       Looking for a future in the fashion industry? ...   A chance 
      to put away some money for college?  



                                  JANE (PRE-LAP)
                          (pleading)
                    But, it s perfect. 



      Miss Hughes reads over Jane s internship print-out.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Jane, you d have to sign up for the 
                    career internship program and... to 
                    do something like that... it means 
                    leaving school at 11:30 every day 
                    ... going to work. 

                                  JANE
                    So?  I know a few kids that do it.   

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    They re seniors.  You re a junior.  
                    It s a lot to take on.  Not to 
                    mention, a lot to give up.  You d 
                    be sacrificing a huge part of your 
                    high school experience. 

                                  JANE
                    I get it.  I do.  But, honestly 
                    Miss Hughes, it s not like I m at 
                    the center of the social universe 
                    around here as it is. I ve made 
                      straight-A s since freshman year. I 
                    can handle this... I need this.  

      A beat.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Jane, is this about your, dad?  Is 
                    it about money?  Because, if it is, 
                    maybe I can talk to him and...

                                  JANE
                    No.  Yes.  I mean, I could help 
                    out, which is good, but... getting 
                    in to college these days?  
                          (lays it on the line)
                    Straight A s aren t enough anymore.  
                    Not if you need a full ride.  And, 
                    I don t see my dad being able to 
                    pay for college tuition any time 
                    soon.  This would give me an edge. 
                    It could be my ticket to Parsons.                                                                                      11.


      Miss Hughes looks between the internship application and Jane 
      a few times, considering it.  



      Jane sits alone on the train.  She nervously glances down at 
      the application folder in her lap, then looks up just as...

      Downtown Philadelphia comes in to view through the window. 



      Jane enters, taking it all in:  

      A bright, airy industrial loft space with salvaged wood 
      staircases and glass catwalks across an open lobby space. 

                                  JANE
                          (at reception)
                    Hi.  I have an appointment with 
                    Human Resources.   

      The girl points her down the hall.  



      Jane pretends to leaf through her Teen Vogue as she casually 
      checks out the room full of young hipsters in waiting.  

      BIRDIE DUARTE (mid-20 s, hispanic) pops out of the back 
      office with a bulging clipboard and a big smile.    

                                  BIRDIE
                          (reading)
                    Jane Pipsky? 

      Everyone looks up.  No answer.  

                                  BIRDIE (CONT'D)
                    Jane?...  

      Our Jane s eyebrows knit together for a beat just as Birdie s 
      armful of paperwork slips to the floor, scattering.  

      WE WATCH Jane Pipsky s impressively typed resume  float to 
      the floor and... disappear beneath a waiting room couch. 

      Birdie sighs at sight of the scattered papers.  

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    Great.  

      Jane jumps up, helping her collect the stack of resumes.   

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    Thanks. 

      Birdie collects herself, back to her clip board. Where did 
      that resume  go?  She shuffles through.  Huffs.   

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    I m looking for Jane... Pipsky-
                      something?                                                                                     13.


      No answer.  A beat.  Jane looks around the room, then 
      tentatively raises her hand with an apologetic smile.  

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry, but... Do you mean 
                    Quimby?  Jane Quimby?  

      FREEZE FRAME ON: JANE S FACE

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    All it takes is one moment --

      The sound of an ALARM CLOCK JANGLING as we...

                                                                    HARD CUT TO:

      SUPER: TWO HOURS EARLIER



      Other Jane... JANE PIPSKY startles awake.  

      Jane glances between her blaring alarm clock and the giant 
      rock nestled neatly on her ring finger and... She smiles. 

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER)
                    Just one single moment, and your 
                    life can change forever. 

      Jane yanks the alarm clock cord from the wall and rolls back 
      into bed, throwing a satisfied arm over her new fiance . 

                                  JANE (VOICE-OVER) (CONT D)
                    I know mine did. 

                                                                          BACK TO:



      OUR JANE S FREEZE FRAME: As it returns to life.  

                                  JANE
                    I m Jane.  I think I m the one 
                    you re looking for.   

      Birdie looks up from her search for the missing resume .  

                                  BIRDIE
                    Right.  Of course.  
                          (eye roll)
                    Sorry about that.                                                                                    14.


      She scratches  Pipsky  off her list and pencils in  Quimby. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    My paperwork s a mess.  Follow me. 

      Jane follows Birdie out of the waiting room and up a giant 
      flight of stairs overlooking the entire warehouse office. 

      Birdie leads Jane down a row of funky, glass-walled office 
      cubicles to a private corner office.   

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    She ll be with you in a minute. 

      Jane follows Birdie s gesture inside the office...

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    Good luck.  
                          (with a wink)
                    You re gonna need it. 

      Tosses a packet on the coffee table and turns to exit. 

                                  JANE
                    Thanks?  

      The door closes behind Birdie.  Jane waits.  And waits.  

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      Jane still waiting, reading through a magazine.   

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      Jane does a few dance moves in her seat to a silent beat.  

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      Jane, head back, blows a giant, pink, sugary bubble.  

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      Jane fiddles in her seat.  She squirms nervously.  She peeks 
      at the closed door and then, quickly seizes the moment.  

      Jane jumps up, hiking her vintage dress, less-than-elegantly 
      un-bunching the bright argyle tights from her bum just as...  

      The COMPUTER on the desk suddenly SPRINGS TO LIFE.  

      GRAY CHANDLER MURRAY (40 and hating it) stares back at Jane 
      from the computer screen; Great and Powerful Oz-like.                                                                                      15.


                                  GRAY
                    Am I interrupting something? 

      Jane plays it off, quickly lowering herself into her seat. 

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  Hi.  

      A confused look between the door and the computer.  She 
      thought she was waiting for, you know, an actual person. 

                                  GRAY
                    And you are...?

      Checks her blackberry, scrolling.  

                                  JANE
                    Jane.  Jane Quimby. 

                                  GRAY
                    Right. 

      Looks up, bored.  Then, interest piqued, tilts her head. 

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Stand up.  

      Jane pauses.  Do what?  Gray snaps here fingers impatiently, 
      and Jane stands, totally confused.  

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Turn around.  

      Huh?  A slow, puzzled spin as Gray takes in Jane s outfit.  

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    You have a trained eye.  A little 
                    juvenile, but that could be useful.  
                    Use of new and old.  Belt s good.   

                                  JANE
                          (nervous ramble)
                    Thanks.  I made it.  My dad says I 
                    get it from my mom... She used to 
                    make her own clothes and stuff.

                                  GRAY
                    And now? 

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry?                                                                                     16.


                                  GRAY
                          (so annoyed)
                    What does your mother do now?  

                                  JANE
                    I... I don t know actually.  She 
                    left when I was a baby. 

                                  GRAY
                          (who cares)
                    Tragic. 

      Jane wilts under Gray s harsh, evaluating gaze. 

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Sit. 

      Jane drops. 

      A long, pained beat.  Jane smiles.  Gray does not return the 
      smile.  Gray Chandler Murray is a take-no-prisoners, blonde 
      powerhouse.  World domination actually seems do-able here.  

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    I ll get straight to it, Janet. 

                                  JANE
                    Jane. 

                                  GRAY
                          (checks her watch)
                    I don t have much time. I m in 
                    Bangkok and I have a dinner meeting 
                    in five. Thing is, Janet... 

                                  JANE
                          (softly)
                    It s... Jane. 

      But, Gray s not listening.  She s basically typing on her 
      blackberry through most of the video conference with Jane. 

                                  GRAY
                    I average an assistant or two a 
                    month. These interviews..? Their 
                    tedious and pointless and a waste 
                    of my time. I ve decided to go sink 
                    or swim this round. You last more 
                    than a week, I ll be shocked. 

      Jane grimaces... Geez.                                                                                     17.


                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Your office hours are part-time 
                    because my work keeps me on the 
                    road, but make no mistake about it.  
                          (looks up, icy)
                    I expect perfection.  And you... 
                    for as long as you can hack it... 
                    are my beck and call girl.  You 
                    will roll my calls, manage every 
                    detail of my schedule, track 
                    shipments and... you will not make 
                    mistakes. Have I made myself clear? 

                                  JANE
                    Yes. Of course. I just have a few 
                    questions about my intern--

      Cuts her off, no time to waste.  

                                  GRAY
                    Starting salary is thirty-two 
                    thousand.  

      Jane blinks. 

                                  JANE
                    Dollars? 

                                  GRAY
                          (dry)
                    No.  Cupcakes.  
                          (annoyed)
                    Yes, dollars. 

                                  JANE
                    But... 

      Jane s eyes land on the folder Birdie left behind.  It s 
      cover labeled in bright red ink:  

       Executive Assistant Applicant Packet.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Oh!  Oh, no... No... 
                          (blind panic)
                    I think I m in the wrong... I... 

                                  GRAY
                    Fine.    

      A slight smile pulls at Gray s perfectly painted red lips. 
      She thinks Jane is playing hard ball. 

      And, Gray loves hard ball.                                                                                     18.


                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                      Thirty-four thousand cupcakes a 
                    year.  And, an expense account.  

      ON: JANE, wheels turning.  

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Take it or leave it. 

      Half a beat. 

                                  JANE
                    I ll take it. 

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                            ACT TWO



      Birdie is giving Jane the tour now, hustling her through the 
      various departments...  

                                  BIRDIE
                    Gray is the Senior Accessories 
                    Buyer. She s on the road, I don t 
                    know, at least three hundred days a 
                    year.  Paris, India, Tokyo...

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                  BIRDIE
                      Purchasing.  Developing the line.   
                    You see a belt on the shelf? Gray 
                    found it on the other side of the 
                    world and sent it back for mass 
                      production. Every accessory in the 
                    line; all Gray. Michael Morris, our 
                    C.E.O; she s his favorite. Started 
                    as a sales girl in Red Bank. 

                                  JANE
                    No way. 

                                  BIRDIE
                    So the legend goes.  And that...

      Pointing at a glass cubicle as they head down the hall.  

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    Is Amy Tanaka.  Associate Buyer, 
                      Accessories. Directly beneath Gray.  

      Very pretty, black hair, legs for days.  She gives Jane and 
      Birdie a suspicious look as they pass. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                          (whispers)
                    Scary.  

      Twisting down a set of giant wooden steps now, Birdie 
      gestures around the giant, bustling warehouse as they pass:  

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                      Marketing.  Distribution.  Catalog. 
                    Graphic Design.  P.R.  And...

      At the bottom of the steps.                                                                                      20.


                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    The center of it all. 

      A gorgeous layout.  Dress forms. Giant spindles of colored 
      yarn.  Inspiration boards.  Designers hard at work. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    Creative. 

      A handsome guy with a big smile works the room, laughing with 
      some of the other designers.  He just completely pulls focus.  

      Birdie looks over, notices Jane staring at him. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    The center of the center... our new 
                    senior designer, Jeremy Jones. 

      JEREMY JONES, 24, brandishes a boyish smile and an easy 
      confidence that comes with being creative s new golden boy.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh my gosh... 
                          (brightens)
                    I ve totally heard of him.  He s, 
                    like, the next Tom Ford. Came from 
                    London.  Star of Parsons.  He s... 
                          (awestruck)
                    He s supposed to be incredible.  

                                  BIRDIE
                    That s what all the ladies around 
                    here are saying... 

                                  JANE
                    Oh, yeah?    
                          (off Birdie s  you get my 
                            drift  look)
                    Ohhh...!  Right.  

      Jane steals a quick, curious glance back at Jeremy as they 
      exit, ever-so-slightly catching his eye.   

      WE STAY WITH: JEREMY as...

      Amy Tanaka stomps up, planting herself in front of him. 

                                  JEREMY
                          (British clip)
                    Hello, Amy.   

                                  AMY
                    Did you tell Michael to kill the 
                    fabric pendants for spring?                                                                                    21.


                                  JEREMY
                    Yes, I did.  

      Chasing after him as he goes about his work. 

                                  AMY
                    Why would you do that? 

                                  JEREMY
                    They were ruining my jacket. Was 
                      completely wrong. Had to be done.  

                                  AMY
                    Without talking to me first? 

      Jeremy shrugs, apologetic.   

                                  JEREMY
                    I m sorry.  Really, I am.  But, the 
                    jacket was better without it. 

      He smiles.  A big, winning smile. 

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    Forgive me?  

      Amy s face flushes, angry... 

                                  AMY
                    No.  I don t. I don t forgive you.  
                    You can t just show up, flashing 
                    your smile and playing all nicey-
                    nice and then kill my line.  Next 
                    time you have a problem, you talk 
                    to me first. Don t go over my head.   

      ... and off she stomps in her heels.  Clomp, clomp, clomp.   

                                  JEREMY
                          (calling after Amy)
                    I really am sorry. 

                                  AMY
                          (shouts back)
                    You suck! 

      Jeremy shrugs at a co-worker.  The guy shrugs back.  

                                  CO-WORKER GUY
                    I think you re nice. 

                                  JEREMY
                          (pat on the back)
                    Thanks, man.                                                                                      22.



      Birdie and Jane make their way down an expansive, organic 
      lunch line.  Sort of a Whole Foods salad bar arrangement. 

                                  JANE
                    So, Gray s been through a few 
                      assistants, huh? 

      Birdie laughs. 

                                  BIRDIE
                    You could say that.    

      Birdie smiles at Jane, softening.  

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    I hope it works out for you, Jane. 
                    I do.  You seem really nice. But, 
                    Gray?  She didn t get to the top 
                    without crushing a few souls on the 
                    way up. I spent four hours talking 
                    her last sobbing assistant out of a 
                    bathroom stall.  My advice?  Don t 
                    take it personally.   

      Pats Jane on the shoulder, snaps her salad container closed. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    See you later, okay?  I ve got to 
                    work through lunch.  Again.    

      And off she goes.  Jane stands alone for a beat.  

      Looks around the lunch room.  People talking at tables, 
      clustered in groups.  It s practically a high school 
      cafeteria in here. She looks down at her sandwich...

      And heads out alone.  



      Jane.  Alone.  On the elevator.  She takes a lonely bite of 
      her turkey sandwich wrap.  Ding! 

      The elevator doors slide open.

      Jeremy Jones steps on beside Jane.  She discreetly checks her 
      teeth.  They ride for a silent beat, then...

                                  JEREMY
                    Looks delicious.                                                                                     23.


                                  JANE
                    Oh, yeah, it s...

      She looks over. He s looking at her, not her sandwich. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Gross. 

                                  JEREMY
                          (laughs)
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Does that really work for you?  

      He grins, completely amused. 

                                  JEREMY
                    Most of the time.   

                                  JANE
                    Really?   That s -- wow.  Shocking.  

                                  JEREMY
                    It s the accent.  Pretty much say 
                    anything and get away with it. 

      She rolls her eyes, smiling.  

                                  JANE
                    Well, at least you can admit it.    

                                  JEREMY
                          (charmed)
                    Haven t seen you around before. 

                                  JANE
                    That s because it s my first day. 

      He reaches over, gives her hand a formal shake.  

                                  JEREMY
                    Jeremy Jones.  

                                  JANE
                    Jane Quimby.  

      Ding!  The elevator doors slide open. 

                                  JEREMY
                    Well.  This is me. 

      He steps off, looking back.  Gives her a playful salute.  She 
      salutes him back.  A smile between them.                                                                                     24.


      The elevator doors begin to close.  Suddenly, they pop open 
      again as Jeremy sticks his foot in the door. 

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    You should come by sometime. I m in 
                    design.  I m always around, working 
                    late. I can give you a bit of 
                    advice about being the new kid. 

      Pulls his foot free, releasing the door to slide closed.

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    Nice to meet you, Jane.   

      Alone again.  Jane breaks into a giant smile.   



      Jane slowly moves around Gray s office, checking the contents 
      of her book case:  Donald Trump: Master Apprentice,  some 
      Japanese gardening books, Employee of the Year paperweight.  

      She picks her way towards Gray s desk, slowly pulling open 
      the top drawer. A lone, Chanel lipstick rolls to the front...

      Jane twists it open.  Red.  Bright red.  

      Just as Jane begins to lift it to her lips:  BUZZZZ!  She 
      jumps, slamming the lipstick away in the drawer. BUZZZZ! 

                                  BIRDIE (OVER INTERCOM) 
                    Jane?  It s Birdie. 

                                  JANE
                    Oh. Hi.  

                                  BIRDIE (OVER INTERCOM) 
                    We need you down in H.R...  



                                  BIRDIE
                    Photo identification, home address, 
                    your bank account information... 

      Jane sits beside Birdie at her desk, going over the necessary 
      paperwork for  her  new job.  Her face is blank, stunned. 

                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    ...we do direct deposit here. 

      Birdie looks over at Jane, not responding.                                                                                      25.


                                  BIRDIE (CONT D)
                    You okay? 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. I just... I ll need to bring 
                    this stuff on Monday if it s okay? 

                                  BIRDIE
                    Sure.  But, Monday at the latest.  
                    Can t have you start working until 
                    I have it all... corporate policy.  

                                  JANE
                    Right.  Of course. 



      Jane rocks gently back and forth on the train, surrounded by 
      commuters.  

                                  COMMUTER (O.C.)
                    You mind?  

      She looks up, scooting over to make room as a put-together 
      woman wearing sensible pumps takes the seat beside her. 

                                  COMMUTER (CONT D)
                    Long day, huh?  

      Jane smiles.  

                                  JANE
                    Yeah.  Long day.  

      One that Jane is actually a bit sad to see end.  

      She turns, taking in the downtown Philly skyline out the 
      train window as it begins to sparkle in the fading light...

      Then disappears from view. 



      ON: a bowl of Cap n Crunch as it s doused with milk.  

      Jane takes a seat at the small kitchen table, digging in. She 
      picks up as the portable phone RINGS on the counter. 

                                  JANE
                          (answering)
                    Hello? -- Yeah, hold on a sec.                                                                                      26.


      Covering the mouthpiece.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Dad?... Dad?!

      She walks, still working on her cereal, through the kitchen 
      and down the hall, phone propped beneath her cheek. 

      Jane peers in her dad s room  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Dad?  

      Jane spots his  interview  suit and tie laid out neatly at 
      the end of the bed. The sound of Garret SINGING in the shower 
      warbles out from beyond the bathroom door.  She smiles. 

      She turns back, uncovering the phone with a formal... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  He s not available 
                    right now, may I take a message?   

      Jane stops in her tracks, lowering her voice. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Look.  I know he s late on the 
                    payments but...

      Quickly closes herself in her bedroom. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Can t we get a couple extra months? 

      She listens, her eyes drifting to the  Executive Assistant 
      Applicant Pack  that Birdie sent her home with.  

      A beat.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How many payments behind are we?  

      She listens again.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    That many. 

      And then Jane s face sets, determined.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Give me two weeks.  I ll take over 
                    the house payments. We ll be caught 
                    up in... 
                          (does the quick math)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Three months.  That s all I need.  
                          (a beat)
                    No, I m not his wife.  I m...    
                          (here goes nothing)
                    I m his sister. 

                                  BILLY (PRE-LAP)
                    You ll never get away with it!



                                  JANE
                    Not without you, I won t.   

      Jane paces at the foot of the bed where Billy, wearing a 
      vintage Atari shirt, sits before a couple laptop computers. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You re the only one who can help.  

                                  BILLY
                    Help you forge illegal documents?  

                                  JANE
                    Don t be so dramatic.  You made all 
                    of your brother s fake id s.  How 
                    is this any different?   

                                  BILLY
                    Because he was going to dive bars, 
                    not taking someone s job.   

                                  JANE
                      I understand the risk. But, I have 
                    to do something, Billy...

      Suddenly emotional. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    They re gonna take our house.  

                                  BILLY
                    Don t... don t cry.  You know I 
                    don t like it when the ladies cry. 

      Jane smiles.  Mission: Accomplished.   

                                  JANE
                    So, you ll help me?  

      A beat.                                                                                      28.


                                  BILLY
                    You re sure you wanna do this? 

                                  JANE
                    Well, I don t have a better idea. I 
                    mean, I keep asking myself over and 
                    over,  What would Jane do?  but... 

      Billy blinks.  

                                  BILLY
                    Jane.  

                                  JANE
                    What?

                                  BILLY
                    You are Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    I mean  Other Jane.   What would 
                    Other Jane do?  

                                  BILLY
                    I m gonna take a wild stab in the 
                    dark here and say,  Not commit 
                    fraud.   
                          (concerned)
                    You don t have to do this.  Garret 
                    wouldn t want you to do this.    

                                  JANE
                    Garret won t know.  
                          (sits beside him)
                    And, it s not just for him.  I need 
                    this, Billy.    

      Billy looks at his best friend for a painfully long beat.  

                                  BILLY
                    Fine.  I ll do it.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes!

      She leaps over, wrapping her arms around his neck.  

                                  BILLY
                    But on one condition...

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    29.


                                          ACT THREE



      Old school Tone-Loc blaring; house already a wreck.  

      Jane and Billy stand in the entryway overlooking a sunken 
      living room that s throbbing with partying teens. 

      A beat.                                                                                      30.


                                  JANE
                    Now what? 

                                  BILLY
                    I don t know...  Get a drink or 
                      something, I ll be right back. 

                                  JANE
                          (panic)
                    What?  You re leaving me? 

                                  BILLY
                    Dude, I have to go the bathroom.  
                    Relax.  I ll be back in a second.  

      As Billy disappears into the crowd.  

                                  JANE
                    Fine.  Be that way.  

      An awkward beat.  And then, Jane spots Lulu crossing the 
      room.  She quickly ducks out of view in to...



      ... where she slams directly into NICK FOREST.  Ooof!

                                  JANE
                    Oh!  Hi.  

      Gulp.  He s so cute.  

                                  NICK
                    Hey, how ve you been, Janey? 

                                  JANE
                          (nervous, chatty)
                    Good, good.  You know how it is? 
                    Same ol, same ol.

      Jane grimaces.  Did I just say that out loud?  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    What about you? 

                                  NICK
                    Good.  
                          (a beat)
                    I like your scarf.   

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  This?  It s fake.  Faux.  
                      ...Technically, it s a wrap.                                                                                       31.


      Jane whacks Nick in the cheek as she attempts to give the 
      wrap a  sexy  toss over her shoulder.  Crap.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Sorry. 

      Awkward silence.  

                                  NICK
                    Well, I should probably...

      Jerks his chin out at the party.  

                                  JANE
                    Yep.  You do that.  Mingle away.  

      He gives her a look.  O-kay? 

                                  NICK
                    Good to see you.  

                                  JANE
                    You, too.  

      He walks off with a smile back at her.  She waves.  Ugh.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (wry, to herself)
                    Well played, Jane.  

      Jane shakes her head at herself, dying inside.    



      Billy heads down a long, upstairs hallway.  Not a soul in 
      sight.  Finally, a kid appears around the corner.  

                                  BILLY
                    Bathroom? 

      The guy points the way, then disappears down the stairs.  

      Billy follows the guys gesture around the corner and abruptly 
      comes face-to-face with Lulu Pope.  Short skirt.  Tank top.  

      She blocks his path, narrowing her eyes.  

                                  LULU
                    What re you doing here? 

                                  BILLY
                    I can come to a party if I want, 
                    Lulu.  You can t stop me.                                                                                       32.


      He takes another step towards her.  

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    And, you need to stop being mean to 
                    Jane.  She s never done anything to 
                    you so just... leave her alone. 

                                  LULU
                    Or what? 

      A beat. 

      Billy leans in and kisses Lulu hard on the mouth.  She 
      roughly PULLS AWAY, glancing back down the hall.  

      She grabs Billy, pulling him through a bedroom door.  



      Lulu and Billy heatedly grope one another in the darkness of 
      empty bedroom.  Suddenly, he pulls back. 

                                  BILLY
                    Stop.  

       Lulu grabs him towards her.  But, Billy pulls away again. 

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                      Seriously... Stop.  What is this? 

                                  LULU
                    What re you talking about? 

                                  BILLY
                    This.  Us.  Sneaking around the 
                    past three months. I don t get it.  
                    You ve forbidden me from telling a 
                    soul.  We don t speak at school.   

                                  LULU
                    I like you Billy. 

                                  BILLY
                    Why? 

                                  LULU
                    I don t know.  I just... do.  Maybe 
                    because my father would hate it? 

                                  BILLY
                    That s great. 

      He heads for the door; she grabs him back.                                                                                      33.


                                  LULU
                    I m joking.  

                                  BILLY
                    I don t think you are, Lu.  All 
                    your  daddy issues  aside, this 
                    whole secret-lover thing is really 
                    starting to eat away at my soul. 

                                  LULU
                    Your what? 

                                  BILLY
                    Soul.  A persons moral and 
                    emotional sense of identity. 

                                  LULU
                    See?  That s what I love about you.  

      Lulu moves in again, pushing Billy back onto the bed.   

                                  LULU (CONT D)
                    Your brains are hot...



      The clock on the wall reads:  

      11:29. 

      Jane taps her pencil... tap, tap, tap... in time to the 
      second hand as it advances to: 

      11:30.

      Jane leaps from her seat a half-second before the BELL RINGS. 



      Jane does a quick change in the train s teeny-tiny, wretch-
      inducing dirty bathroom. She swaps out her faded, vintage 
      501 s and suspenders for a cardigan and pleated skirt.  



      Jane pounds up the stairs... down the hall... through Gray s 
      office door and...

      Slides behind Gray s desk just as the computer screen springs 
      to life.  Gray cooly stares back at a panting Jane.  

                                  GRAY
                    I trust you had a leisurely 
                      morning...  Let s get to work.  



      Jane now sits at a small desk outside Gray s office.                                                                                     36.


                                  GRAY (O.S.)
                    There s a call coming in from 
                    Mumbai in an hour.  You re gonna 
                    have to transfer it to my cell.  

      Jane tries to transfer the call.  Dial tone.  Grimaces. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Jane squints at a German-American translation book. 

                                  GRAY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I also need you to confirm the 
                    shipments coming in from Frankfurt. 

                                  JANE
                    Nein... 
                            (struggling, on phone)
                    Ein Versand nach Philadelphia. 

                                  GRAY (O.S.)
                    But, most important of all... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Jane leans  casually  against her desk watching...

                                  GRAY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I want your eyes on my no good, 
                    ingrate of a underling, Amy Tanaka.  

      Amy is going over an accessories layout in her glass-walled 
      office.  She spots Jane staring.  Jane looks away.  



                                  GRAY (O.S.)
                    I want to know her every move.  
                    When she eats.  What she eats. 

      Jane takes notes from her table: 1:12PM.  Steamed veggies. 

                                  GRAY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And who she eats it with.   

      Amy Tanaka takes a seat at a table with a group from the 
      design floor, Jeremy Jones among them. 



      It s late.  Most of the office gone for the day.  Jane, face 
      down in her high school history book, startles awake.                                                                                      37.


                                  GRAY (O.S.)
                    If she s at work... You re at work.  

      She glances, anxiously, across the catwalk.  A relieved sigh 
      at the sight of a light still burning in Amy Tanaka s office.  

                                  GRAY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    That weasel is after my job.  And, 
                    I m not going down without a fight. 



                                  GRAY (O.S.)
                    This.  Is war.  

      A giant conference room table, everyone waiting quietly.  
      Jane discreetly eyeballs Amy, seated across the table.  

                                  GRAY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And you, Jane, are my front line.   

      Suddenly, everyone perks, greeting Urban s C.E.O, MICHAEL 
      MORRIS (60 s, yuppie/crunchy) as he bursts in to the room.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Old and new.  Past and future.  
                    That s what our design is about. 

      Jane is on the edge of seat, riveted.   

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    We are the envy of the retail 
                    world. Our sales have grown from 
                    548 million to nearly 1.5 billion 
                    in less than five years. In a 
                    climate where other s are cutting 
                    back, we re growing.  Why? 

      No answer. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Anyone? 

      He spots Jane. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    You. 

      She blanches, her mouth opens, then closes.  No words. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Because of you.                                                                                    38.


      Jane points at herself.  Me? 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Yes.  You. 

      Jane exchanges a look with Jeremy; he smiles, encouraging. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Young people are our customers. We 
                    want them to like what we re 
                    selling so we hire people like...

      Looks back at Jane. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    What s your name? 

                                  JANE
                    Jane.  Jane Quimby. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Like young Miss Quimby.  We hire 
                    young, creative, out of the box 
                      thinkers... and then we give them 
                    the freedom to use that creativity.  

      Amy Tanaka leans over and quietly says something to Michael.  
      His eyebrow shoots up, amused.  He laughs. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Or... we give them the freedom to 
                    answer Gray s phone.  

      Laughter around the table, all eyes on an embarrassed Jane.  



      Jane, phone to her ear, watches Amy share a laugh with 
      Michael Morris outside of her office, hand on his arm.    

                                  JANE
                    I don t know...

      BILLY AT HOME on the other end of the line:  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It sorta feels like I ve gone from 
                    calculus to corporate espionage. 

                                  BILLY
                    So quit.                                                                                     39.


                                  JANE
                    Cut it out, Billy.   

                                  BILLY
                    I m serious.  If you don t like it, 
                    just quit. 

                                  JANE
                    Don t be ridiculous.  I mean, it s 
                    not exactly what I thought it would 
                    be but it s still better than 
                    sitting in high... 

      She turns to find AMY standing directly beside her.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hiiiii.  

                                  AMY
                          (big smile)
                    Hi.  

                                  JANE
                          (in to phone)
                    I ll let her know you called. 

      Hangs up on Billy.  Smiles back up at Amy.   

                                  AMY
                    We haven t officially met.  Amy.   

      They shake hands.

                                  JANE
                    Jane.  

                                  AMY
                    Well.  I just wanted to say, you 
                    know, if you need anything or have 
                    any questions... we re on the same 
                    team.  Don t hesitate to ask. I was 
                    Gray s assistant a few years back 
                    and... I know how hard it can be.   

                                  JANE
                    Thanks. 

      Jane is a little disarmed.  The  enemy  seems nice. 

                                  AMY
                    I know first hand how isolating it 
                    can be with Gray on the road... 

      Jane s computer DINGS loudly.  She hits  Dismiss.                                                                                       40.


                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    But, I m here if you need me. 

                                  JANE
                    I really appreciate it. 

      Another loud DING.  Dismiss.   And then DING, DING, DING.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  It s just...

                                  AMY
                      Scheduling program.  It s tricky. 

      Amy leans in and with a few skilled key strokes.  

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    You ve got it on alert.  Just 
                    select monthly, and... there. 

      Up pops Gray s entire schedule. 

                                  JANE
                    Thanks. 

      Jane clocks Amy s eyes quickly scanning the schedule.  Amy 
      looks back at Jane, brightly. 

                                  AMY
                    Any time. 

      And off she goes.    

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXTREME CLOSE UP: Jane talking on her cell phone.

                                  JANE
                    Hey, Dad.  It s me. I just wanted 
                    to let you know I m gonna be home 
                    late... School stuff.  Studying.  

      PULLING BACK: to reveal...



      After work drinks with  the girls ...

      Birdie and TROY BING (30 s, gay, Public Relations guru.)  

                                  BIRDIE
                    I ve been seeing him for about a 
                    year.  Married.  Which, I know, is 
                    totally a disaster in waiting. But, 
                    there s just something about him. 
                    The man really knows how to make a 
                    girl... you know...

      Birdie arches a conspiratorial brow.

                                  TROY
                    Can t say that I do.  

                                  BIRDIE
                    You know what I mean, right Jane?  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Of course.  I do...  
                          (doesn t)
                    Know exactly what you mean. 

                                  JEREMY (O.C.)
                    May I steal you for a bit? 

      Jane looks up to find Jeremy Jones standing over her.  Troy 
      and Birdie both smile, give each other a look.

                                  JANE
                    Uh...?

                                  BIRDIE
                    Go. 

      Jane stands, an appreciative smile back at Birdie and Troy as 
      she follows Jeremy to a spot at the bar. 

      Troy and Birdie clink glasses. 

                                  TROY
                    That s what I m saying.                                                                                      42.


      AT THE BAR - LATER

      Jane and Jeremy, a few drinks in.  They re side by side on a 
      pair of bar stools, leaning in closely, laughing...

                                  JEREMY
                    It s a matter of pride. 

                                  JANE
                    It s soccer. 

                                  JEREMY
                    Football!  And, this country can t 
                    just make up its own name for it. 

                                  JANE
                    Too late.     

                                  JEREMY
                    It s a disgrace. 

                                  JANE
                    No. 
                          (teasing)
                    It s America.  

      Jeremy leans in closer, looking right at her.   

                                  JEREMY
                    You have pretty eyes.  

                                  JANE
                    Such b.s.  You totally need new 
                    material. 

      He laughs.  

                                  JEREMY
                    I m serious.  You have very pretty 
                    eyes, Jane Quimby.   

                                  JANE
                    And you, Jeremy Jones, have a very 
                    bad reputation.   

                                  JEREMY
                          (amused)
                    Me?  A reputation? 

      She gives him a look.  Really? 

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    It s completely unwarranted.                                                                                      43.


      Another look from Jane. 

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    Okay, maybe a bit warranted.  
                    But... 

      Jeremy lays a hand on Jane s arm; genuine.    

                                  JEREMY (CONT D)
                    Jane, I really do like you. 

      A beat.  Suddenly, the gravity of the situation hits Jane.  
      Unbeknownst to this very cute guy, this is all kinds of bad.   

                                  JANE
                    I should go. 

                                  JEREMY
                    Don t.  

      She quickly dismounts her bar stool.  

                                  JANE
                    I should definitely go.   

      She starts to walk away.  Turns back.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And... I like you, too.  

      A last look between them as Jane exits.  Jeremy smiles.  



                                  JANE
                    30th Street station, please. 

      A beat as the taxi pulls away.  And then...

      Jane SQUEALS.  

      Composes herself with a giggle as the taxi driver winces in 
      the rear view. 



      Jane tip-toes in to the kitchen...                                                                                     44.


                                  GARRET (O.C.)
                    Hitting the books late, huh?

      She jumps.  Turns to find Garret seated at the table, the 
      want ad s spread out in front of him, pen in hand. 

                                  JANE
                          (surprised)
                    You re still up.    

                                  GARRET
                    Yeah, well...

      He gestures at the newspaper.   

      Jane smiles.  She fishes a small box out of her handbag.  

                                  JANE
                    I got you something today.  

      She sets it on the table and kisses the top of his head. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    G night. 

      Garret pulls the small lid off of the box. Inside it... a 
      brand new tie.  He opens the card, which reads: 

       Things are going to turn around soon.  Love, Jane  

      Garret smiles, moved. 

                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    45.


                                          ACT FIVE



      Classroom silent, students all at work on a pop quiz.  

      Bzzzt, bzzzt.   Bzzzt, bzzzt.  

      Jane glances down at the blackberry buzzing angrily in her 
      lap.  An incoming call from Gray.  

      Covers it with her hand as her teacher glances about for the 
      source.  A relieved look from Jane as the blackberry settles.  

      Less than three seconds later...

      Bzzzt, bzzzt.   Bzzzt, bzzzt.  

      It s Gray again.  The teacher glares at Jane now.  Nailed.  

                                  JANE
                          (whispers)
                    Sorry. 



      Jane, phone to her ear now, rushes down the hallway. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  No, I m sorry. I was--  No 
                    I m not making excuses, I just--  

      Jane pulls a notebook from her bag, jotting down...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Did you say,  hats?   

      Suddenly, Jane spots Miss Hughes at the end of the hall. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch. 
                          (back to phone)
                    Oh!  No!  Not you.  I...

      Miss Hughes narrows her eyes as she spots Jane on the phone.  
      She makes a beeline towards Jane down the hall. 

      Think quick, think quick!                                                                                     46.


                                  JANE (CONT D)
                      I can t... Hear you... I have...
                          (fake static)
                    Bad... recep... I can t... 

      Snaps the phone shut just Miss Hughes land in front of her.   

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Jane... 

                                  JANE
                    I know. 

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    No phones on school property.    

      Jane smiles, so innocent.   

                                  JANE
                    I know.  And, it won t happen 
                    again, I promise... I m sorry. 

      Jane s phone begins to BUZZ in her hand.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I should go.  Got a train to catch.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    You sure you re okay, Jane?  

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    You re not letting this job thing 
                    affect your school work are you? 

                                  JANE
                    Nope. 

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Because if I see that happening... 
                    even slightly... I ll have to...

                                  JANE
                          (cuts her off)
                    I know.  

      Points at her watch.  11:34.   Deep sigh from Miss Hughes.  

                                  MISS HUGHES
                    Go.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    47.


      QUICK POPS: Jane s routine.   

      Magic Bus screeching into train station... Jane s train quick 
      change... Racing across parking lot... Sailing inside office. 



      Gray and Jane, mid-video conference.  

                                  GRAY
                    I need you to go to my house.  
                          (before Jane can ask)
                    Bottom right drawer. 

      Jane slides the drawer open and... sure enough: House keys. 

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    There s a shipment coming there and 
                    I need you to...

      Pauses, peering at Jane through the monitor. 

                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    Are you wearing my lipstick? 

                                  JANE
                          (yes)
                    No. 

      Gray makes a face.  Then, back to subject: 

                                  GRAY
                    I need you to go through every 
                    packing list in that delivery.  
                    Make sure it s all there. If it s 
                    not, DO NOT accept the shipment. 

                                   JANE
                    Got it.    

                                  GRAY
                    This shipment s important, Jane.   

                                  JANE
                    Do you want me to call and see if 
                    they can bring it over here...

                                  GRAY
                    No. I don t. I don t want Amy 
                    Tanaka anywhere near it. 

                                  JANE
                    Okay, but I think...                                                                                    48.


                                  GRAY
                          (pure ice)
                    Do not think. Do not ask questions.  
                    Do what I tell you to do.  Nothing 
                    more.  Nothing less.  If you can t 
                    handle that, Jane, then I can...

                                  JANE
                    I can handle it.  I can.  



      Oriental rugs.  Oil paintings.  Over-stuffed silk couches. 

      Jane slowly makes her way around the brownstone, room by 
      room... each one more perfect than the next. 

      She reaches a back library room, fitted with a fluffy window 
      seat that looks out over an impressive Japanese garden.  

                                  JANE
                    Wow. 



      CLOSET DOORS OPENING TO REVEAL: 

      The most outrageous walk-in closet of all time.  A wall of 
      high heels. Rows of accessories. Color-coordinated racks. 

      Jane is gobsmacked. 

                                  JANE
                    Gray... You... are my new hero.  

      MONTAGE: 

      Jane samples shoes.  Tries on a few gowns. Some chandelier 
      earrings held by her face. Runway walk wearing a crisp suit.  

      WE HEAR: The doorbell chime downstairs.                                                                                       51.



      Easily fifty boxes now stacked in Gray s foyer. Jane, up to 
      her ears in packing peanuts, pops up from the final one. 

                                  JANE
                    I think that s the last of it. 

      A bored DELIVERY GUY, waiting on the front stoop, his feet 
      propped, looks up from his Philly cheese steak. 

                                  DELIVERY GUY
                    So, can I go now? 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah.  Thanks for waiting. 

      A shrug as he rumbles down the stairs towards his truck. 

      INSIDE AGAIN AS:  

      Jane turns back to the boxes, peeking inside one to reveal...

      Hundreds of jewel-crusted creatures.  Bugs.  Octopus.  Ants.  
      All strange and beautiful and slightly vintage looking.   

      Jane picks up a sparkling, black octopus and fastens it on to 
      the shoulder of her bright pink blouse.   

      Smiles at her reflection.  It s gorgeous. 



      Jane pulls a lone bottle of water from the empty fridge as 
      she talks on her phone.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Yes, it s all here.  But, 
                    what s it all--?  
                          (brows knitting)
                    What meeting?  That doesn t make 
                    any sense.  You ll be on a plane. 

      Checks her watch. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I ll be there.  I m sorry.  I ll 
                    call you as soon as you land with 
                    every detail.  And, Gray, I think 
                    maybe...

      A beat. Looks at the phone.  Gray has already hung up.                                                                                     52.


                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Never mind.  

      Her phone suddenly rings.  Jane picks up. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I think maybe Amy had something to 
                    do with this.  The other day...  

      REVEAL: BILLY on the other end of the phone. 

                                  BILLY
                    What re you talking about? 

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  I thought you were Gray.

                                  BILLY
                    Where are you?

                                  JANE
                    I m at her house.  You should see 
                    it, Billy.  It s gorgeous.  

                                  BILLY
                          (rushed)
                    That s great, Jane.  Look...  We ve 
                    got a situation.   

                                  JANE
                    She has this in-sane closet...

                                  BILLY
                    Jane...

                                  JANE
                    Yes, I have officially touched a 
                    vintage Balenciaga...  

                                  BILLY
                    Jane...

                                  JANE
                    Fine.  I tried it on.  It was just 
                    so pretty and the detail was...

                                  BILLY
                    Jane!

                                  JANE
                    What? 

                                  BILLY
                    Your mid-term test.  It s today.                                                                                         53.


                                  JANE
                    No.  

                                  BILLY
                    Yes. 

                                  JANE
                    No.  It s not, it s...

      Grabs a calendar book from her handbag.  Mid-term.  2:30 P.M.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                      Ohmygoditstoday.     

                                  BILLY
                    Jane, you need to get here...  

      Jane s eyes dart between the paper and the clock: 2:05.   

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Fast.  

                                  JANE
                    But, I have to be at the office in 
                    an hour. A meeting got rescheduled 
                    and Gray can t be on conference 
                    because she ll be in the air and...
                          (stressed)
                    If I don t show up at that meeting, 
                    Gray ll hand me my ass.  

                                  BILLY
                    Then prepare for some ass-handing 
                    because, if you don t show up here 
                    ... You ll flunk.  

                                  JANE
                    And, Miss Hughes ll pull the plug.  

      Jane is torn, thinking.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I can t get to school, take a test 
                    and back to the office in time for 
                    that meeting. There s no way.  

      A beat.  Jane s eyes settle on something across the kitchen.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Unless...

      JANE S POV: A set of PORSCHE CAR KEYS on a hook by the door.

                                        END ACT FIVE                                                                                    54.


                                            ACT SIX



      ... just as Nick Forest turns his attention to the window.  
      He sees Jane leap out of the Porsche.   

                                  NICK
                    What the-- ?  

      Jane tosses Billy the keys and races inside.  

      A beat. 

      And then Jane bursts in to the classroom, breathless.  She 
      snatches up a test and slides in to the desk beside Nick. 

                                  JANE
                    Hey. 

                                  NICK
                    Hey. 

      He glances between Jane (dressed in her pink blouse, tight 
      skirt and high heels) and the Porsche outside... and smiles.  



      Billy sits behind the wheel.  Puts on his sunglasses.  

                                  BILLY
                    That s right...

      The  one hand on the wheel  move, he turns on the stereo, 
      milking it as some kids pass the parking lot.   

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Take a good look.                                                                                     55.


      Jane soars out of the school, test completed.   

                                  JANE
                    Okay, okay... move it, move it!  

      A quick switch-out with Billy, and she screeches out again. 



        Presentation in progress.  Jane slips in the back as... 

      Amy stands before a board of accessory lines for Spring.  
       Estate sale  jewelry, metallic headbands, feather earrings. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s...

      He doesn t look pleased.  

                                  JEREMY
                      Uninspired. 

                                    MICHAEL
                      Precisely.  

                                  AMY
                    I agree.  Michael, if you would 
                    give me a chance.  Gray is... 

      Gestures at the board, making her move.  

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    She s not sending back the level 
                    you re looking for anymore. It s... 
                    grown stale. This brand needs new 
                    vision. My vision. Send me out in 
                    the field and I won t let you down.  

      Michael turns this over in his head.  He s about to speak.  

                                  JANE
                    Excuse me? 

      She stands, tentatively.  Amy rolls her eyes. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yes?                                                                                     56.


                                  JANE
                    Jane Quimby.  Gray s assistant. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Young lady, I...

                                  JANE
                    I think you should see this. 

      Gestures at the jewel-crusted octopus on her shoulder. 

                                  JEREMY
                          (perks)
                    That s fantastic. 

                                  JANE
                    And, there s more where this came 
                    from.  Many, many more.  

      Jane spills her bag on to the table: Gray s jeweled creatures 
      from the shipment tumbling out.  Michael leans in, admiring. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And this is just a taste.  This...
                          (gestures at Amy s board)
                    Is not the final by any means. Gray 
                    wanted me to tell you she ll be 
                      presenting the new line next week.  

      Amy stews in her seat, eyeballing the shipment samples.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    I look forward to it. 

      Jane exchanges a look with Jeremy.  He winks.  Nice work.  



      Jane heads down the hall, post-meeting, a spring in her step.  
      Amy pops out of her office, blocking Jane s path. 

                                  AMY
                    I m on to you, little girl.  

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry? 

                                  AMY
                    I know what you re doing. 

      Here it comes.  Jane holds her breath.  She s been caught.                                                                                     57.


                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    So, you can stop sneaking around 
                    and taking screen grabs of my lunch 
                    tray.  You tell Gray... Game on. 

      Exhale from Jane.  Relieved.  And, then it hits her. 

                                  JANE
                    You weren t being nice to me.  You 
                    were just looking at her schedule.  
                    You... You set up this whole thing.  

                                  AMY
                    I don t know what you re referring 
                    to.  But, I do know that eventually 
                    you ll have to pick sides, Jane.    
                          (smiles sweetly)
                    Make sure you pick the right one.  

      Amy spins on her heel, marching back into her office.  

                                  GRAY (PRE-LAP)
                    You did WHAT? 



                                  JANE
                      I presented your idea.  Or... at 
                    least what I think was your idea. 

      Jane sits behind the monitor, talking to Gray.  She gestures 
      at the jeweled octopus pinned on her pink shirt.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It s great, right? 

                                  GRAY
                    Why would you do something like 
                    that?  Are you crazy?  

                                  JANE
                    No.  You were right. Amy was making 
                    her move. She is after your job, 
                    Gray.  And, the meeting change? It 
                    was her. Gray, your stuff, the 
                    shipment?  It s brilliant. It s... 

                                  GRAY
                    Quiet!

      Gray glares through the screen at Jane.                                                                                      58.


                                  GRAY (CONT D)
                    I m halfway around the world. How, 
                    exactly, am I going to fix this? 

                                  JANE
                    But. I think Michael liked it.

      Gray looks up, laser-focused.  

                                  GRAY
                    You think?  Or you know?  

                                  JANE
                    Well, he...

                                  GRAY
                          (furious)
                    Forget it.  

      The screen goes black.   Jane s face drops in her hands.  



      Jane heads out for the night; exhausted, spent, emotional.   

      She spots a light in the design wing.  Jeremy working late.  
      Jane perks, straightens her skirt... Why not?  

      CUE:   EATEN BY THE MONSTER OF LOVE  by the Sparks. 

      FLASHES OF: Groping hands. A hiked skirt. Lips kissing. All 
      intercut with high heels approaching, rounding the corner-- 

      REVERSE ON: Jane, smile fading.  Jeremy Jones has Amy on a 
      table, her legs around his waist.  Jane darts out unseen.
