FADE IN:


EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING- CLOSE ON SIGN


An illuminated sign flashes the time:.3:28A.M  PAN TO FRAME 

boarded-up buildings, deserted streets -- theperfect place for 

some kind of illegal transaction, which is what's happeningright 

now.  A high-priced sedan is parked next to a panel truck, and

boxes of something -- illegal substances, most likely -- are 

visible inthe truck. THUNDER RUMBLES, and flashes of heat 

lightning are seen againstdark clouds.  Autumn leaves swirl 

THROUGH SHOT.


CLOSER


DRAKKAR, a drug czar in a cashmerecoat, opens a suitcase full of 

money and shows it to THE SUPPLIER. The latter accepts it.  

Several GOONS flank both of them.


ON SUITCASE


The Supplier is about to close it whena batarang flies INTO SHOT, 

striking the suitcase and knocking it fromthe Supplier's hands 

(SFX).

Batman wades into the remaining Goonslike Godzilla leveling 

Tokyo.  A Goon leaps on his back; Batman flipshim over to SMASH 

against another Goon.

                       (cries of pain)

He smiles; then a particularly loudO.S. PUNCH causes him to glance 

back nervously at the fracas.


ON BATMAN AND GOONS


Batman grabs one of the few remainingGoons, lifts him off his 

feet, hurls him O.S.


                               GOON

                       (cry, then grunt of

                        impact)


ON BATMAN AND DRAKKAR


Batman turns, face in shadow, eyesburning, and heads toward 

Drakkar.  The latter, about to lose bladdercontrol, turns to run, 

but Batman is on him with a single leap.  Hegrabs a double handful 

of expensive cashmere, lifts Drakkar off his feet.

               disappeared.

               He sometimes goes undercover for days,

               Alfred.  You know that.


                               ALFRED (V.O.)

               Quite true, sir.  But he told me last

               night that he would be back before

               morning --

               Thank you for coming, Master Dick.  I'm

               probably foolish for worrying, but --

               What sort of case was he working on?


INT. LIBRARY


They cross to the bookcase, passinga clock which tells us it's

8:05. Alfred removes a book, triggeringthe release mechanism.  

During this:


                               ALFRED

               I'm not sure, really.  He said little

               about this one.  You know how he gets

               sometimes ...


The bookshelf opens, revealing thestairs leading down into 

darkness.


ON DICK


He looks serious; a little tight-lipped.Bruce's reticence has 

always been hard for him to deal with.


                               DICK

               Yeah.  I know.

               Something to do with the city's drug

INT. GARAGE AREA


Robin throws a leg over a Batcycle,picks up the helmet.


                               ROBIN

               I hope I'm doing the right thing.

               Don't want to mess up Bruce's case by

               poking my nose in it.


                               ALFRED

               I understand your reticence, but I have

               a bad feeling about this.  I think he

               needs your help.


CLOSE ON ROBIN


Somewhat sad.


                               ROBIN

               He doesn't need my help, Alfred.  He

               doesn't need anybody's.

Robin puts on the helmet and ROARSup the ramp.  Alfred watches him 

go, worry etching his face.

               Batman never does anything without a

                               ALFRED

               Perhaps a reference to one of your

               previous cases.

               Exactly what I was thinking.

Robin and Alfred are facing the trophyarea of the Batcave; we can 

see the giant penny, the robot dinosaur andthe Joker card

the Bat-duplicant from His Silicon Soul, the Mad Hatter'sdream 

helmet from  ToDreamNightof, the katana sword fromPerchance the

ANOTHER ANGLE


Robin sneaks down the corridor, movingfrom one pool of light to 

the  next.  We can hear the crepuscularMUTTERINGS of inmates in

ANGLE ON JOKER


The JOKER leans forward into the dimlight, his sadistic grin 

eerily half-lit.  He's wearing loose whitehospital garb and a 

heavy-duty straitjacket.  The cell is stark, monastic. The Joker 

does not seem surprised to see Robin there.


                               JOKER (CONT'D)

               It's not much, but it's the only

               view I have.


                               ROBIN

               I'm looking for Batman.


ANOTHER ANGLE - JOKER


Eyes lidded, unnervingly still.


                               JOKER

               Aren't we all.

                       (chuckles; then, mock-

                        surprise)

               Don't tell me you think I know where

               he is?  After all, I'm just a poor

               lunatic locked away in an asylum.


ON ROBIN


In no mood for this.  He leansforward angrily.


                               ROBIN

               Stow it, Joker.  Batman's missing.  He

               left this as a clue.


He holds up the vial of acid.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               Acid.  The same kind of acid you

               sometimes use in your lapel flower.

               Admit it -- you're involved in this

               somehow.


ON JOKER


He looks crushed.

               as pure as the driven snow.


ON ROBIN


His confidence in the Joker's involvementis slightly shaken.


                               ROBIN

               So you don't know where he is?


ON JOKER


He smiles a smile of pure evil.


                               JOKER

               Oh, I didn't say that .


ON ROBIN


HE POUNDS both fists against the glasswall of the Joker's cell.


                               ROBIN

               Tell me!  Or I'll --

ON JOKER


Not at all disturbed by Robin's anger.


                               JOKER

               You'll what?  Send me to Arkham?

                       (cackles)

               Oh no, no, it won't be that easy.  The

               clock's ticking, boy.  You've got less

               than three hours.

He shoots his cuff back, looks at hiswatch.  It reads .9:15

               Mountain Crest is a wash, Alfred.  All

               graveyard shift.

                       (beat)

               I'll check out Gotham Cemetery.

               Nothing at Gotham Cemetery either.

               The Joker was jiving me.  I wouldn't

               be surprised if he sicced those

               graverobbers on me.


                               ALFRED

               Do you think he was lying about the

               auction for Master Bruce's life?

               No.  That I believe.

                       (beat)

               He was right about something else, too.

               If I'm going to find Bruce, I have think

               It's -- not easy, Alfred.  I mean ...

               much as I admire Bruce, I've never

               wanted to be like him.  So grim, so

               driven ...

Robin clenches a fist in determination.


                               ROBIN

               No.  You said the case had to do with

               But what graveyard could they be

               referring to?  You've already

               investigated the two cemeteries

               within the city limits.


                               ROBIN

               "The graveyard" must refer to

               something else.

               Got an idea, Alfred.  No time to

pillars. Trash is everywhere.  A derelict huddlesin a corner 

against the cold; he looks up as Robin dashes past him anddown the 

stairs to the lower level.


INT. LOWER LEVEL


Narrow corridors veined with electricalconduits, circuit boxes, 

water pipes.  Robin runs THROUGH SHOT.


INT. CORRIDOR INTERSECTION


Dimly lit by bare hanging bulbs. Rats CHITTER and scurry about.  

Robin stops, unsure which way to go.


CLOSER ON HIM


A gun barrel suddenly EXTENDS INTOSHOT next to his head.


                               THUG (O.S.)

               Well, looky here.  Come ta see the

               show, bird boy?


WIDE ANGLE


The THUG is behind Robin, his gun cocked. Robin raises his hands 

slowly.


                               ROBIN

               So I was right.  The subway graveyard.

               The place where they keep the old

               train cars.



                                                                                                  Page 29 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

                               THUG

               Yeah, you was right.  Now you're goin'

               ta see the Dragon.  You oughtta up the

               biddin' war a coupla notches.

                       (points)

               This way.


OTHER ANGLE


Robin suddenly drops to one knee, shootingthe other foot straight 

out and up behind him, catching the Thug squarelyon the chin.  

SFX: WHACK!


                               THUG

                       (cry of pain)


The Thug drops like a poleaxed steer.  Robin dashes O.S.


INT. SERVICE CONDUIT


Robin crawls through it on his handsand knees.  There's light up 

ahead; he crawls toward it.


ON GRATING


A small grid in the wall where thecorridor makes a 90  turn.  

Robin worms his way up to it, peersthrough it.


REVERSE ANGLE


Robin's face looking through the barsof the grid.  He reacts in 

shock to what he sees O.S.


                               ROBIN

                       (sotto)

               Oh, my god ...


WIDE ANGLE - SUBWAY GRAVEYARD - ESTABLISHING


A huge, dimly-lit area of Gothic archesand cobwebbed vaults.  

Several subway cars, decrepit, their windowsbroken, sit on 

intersecting tracks.  In an open area are several longtables, 

draped with tablecloths, and decorated incongruously with expensive

dishes and candlabra.  Seated at them are the cream of Gotham 

City'sunderworld.


                                                                                                  Page 30 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

PAN THE TABLES


We recognize ARNOLD STROMWELL, RUPERTTHORNE, TWO-FACE and others.  

They look up as they hear:


                               DRAKKAR (O.S.)

               The bidding will now begin, gentlemen.


ANGLE INCLUDES DRAKKAR AND BATMAN


Drakkar stands atop one of the subwaycars.  A scaffolding of 

stairs provides access from the ground. Batman is beside him, 

crucified by chains to an X-shaped cross.  Besidehim is a 

grandfather clock, the hands of which read .11:58


                               DRAKKAR (CONT'D)

               I am offering an unparalleled opportunity

               -- the chance to unmask  Batman and put a

               bullet through his head.  How much am I

               bid, gentlemen?


ON MOB LEADERS


This is their idea of entertainment.


                               THORNE

               Ten thousand.

                               STROMWELL

               Fifty thousand.


INT. CONDUIT - ROBIN


Frantic.  He pushes on the grid. It buckles, but does not give.


ON DRAKKAR


Quite pleased with the way things aregoing.


                                                                                                  Page 31 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

                               DRAKKAR

               I have fifty thousand dollars.  Going

               once -- going twice ...

                               TWO-FACE

                       (quietly)

               Two hundred thousand dollars.


ON STROMWELL AND THORNE


They react.  Two-Face is playingfor keeps.


ON DRAKKAR


He points to Two-Face.


                               DRAKKAR

               Two hundred thousand once -- twice

               -- !  Two-Face has bought thesold

               right to unmask and execute Batman

               at the stroke of midnight!


 ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK


The hands hit midnight.  The clockbegins to TOLL.  The TOLLING 

extends through the next scene.


WIDER - INCLUDE SUBWAY CAR


Two-Face climbs the steps to the car'sroof as the TOLLING 

continues.


ON GRID


It is KNOCKED O.S. as Robin kicks it. He leans out, glances O.S., 

sees something.


HIS POV - FUSEBOX


Across the open space on the far wall. PUSH IN FAST on it.



                                                                                                  Page 32 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled

ON BATMAN


Grimly awaiting his fate.  Two-FaceENTERS SHOT, pulling a gun from 

a shoulder holster.  The TOLLING continues.


CLOSER


Two-Face steps up to Batman, COCKINGthe gun as he reaches for 

Batman's mask.


                               TWO-FACE

                       (softly)

               It's payback time, Bats.


ON GRID


Robin leans out and hurls a batarangO.S. as the TOLLING continues.


ON TWO-FACE


He seizes Batman's mask and startsto pull it off, at the same time 

raising the gun.


ON FUSEBOX


And the power line coming out of thebox.  The batarang SLICES 

through the line in a SHOWER OF SPARKS. The lights go out just as 

the CLOCK TOLLS for the last time.  (NOTE:the following scenes 

should be painted for darkness.)


WIDE - THE GRAVEYARD


Everyone reacts to the darkness.


                               MOBSTERS

                       (confused walla)

               Hey, the lights are out? / What's

               the deal? / This some kinda trick?

               (Etc.)

The two criminals still reacting. (These last few shots, needless 

to say, should play very fast.) Suddenly Robin swings INTO SHOT 

and SLAMS into Drakkar and Two-Face, knockingthem from the top of 

the car.


                               DRAKKAR,  TWO-FACE

                       (surprise, pain)


ON BATMAN


Robin pours a vial of acid on the chainsthat hold one of his arms 

to the cross.  SFX: METAL SIZZLING.


                               ROBIN

               Cavalry's here, partner.


ANOTHER ANGLE


Batman pulls free.  He and Robinleap from the roof of one car to 

another.


ON MOBSTERS


Little more than silhouettes fleeingin confusion, trying to find 

the exits in the dark.


                               MOBSTERS

                       (walla)


               Batman's loose! / I'm outta here!

               (Etc.)

 

ON BATMAN AND ROBIN


Standing atop the subway car. Both hurl batarangs with lines 

attached in opposite directions.


ON DRAKKAR AND TWO-FACE


Batman's batarang whips INTO SHOT andwraps up Drakkar and Two-

Face. They fall.


                               DRAKKAR, TWO-FACE

                       (surprise, rage)

                               STROMWELL, THORNE

                       (surprise, rage)


WIDE ANGLE


Batman and Robin looking down on thecaptured criminals.


                                                           WIPE TO:


EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAWN


Batman and Robin stand on a ledge overlookingthe city.  Dawn 

begins to bleed the eastern sky.  A breeze WHIPStheir capes.


                               ROBIN

               I still can't believe I found you.


                               BATMAN

               I knew you would.

                       (beat)

               Though you did cut it a bit close ...


                               ROBIN

               So much of it was sheer luck.


                               BATMAN


               Not luck.  Skill.  I taught you well.


CLOSER ON THEM


Robin looks at Batman, taken aback.


                               ROBIN

               Is that all you can say?  Bruce -- I

               saved your life.


                               BATMAN

               That was the idea.


FAVOR ROBIN


                                                                                                  Page 35 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/Midnight.html                                                                                                3/10/03 7:25 PMUntitled


Robin raises his hands in a gestureof defeat.


                               ROBIN

               Okay.  I give up.


He turns to walk away.


                               ROBIN (CONT'D)

               Gotta get back to GSU.  Mid-term

               today.

 

FAVOR BATMAN


Watching Robin walk away.

 

                               BATMAN

               Hey, partner --


Robin turns, looks back.


CLOSER ON BATMAN


He smiles.


                               BATMAN (CONT'D)

               -- Thanks.


ON ROBIN


Surprised at first; then he grins --the grin of a son winning 

favor with a most demanding father.  Wesavor his triumph for a 

moment, and then:


                                                           FADE 

OUT.
