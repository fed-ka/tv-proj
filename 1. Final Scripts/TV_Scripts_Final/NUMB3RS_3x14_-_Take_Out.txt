  1,592... Death Squad Murders

  INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT #1, CROSTATA - EVENING11

  Swanky San Fernando Restaurant, tables filled, three deep at 
  the bar.  TWO BUSINESSMEN sit near the back, scan the room,

  ...when TWO MASKED MEN burst through the front door.  Dressed 
  in black, body armor, one with a Glock, one with an FN-P90. 

                                MASKED MAN #1
                      (light Spanish Accent)
                Wallets, purses, cell phones. 
                  Everything goes in the bag. If you 
                hold back, you get shot. 

  The second man moves through the room with a small duffle 
  bag, collecting the loot; one victim, not quick enough to 
  empty his pockets, gets pistol-whipped.

                                MASKED MAN #2
                      (heavier Spanish accent)
                Mobile. Now.

  Meanwhile one of the businessmen surreptitiously sends a text-
  message, then nods to his friend...

  ... and the two men make their move, standing and pulling 
  their own pistols on the robbers.

                              BUSINESS MAN
                LAPD.  Don t move...

  Both robbers freeze --

                              BUSINESS MAN (CONT D)
                ...drop your weapons. 

  Both men nod, bend over and place their guns on the ground, 
  drop to their knees, lace their hands behind their heads.

                              BUSINESS MAN (CONT D)
                Put your hands in the air.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    2.

    CONTINUED:11


  One cop keeps the robbers covered as his partner holsters his 
  gun, takes out handcuffs, moves in their direction --

  -- when TWO OF THE OTHER PATRONS --an Hispanic MAN AND WOMAN, 
    attractive -- pull out guns of their own and open fire. 

  The cops, caught unaware, go down in withering gunfire...

  ... and all four robbers (TEAM #1: MARIA CAMPOS, MASKED MAN 
  #1, MASKED MAN #2, HISPANIC MAN) gather their items -- the 
  two killers collecting their bullet casings, and exit.

  INT. RECEPTION HALL - EVENING22

  A black tie reception. CHARLIE, spiffily dressed in a tuxedo, 
  accompanies a stunning DR. FINCH, dressed for the red carpet.

                              CHARLIE
                This is a disaster.  And the tuxedo --

                                MILLIE
                As promised, you look like James 
                Bond.

                              CHARLIE
                        (inconsolable)
                My joke about Circle-Circle Tangents 
                went right over the Senator s head. 

                                MILLIE
                Well... External Similitude humor 
                isn t for everyone. 

                              CHARLIE
                I told you I m no fundraiser...

                                MILLIE
                More like a fund magnet. A five minute 
                  conversation with the Senator was good 
                for a quarter million dollar grant.

                              CHARLIE
                That s not too bad...

                                MILLIE
                That s five new jobs you created in 
                five minutes.  I call that a victory.
                      (beat)
                  Politicians, lobbyists... they don t 
                want to understand what they re 
                funding, they just want to be 
                  impressed.  And you re very impressive.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    3.

                      (getting flattered)
                I am?

                                MILLIE
                You re the one and only Charlie 
                Eppes.  More dazzling in person than 
                your legendary name would suggest.

                              CHARLIE
                Well, I don t know about legendary... 

                                MILLIE
                      (pouring it on)
                You just keep reeling them in and let 
                me worry about closing the deals.  In 
                  Astronomical terms, we call it 
                    syzygy(SI-zuh-jee); the planets in 
                perfect alignment... you, me, and a 
                room full of money... 

  Charlie s PHONE RINGS -- as he answers it, Millie winces --

                              CHARLIE
                Hey, Don --

  Millie looks disappointed; Charlie wavers a little --

                              CHARLIE
                Look, I m kind of in the middle of...
                      (listens)
                Okay, I ll be right there.
                      (hangs up, to Millie)
                I m sorry. This is really important.

                                MILLIE
                      (reads his seriousness)
                  I understand.

  INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT #1, CROSTATA - LATER33

  The aftermath of the robbery.  LAPD, FBI Techs work the crime 
  scene, interviewing witnesses, studying the blood spatter. 

  DON gets off his phone, joining COLBY and LAPD SERGEANT 
  POWELS.  The sergeant is visibly shaken.

                              POWELS
                We were chasing a pattern robbery. 
                Two guys in masks and body armor, in  
                and out of upscale restaurants in 
                under ten minutes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    4.

                Wallets, purses, cell phones.  No 
                jewelry, never touch the register.

                                POWELS
                They ve been hitting all over the 
                valley; no way to predict where 
                they d go next.  We had to spread 
                out; two man spotter teams in a dozen 
                  restaurants, with Rapid Deployment 
                Teams waiting for a signal.

  Don stares at the blood on the floor for a moment.

                              DON
                They couldn t call it in?

                                POWELS
                They did.  We weren t fast enough.
                      (agonized)
                  I screwed up.  Bad plan, bad intel--
                      (beat)
                I got these guys killed.  What do I 
                tell their wives?  Their kids...

  Powels trails off.  Don looks at Powels, empathizing, but 
  what is there to say.  He and Colby move off...

                              COLBY
                  Witnesses said the officers ID d 
                  themselves, disarmed the robbers... 
                then two of the customers pulled 
                  handguns, opened fire.
                      (beat)
                And they collected their bullet 
                casings before they left.

                              DON
                So, we re looking at a four man 
                crew... two come in, scope the place, 
                give the other two the go ahead.

  CHARLIE approaches, still in his tuxedo.

                              DON
                Nice rags... very --

                Yeah, I didn t think so, either.

  Charlie looks around the room.

                              CHARLIE
                Two police officers were hurt --

                              CHARLIE
                Pretty spread out... no geographic 
                pattern jumps out, but maybe with 
                more data on methods, times...

                              DON
                Remember when we were chasing those 
                bank robberies, and you predicted the 
                next hit --

                              CHARLIE
                The time you got shot?  Yeah... 
                  vaguely...

                              DON
                Charlie, these guys killed two cops -- 
                which means they ll kill anyone.  

                              COLBY
                We have to shut them down before they 
                hit again.

  Charlie nods and looks at the MAP -- 

                              CHARLIE
                        (determined)
                I ll find them for you.

                We went through the reservations -- 
                the inside couple used a fake name 
                and bogus number. 

                              DON
                No surprise there...

                              MEGAN
                So I cross checked with the other 
                  robberies; figured if an inside team 
                was part of the M.O., maybe they 
                slipped up, used the same name twice.

                              DON
                And? 

                              MEGAN
                They didn t slip up.

                How s the profile coming?

                charged for big ticket items --

                There aren t any; they re using dummy 
                internet stores, running the charges, 
                shutting the sites down a day later.

                down robbing Beverly Hills diamond

                reach out.

  Don puzzles over one of the letters, in a yellow envelope.

                              MEGAN
                You know, most criminals aren t perfect 
                at first.  Make mistakes, leave 
                evidence.  Now that we know their MO, 
                maybe we can find something new if we 
                look at the first robberies again.

  Looking at Don, distracted by the letter for a beat, then:

                              DON
                Yeah... take Colby...

  Megan looks at Don curiously, as he walks off rereading the 
  letter.

  INT. CALSCI - CHARLIE S OFFICE - MORNING55

  Charlie erasing, scribbling, erasing on his board, doesn t 
  notice when Millie enters.  She waits, not wanting to 
    interrupt.

  Charlie turns to his desk, startled to find a silent Millie 
  staring back at him. 

                                MILLIE
                Didn t mean to sneak up on you.  In 
                  Antarctica, you get used to doing 
                  everything quietly.  It s like a

                Don t be.  The school made out very 
                well. 

  Millie walks over, studies his board closer.

  Charlie thinks about it.

                There was an article, maybe a year

  Charlie takes the file.

                How did you know?

                                MILLIE

                This Threat Matrix isn t quite right 
                yet.  It s set to predict the 
                  unpredictable -- terrorist attacks -- 
                and robberies have their own unique 
                  characteristics.

                              CHARLIE
                It was Millie s suggestion.

                third world countries to cure the

                AIDS serum that costs fifty cents.

                I didn t know about this -- I ll talk

                              CHARLIE
                What s missing?  Something s missing.

                              AMITA
                Food.  Where are those delivery 
                menus?

  Charlie turns to the desk, opens the drawer and takes out a 
  stack of menus -- 

  FLASH CHARLIE VISION --

  As the menus become PLATES OF FOOD -- becoming a STOCKED 
    REFRIGERATOR --

                              CHARLIE

                              DAVID
                  I followed the phony website and the 
                credit card charges to an anonymous 
                offshore bank account in Nauru.   
                  (NAH-OO-ROO)

                              COLBY
                Nauru?

                              DAVID
                Small island in the South Pacific 
                whose economy is based on phosphate 
                exports and no-tell banking.
                      (beat)
                The bank refused to cooperate unless 
                we can prove that specific deposits 
                came from a felony.

                              COLBY
                But we can t point to specific money 
                unless they let us look at their 
                  accounts.

                              DAVID
                That particular Catch-22 has made 
                Nauru a favorite banking center for 
                all kinds of high-end lowlifes.

                              COLBY
                No luck on the ex-military angle 
                either.  Immigration couldn t narrow 
                the field much.  Nicaragua, 
                  Argentina, Guatemala... over the past 
                thirty years, we ve been a foreign 
                exchange program for every country 
                south of Texas.  Training special 
                forces, paramilitary units... and 
                when the country turns, or the army 
                stops paying --

                              DAVID
                -- there re a lot of unemployed 
                soldiers looking for work.
                      (beat)
                Maybe Charlie can narrow down the 
                field --

                time.

  INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER1010

  CHARLIE briefing Colby and David. 

  ON THE BIG SCREEN --

  a map of the San Fernando Valley with eight dark RED spots.

                              CHARLIE
                I... Amita and I, adapted Homeland 
                  Security s Threat Matrix to examine 
                the eight robberies.  Time, location, 
                target, security... 
                      (beat)
                ... and we came up with this list of 
                similar targets. 

  Charlie pushes a key and over 700 tiny dots in various shades 
  of the Homeland Security Threat Levels (green, blue, yellow, 
  orange, red) pop on the screen. 

                              CHARLIE
                Then I went further... evaluating the 
                  restaurants in terms of architecture 
                and access to fast escape routes.

  Charlie pushes a key again, leaving only 120 RED spots.

                              DAVID
                Looks pretty much like the LAPD s 
                list.

                              CHARLIE
                Which told me I was on the right 
                path.  But Set Theory wasn t working, 
                so I applied a mixture of 
                  multidimensional graph Laplacians 
                    (luh-PLAY-she-uns) and PageRank 
                  matrices.

                              COLBY
                Yeah, that s what I would ve done, 
                too.

                      (getting it)
                It s a way to investigate a group of 
                things, and identify their shared 
                  properties.  

  Colby and David exchange glances.  You get it?

                              CHARLIE
                Think about a refrigerator --

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION

  Of a KITCHEN REFRIGERATOR --PAN ACROSS steaks, apples, etc --

                              CHARLIE
                -- filled with groceries.  Steaks, 
                apples, wine, a pie. Each item is 
                unique, and you can buy them 
                  separately at any number of places...

  -- from the items, we see the corresponding stores -- a 
  butcher, a fruit stand, a liquor store, a bakery...

                              CHARLIE
                ... but, more likely, the family made 
                a single shopping trip...

  BACK TO SCENE --

                              DAVID
                -- you figured out where the robbers 
                went shopping for their targets.

  Charlie produces a RESTAURANT GUIDE.

                Simon s LA Restaurant Guide. Each of 
                the eight restaurants they attacked 
                scored 93% or higher on food quality 
                and price.  

                              DAVID
                Cost I get -- they re looking for the 
                fatter credit cards --

                High food rating means a trendier 
                  restaurant, and the fattest credit 
                cards.

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly. 
                      (pushes the key)
                We used those variables to narrow it 
                  further..

  Now there s only 15 dots on the screen, most are light pink, 
  but one is dark, BLOOD RED, almost blackish.

                              DAVID
                      (pointing to the single, 
                        blood red dot)
                You think this is their next target?

                              CHARLIE
                Since you can t cover all 15... 
                      (the map goes to a single, 
                        pulsing dot)
                ...this site has the highest 
                  probability.

  INT. BLUE CHANNEL RESTAURANT #2 - NIGHT1111

  Another upscale locale, but this time as we scan the room, we 
  see familiar faces.  Colby sits at the bar, drinking club 
  soda.  David s enjoying the company of a female FBI agent. 
  More undercover agents chatting at the front, waiting for a 
  table.

  EXT. ISTHMUS RESTAURANT #3 - CONTINUOUS1212

  A MINIVAN calmly pulls into the valet lane, directly in front 
  of the restaurant --

  -- and THREE ROBBERS (TEAM #2: HECTOR CAMPOS, DRIVER, MASKED 
  MAN #3, MASKED MAN #4) in black masks, body armor and well 
  armed, jump out. 

  The hooded DRIVER steps out and holds the Valet at gun point.

  The door opens -- all of the FBI agents tense --

  Valet lays on the ground, driver staring down at him,

  The other three team members disappear into the restaurant --

  INT. BLUE CHANNEL RESTAURANT #2 - CONTINUOUS1515

  The door pushes all the way open, Colby has his gun half way 
  out of his holster... 

  ... then puts it away as a young kid holds the door for his

  FBI agents still waiting.  David s cell phone rings,

                              DAVID
                  Sinclair...

  Colby s phone starts ringing, he exchanges a glance with 
  David, answers --

  -- as we start to hear other agents  phones going off --

  EXT. ISTHMUS RESTAURANT #3 - CONTINUOUS1818

  The robbers (TEAM #2) rush out of the restaurant and hop into 
  the car. The speaker nods at the driver as he sits shotgun...

  ... and the DRIVER calmly lowers his handgun and shoots the 
  valet twice in the back of the head. 

  Picking up his two spent shell casings and calmly getting in 
  the Minivan.  They drive off.  BURN OUT --

                Three guns through the front door.

                Maybe they re sending us a message --

                gangs and paramilitaries will kill 
                  civilians as a warning -- tells the

                who over-dose on simple, over-the- 
                counter pain killers every year.  

                              CHARLIE
                Did you know that some of these drug 
                  companies exploit third world 
                  countries, sell them overpriced or 
                expired medication --

                                MILLIE
                Yes, I did.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    23.

  Off Charlie s look,

                              MILLIE
                  Corporations aren t angels or demons. 
                They re profit-seeking concerns; some 
                better than others, some not --  

                              CHARLIE
                It seems to me that it should be as 
                  important to know where the money s 
                been as where it s going.

                                MILLIE
                I did my homework, Charlie. MacMillan 
                has had a checkered history, but 
                there s been a complete restaffing 
                over the past three years. New CEO, 
                new Board, new philosophy.
                      (beat)
                I would characterize them as a 
                  relatively responsible company now.

                              CHARLIE
                Relative to what?

                                MILLIE
                I should have known better than to 
                try and slip that word past a fellow 
                  mathematician.

  Which doesn t really answer the question.  But Millie is 
  already disappearing into a building, leaving a concerned 
  Charlie behind.

  INT. OCCUPATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST S OFFICE - DAY2222

  Don enters to meet with WILLIAM BRADFORD (older, African-
  American, physically intimidating) the FBI consultant hired 
    specifically for Trauma Recovery.

                              BRADFORD

  Don sits, then Bradford.

                              BRADFORD
                So?

  Don stands, crosses to Bradford and hands him his paperwork.

                              BRADFORD
                I have the originals.

                Then what s the problem?

  Don sits.

                              BRADFORD
                No problem.  The FBI wanted us to 
                talk.

                              DON
                About?

                              BRADFORD
                  Anything.

                              DON
                      (sighs)
                I don t hate my dad, I like women but 
                respect them as people, and pulling 
                my gun doesn t get me excited.  Okay?

                              BRADFORD
                How do you feel when you pull your 
                gun?

                              DON
                Here we go...

                              BRADFORD

                I m here because I shot Crystal 
                Hoyle.  Who was a spree murderer.  
                Who had just kidnapped one of my 
                agents. Who was driving straight at a 
                  roadblock with a car full of hand 
                  grenades.

                              BRADFORD
                There was a trained sniper on the 
                scene, an...
                      (checks paperwork)
                ... Agent Edgerton.  Why do you think 
                he didn t take the shot?

                              DON
                He probably would ve.  I shot first.

                              BRADFORD
                Because you re a better shot.

                So... I heard you and Millie had a 
                  philosophical discussion about ends 
                and means.

                You can be a very interesting topic.  
                Used to talk to Larry about you, too.

                              CHARLIE
                So, what do you think... about 
                  MacMillan?

                  Experience tempered my activism with 
                  pragmatism.  And, I d like to think,

                              CHARLIE
                And which way does this balance out?

                No idea.  My wisdom s currently being

                  wondering when my landlord s getting

  Charlie stands to help his Dad clear the last two cobwebs...

                Okay, well, my math wasn t wrong, my 
                  assumptions were -- assuming all data 
                belonged to the same set. Think of it 
                like searching for a spider or its 
                prey by studying a web...

  BEGIN AUDIENCE VISION

  A web sits pristine, dew drops shining in the morning sun.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                We can use Tension Values of the silk 
                web, vibrations, mixed with weather 
                  conditions, surrounding terrain, 
                other variables...

  Various colored dots from Green to Red fill in the web, 
  almost looking like a target with greener shades farthest 
  from the center and the darkest red shades near the center.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                ...to reliably predict both where the 
                Spider s located and where the next 
                insect will get tangled.

  All the color disappears, except for a single dark red spot. 
  On cue, a Fly trying to get to food on the other side of web 
  flies right into the spot, getting tangled. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    29.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                However, there are some species...

  The web with the perfect, target-like colors, reappears.  
  Then the colors start to mix and match, the perfect pattern 
  falls apart and dark red dots start to appear in odd 
  locations - a Jumbled Web.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                ...that build overlapping webs.

  A second web appears, covered by the perfect pattern, then 
  overlays part of the first web and we now see two patterns 
  mixed together.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Assuming only one web when dealing 
                with this species will give you false 
                answers about where it s safe to fly.

  A FLY zooms straight into the web.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              DON
                There s two spiders -- two teams.

                was responsible for all the data.  I

  EXT. THREE 1 4  RESTAURANT #4 - NIGHT2525

  As a MINIVAN pulls into the parking lot.  THREE ROBBERS (TEAM 
  #1:  HISPANIC MAN, MASKED MAN #1, MASKED MAN #2) jump out and 
  charge past the 

  VALET --

  Who is grabbed by the Hoodie-wearing driver (MARIA CAMPOS), 
  and thrown to the ground...

  The robbers disappear into the restaurant...

  ... and GUNFIRE ERUPTS from inside.  One of the robbers 
  (MASKED MAN #1) crashes backward, through the door...

  THE DRIVER --

  Startled, gun wavering from the valet s head...

  ... and we reveal that it s COLBY, who jams his gun under the 
  Driver s chin.

                              COLBY
                FBI!

  The Driver s eyes lock with Colby s --

  -- as DAVID, in full tac, bursts out the door, gun drawn, 
  followed by FBI SWAT --

  -- and the Driver relents.  Holding out her pistol, which 
  David grabs, rear cuffing the suspect...

  ... Colby ripping the hoodie off to reveal... the beautiful 
  woman (MARIA CAMPOS) from the teaser. 

  BURN OUT ON: 

  Graphic -- return to the double spiderweb -- one set of 
  strands dissolving away, leaving a single web and a spider 
  scuttling across it...

  INT. FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT2626

  David sits across from the stony, silent FEMALE ROBBER (MARIA 
  CAMPOS).  Her chair is at an odd angle as she stares down.

                              DAVID
                What s your name?

  No response, refusing even to make eye contact.

                              DAVID
                Where are you from?

  INT. FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - NIGHT2727

  Same milieu, only Don standing above a seated MALE ROBBER 
  (HISPANIC MAN).  Don continues the interrogation pattern.

                              DON
                Why are you here?

  Just like the woman, no response.

                              DON
                When did you--

  Don s interrupted by the male robber lightly tapping on the 
  table top.  Don waits until he s finished, then continues.

                              DON
                When did you enter the country?

  INT. FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT2828

  Back with David and the woman.

                              DAVID

  No response.

                              DAVID
                What s your--

  Almost the same tapping... David waits, then starts again.

                              DAVID
                What s your name?   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    32.



  INT. FBI - OBSERVATION - NIGHT2929

  David and Don continue their questioning, same four questions 
  over and over, in the background.

                              COLBY
                We should end this.

                Look at the way they re sitting; they 
                moved the chair so the light s behind 
                them.  Refusing to make eye contact--

  On the speaker, we hear tapping coming from both rooms again.

                              COLBY
                And that.  They re tapping to knock 
                the interrogators off their rhythm.   
                We re all working from the same 
                manuals.

                              AMITA
                      (abrupt)
                I was wondering if Charlie spoke with 
                you about the MacMillan Project.

                              MILLIE
                  I thought I detected your voice 
                behind Dr. Eppes  new social 
                  conscience.

                              AMITA
                Oxford University s still reeling from 
                the Vioxx debacle.  I don t want to 
                see CalSci dragged in that direction.

                              MILLIE
                So you think that my first act as 
                Division Chair would be to tear this 
                entire University apart in scandal.

                              AMITA
                Well, no... that s not what I meant--

                                MILLIE
                Then what did you mean?

  Amita takes a moment to consider her next words.

                              AMITA
                Can you really do good if you re 
                helping a company that also does bad? 

                                MILLIE
                Amita, what s the use of being morally 
                pure if you can t effect change?  A 
                large part of my job is to determine 
                where  ethics  and funding 
                  intersect... as Aristotle said,

  EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY3333

    A middle-aged man, BERNARDO INFANTE, sits at the outskirts of 
    a schoolyard, watching over young children as they play.

  Colby, David, pull up across the street in the black SUV.  
  Slamming of the car door alerts Bernardo to their presence.

  He backs up, closer to the children.

                              COLBY
                Senor Infante, please stop moving.

  He continues to back up, closer to the children.  Colby moves 
  around, trying to get between Bernardo and the kids.

                village they murdered every man, 
                woman... almost every child. 

                              MEGAN
                Does  this Colonel  know who these 
                death squad men are?

                              BERNARDO
                He knows their type.  
                      (direly)
                He trained their type.  Convincing 
                himself that his only duty was to be 
                a soldier, to follow orders. 

  He stops, composes himself.  Telling the story as if it 
  hadn t happened to him.

                              BERNARDO
                The village I mentioned... three 
                children survived.  Six young eyes 
                that saw the faces behind the masks.
                      (beat)
                And this weakling, this Colonel, had 
                  a choice; be a good soldier, turn the 
                children over to the death squads... 
                or to smuggle them to Los Angeles.

                              MEGAN
                The death squad followed you north, 
                looking for the children. 

                              BERNARDO
                They tried to wring words from a man 
                who taught silence.  Would have 
                killed me... but knew if they did, my

                Why the robberies?

                              BERNARDO
                In Mexico, they killed farmers for 
                the coins in their cushions, the gold 
                filling in their teeth.

                train them how to move the money too?

  Bernardo scribbles a list of names.

                              BERNARDO
                There are lawyers in Los Angeles...

                money to run your operations.

                Even after they gave us access to the

                Exactly.  Death Squads can t be

  Smiling, he s found his three targets, pulls the trigger in a 
  short burst... then again...

  BERNARDO INFANTE --

  Dives in front of the kids... BULLETS ripping into him --

  DON --

  Finger on the trigger, sees Colby and David have the angle on 
  Campos and... 

  COLBY, DAVID --

  Pull their triggers...

  CAMPOS --

  Flies violently backward, four bullets throwing him down to 
  the pavement, dead before his body rolls to a stop.

  DON --

  Holding his gun on the body of Hector Campos as Colby 
    approaches...

  FBI AGENTS --

  converge on the van, three men exit (TEAM #2, minus HECTOR 
  CAMPOS), hands held high in surrender.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    55.

    CONTINUED:4646


  DAVID --

  Turns his attention to the schoolyard, sees Infante s body 
  moving slightly, holsters his gun and quickly steps over...

  INFANTE --

  DEAD.  Bullet riddled body.  David falls to his knees, rolls 
  Infante over... and understands why the dead body moved...

  ... three very scared, but very much alive, children lying 
    underneath and behind the fallen Colonel. 

  ON DON --

  Surveying the scene; Colby over Campos  dead body, grimly 
    contemplating what he had to do...

  ... the dead Colonel... 

  ... David and the three children.

  Slowly, Don takes his finger from the trigger, holsters his 
  weapon.  Face etched with exhaustion, drained of spirit.

  INT. CALSCI - MILLIE S OFFICE - DAY4747

  Charlie, with trepidation, enters to find Millie already 
    entertaining a suit, MEISNER, from MacMillan Pharmaceutical.

  Meisner quickly approaches and pumps his hand,

                              MEISNER
                Professor Eppes, a true pleasure to 
                meet you.  MacMillan Pharmaceuticals 
                could not be happier to have you 
                  involved...

                              CHARLIE
                Yes, well --

                              MILLIE
                      (quickly)
                Mr. Meisner and I were finalizing the 
                funding and clinical trial schedule.

                              MEISNER
                In all honesty, Professor, I could 
                not see this project going forward 
                without you --




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    56.

    CONTINUED:4747


                                MILLIE
                -- which is why CalSci will 
                  administer all of the trials and 
                monitor the drug every step of the 
                way.

                              MEISNER
                Well, not all... MacMillan will do 
                its own in-house trials...

                              MILLIE
                No.  Everything goes through CalSci.  
                And all computational analysis will 
                be carried out by Dr. Eppes and his 
                staff.  Sorry, it s just the way we 
                do business here.

  Meisner a little surprised by that...

                              MEISNER
                I ll have to run that by my people.

                              MILLIE
                Of course... 
                      (slyly)
                While you re at it, tell them that  
                five percent of all gross profits 
                from the new drug will go to a 
                  consortium of Third World AIDS 
                programs that Professor Eppes and 
                Professor Ramanajun will be putting 
                together for you.

                              MEISNER
                Five percent?

                              MILLIE
                Gross.  Not net.

                              MEISNER
                We barely have a profit margin as it 
                is.

                              MILLIE
                  A pharmaceutical company with no 
                profit margin, Mr. Meisner?  Come on.

                              MEISNER
                I can t agree to that.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    57.

    CONTINUED:4747


                                MILLIE
                You can if you want the participation 
                of Professor Eppes.
                      (to Charlie)
                Isn t that right?

                              CHARLIE
                      (not completely sure what 
                        just happened)
                Oh... right.

  Meisner looking very unhappy --

                                MILLIE
                Relax... 95% of one of the world s 
                greatest mathematical minds is worth 
                more than 100% of nothing.

  Meisner takes one last look at Millie, knowing he s lost. 

                              MEISNER
                      (miserably)
                I ll call you.

  As Meisner exits --

                              CHARLIE
                What just happened here?

                                MILLIE
                You made my life a little more 
                  difficult and a lot more interesting.

                              CHARLIE
                I m pretty sure I can say the same 
                thing about you.

  As the two realize they ve reach a new rapprochement...

  INT. BRADFORD S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY4848

  The door slowly swings open and Don steps through.  Bradford, 
  looks up, genuine surprise on his face.

                              BRADFORD
                Agent Eppes.  

                              DON
                You have any time today?

  Bradford studies him a beat, then:




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    58.

    CONTINUED:4848


                              BRADFORD
                You want to hang around for a while, 
                I ll shake loose ten minutes to sign 
                you off.

                              DON
                I was thinking more like an hour.

  Bradford a little surprised.

                              BRADFORD
                I m pretty booked today...

                              DON
                Half an hour.  I can wait --

  Don s PAGER goes off again.  He checks it.

                              BRADFORD
                You gotta take that?

                              DON
                No.

  Don stays there this time; looks at Bradford.  The two men 
    communicating silently.

                              BRADFORD
                Okay then.

                              DON
                Okay.

  Bradford goes back to his office.  Don scans the room, looks 
  at his watch, looks at the door, then...

  Don sits down, picks up a magazine and waits.
