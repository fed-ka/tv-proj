      CHIEF AGENT SHAW, 2 MI9 AGENTS KHAN and LILL, WRAPPED UP 
      WOMAN, A RABBIT  PLAYED  BY THE RABBIT WHO  PLAYS  FLOPSY

    An apparently normal morning in  VersuvioCafe . A counter 
    and three small tables. There are a few people sitting 
      drinking tea and eating pastries. The camera starts to pick 
      oddities... The young woman (AGENT LILL) reading a book has 
    an ear piece... The man (AGENT KHAN) drinking tea is 
      watching the room using her compact mirror... A man (CHIEF 
      AGENT SHAW - late 30 s, handsome, muscled, but cold-eyed) 
    is reading a newspaper (the DAILY DESPATCH) that has a big 
      head shot picture on the front  FOREIGN PRINCE TO VISIT UK - 
    the eyes are cut out so SHAW can see through. 

      A  MAN  enters carrying a white rabbit, his face obscured 
    by his scarf and hat - he looks very much like the GRAND 
      MASTER. AGENT LILL and AGENT KHAN exchange quick looks, 
      then glance to where the newspaper is blocking their view 
    of CHIEF AGENT SHAW. The paper lowers.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Go go go!

    All three suddenly jump up and surround the MAN with the 
      rabbit, who looks confused and makes no attempt to flee. 
      AGENTS LILL and KHAN stand aside for CHIEF AGENT SHAW who 
      confronts the startled WRAPPED-UP MAN. 

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Grand Master, I arrest you in the 
                    name of MI9. Your reign of terror 
                    is over. 

    He takes the MAN S hat off revealing a large amount of long 
      brunette hair. SHAW looks confused, he now removes the 
      scarf revealing what is very obviously a young woman and 
    not The Grand Master at all. 

                                  LILL
                    I don t think it s him.

      SHAW throws LILL a look, then turns to the wrapped-up 
      woman.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    I m very sorry, I thought you 
                    were someone else.

      AGENT KHAN now draws SHAW S attention to the counter. The 
      cakes there have just been arranged in the shape of letters 
      that spell out  Nice try, stupid!  SHAW closes his eyes. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      OSCAR, (SKUL) AGENT DIXON-HALLIDAY disguised as a TRAMP, 
      GRAND MASTER (V.O)

      A small traditional park. A Sign reads:  DEIGHTON PARK. No 
      playing. No laughing. No Fun.  OSCAR is sitting on a park 
      bench near a band stand - old school spy style. He looks 
      around but there is no sign of his mum. Suddenly he hears 
      something. A small electrical engine. A small remote control 
    car approaches him. It has a flag with  OSCAR  written on it. 
      OSCAR scans the park but there s no-one else in sight. He 
      bends nearer the car. On the car there s a Dictaphone. He 
      presses play and listens to the message. 

                                  THE GRAND MASTER (O.S.)
                    Listen carefully. This is a 
                    message from SKUL. We still have 
                    your mother. But she is ill. An 
                    old biological war wound from her 
                    time in East Zanzibar. 

      Again OSCAR looks around. There s no-one in view. 

                                  THE GRAND MASTER (O.S.)
                    She needs vital medication. You 
                    will find it in MI9 HQ. Once you 
                    have the medication, a drop-off 
                    point will be arranged. Tell no-
                    one about this. 

      Smoke starts coming from the dictophone.OSCAR quickly puts 
    it back on the car. The car drives off a short way then 
      explodes. OSCAR looks up and sees a TRAMP (OSCAR S MUM in 
      disguise). The TRAMP walks with a pronounced limp.  

                                  OSCAR
                    Hey!

      When he looks again the TRAMP has vanished.

                                                                          CUT TO:    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 15.


      OSCAR, OLD WOMAN, TAICHI MAN, YOUNG COUPLE

      OSCAR appears, carrying a small package and talking into 
    his communicator.

                                  OSCAR
                    Frank... I m at the drop location 
                    SKUL gave me.

    He puts the package into a large round bin then looks round 
    to see if there s anything suspicious. As he does he absent-
      mindedlytakes the locket out of his pocket and fingers it.

                                  OSCAR
                    I ll call you once I ve checked 
                    it out.

    We see OSCAR S POV: An OLD WOMAN feeding the birds, a YOUNG 
      COUPLE chatting and an OLD MAN doing TaiChi. OSCAR walks 
      away. At a safe distance he ducks into the bushes and 
      prepares to stakeout the package. One by one he watches... 
    the OLD WOMAN... the YOUNG COUPLE and the TaiChi MAN.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, OLD MAN, YOUNG COUPLE, TAICHI MAN, (SKUL) AGENT 
      DIXON-HALLIDAY disguised as an OLD LADY

      OSCAR peers out from behind the bushes. He whispers into his 
      communicator. The chain/locket is wrapped around his hand.

                                  OSCAR
                    Frank I have eyeball on a number 
                    of suspects... out.

      Quick ZIP ZOOM on - OLD WOMAN feeding the birds, a YOUNG 
      COUPLE chatting and an OLD MAN doing taichi. We then see 
    his POVthe OLD WOMAN feeding the birds. 

                                  OSCAR
                          (to himself)
                    Feeding birds, old lady? I don t 
                    think so.

    She takes some seeds from a brown bag and scatters them. 
      OSCAR notices something out of the corner of his eye. 

                                  OSCAR
                    Oh no!
                          (into his communicator)
                    Frank, we have a problem! The 
                    bin s disappeared!

                                  FRANK (O.S.)
                    Bin? What bin?

                                  OSCAR
                    There was a bin and now it s...

      OSCAR spots the bin in the distance, trundling rapidly 
      along the path like a Dalek.

                                  OSCAR
                          (to FRANK)
                    I ll call you!

      OSCAR begins running after the bin but it s a long way off. 
    Up ahead OSCAR sees the bin come to a stop. A SKUL AGENT 
      (AGENTHALLIDAY) dressed as an OLD LADY complete with 
      shopping trolley and handbag, steps out from behind a tree 
    and removes the package OSCAR left there (this is the same 
      woman who was earlier feeding the birds). She puts it in 
    her trolley. The SKUL AGENT looks up and sees OSCAR.     MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 25.


    The SKUL AGENT runs for it, pursued by OSCAR. She has a 
      familiar limp.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, (SKUL) AGENT DIXON-HALLIDAY disguised as an OLD 
      WOMAN

      OSCAR is chasing the limping SKUL AGENT and gaining on them. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, (SKUL) AGENT HALLIDAY disguised as an OLD WOMAN

      OSCAR finally catches up to the SKUL AGENT as they near a 
      park keeper s store, the SKUL AGENT S limp has slowed them 
      down. 

    The SKUL AGENT turns and runs straight at OSCAR with her 
      tartan shopping trolley. He grabs a workman s fluorescent 
    top and uses it like a matador s cape to dodge out of the 
      way.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      OSCAR, (SKUL) AGENT HALLIDAY disguised as an OLD WOMAN

    The SKUL AGENT lets go of the wheely-bagand comes at OSCAR 
    in a whirling kung fu attack, using her handbag as a flail. 
      They fight. The SKUL AGENT is more skilled but OSCAR is 
      determined. He knocks the legs out from under the SKUL 
      AGENT and she lands on the floor. 

                                  OSCAR
                    You ve got some nice Ninja moves 
                    for a granny...

      OSCAR is about to unmask her when suddenly his communicator 
      flashes. OSCAR is distracted, and in that instant the SKUL 
      AGENT disappears. OSCAR looks around desperately. He hears 
      a heavy metallic clunk. He sees a man-hole. He runs over to 
    it and tries to pull it up, but it s been sealed from 
      below. OSCAR closes his eyes, hurt at letting his Mum down.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      CARRIE, ROSE, OSCAR, FRANK, GRAND MASTER, (SKUL) AGENT 
      DIXON-HALLIDAY, FLOPSY, AGENT SHAW, AGENT LILL, AGENT KHAN, 
      2 SKUL AGENTS, MI9 SWAT TEAM

      CARRIE, ROSE AND OSCAR wait at one end of a park 
      footbridge. The team have their faces covered to protect 
      their identities. OSCAR is gripping the locket so hard his 
      hand is white. Figures now appear at the other end of the 
      bridge - The GRAND MASTER, TWO dangerous looking SKUL 
      AGENTS and Oscar s mum - AGENT HALLIDAY. She looks a bit 
      tatty and battered like someone who s been in a harsh 
      prison for a couple of years. OSCAR sees her.

                                  OSCAR
                    Mum!    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 31.


      He s about to go tearing towards her but ROSE drags him 
      back.

                                  ROSE
                    Wait, we have to do this like we 
                    planned. 

      OSCAR nods, struggling to keep his emotions in check. 
      CARRIE raises her hand as a signal for the exchange to 
      begin. The GRAND MASTER raises his hand too. 

                                  FRANK
                          (under his breath)
                    Here we go.

      ROSE picks up the rabbit cage and carries it up onto the 
      bridge towards the GRAND MASTER. AGENT DIXON HALLIDAY is 
      pushed roughly forward by the TWO SKUL AGENTS. AGENT DIXON 
      HALLIDAY starts limping across the bridge. ROSE starts 
      walking back towards the MI9 team. There is a look of hope 
    on OSCAR s face, then confusion as he sees her limp. All 
    the pieces crash into place for OSCAR... we flashback to...

                                                                          CUT TO:



      OSCAR, AGENT DIXON-HALLIDAY

      OSCAR looks up and sees a TRAMP (OSCAR S MUM). The TRAMP 
      walks with a pronounced limp. 

                                                                          CUT TO:    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 32.

      DIXON HALLIDAY, AGENT SHAW, AGENT LILL, AGENT KHAN, 2 x N/S
      SKUL AGENTS, N/SMI9 SWAT TEAM, FLOPSY 

      OSCAR leaps to his feet. ROSE is halfway back from 
      depositing the cage. 

                                  OSCAR
                    It s my mum... She s working for 
                    SKUL!

                                  CARRIE
                    What!

                                  FRANK
                    Oscar, are you sure. 

                                  OSCAR
                          (bitterly)
                    She s with them. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Rose, get Flopsy.

    But AGENT DIXON HALLIDAY is already level with FLOPSY S 
      cage. She grabs it and looks for a fleeting moment back at 
    the watching OSCAR. She turns and runs back across the 
      bridge to the GRAND MASTER. CARRIE, ROSE and FRANK run 
      towards the bridge. OSCAR doesn t move, he s in shock. 

                                  FRANK
                          (into walkie-talkie)
                    Swat team, go! Take them!

    As the team start to cross the bridge, three MI9 SWAT TEAM 
      appear. They run towards the GRAND MASTER. But the SKUL 
      AGENTS drop smoke bombs. Under their cover, THE GRAND 
      MASTER and his team vanish down manholes. Smoke swirls 
      everywhere.

                                  CARRIE
                    Where did they go?!

                                  ROSE
                    I can t see anything.

      CARRIE, ROSE, FRANK and the MI9 AGENTS search in vain for 
    the GRAND MASTER using tracking devices. The fog starts to 
      clear and there is no sign of the SKUL group. 

      OSCAR stares gloomily into the mist. OSCAR looks down 
      coldly at the locket in his hand. He throws it in the 
      canal. 

                                                                          CUT TO:    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 33.
