      Morning.  Everyone s heading to work, ready or not.  On the 
      sidewalks a sea of corporate drones, tight-skirted 
      assistants, power-suited attorneys --

      And CARL RESNICK, late 20 s, a schlub with a please-don t-
      hurt-me air.  But today, a determined schlub, a schlub with a 
      mission.  He plows through the crowd dragging something heavy 
      -- maybe he s got a large suitcase, maybe his bike lost a 
      tire, we can t tell.  Carl s puffing a self-help mantra --

                                  CARL
                    ...Self isn t something you find, 
                    it s something you create.  The 
                    more action you take, the more 
                    progress you make...

      Mostly no one s paying attention to Carl -- he s that kind of 
      guy -- but one Woman scurries out of his way, does a 
      horrified double-take --

      But Carl s gone, lost in the crowd.


      Imposing structure, lots of money here.  Striding to the big 
      glass doors are Jane, Lisbon and Carl, (hands cuffed 
      discreetly in front of him) held firmly by Rigsby.  


      Lisbon walking, anger in her stride.  Cho meets her, coming 
      from the direction of the courthouse.  He s carrying a file.

                    Yes, and I should be there.  What 
                    the hell happened?  Tiegler got 
                    bail?  Just like that?

                    Hello, Agents.

      It s Rick Tiegler, a grin on his face one might call  shit-

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Tiegler, you need supervision.  
                    We think you may have been 
                      hypnotized by the person who killed 
                    Mary Beth.

      A beat.  Tiegler bursts out laughing.

                                  RICK
                    Really?  That s your play?

      He yanks on his pants way too low for Lisbon s tastes to 
      reveal a purple bruise on his hip.

      Tiegler s smile falters... but then he laughs again.

      steps back in.

                    be together.  Finally he ll really 
                    see me.  And the gifts I have.

                                  RIGSBY
                    But he didn t see you.
                          (quietly)
                    It s hard, when they don t see you.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (bitter; to Daniel)
                    What a moron I was.  When I came to 
                    you, you said,   It s not 
                      important.  We ll do fine without 
                    you.  Go home.   And in that moment 
                    I knew -- you d never love me.  
                    Never.  So now you re going to die.

      Daniel  mmmph! s in protest.  Lindsay turns to Rigsby, 
      vulnerable eyes --

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    He hurt me, Rigsby.  He hurt me.

      Rigsby frowns, and BAM, socks Daniel across the jaw so hard 
      he knocks the chair over.  Daniel hits the deck, unconscious.

      Lindsay faces Rigsby and touches his shoulder once, quickly -- 
      the trigger -- then holds his hands, re-establishing rapport, 
      anchoring him in a trance state.

                    You want to protect women, don t 
                    you?  I saw how you look at that 
                      red-haired agent.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Grace.  Her name is Grace.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Well, now I need your protection, 
                    Wayne.  Your help with a special 
                    job.  You ll help me, won t you?

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Rigsby.  Hey, is that Venus 
                    up there, or Mercury?

      Rigsby turns, startled.  It s Jane, smiling cheerfully.  
      Lindsay aims the gun and he raises his hands.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hansel and Gretel used bread 
                    crumbs, we had Rigsby.  

      Jane holds up his cellphone, shows her a GPS readout.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I knew Rigsby would lead us to the 
                    guilty one.  So we put a tracking 
                    device in his pocket. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Smart.  Except for the part where I 
                    have a gun.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I have a gun, too.  Lisbon?

      Lisbon emerges from darkness and levels a gun at Lindsay.

                                  LISBON
                    Drop the weapon, Lindsay.

                                    LINDSAY
                    So predictable.  Rick!

      Rick Tiegler appears behind Lisbon, aiming a SHOTGUN at her 
      head.

                                  RICK
                    You should put the gun down, ma am.

                    Tiegler, you just made bail, don t

                    Shut up!  Drop the weapon, Agent!

                                  JANE
                    Best do as she says.

      Lisbon obeys, puts down her gun.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I am impressed, Lindsay.  There 
                    aren t three people in the world 
                    who could have done an induction on 
                    a cop.  But Rigsby s guard was up 
                    when he was with Dr. Daniel and 
                    Carl.  You, however, slipped right 
                    in, you bad little mouse.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I was never the sparkling, 
                    vivacious one.  That was Mary Beth.  
                    All the boys loved her.  Never me. 
                    But when I started working for Dr. 
                    Daniel, I realized I had a talent 
                    to reach people s unconscious.  
                    People trust me.  They let down 
                    their defenses.  Finally I was 
                    worth something.  Finally I was in 
                    control.

                                  JANE
                    Look around you.  Are you in 
                    control now?  Everybody here, you 
                    have to kill.  That s madness.  
                    That s not control.  You re having 
                    a nervous breakdown, Lindsay.  You 
                    need help.  We can help you. 

      This last said with tremendous confidence Jane doesn t feel.  
      A beat, is Lindsay wavering?...

                    Beautiful night for a swim, don t 
                    you think?  The ocean is so nice 
                    tonight.  

      Lindsay strolls to the railing, looks down.  Nothing but 
      darkness below.  It almost could be dark water out there.

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    Hear the crash of the waves out 
                    there, Rigsby?  Peaceful. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yeah.  It s nice. 

                                  JANE
                    It s not nice, Rigsby, it s not the 
                    ocean --

                                    LINDSAY
                    -- How about you show Royston the 
                    beautiful dark ocean?  Take him for 
                    a swim.  I love night swims.  Don t 
                    you?

      Rigsby shrugs his assent, shoves Daniel s chair toward the 
      roof s edge.  

                                  LISBON
                    Stop!

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby, listen to me, listen to my 
                    voice --

                                    LINDSAY
                    -- You know that won t work.  Hey, 
                    Wayne.  Take Jane swimming, too.  
                    He wants to go.

                                  JANE
                    No, Rigsby, I don t want to...

                                  LISBON
                      Rigsby!...

      But Rigsby shoves Daniel near the edge and firmly takes 
      Jane s arm.  Lisbon starts forward, but stops when Tiegler 
      brandishes the shotgun.

                                  RIGSBY
                    C mon, Jane, let s go swimming, 
                    man.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       49.

                    Rigsby, it s not water down there, 
                    it s cement.

      Rigsby and Jane approach the building s edge.  He pauses...

                                    LINDSAY
                    The water s gorgeous, isn t it?  
                    Mr. Jane loves the water just like 
                    you do.  

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby, don t!

                                    LINDSAY
                    Go ahead.  Let him go for a swim.  
                    Help him in, then help Royston.  
                    The water is so warm, healing...

      Rigsby prepares to push Jane over the edge... Jane points 
      urgently.

                                  JANE
                    Sharks!  Right there!  Look!    

      Rigsby pauses and looks.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    There!  See that?  There s great 
                    whites down there.  Tear your arm 
                    off soon as look at you.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (confused)
                    Sharks?  Where, dude?

                                    LINDSAY
                    There s no sharks, they re all 
                    gone.  They re gone, Wayne.  You 
                    can go in the water now...

                                  JANE
                    No, she s lying.  She wants you to 
                    get eaten.  Who is this woman?  

      Rigsby hesitates.  Lindsay waves her gun at Jane to shut him 
      up, moves closer, impatient --

                                    LINDSAY
                    Just get in the damn water!  Throw 
                    Jane in the water!




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       50.

      And she starts to grab Rigsby by the shoulder and spin him 
      around, but suddenly moves her hand, clumsily clutching his 
      arm instead.  An odd, clumsy move.  Jane s eyes narrow.

                                  JANE
                    Why not touch his shoulder, 
                    Lindsay?

                                  JANE
                    Don t bother.

      And he briskly taps Rigsby on the shoulder.  The trigger.  
      It s enough to interrupt the trance state.  Jane leans close 
      to Rigsby s ear, commanding --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Wake up.

                                    LINDSAY
                    No, Rigsby --

      But Rigsby turns, sees Lindsay with the --

                                  RIGSBY
                    Gun!

      Instinctively he knocks the gun out of her hand and kicks her 
      legs out from under her in one smooth motion.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Gun.  Thank you, Rigsby.

      Without Lindsay to command him, Tiegler just stands there 
      with the shotgun, perplexed.  Lisbon snatches the gun from 
      him, and cuffs him.  Meanwhile...

                                  JANE (CONT D)

                    Lindsay killed her sister to get to

                    she tried to make you kill him.  
                    And have it look like you both died 
                    during an attempted arrest.

      Lisbon goes to Lindsay sitting disconsolately on the ground.      

                                  LISBON
