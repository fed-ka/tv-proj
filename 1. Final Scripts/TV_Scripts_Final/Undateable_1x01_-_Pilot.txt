      EXT. DANNY S HOUSE - DAY

      A QUAINT, BRICK HOUSE WITH A PORCH IN FERNDALE, MICHIGAN. A

      INT. DANNY S HOUSE - SAME TIME

      MAN-CHILD DANNY BEEMAN (29) IS IN HIS TATTERED,  LUCKY  
      BATHROBE.  DANNY IS A GOOD LOOKING GUY -- TALL, CONFIDENT, 
      AND FEARLESS.  HE S UNCONCERNED WITH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK 
      OF HIM.  IT S A RECIPE THAT HAS SERVED HIM WELL WITH WOMEN.  

      THERE S A BASKETBALL POP-SHOT IN THE CORNER, A KEG DOUBLES AS 
      AN END TABLE NEXT TO THE COUCH, AND A BARRY SANDERS FATHEAD 
      AND A BRUCE LEE ENTER THE DRAGON POSTER ADORN THE WALL. 

      PACKED BAGS SIT BY THE FRONT DOOR AS DANNY TALKS, VERY 
        EMOTIONALLY, TO SOMEONE - PRESUMABLY A SOON-TO-BE EX-
      GIRLFRIEND - IN THE OTHER ROOM.

                                  DANNY

                You re turning your back on something 

                special if you do this.  You re 

                turning your back on us!   

      DANNY S MALE ROOMMATE, CHUCK (29), EMERGES WITH A BAG.

                                  CHUCK

                Danny, we ve been through this.  I m 

                engaged.  I m moving in with Olivia.

                                  DANNY

                What about our two man motorcycle 

                gang?  Dos Lobos.  I can t roll Solo 

                Lobo.

                                  CHUCK

                You ll find another Lobo."UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/132.


                                  DANNY

                I m telling you, you are making a 

                mistake if you walk out that door.

                                  CHUCK

                (SITS ON THE COUCH)  Be happy for me.

                                  DANNY

                (SMILES, THEN) Can t do it. (SITS NEXT 

                TO CHUCK, SINCERE)  Think of the 

                  memories, the women that we ve 

                  entertained in this place, the DNA 

                that s been spilled where we re 

                sitting, right now.  It s like an FBI 

                database of Detroit s finest on these 

                couch cushions and you want to give 

                that up for one woman?

                                  CHUCK

                Yeah.  I do.

      CHUCK HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  DESPERATE, DANNY RUNS OVER TO THE 
      POP SHOT AND GRABS A BALL.

                                  DANNY

                Okay, wait.  If I make this shot it 

                means you re meant to stay. (MISSES) 

                That was practice.  Okay, this is 

                real. (MISSES) Best out of three. 

                (MISSES) DAMMIT!  There s something 

                wrong with the rim.

                                  CHUCK

                Danny, I gotta go.  I m sorry. "UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/133.


                                  DANNY

                (NODS, ACCEPTING) I understand...

      BEAT.  DANNY WINGS THE BALL, HITTING CHUCK WITH IT.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)

                ...that you re ruining my life!

                                  CHUCK

                You are a selfish child, Danny!  I 

                take my apology back!

      CHUCK EXITS WITH HIS BAGS AND THE BALL.  DANNY CALLS AFTER--

                                  DANNY

                Good!  I don t want your apology!  But 

                I do want my ball back!

      BOOM!  THE BALL BOUNCES OFF DANNY S FACE.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)

                Is that all you got, weak sauce? 

                Didn t hurt one bit!  I can take balls 

                in the face all day long!  Shoulda 

                stopped before I said that!  Oh, well!  

                Moving on with my life!  Moving 

                forward!  Unlike you!  Solo Lobo 

                rides... Solo!  Adios!  Spanish word!

                                        SCENE A     

      INT. DANNY S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

      DANNY S SISTER, LESLIE (35) -- A STRAIGHT SHOOTING, NO-
      BULLSHIT DIVORCE  WITH A KID -- UNLOADS GROCERIES.  DANNY 
      PULLS OUT A BAG OF FROZEN PEAS AND PUTS IT ON HIS FACE.

                                  DANNY

                Who am I supposed to pick-up girls 

                with?  Ride motorcycles with?  Eat 

                White Castle at 3 AM with?  My life 

                was perfect and Chuck ruined it.    

                                  LESLIE

                Can t you just do that stuff with one 

                of your other friends?

                                  DANNY

                All my friends are buried!  Married.  

                I meant married, but I said buried, 

                because I equate marriage with death.

                                  LESLIE

                Danny, I m obligated to tell you that 

                you re an incredibly selfish person.

                                  DANNY

                  Actually, the obligation of siblings 

                is traditionally to be supportive and 

                have each other s back.  

                                  LESLIE

                This is hard for me, but I m gonna 

                tell you what your problem is."UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/135.


                                  DANNY

                Leslie, you always do this to people, 

                and it s never hard for you, it s hard 

                for them.

                                  LESLIE

                You re getting weird.  Living like 

                this -- the lucky bathrobe all day, 

                random hook-ups, no real job--

                                  DANNY

                I have a job.

                                  LESLIE

                You sell homemade bottle cap belts on 

                Etsy.  This was acceptable at 21.  It 

                was even cute at 25.  But you re 

                pushing 30, and it s getting creepy.  

                Gary Busey creepy.  And creepy sticks.  

                It s like herpes.  It s for life. 

                  (SINCERE) I get that it s scary when 

                all your friends move on to start 

                their lives.  But no one wants to end 

                up the 40 year-old guy who goes to the 

                bar alone.  You don t have to be that, 

                Danny.  You have so much potential.

      DANNY NODS, CONSIDERING LESLIE S ADVICE.  THEN--

                                  DANNY

                You re absolutely sure that herpes is 

                for life?"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/136.


                                  LESLIE

                You have to find a purpose.  Something 

                greater than just satisfying your own 

                base desires. 

                                  DANNY

                Why would I do that?  It sounds 

                  horrible.

                                  LESLIE

                All aboard, next stop Creepytown.  Say 

                hey to Busey for me.  I gotta go pick 

                up my son from his cheating, sexually 

                  inadequate, dead beat dad s house. 

                                  DANNY

                Hey, Les. (SWEETLY) Make sure you tell 

                that tool what his problem is, too.

                                  LESLIE

                I always do. (THEY HIGH FIVE) I m 

                outta here like a herd of turtles.  

                Good luck with the roommate hunt.

                                  DANNY

                  Actually, Chuck gave me a lead on a 

                dude who needs a place pretty bad.  He 

                owns a bar.  Seems like a cool guy.

                                  LESLIE

                  (SARCASTIC) Cool guy who owns a bar.  

                I can feel the growth already.     

                                                                              CUT TO:"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/137.

      INT. BLACK EYE S BAR - OFFICE - SAME TIME

       GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN  EMANATES FROM THE HEADPHONES OF 
      JUSTIN ZIP (26), SEATED AT HIS DESK, DEALING WITH PAPERWORK. 
      JUSTIN GROOVES TO THE SONG AS HE WORKS, SINGING ALONG -- HE S 
      NEVER BEEN CALLED THE COOLEST GUY IN THE ROOM.  JUSTIN IS A 
      CHRONIC OVER-THINKER, AND ALWAYS LOOKS BEFORE HE LEAPS.  
      DANNY ENTERS.  JUSTIN IS TOO INTO THE SONG TO NOTICE, BELTING 
      THE TOUGH PART.  HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS, BUT HAS A KILLER VOICE.

                                  JUSTIN

                You didn t knock!  Super! (COVERING) 

                You must be Danny. 

                                  DANNY

                Killer pipes, man.

                                  JUSTIN

                (DEEPLY FLATTERED) Oh, thanks.  I went 

                to chorale camp every summer as a kid.  

                And I m a huge fan of 80 s music.   

                                  DANNY

                Chuck didn t mention that.  I m more 

                of a hip-hop guy, but I respect a man 

                with the balls to rock some C-Laup."UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/138.


                                  JUSTIN

                I do enjoy the occasional karaoke 

                night amongst friends.   

                                  DANNY

                Karaoke.  Chuck didn t mention that 

                either.  You have the rent check?

                                  JUSTIN

                You know I thought about it and I 

                think I should look at the place 

                first.

                                  DANNY

                Awesome.  So glad I came down here.

                                  JUSTIN

                Yeah, I m sorry, I would ve called, 

                but I just this second decided that.

                                  DANNY

                No big.  Just cruised over on my bike.

                you see my bike out front?

      THEY GO FOR A HIGH FIVE.  JUSTIN STANDS, REVEALING THAT HE S 
      WEARING CYCLING SHORTS.  THEY BOTH STARE AT THE SHORTS.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)

                This is awkward.  I wasn t planning on 

                seeing your penis on the first day.

      JUSTIN GRABS A PAIR OF PANTS AND PULLS THEM ON. 

                                  JUSTIN

                Got so busy with work I forgot to 

                change after my ride.  Bad habit.  I 

                can get a little rashy unless I wipe 

                down with rubbing alcohol right away.

                                  DANNY

                Let s save the rash chat for our 

                second date.  So when you said  the 

                bike out front  you did not mean the 

                  motorcycle.

                                  JUSTIN

                No.  And when you said  panty dropper 

                bike  you didn t mean--

                Mine s actually got 18.  I m rarely in 

                one through five, though.  Unless it s

                                  JUSTIN

                Fact: If a motorcycle is your 

                  principle mode of transportation, you 

                have a 60 percent chance of sustaining 

                an injury requiring an overnight 

                hospital stay.

                                  DANNY

                A man has three things, Justin, two 

                  testicles and a motorcycle. (CHANGES 

                COURSE) We re getting off on the wrong 

                foot.  Let s try again.  Find some 

                common ground. (OFF A NOD) You own a 

                bar.  And that kicks ass in my book.

                No, Black Eye s.  Like if you get in a 

                fight there might be a few black eyes.

                  Experience tells me when you get in a

                Yeah, at first I was pissed.  Then he 

                said I wasn t as pretty as I thought I 

                was, so I went home with him. (TO

                Right, because Feng Shui is a real 

                thing. (AS JUSTIN WRITES A CHECK) And 

                the wall is already wired for a flat 

                screen, so you re good to go.

                Oh, no, I don t watch TV in bed.  All 

                research suggests that it negatively

                Who me?  You think I just came out the 

                womb crushing ass?

                                  JUSTIN

                That s a very disturbing image. (BEAT)  

                For anyone who has a mother.

                                  DANNY

                I had many teachers over many years.  

                Seventh grade.  Jay Tuck taught me how 

                to remove a bra.  Turns out he was 

                just looking for an excuse to wear a 

                bra, but still, his issues aside, I 

                don t know where I d be without him.  

                And there were others, in high-school 

                and college, all passing along what 

                they d learned from their 

                  predecessors, shaping the man you see 

                standing before you. 

                                  JUSTIN

                You re aware of how douchey everything 

                you re saying right now sounds, right?"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1322.


                                  DANNY

                I blow by negative thoughts.  Who were 

                your teachers?  Any big brothers?  

                Family or fraternity?

                                  JUSTIN

                No one.  No one taught me anything.

                                  DANNY

                My sister was right.  It all happens 

                for a reason.  And you need me.

                                  JUSTIN

                Words cannot express how strongly I 

                disagree with that statement.

                                  DANNY

                Change is hard.  I get it.  But I m 

                trading in my beer helmet for a 

                  professor s cap.  Consider this your

                I need a purpose, Justin, and that

                Don t you have something more 

                  important to be doing with your time?

                                  DANNY

                What could possibly be more important 

                than helping you become the roommate 

                I d hoped you d be?

                                  JUSTIN

                Okay Danny, I m gonna lie and say I 

                  appreciate the offer, but you have 

                your life and I have mine.  I d prefer 

                it if we kept it that way.

                                  DANNY

                (NODS, THEN) Can t do it.  You have 

                what I call  unused juice.   You re a

                  looking... You have the juice, you 

                just don t know how to use it.

                                  JUSTIN

                Please leave me alone.  I know how to 

                use my juice.

      DEFINITELY INTIMIDATED... BUT IT S THE ONLY WAY OUT.

                                  JUSTIN

                Fine.  If it ll get you off my back, I 

                will go use my juice right now. 

                (FEIGNS CONFIDENCE)  Bout to get super 

                juicey in here.  Gonna juice myself in

                Justin, you just scared me.

                safe, that s boring.  But not too 

                  dangerous either. I m like baby bear s

                weirdo who s gonna murder you, like--

      SPECIFIC AND WEIRD.  HE  SHH S  HIS INVISIBLE VICTIM AS HE

                I don t know why I would  shush  you 

                while I choked you-- Not that I would 

                choke you!  Unless, it was like a 

                sexual thing that you asked for --

                me that he actually had the worst pick-

                up line of all time.  Here you go.

                Dude, you almost just kind of asked 

                her out!  That was crazy.

                                  DANNY

                This is so much worse than I thought.

                                  JUSTIN

                That wasn t a fair test.

                We are out.  We re at a bar.

                                  DANNY

                No, I mean out.  Out of your routine, 

                out into the world, to live.  My 

                sister s a wine rep.  She s hosting an 

                event tonight.  Tons of girls.  And

                Missing the point, Shell, but I m glad 

                to have you on board.   Why don t you 

                all run home and get changed into...

                rubbies.  If I m not doing it with 

                myself at the end of the night, it s a 

                win.  Actually, even then it s a win.

                Justin s moose knuckle.  Seriously, 

                it s all I see.  Could those jeans be 

                any tighter, man?

                                  DANNY

                Okay, this is a lot to take in very 

                fast, but listen up.  Bursk, here s a 

                general rule I like to follow: Unless 

                the baby is crowning, never assume a 

                woman is pregnant.  Maybe next time, 

                let her talk a little bit before 

                diving in with your own thoughts.  And 

                Brett, whole new lesson coming your 

                way.  Every man has a flaw.  But 

                  sometimes those quirks are what make 

                people special.  Just give  em a 

                chance.  And I know that s hard to 

                hear coming from a damn near perfect 

                specimen like me.

                                  BRETT

                You re nowhere near perfect.  Your 

                  shoulders are too square, your nose is 

                a little beaky, and you have clown 

                feet.  And that s just at a glance.

                                  DANNY

                Shelly, do I look like the kind of guy 

                who would throw a man who can t swim 

                into a cold swimming pool? (HE LEADS 

                HIM TO THE PIANO)  Because that s the

                worry too much about what s gonna 

                happen down the road.  I never think

                  something... year old divorced woman 

                with a child.  And I get one night a 

                week when my A-hole ex-husband has our 

                son.  It s a very small needle to 

                thread, so when a nice guy walks up 

                and says nice things to me, and I ve 

                got my one nice thong on, I listen.  

                Even if he is my brother s roommate. 

                (OFF DANNY S GUILTY NOD) And you know 

                  something else?  He s a good person!

                (SAD) It was a disaster from the 

                  beginning.  He slipped while shaking 

                my hand and pulled my arm out of the 

                socket.  And then he was just so 

                  apologetic and sweet and nervous, I

                And I ll never forgive you for that.

                                  JUSTIN

                  Regardless, you ve done more for me in 

                three days than anyone else has done 

                for me in my entire life.  Thanks.

                                  DANNY

                (SOFTENS A LITTLE) You re welcome. "UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1353.


                                  JUSTIN

                Anyway, that s all I wanted to say.

      JUSTIN STARTS TO HEAD OUT.  DANNY STOPS HIM BY SAYING: 

                                  DANNY

                You were right about me. (THIS IS HARD 

                FOR DANNY) I m not great at being 

                alone.  All my boys are buried and 

                gone. (OFF JUSTIN S CONFUSION) That 

                means married.        

                                  JUSTIN

                Of course.

                                  DANNY

                They all started their lives.  I just 

                don t feel ready yet, you know?  Wish 

                I was.  Lobos aren t meant to be solo.  

                It s unnatural.

                                  JUSTIN

                (BEAT, THEN) Come back to the bar.

                                  DANNY

                That s okay, man, that s your crew.

                                  JUSTIN

                It s our crew.  I mean, if you want to 

                be a part of it.

      DANNY NODS, TOUCHED.  HE INHALES DEEPLY AND THEN EXHALES, 
      REALLY LOUD.  HE THEN OPENS HIS EYES REALLY WIDE.

                                  JUSTIN (CONT D)

                Are you alright?"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1354.


                                  DANNY

                Fine.  Totally fine.

      DANNY STARTS CONTORTING HIS FACE IN REALLY STRANGE SHAPES.

                                  JUSTIN

                Are you trying not to cry?

                                  DANNY

                (HE CLEARLY IS) No.  Nope.  Absolutely 

                not.  Crying is for babies and people 

                who read Nicholas Sparks novels. 

                                  JUSTIN

                Be that as it may, I want back in. 

                (PICKS UP BASKETBALL) Tell you what, 

                  Professor, if I make this shot, I get 

                another chance at D.B.U.

      JUSTIN LINES UP THE SHOT--

                                  DANNY

                Don t bother, the rim is--

      SWISH.  THE BALL GOES IN.  DANNY CAN T BELIEVE IT.  

                                  JUSTIN

                See you back at the bar, Danny.

      JUSTIN EXITS.  DANNY GRABS THE BALL, SHOOTS, AND MISSES.  

                                  DANNY

                Dammit! How the hell did you do that?!

                                  END OF ACT III"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1355.


                                          TAG

      INT. BAR - LATER

      THE REGULARS ARE AT A TABLE.  DANNY ENTERS WITH LESLIE. 

                                  DANNY

                This is my sister. Entertain her for a 

                sec. I ran over Justin s bike again. 

      DANNY EXITS.  THE GUYS STARE AT LESLIE LIKE SHE S AN ALIEN.

                                  BURSKI

                So you re the one Justin didn t have 

                sex with. (IMPRESSED) I can see why.

                                  SHELLY

                (VERY QUIET)  He meant that as a 

                  compliment.

                                  LESLIE

                (TO BURSKI) Oh.  Okay.  Thank you.

                                  BRETT

                This is why your brother calls us The 

                  Undateables. 

                                  LESLIE

                You guys are undateable?  Please.  I m 

                  divorced, with a kid, and I have a 

                tendency to be so direct that people 

                mistake it for Tourette Syndrome.

      A CHAIR SLIDES OUT FROM THE TABLE.  LESLIE TAKES IT.

                                  BURSKI

                  (QUIETLY) Dibs.
