          A beautiful day.

          Reverend Purdy stands proudly on the steps of a new
            building.  A large WHITE RIBBON ties the entrance.  He
            addresses a crowd.

                                        PURDY
                          ...Today, Faith Heritage continues
                        to grow - thanks in no small part
                        to the generosity of one very
                        special person, the late Vera
                        Smith.  If you'll allow a personal
                          reflection...

          Purdy makes eye contact with Johnny, as we see how
            emotional he's becoming.

                                        PURDY
                                (emotional beat)
                        Vera wasn't simply a lover of
                        literature and art.  She was also
                        passionate about life.  She was
                        the kind of woman who brought
                        love and joy into the lives of
                          everyone close to her, and I miss
                        more with every passing day.

          Purdy smiles at Johnny who, frankly, is a little uneasy
          with such intimate comments made about his mother in such
          a public forum.  In fact, it's kind of a creepy moment
          for everyone involved.

                                        PURDY
                                (back on text)
                        I'm also honored to introduce
                        someone else who was very close
                        to Mrs. Smith.  Her only child,
                        Johnny Smith.

          Polite APPLAUSE.

          Johnny offers an uncomfortable smile and wave.

                                        PURDY
                        John, I know your mother is smiling
                        down on us today.  So, without
                        further to do, I am proud to
                        officially open the "Vera Smith
                          Library."  May it bring knowledge
                        and enlightenment to all who enter.

          Purdy cuts the ribbon with scissors.  More APPLAUSE.

                                        BRUCE
                        Didn't this just used to be a
                        place of worship?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What, your chapel back home doesn't
                        have instantaneous translation in
                        40 languages?

                                        BRUCE
                        The chapel back home doesn't have
                        indoor plumbing.

          People begin to surge past them towards the entrance of

          RESUME on Johnny, concerned.  He takes a quick look around
          at the crowd.  Searching.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy.

                                        BRUCE
                        What about him?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Someone's going to hurt him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who?

          Johnny SPINS, anxiously looking, then --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Her.

          JESSICA, the young woman from Johnny's vision approaches
          Purdy.  Johnny squeezes quickly through the crowd,
            following her.

          ANOTHER ANGLE - PURDY

          He greets people as they enter the library.  Johnny's
          about to stop the woman when she reaches Purdy.  Johnny
          hangs back behind a hedge.

                                        PURDY
                          Welcome.

                          Reverend Purdy.  My name is
                          Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        It's very nice to meet you,
                          Jessica.

                                        JESSICA
                        I've been wanting to meet you for
                        a long time.

          Even Purdy begins to feel the undercurrent of something
          strange.

                                        PURDY
                              (a beat)
                        I must say, you do look slightly
                          familiar.

                                        JESSICA
                          I should.  I'm your daughter.

          FADE IN:



          A BUBBLING FOUNTAIN

          Purdy and Jessica speak privately.  Johnny speaks with
          Bruce off to the side, keeping his eye on them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you sure you heard her right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was three feet away.  She said
                        she was his daughter.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's hard to imagine Purdy knocking
                        boots with anyone, much less having
                        a kid.  What do you think she
                        wants?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I dunno.  Money, salvation...
                        money.

                                        BRUCE
                        You said money twice.

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a knowing look)
                        Did I?

          AT THE FOUNTAIN

          Jessica clutches a piece of paper.  She's nervous.

                                        JESSICA
                          I realize this must be awkward
                        for you.  I thought about
                        writing...

          Purdy can see how nervous she is.

                                        PURDY
                        Your hands are trembling.

          Jessica tries not to cry.

                                        JESSICA
                        I promised myself I wouldn't do
                        this.  I even wrote down what I
                        was going to say.

                                        JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        Pretty stupid, huh?

            Embarrassed, she rips up her speech.

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't want anything from you. 
                        I mean, I have a life.  Kind of.

          Purdy exudes empathy, as if helping a lost child.

                                        PURDY
                        Jessica... if I may be so bold?

          She nods.

                                        PURDY
                        I trust what your heart wants,
                        but what you're saying simply
                        isn't possible.

          She hesitates, then pulls out a check and hands it to
          Purdy.

                                        JESSICA
                          I receive one of these every month,
                        I have for most of my life.  They
                        come from you, don't they?

          Purdy is taken aback.

                                        JESSICA
                        And there's this.

          Jessica pulls a PHOTO out of her purse and shows it to
          Purdy.  While we don't see it, Purdy's face goes white. 
          An entire past life washes over him.

                                        JESSICA
                        You recognize it, don't you?

          His expression says he does.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        Why did you wait so long to contact
                        me?

          Puzzled, as Purdy talks with Jessica.

                        I saw.

                        Good luck.

          Johnny walks over.  Purdy seems on edge as Johnny steps
          up to them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me, Gene.  I was wondering
                        if we could talk?

                                (half stunned)
                        I'm sorry, Johnny, I'm in the
                        middle of something.  Can it wait?

                        Uh, actually...

          Purdy stands, awkward, between him and Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        Where are my manners?  Jessica. 
                        Johnny Smith.  The new library is
                          dedicated to his mother.

          Johnny and Jessica size each other up.

                                        JESSICA
                        That must be very... satisfying.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, it is.

          An awkward PAUSE, then...

                                        PURDY
                                (to her)
                        Well, I think we should go inside
                        and continue our conversation. 
                        Excuse us.

          Purdy gestures Jessica into the building, she looks back
          at Johnny.

                                        JESSICA
                        It was nice meeting you.

          She walks away, as Purdy starts off behind her.

                        Gene?

                        I don't have time right now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to make time.

          Purdy STOPS and looks back...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision.  You were in
                        danger.  And that woman was with
                        you.

                                        PURDY
                                (confused)
                        What kind of danger?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.  You were down on
                        your knees.  You were bleeding.

          Purdy considers this, then --

                                        PURDY
                        Is that all?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that all?  Gene, you know I'm
                        right about the things I see. 
                        Maybe you should stay away from
                        her until you get proof she's who
                        she claims to be.

          Purdy realizes Johnny overheard them talking.

                                        PURDY
                        Thank you for your concern, but I
                        can handle this.

          Purdy walks away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          He just keeps walking.  Bruce approaches.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He blew me off.

                                        BRUCE
                        You told him about what you saw?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told him.  There's something
                        very strange about this.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's 'strange' is you worrying
                        about a guy you haven't trusted
                        since you came out of your coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.  He helped my
                        father when he was in trouble.  I
                        can't turn my back on him.

          Johnny suddenly notices a small piece Jessica's ripped
          piece of paper on the ground.  He picks it up, holds it. 
          The letterhead says THE ANTLERS INN.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "The Antlers Inn."

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a Bed & Breakfast on the
                        East side of town.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like a place to start.

                                        BRUCE
                        Start what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To figure out if this woman really
                        is who she claims to be.



          Grain silos dot the landscape.  Johnny and Bruce drive
          past acres of symmetrical fields.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Reminds me of Indiana without the
                        corn.  And the basketball.

          They pass a sign proudly displaying:  "Lewiston, Maine."



          Johnny and Bruce walk back to Johnny's Range Rover.  Bruce
          holds a handwritten map.

                                        BRUCE
                        You just have to know where a
                        woman's vulnerable. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's your secret, huh?

                                        BRUCE
                        That, and basic animal magnetism.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll have to remember that.  So,
                        how far to this Desmond Farm?

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like five miles north.

          As Bruce and Johnny get in the Rover and drive off, a
          CLEAN CUT MAN sitting in a dark sedan watches them from
          across the street.  He pulls out and follows...



          Johnny and Bruce get out of the Rover in the middle of an
          barren field.  There's a WATER TOWER with the name
          'LEWISTON' stenciled across the side of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is definitely where the
                        picture was taken.

          Johnny touches the tower.  Whoosh.



          A SMALL carnival now occupies the space.  A TENT SHOW
          MIDWAY.  A CARNIVAL BARKER (20's) loud and energetic.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Come witness the extreme, bizarre,

                          humanity.  See the Illustrated
                        Man, where every picture tells a

                        Man and Human Pin Cushion.  If
                        you're feeling lucky, spin the

                                        YOUNG MINISTER (O.S.)
                          God-fearing citizens of Lewiston!  

          A YOUNG MINISTER, 20s, his back to Johnny, steps up on a
          wooden barrel, he holds a RED BIBLE up in the air.  Johnny
          tries to MOVE around to see his face, but keeps getting
          crowded out.

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        Turn away from this haven of sin! 
                        This man is an agent of the devil! 
                        The Lord sees all, including
                          abominations of the mind and the

                          religion somewhere else, Minister! 
                        This is a place of entertainment!  
                        These folks want to be dazzled
                        and amazed!

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER (CONT'D)
                        Not frightened and scolded!

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        He's right, friends!  This is no
                        place to bask in the warmth of
                        the Holy scriptures!  That's why
                        I'm invitin' every person within
                        the sound of my voice to come
                        witness the glorious work of the
                        Lord!  Who'll join me in humble
                        praise of God almighty?!

          The offer hangs in the air like the smell of hot roasted
          peanuts, until a young woman (who we will later know as
          CLARA, 20), raises her hand, inspired and steps forward
          out of the crowd.

                                        CLARA
                        I'll come, Minister...

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        Praise Jesus, sister!

          Even from across the midway, Johnny can tell she's taken
          by the young man holding the bible high. 



          RESUME: Johnny spins out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The woman I saw in the picture. 
                        She was here.  At the carnival. 
                        There was a young Minister...

          A sound behind them as they TURN to SEE a battered Ford F-
          150 pickup drive up.  A thick young farmer, WALLACE (20s),
          gets out of the truck.  Shotgun in hand.  The truck's
          engine remains running.

                                        WALLACE
                        You two are trespassin' on private
                          property!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  We didn't see any
                        signs.

                                        WALLACE
                        Saw the barb wire fence, didn't
                        ya?

                        Look, we didn't mean any harm.

                                        WALLACE
                        Then you won't mind gettin' back
                        in your fancy truck and drivin'
                        out the way you came in!

            Suddenly, the pickup's engine SPUTTERS and begins to SMOKE.

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like you got other problems.

          Wallace TURNS, as he slips off his baseball cap and stares
          at the truck in disbelief.

                                        WALLACE
                        I'll be damned!  I just paid four
                        hundred dollars to have that engine
                          rebuilt.

          Johnny sees an opportunity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like you might have a loose
                          cylinder head.

          Wallace looks back, now less confrontational.

                                        WALLACE
                        You know somethin' 'bout truck
                          engines?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a jeep I used to work on. 
                        Same thing under the hood.

                                        WALLACE
                        Think you might take a look under
                        mine?

          Johnny looks at Bruce, then back at Wallace.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (confident smile)
                        Sure, why not?



          Johnny pulls his soiled hands out of the truck's engine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go ahead, try it now!

          Wallace turns the ignition as the engine starts.  It sounds
          fine.

                        You're gonna need to replace the
                        points and plugs.  She should be
                        alright until then.

                          information on a carnival.  It

                        What about a tent revival?

          Wallace breaks a knowing smile.

                                        WALLACE
                        That, I can help you with.

                        I don't get it.  Why would Purdy

          The same Carnival Barker is inside a dark tent speaking
          with Minister Franklin (Young Purdy).  Johnny FOLLOWS
          them as they STEP around behind a tent.

                        Nice performance today.  You really
                        had her goin'.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                                (all business)
                        Did you bring it?

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Yeah, but I'm not so sure about
                        this one...

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        You let me worry about saving
                        souls.  You just keep your eyes
                        open.  Understand?

          The Carnival Barker hands him a piece of paper.  

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Her name is Clara Simon...

          Young Purdy scans the piece of paper. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        You're sure about this medical
                          information?  

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        I'm sure.

          Young Purdy hands him a roll of cash.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                          Pleasure doin' business with you,
                          Minister. 

          The guy walks away, as we HOLD on YOUNG PURDY'S conflicted
          look. 



          Johnny and Bruce walk back to the Range Rover.

                                        BRUCE
                        I know you don't like to hear it,
                        but the guy's always felt iffy to
                        me.

          Johnny is clearly upset by what's going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Iffy'?  What the hell is that
                          supposed to mean?

                                        BRUCE
                        You know, 'iffy'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I don't know.  That's why I
                        asked.  What does 'iffy' mean?

          Bruce stops, he can see this isn't about him.  After a
          BEAT, so does Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I've known Gene Purdy my whole
                        life.  At least, all of it I
                          remember.  Now I'm starting to
                        think I never knew the man at
                        all.

          POV - ACROSS THE STREET

          Johnny notices the same CLEAN CUT MAN from earlier stamp
          out a smoke and walk away.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That guy over there.  He was
                          watching us at City Hall.

          The guy disappears around a corner. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm gonna drop you off downtown. 
                        See if there's any public record
                        of that revival.  Something with
                        Franklin's signature.

                                        BRUCE
                        Where are you goin'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        See if I can find Clara Simon.



          A long driveway leads to an old, New England colonial
          home.  Once magnificent, it's now fallen into disrepair.

            A mailbox reads:  "C.  Simon."

          Johnny walks through tall iron gates to the front door. 
          KNOCKS.  The door opens, and -

          Jessica answers.

                                        JESSICA
                                (surprised to see him)
                        Mister Smith? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        C. Simon.  Clara was your mother,
                        wasn't she?

          It's obvious she doesn't want to talk about this.

                                        JESSICA
                        This isn't a good time. 

          She starts to close the door, but Johnny stops it with
          his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can talk to me here alone, or
                        we can do it in Gene Purdy's
                          office... it's up to you.

          Off Jessica's torn look...



          As the door shuts behind him, Johnny takes a second to
          digest what he's just seen...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:



          Johnny and Bruce outside City Hall.  They head for his
          car.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nolan accused Purdy of killing
                        Clara Simon?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and from the look on Gene's
                        face, he might have been right. 

                                        BRUCE
                        That explains why Purdy would
                        accept Jessica as his daughter. 
                        He doesn't want anybody asking
                          questions about her mother's death. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy's a lot of things, but a
                          murderer?  

                                        BRUCE
                        I found some old tax records.  It
                        seems Clara Simon was loaded. 
                        Sound familiar?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You talking about my mother?

                                        BRUCE
                        Wealthy widow taken in by a
                          charismatic man of God.  It can't
                        be a coincidence... can it?    

          Angry, Johnny puts the Range Rover into drive -



          They merge into traffic.  A black sedan follows them.



          As it SCREECHES TO A SKIDDING STOP.  The DARK SEDAN also
            SCREECHES TO A STOP 10 feet behind the Rover.  Another
          car STOPS behind the sedan, blocking its retreat.



          Johnny walks briskly towards the sedan.  The Clean Cut
          Man tries to back-up, but is blocked. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your problem?!

          By now, Bruce is trailing quickly behind his friend.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 32.

                                        BRUCE
                        John? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just want to ask him a few
                        questions.  Who sent you?

          Johnny reaches into the car and GRABS THE GUY - 



          Whoosh!  The Clean Cut Man is parked at the same farm
          Johnny was at earlier, holding the revival poster.

            A lighter flicks, he sets the poster on fire. 

          CLOSE ON

          Purdy's face on the poster, as any trace of "Minister
          Raymond Franklin" burns to ash and falls to the ground.

          The Clean Cut Man picks up his cell phone, dials.

                                        CLEAN CUT
                          Reverend Purdy. -- It's Williams. 
                        Smith and Lewis are still in
                          Lewiston.  They know about the
                          revival. -- Yes, sir, I understand.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 33.



          Johnny SPINS out and lets go of the guy.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to find Purdy.

          Off Johnny's look of resolve...



          Purdy watches as Jessica stares out the window at the
            sprawling green campus at Faith Heritage. 

                                        JESSICA
                        This place is amazing.  So many
                        unusual things to see.

          Jessica notices a small carved WOODEN IDOL.

                                        PURDY
                          I brought that back from Senegal.

                                look)
                        That's in Africa.

                                        JESSICA
                        Oh.  Wow.

                                        PURDY
                        I did my missionary work there. 
                        The idol was a gift from the
                          children of the local tribe.  It
                        symbolizes trust and love. 

          Jessica hesitates, suddenly bothered by the situation,
          then... 

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't know if this was such a
                        good idea.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you mean?

                        There's a reason God has brought

          She forces a small smile, as...



          Young Purdy (as Minister Franklin) KNOCKS on Clara's front
          door.  Clara answers.  There are emotional sparks flying
          all over between these two.

          Young Purdy holds his hat in hand, as he nervously
            speaks...

                          I apologize for showing up
                          unannounced.  The thing is, I
                        was... Well, I was taken by you...
                                (awkward smile)
                          I should say, by your interest in
                        the scriptures.

            A 3-year-old LITTLE GIRL, Jessica, appears by Clara's
          side, tugging at her mother's skirt.

                                        CLARA
                        I'm afraid she's a bit shy when
                        it comes to meeting strangers.

          Young Purdy kneels down.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Hello, Jessica.  My, aren't you a
                          beautiful little girl?

          Purdy gently strokes her long blonde hair and smiles up
          at Clara.           DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 37.



          Purdy's limousine is parked in front.  Jessica sits in
          the back, she stares out the window.  She seems different,
          less sure of herself. 

                                        PURDY
                        Did you enjoy the service?

                                        JESSICA
                        It was beautiful.
                                (beat)
                        Johnny Smith came to see me.

                                        PURDY
                                (tries to remain cool)
                        Did he? 

            A moment.  Purdy reaches into his coat pocket.

                                        PURDY
                        I'd like to give you something.

          He offers her the African idol.

                                        JESSICA
                          Reverend, I can't take this.

                                        PURDY
                        And I can't think of anyone else
                        I'd want to have it.

          She seems genuinely moved by the gesture.

                                        JESSICA
                              (a beat)
                        You're not the person I expected. 
                        The person I made up in my head.
                                (suddenly emotional)
                        I'm sorry.  This was a mistake.

          Purdy watches as Jessica leaves the limo.



            Establishing.  The sun creeps over the horizon.  Purdy
          pulls up in his Jaguar, grabs the briefcase and gets out*
          of the car.  Massive silos spread over the fields.  Purdy*
          hops over a fence and walks toward the field of silos.*



          Purdy walks towards a particular silo.  He looks up at
          the rusted, tall structure.  He's been here before.



          Walt's patrol car pulls up behind Purdy's Jaguar.  Johnny,
          Bruce and Walt spill out.

                                        BRUCE
                        At least we know he's here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, but where?

                                        WALT
                        I've got a half dozen men on the
                        way.

                        There isn't time to wait.

          Walt looks up - there must be a dozen silos.  All spread
          apart.  Walt pulls his shotgun from the trunk.

                                        WALT
                        Guess we're going door-to-door.

          Walt hands them each a flashlight from his trunk.

                                        WALT
                        Don't do anything crazy.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't worry.

          Johnny looks off, his face etched in the moment...

                                        WALT
                        John?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hear you.

                                        WALT
                        Okay, let's do this.  You see or
                        hear anything, give three flashes
                        and hold tight.  Good luck.

          They all take off in different directions.



          VARIOUS SHOTS of silos.  Walt rushes to a silo door, opens
          it.  Empty.

          Johnny rushes to a silo across the field.  Bruce does the
          same.



          Johnny PULLS on the door handle, as WHOOSH --



          Purdy, carrying the briefcase, hesitates to say a short
          prayer.

                                        PURDY
                        Give me strength, Lord, to face
                        my sins.  Give me strength to be
                          righteous in Your name.  Amen. 

          Purdy opens the door and enters.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  52.



          Johnny pulls on the door, but it's LOCKED.  Johnny looks*
          for Walt - he's nowhere to be found.  He's on his own. *
          Johnny goes around the side of the building looking for*
          another way in.*



          Johnny hears the motor come to life.



          Outside, Johnny sees a hole in the wall covered loosely*
          by some metal sheeting.  He grabs the sheeting -- WHOOSH.*



          Johnny moves the sheeting aside and crawls in through the*
            opening.*

          Jessica sits in the back.

                                        WALT
                        I guess that's up to Reverend
                        Purdy.  If he wants to press
                          charges?

          Purdy is stoic, as he watches her.

                                        PURDY
                        She was as much a victim in this
                        as I was.  I took her life away
                        once, I won't do it again.

                                        WALT
                        I can't promise she won't be back.

                                        PURDY
                        I'll leave that up to her.  And
                        God.

                                        WALT
                        Okay.  But you should go to the
                          hospital and get checked out.

          And Walt walks off.  Bruce can tell he's in the way.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm gonna catch a ride back with
                        Walt.

          Bruce walks away.  A tense BEAT, then...

                        I know our relationship isn't
                        what I wanted it to be.  I'd like
                        to try and change that.  To make
                        it up to you.

                        You can start by being honest
                        with me.

                        Clara was the reason I turned my
                        life to God.  Your mother was the
                        reward.

          Purdy's eyes well up, as an EMT helps Purdy into an
          ambulance.

                        Thank you.

          Purdy musters a weak smile as the doors are shut and the
            ambulance drives away.

          Johnny takes a BEAT to consider the surrounding, then
          grabs his jacket and walks away as the camera lingers on
          the silo.

          The SHOT PUSHES IN TIGHT on an area of the silo we have
          not seen.  An old, dusty sign that reads:
