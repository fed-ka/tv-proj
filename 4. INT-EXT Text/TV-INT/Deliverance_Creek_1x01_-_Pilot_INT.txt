Jasper and his men ENTER the saloon.  Jasper scans the smoky 
bar filled with UNION SOLDIERS.  Soldiers drunkenly sing, 
play poker and chase WHORES upstairs.  Jasper and Toby step 
up to the bar.

JASPER
(to Bartender)
Two whiskeys.

Jasper rests his hand on his revolver.  Out of the corner of 
his eye, Jasper sees a YOUNG SOLDIER eyeing them.  Feeling 
his gaze, Jasper follows it to where it lands -- on the 
emblem on the side of Toby s Union jacket -- the same as 
what s on the soldier.  This is the rest of the regiment, 
here, at the bar... the SOLDIER sees Jasper s caught him.6.


YOUNG SOLDIER
So... you just got here?    

JASPER
That s right.  
(then)
See Toby, here s the rest of our 
regiment...

Jasper nods to Toby who PULLS HIS GUN on the SOLDIER.  Jasper 
trains his on the Bartender.  

JASPER (CONT D)
(to Bartender)
Empty your cash register, NOW --

The Bartender doesn t move.  Jasper LEAPS over the bar -- 
presses his gun into the soft of the Bartender s cheek --

JASPER (CONT D)
You open that register or prepare 
to meet your maker --

Jasper DRAGS the Bartender by his collar over to the register 
and SCANS the room as he OPENS it -- Jasper sees a SOLDIER 
reach for his gun and SHOOTS HIM FIRST without letting go of 
the Bartender -- 

Jasper s SHOT releases an EXPLOSION OF VIOLENCE as his GANG 
SHOOTS and ROBS their way through the saloon --

UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Toby shoots his way through the brothel -- he CLEARS anything 
of value off night stands -- CASH, POCKET WATCHES, etc., -- a 
WHORE crouched down in the corner shouts over to Toby --

WHORE
I WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR THAT -- 

TOBY
I m sure you did, darlin .  My 
apologies --

Toby PEELS a few BILLS from his wad of CASH and drops it back 
onto the night stand as he tips his hat and moves on --

BACK DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Cyril s bowie knife digs into the neck of a YOUNG SOLDIER --

YOUNG SOLDIER
DON T -- DON T -- I KNOW SOMETHIN  --7.


Toby rejoins them, he sees Cyril cowering over the soldier.

YOUNG SOLDIER (CONT D)
Please, don t kill me, I... I ve 
got somethin  I think you d be 
mighty interested in -- I heard 
where our next payroll is going --

TOBY
JASPER, C MERE --

Jasper joins them, looking down at the crouched soldier.

YOUNG SOLDIER
And Union payroll comes all in 
gold... 

JASPER
Where?

YOUNG SOLDIER
Into Deliverance... Deliverance --

Jasper and Toby look at one another.

TOBY
WHEN?

YOUNG SOLDIER
I don t know --

Cyril SLICES THE SOLDIER S NECK wide open -- They hear a ROAR 
and look up to see the CURTAINS ON FIRE --


Belle dumps FEED into the draft horses s feedbag.  She 
strokes the large animal s chest and down its front foreleg, 
checking the hooves...  

IN THE BARN DOORWAY

JEB CAULFIELD (early 50s) watches Belle s every move.  His 
predatory gaze lingers over her backside, her breasts as she 
tends to the horse... he stealthily moves towards her...

Belle hears his footsteps and turns -- He s just a few feet away.  
She s instantly wary...

BELLE
Jeb -- what do you want?

JEB
(tips his hat)
Just making sure everything s 
alright over here, neighbor...

Belle, still on her guard, peers at him in the darkness...

BELLE
I thank you for checking in on us, 
but we re making do.  Now, if 
you ll excuse me, I ve got supper 
to fix.

Belle attempts to walk past, he side-steps to prevent her -- 

JEB
I see Deputy Cooper ridin  out here 
all the time... 

Belle smells the whiskey on his breath...

JEB (CONT D)
Now why let him help, when I m 
right next door?

Jeb tries to take her arm and pull her close, Belle yanks it 
away, stepping back into the stall door.  Cornered.9.


BELLE
You re drunk.  Go back home and 
sleep it off --

Belle scans the barn wall for her rifle -- too far away to 
reach.  Jeb leans his body into hers, pinning her against the 
door while running his hands slowly down her sides -- he 
leans forward to kiss her and Belle spits in his face --

JEB
(flinches)
You are a feisty one --

Belle KICKS his shin -- he releases her arm just long enough 
for her to SLAP him across the face -- HARD -- knocking OFF 
his hat --

JEB (CONT D)
(stumbling back)
You goddamn bitch --

Belle GRABS the pitchfork behind her -- then holds it out in 
front of her as he slowly stands.  

BELLE
I ll take that as a compliment 
comin  from a coward.  

Belle PRESSES the tines of the pitchfork into his chest.  

BELLE (CONT D)
Now get off my ranch.

Belle SPEARS Jeb s hat off the floor, holding it out for him.

JEB
(taking his hat)
You re gonna regret this...

BELLE
Give my regards to your wife.


HATTIE GATLIN, 22, Belle s younger sister, straightens the 
school desks.  She s pretty, but in a different way than 
Belle, more delicate.  

Franny and Abner run in, hugging their aunt.  

HATTIE
Hey, you re here early!

FRANNY
Mama brought us.

HATTIE
Oh?


Three TELLERS behind bars help CUSTOMERS.  In a back office 
with the door open is Cordelia Caulfield poring over papers.  

BEN CAULFIELD, Cordelia s nephew, missing half his leg from 
the war, hobbles back with the use of a cane.   13.


CORDELIA
Why didn t you tell me Belle 
Barlowe is late on her payments?

Ben hesitates, leaning on his cane.

BEN
Everyone s late on their payments, 
Aunt Cordelia...
(off her glare)
She pays a little something each 
month.  Same as most other widows 
in town.  

CORDELIA
Last I heard, Belle Barlowe is not 
a widow.  

BEN
How s she gonna round up her cattle 
alone?  She s got lil  ones --

CORDELIA
Why do you defend her so...?  
(then it occurs to her)
You re sweet on her little sister, 
Hattie, aren t you?

Ben looks away uncomfortably.  Cordelia smiles, taking pride 
that she guessed right.

CORDELIA (CONT D)
Draft up a lien and nail it to her 
front door.     


The whole town shows up for Sunday service.  Belle and her 
children sit with Hattie and their mother PEARL GATLIN and her 
sister-in-law MARGARET GATLIN.  Belle and Hattie share a prayer 
book, singing.  


Nate times his EXIT perfectly to match Belle s as the crowd 
carries them out of church.  He leans forward, whispers into 
the back of her neck...

NATE
Tonight?

She merely nods, never looking back at him.  He squeezes her 
hand -- unseen in the crowd -- before they EXIT the church.


Belle and the children ENTER the house and Belle instantly 
sees a TRAIL OF BLOOD -- she looks up to find a grizzled MAN 
(CYRIL BALFOUR) STEP OUT FROM THE SHADOWS.  Belle pulls her 
children behind her -- looks around to see the room full of 
Union Soldiers...

Cyril smiles slowly, menacingly, doing nothing to quell her 
fear as he walks slowly towards her...  


END OF ACT ONE19.


ACT TWO


Belle s eyes dart from Cyril to the other MEN who look at her 
leeringly... her children cling to her skirts...

BELLE
If it s food you want, I ll fix it.

MAN S VOICE
(from the next room)
Alright then, I ll have steak and 
kidney pie with the crust almost 
burnt, and an extra helping of 
bread pudding. If n you could 
manage apple crumble I might even 
forget this war ever happened...

BELLECALEB
(catching in her throat)(face lights up)
Jasper!Uncle Jasper!

Jasper steps out of the shadows.  Belle runs to him, hugging 
him... Caleb just steps behind her.  But as soon as Belle 
pulls back she punches his shoulder.  Hard.

JASPER
What the hell s that for?

BELLE
For scaring me and the children 
half to death -- what re you doing 
in those uniforms?

But Jasper purposely turns his attention to the children.

JASPER
Caleb, last time I saw you, you 
were between grass and hay!  
(looking over)
Is that baby Franny and Abner I 
see?

Belle s trying to put this all together, a sense of dread 
spreading through her...

BELLE
So is the war over?  

JASPER
No... We just... cut out a little 
early is all.20.


Belle looks down at the blood trail across the floor... 

BELLE
You look in one piece, so whose 
blood is all over my parlour floor?

JASPER
It s Toby...

Belle s face instantly drops -- 

JASPER (CONT D)
He could use a little help.

BELLE
Caleb, you take the kids on up now.

CALEB
But, Ma --

Belle looks carefully at Caleb.  He nods, taking each of 
their hands he leads them upstairs.  

BELLE
Where is he?


A mix of emotions cross Belle s face upon seeing Toby lying 
in her bed, looking pale, breathing labored.  Just from the 
sight of him, Belle can see how serious it is.

BELLE
I ll have Caleb go fetch Doc Burton --

JASPER
No, Belle -- You ve got to help 
him.  No one can know we re here.

DISSOLVE TO:


Several kerosene lamps burn in a circle around Toby s bed.  
Belle holds a whiskey bottle up to his lips, Toby blearily 
looks up at her, muttering incoherently... Jasper looks on.

TOBY
Belle... why s your Pa hate me so 
much?  He wants to kill me...

BELLE
Shhhhhh.  He s long dead now, Toby, 
so don t you worry about it.21.


Toby blearily looks up at Belle.

TOBY
You sure are pretty...

Belle holds the whiskey bottle up to Toby s lips again.  

JASPER
You better stop stalling, Belle. If 
you re not careful, the liquor s 
going to kill him, not the bullets.

BELLE
Alright, alright... give me the 
knife.

Jasper takes the knife and holds it in the flame, then hands 
it over.  She stares at it, then at Toby s bare, inflamed 
flesh.  Belle slowly leans in... Jasper leans in, too.

JASPER
You might want to open your eyes 
when you do that!

BELLE
(snaps)
Why are you making me do this?!!

JASPER
You ve got a steady hand, you re 
good at stitchin  and such --

BELLE
No.  That was Hattie, not me!

Jasper pats his sister s back, reassuring her.  

JASPER
Come on... you can do it.

TOBY
Don t tell me you never wanted to 
stick a knife in me.  Now s your 
chance!

BELLE
(suppressing a smile)
Bring that lamp closer...


Toby s eyes are closed.  His breathing regular.  Jasper 
drinks from the half-empty whiskey bottle while Belle 
finishes sewing Toby up.

JASPER
You did good, little sis...

Belle takes the whiskey bottle from Jasper, takes a swig.23.


BELLE
You see Harlan... heard anything?

JASPER
He s dead, Belle... crossed paths 
with Rennie right after we left 
Bloody Bill.  He fought with Harlan 
at Palmito Hill, no one from 
Deliverance survived  cept Ren.  

BELLE
Where?

JASPER
Texas.  

BELLE
I didn t even know he was in 
Texas...

JASPER
You don t have to play the grieving 
widow with me, Belle.  

BELLE
I ll grieve for my children, for 
Caleb especially, he s at that age 
where he needs his Pa. 

Jasper heads for the door.

BELLE (CONT D)
Why are y all wearing those Union 
jackets?

JASPER
(without turning around)
We were wearing rags before.

Belle doesn t believe that for a second...

BELLE
You burn them, you hear?  

Jasper nods then leaves.  Belle turns around to sterilize the 
needle in the open flame when Toby opens his eyes, watching 
her...  As she turns back, he CLOSES his eyes again.  

Belle looks down at Toby, studying his face.  She leans 
across him to pull the last stitch through his skin at his 
shoulder, bending down to tear the string with her teeth.  
Hovering over him close enough to kiss...  24.


With his eyes still closed, Toby reaches his good arm around 
and runs his hand up the back of her bare leg, beneath her 
dress, all the way up to her ass.  When he gets there, he 
OPENS his eyes, staring straight into hers.  They stay that 
way for a moment, the sexual tension palpable.  Belle stands 
up without a word and walks out of the room.


Hattie opens the clay grain pit door and the three escaped 
slaves help her shovel the grain in -- all in darkness -- all 
in silence.  Hattie signals for them to get in.  She 
continues shoveling in the last of the grain around them as 
they cover themselves up to their shoulders.  She drops to 
her knees, keeping her voice low as she speaks to them.

HATTIE
I ll bring you food later tonight.

Hattie lowers the trap door... 


Belle walks out of the bedroom to observe a MAN stationed at 
each window, hands on rifles.  The DOOR is kicked OPEN to 
reveal Cyril dragging Hattie inside.25.


BELLE
Let her go.  That s my sister!

Hattie wrestles out of his grasp, wildly looking around at 
all the MEN in Belle s house -- 

HATTIE
Belle -- what s going on?!

BELLE
It s alright, Hattie.

Jasper walks in from outside -- 

JASPER
Hattie?  C mere --

But Hattie stays put, glaring at Jasper.

HATTIE
This some kind of joke to you?  Why 
would you bring these men here to 
terrify us?

JASPER
(points at Cyril)
You heard her, git!  Stop scarin  
all my kin.  If my Ma stops by, try 
not to lay your damn hands all over 
her.

A few of the MEN sitting around grin.

JASPER (CONT D)
(to rest of the men)
THAT GOES FOR THE REST OF YA, GIT -- 

Hattie watches the men clear out.

HATTIE
What s this?  You desert?  

JASPER
(shakes his head)
You re looking at my own personal 
regiment.  We started off with 
Quantrill, Bloody Bill Anderson, 
then... just us.

HATTIE
You with Quantrill when he raided 
Lawrence?  You murder all those 
innocent women and children?26.


Belle puts a hand on Hattie to quiet her.  Jasper slowly 
smiles.

JASPER
So, you a Yankee now, Hattie?

Belle takes Hattie s hand, squeezing it as a warning.

BELLE
She s no such thing.  

JASPER
How could you forget Daddy being hog 
tied and hung by those very same 
Yankees you seem to love so much?  
Hell, just the thought of it makes me 
want to ride across the river and kill 
some more -- 

HATTIE
Those were innocent women and 
children --

JASPER
Whose fathers and husbands and sons 
murdered our daddy -- 

BELLE
That s enough, Jasper.  Come on, 
Hattie, we re gonna fix supper.

KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

BELLEHATTIE
You best watch yourself, Your grain s in the barn -- 
Hattie --

Belle s face drops -- she looks past Hattie to the barn...

BELLE
We gotta get them out of there --


Belle stands  guard  holding her shotgun while Hattie gets 
the slaves back into the wagon.  

HATTIE
You can t let Jasper and his gang 
stay, Belle --

BELLE
Toby s too shot up to ride on.27.


Hattie stops shoveling grain back in the wagon.

HATTIE
Wait -- Toby s here?!!

Belle takes the shovel out of Hattie s hand.

BELLE
There s no time for that --

Belle quickly collects burlap sacks, about to toss them into 
the back of the wagon when she STOPS -- seeing the BOY.

BELLE (CONT D)
How old is he?

HATTIE
He can understand you, Belle... 

Belle s gaze shifts back to the boy.

BOY
Twelve, ma am.

BELLE
This your Pa?

Belle looks at one of the men.  The boy shakes his head.

HATTIE
We had to leave his Pa.  No room. 

Belle forces herself to look away from the boy s large 
fearful eyes as Hattie gestures for them to lie down.  She 
and Belle throw the tarp back over them.  They get to work 
tying down their respective sides.

BELLE
You re going to take them back, now.  
At least he ll be back with his Pa.

HATTIE
Old man Spencer s worried about 
bounty hunters --

BELLE
So should you be.  They find you 
with slaves, they ll hang you -- 

Hattie refuses to look up.  Belle walks around and takes 
Hattie in her arms, making her sister look at her.28.


BELLE (CONT D)
Hattie, you re making me sick with 
worry.  This is too dangerous --

HATTIE
I don t have family like you --

BELLE
We are your family, Hattie... I am 
your family.  And that boy should 
be with his.  Take them back.   

Belle takes Hattie s hand, helping her up onto the wagon.

BELLE (CONT D)
You gotta go tell Nate I m not 
coming.  Just don t tell him why.   
If you think you ve been followed, 
tell him.  He ll help you. 
(slides open doors)
Now you be careful --


CORDELIA peers out her window, watching Belle s ranch... the 
bonfire visible.  Jeb sleeps in bed behind her.


Belle changes Toby s bloodied bandages.  She mops down his 
brow.  He shifts, then opens his eyes.  They take each other 
in for a long moment... 

BELLE
I hoped I d never set eyes on you 
again.

TOBY
And I was hopin  you d be fat and 
ugly by now.  So I guess we re 
even.

Belle almost smiles, which is just enough of an opening...

TOBY (CONT D)
I don t know why you re so dang mad 
at me.  You were the one to run off 
and marry that old son of a bitch. 

BELLE
And when the Preacher said  does 
anyone here object to this union , 
you were nowhere to be found... 

A flicker of pain lands, resting in his eyes.  Still raw.  Like it 
was days ago instead of years.

TOBY
Just like a woman to use that kind 
of logic.
(softly)
But we was only kids then...

Toby reaches for her hand, but Belle stands. 

BELLE
And now that you re all grown up, 
Toby, you ever take the time to 
think back and figure maybe it 
wasn t my idea to become Mrs. 
Harlan Barlowe?
(heading out)
Rest up now.  

DOORWAY

Belle quickly closes the door behind her, then leans against 
it, trying to breathe...  Trying not to cry...  The men s 
voices from the other room take her out of her own thoughts:30.


ANOTHER S VOICE
Ambush them on the road --

JASPER S VOICE
There ll be Union calvary escorting 
them to the bank.

The voices die down again, but she hears  gold ,  bank 
robbery  and enough to figure out what they re talking about.

THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Belle ENTERS.  All the MEN STOP talking.    Belle looks over 
at her brother who holds a straight RAZOR. 

JASPER
How s Toby?

BELLE
Fever s down.

JASPER
(nods)
I was gonna suggest you cheer us 
all by playing the piano, but uh... 

Jasper taps his boot on the floor where the ghostly, faded 
shadow of where the piano used to be still remains...

JASPER (CONT D)
Seems to be... missin .

BELLE
Times are tough.

JASPER
Daddy gave you that piano, you 
loved playing...

BELLE
I love my children eating more.

JASPER
You still got a washing basin, or 
you sell that too?

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jasper lathers his face for a shave.  Belle sits on the edge 
of her bed, watching him.  Their eyes meet in the mirror, 
their likeness to one another undeniable.

JASPER
What?31.


BELLE
You were born with that beard, 
weren t you?
(off his laugh)
Why shave it off now?

JASPER
It s time for a change.

BELLE
Or...

Belle walks to the window and pulls back the curtain... she 
watches Jaspers men standing guard...

BELLE (CONT D)
Maybe it ll be harder for witnesses 
to identify you.  What d you do?

JASPER
Robbed a saloon in Kansas.

Belle sits on the window sill...

BELLE
And that s how you help the 
Confederates win the war?

JASPER
They were Union soldiers, Belle.  
Instead of dying in a ditch, they 
died drunk and somewhere warm.  

BELLE
So now you think you re ready to 
rob a bank?

JASPER
Didn t take you long to figure that 
out.

BELLE
Less time than it s taking you to 
figure out that robbing drunken 
soldiers is a far cry easier than 
robbing a bank...

JASPER
We didn t plan that.  I m planning 
this one.

BELLE
Why here?  Why our home town?  32.


JASPER
Because when opportunity knocks...

BELLE
What opportunity?  As far as I can 
tell the bank is as empty as my 
pantry!

JASPER
Six Union regiments are getting 
their payday from Deliverance.  
Coming by stagecoach.  Solid gold 
bars.

BELLE
When s it coming?

JASPER
Don t know. 

BELLE
Hell, that s the most important 
part, Jasper!

JASPER
Well, it s comin  into Deliverance 
and when it does, we re robbin  it.

BELLE
Not while staying here you re not.  

Belle heads for the door.  Jasper grabs her arms and pulls 
her back...

JASPER
I appreciate your hospitality.

Jasper pulls out a wad of cash from his shirt pocket and 
holds it out for Belle.

JASPER (CONT D)
Don t act proud, Belle.  I can see 
you re struggling...   

Jasper picks up the crumpled lien off her vanity.

JASPER (CONT D)
Looks like you ve been struggling 
for some time now.33.


BELLE
That s Caulfields thinking that 
with one little piece of paper they 
can take away what s rightfully 
mine.

JASPER
Then why not help us rob them 
blind?  

BELLE
(bemused)
Can t you see my life has changed?  
I ve changed... look at me, Jasper.  
I ve got three younguns who depend 
on me.  Those days of runnin  wild 
are done for me, and they should be 
for you, too.  
(then)
You really want to help me?  I ve 
got cattle to roundup for auction 
and you ve got men.

Off Jasper s silence.

BELLE (CONT D)
That s what I thought.

JASPER
Alright, alright.  We can do that.

BELLE
Tell your men we leave at dawn.

Belle goes to leave -- then turns around and TAKES the money 
from Jasper and EXITS without another word.


Men scattered asleep on the floor. Jasper sleeps in a chair 
in front of the window.  


Belle s eyes snap OPEN as she hears her dog bark...  She 
quickly disentangles herself from Franny; pulls the blankets 
up around her and Abner, then grabs her shotgun...34.


IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Nate slides off his horse, tying it up.  He takes in the 
dying bonfire.  Belle s dog bounds up to greet him -- he gets 
down, petting him, then stealthily moves towards the ranch, 
Belle s dog at his heels...

BELLE S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Belle gingerly navigates between the sleeping bodies, heading 
to...

TOBY S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She peers out the window, looking across her field, seeing 
shadows but nothing else, and then peers up at the FULL MOON.  
She steps away from the window...

And turns to check on Toby...


Hattie walks through the darkened hallway, clearly knowing 
her way.  Straight, right, and towards a door with just a 
sliver of light coming beneath it... She reaches for the door 
knob, silently turns it...


Duke COUNTS his MONEY from the night at a large oak desk, his 
cigar resting in a crystal ashtray in front of him.  He hears 
someone ENTER without knocking and quick as a flash PULLS his 
REVOLVER, training it at the  intruder  --  HATTIE.   

DUKE
I wasn t expecting you...

His tone is calm, and judging by the fact that he s not 
surprised to see her, you can tell this isn t the first time 
they ve met like this.   

Duke holsters his revolver.  He can see she s upset.

HATTIE
I need your help, Duke.  I ve got a 
shipment that needs to go out tonight.

DUKE
I wish I could help, really I do.  
But it s Jimmy s night off.

Hattie eyes his pile of cash...

HATTIE
Isn t there something you could do 
to persuade him...?

DUKE
You re very persuasive.  Ask him 
yourself.  He s in the bar -- 
But then again, you might not want 
a drunken ferryman in charge of 
your precious cargo.38.


Hattie glances out the window, checks her wagon...

HATTIE
Can you let them stay the night? 
(tentatively)
Here, in your office, maybe?  

DUKE
I thought the last time was a one 
time favor?  Which I granted 
because I think you may be the only 
truly good person I know...
(resumes counting his 
money)
Myself, well, I m bound to burn in 
Hades, but I like to play the odds.  
Way I see it, sometimes you can 
beat the house.  

Hattie finds it difficult to breathe, she begins to cry, she 
wanted to keep it together, but here... she can t.  

DUKE (CONT D)
(looks up)
Hey, hey now... what is it?

Duke rises and comes around his desk, gathering her in his arms.

HATTIE
They hung old man Spencer and his 
wife... slave bounty hunters, I 
couldn t take all four... said I d 
come back for him...

DUKE
(holding her up)
Shhhhhh, shhhhhhh... 

Duke looks into her eyes and then kisses her.  It s clear 
from the intensity of the kiss that they are lovers.

DUKE (CONT D)
You ve got to stop this... it s not 
a game, Hattie.

But Hattie can t stop crying.

DUKE (CONT D)
They can stay until we figure 
something out.  Then no more.  You 
hear?  39.



Jasper and his gang saddle up to go out with Belle.  Caleb 
appears, dressed and ready to go.  

CALEB
Why didn t you get me up?

BELLE
I need you here --

CALEB
(angry)
But Ma, you promised -- we was 
planning this!

Belle walks over to him, lowers her voice so only he can hear.

BELLE
I need you here.  Toby s gonna need 
lookin  after.  You and the kids 
stay home, you keep them here, you 
understand?

Caleb still mad, finally nods.  

BELLE (CONT D)
You re the man of the house now, 
Caleb.  So act like it.

CALEB
(stands straighter)
Yes ma am.

Belle climbs up on her horse, nods to Jasper.  Caleb follows 
them out, watching them ride off... 


Jeb grabs his hat off the rack, about to put it on when he 
holds it up to the light.  He sees the half dozen HOLES left 
from Belle s pitchfork.  He throws the hat down on the 
ground, grabs another...


Caleb stands in the doorway, holding a plate of food, afraid 
to disturb the bloody, dirty strange man who sleeps here... 

TOBY
(eyes still closed)
I don t bite...

Toby OPENS his eyes, taking in Caleb.  

TOBY (CONT D)
Unless it s breakfast...

After a moment s hesitation, Caleb walks the rest of the way in 
and hands Toby the plate.  As soon as it s in Toby s possession, 
he shovels the food in.  Caleb can t help but STARE...

TOBY (CONT D)
(mouth full)
Could ya fetch me a water, boy?

Caleb proceeds to pour Toby a glass.  He hands it to him.  

Caleb drops his gaze to the floor.  Toby s fancy SILVER SPURS 
on the back of Toby s boots catches his eye -- Toby leans 
over to see what Caleb is so taken with...

TOBY (CONT D)
Those were given to me by my Pa.  

Caleb picks a boot up, spins the spur, admiring it.

TOBY (CONT D)
Go on, try  em on.

Toby sees Caleb is struggling to get the spurs off.

TOBY (CONT D)
C mere, give  em here...

Caleb sits on the edge of the bed as Caleb shows him...

TOBY (CONT D)
You got sausage fingers like 
me...there.41.


Caleb nods a  thanks , pulls his boots on...

CALEB
So what was my Ma like as a kid? 

TOBY
Hot headed.  Brave.  This here s at 
least the third time she s saved my 
life.

CALEB
Really?

TOBY
Time before this, we was oh, 
probably  bout your age.  Before 
Duke cleaned up the whorehouse I 
lived there with my Ma --

CALEB
What was it then?

TOBY
A dirty, rundown whorehouse.

Caleb laughs.  Toby is oblivious that this is not a 
conversation to have with a boy his age...

TOBY (CONT D)
A cowboy came in after roundup all 
liquored up and flush with cash. He 
liked this whore named Sadie who 
had a reputation for a famously 
powerful cooch...

Toby trails off, now realizing this story might be too much.

TOBY (CONT D)
Hold on.  I gotta better story --

CALEB
Wait, what happened with the other?

TOBY
I ll skip to the good part.  The 
cowhand brought his bullwhip and 
started using it on Sadie.  Well, I 
tried and stopped him, so he turned 
that whip on me, and he wasn t gonna 
stop, he was in a feverish rage.  Well 
your Ma probably heard me screamin  
from next door -- and showed up with 
her daddy s peacemaker.  
(MORE)42.

TOBY (CONT'D)
She put a bullet clean through that 
cowhand s leg, then told him one of her 
famous tall tales -- that her daddy the 
sheriff was ridin  over so unless he 
wanted to meet his maker he should git.  
Well he took off outa there so fast he 
didn t even put his britches on!  

Toby s laughter turns into coughing...  Caleb stands.

CALEB
I should let you rest up, if you 
need anything, just holler -- 

TOBY
What should I holler?

CALEB
Oh.  Caleb.  Caleb, sir.

Toby extends his good arm to shake Caleb s hand.  Toby looks 
into the boy s eyes, so much like his own...

TOBY
How old are you, boy?

CALEB
Twelve.  Twelve, sir...

Toby nods, slowly letting go of his hand.  Caleb takes a 
STEP.  Remembers spurs.

CALEB (CONT D)
Better take these off --

TOBY
No.  No, I want you to keep  em --

CALEB
Nah, I couldn t --

TOBY
I tell you what. If n I ever have a 
boy, I know where to find ya.  But 
rest easy, cause I got a feeling I m 
gonna have a house full a girls, just 
my damn luck, so take  em!

They laugh at his joke, Caleb looks down, admiring his spurs. 43.



UNION SOLDIERS and a high-ranking OFFICER crowd around Nate s 
desk.  Nate pours over crude SKETCHES of CYRIL BALFOUR and 
some of the other men in Jasper s gang.  SHERIFF KNOX beside 
him.  

OFFICER
Any of them look familiar?45.


UNION SOLDIER
(nods)
There s a reward, dead or alive.

Nate takes a good hard look at the sketch, knowing now that 
Cyril is one of the men he saw at Belle s ranch that night.  

NATE
No, sir... haven t.  But I can take 
you around town to find out if 
anyone has.


Belle walks into the bank and stands in line, her eyes find 
Hattie who stands at the counter talking in hushed tones to 
Ben Caulfield.  We can t hear what they re saying, but Ben 
glances around quickly, making a show of  waiting  on Hattie. 

BEN
Thank you, Miss Gatlin.  Next...

Hattie turns around, pale, shaken, and then sees Belle.  
Belle steps out of line and follows Hattie out.  


Belle counts out the AUCTION MONEY in crumpled dollar bills 
onto the counter out loud to Ben Caulfield.  Belle does this 
for Cordelia s benefit who is just visible in her back 
office...

BELLE
Thirty-six, seven, and that s five 
hundred... now, will that settle us 
up for awhile?

Ben smiles at Belle, she s about to leave, when --

CORDELIA
(appears at the window)
Could you wait just a moment, Mrs. 
Barlowe?

Belle sets her jaw, but then turns to look at a lady waiting 
in line behind her.

BELLE
Hi May, how re you today?

MAY
Just fine, Belle... you sell your 
cattle at auction then?

Ben Caulfield steps back up to the counter.47.


BEN
Just remember, Mrs. Barlowe, the 
rest is due by end of next month, 
or the bank will proceed to taking 
back your ranch.

BELLE
Well, you remind Mr. and Mrs. 
Caulfield that anyone who tries to 
take what s rightfully mine will be 
met by me and the end of my 
shotgun.  Have a good day.


Ben stands beside Union Soldiers.  Cordelia looks through the 
sketches... 

CORDELIA
What are these men wanted for?

UNION SOLDIER
They re bushwhackers, ma am.  
Robbed a saloon in Kansas, killed 
many of our men.  Just across the 
river, we re checking all towns in 
the area, especially Confederate 
ones.

CORDELIA
Well, our kin is all Union 
supporters, Officer.  

Cordelia sees Jeb ENTER the bank. She waves him over. 

CORDELIA (CONT D)
But our neighbor, her whole family 
are rebels... We ve been thinking 
something s been going on at our 
neighbors ranch this week, haven t 
we Jeb?

JEB
I did go over today to check out a 
bonfire that was goin  all night...

Jeb takes the SCRAP OF ILLINOIS REGIMENTAL PAPER out of his 
pocket, slaps it down on the desk.  All the SOLDIERS lean in 
to see the proof laid before them.

OFFICER
Sir, would you escort us to her 
ranch now, please.


Belle bursts in, Jasper and his gang are sitting in her house -- 

BELLE
You gotta leave now, Jasper -- 
they re in town, Union soldiers 
everywhere in town looking for you.  
They ve got sketches of Cyril, 
others... can Toby ride?

JASPER
No way he d stay on a horse.49.


BELLE
Then move him to the barn --


Belle rushes the children upstairs --

BELLE
You re to stay with Franny and 
Abner, do not come downstairs until 
I say it s safe -- no matter what, 
you hear?  Hide in the back bedroom 
with the door closed.

CALEB
What s going on?

They hear POUNDING on the door downstairs.  Belle puts her 
finger over her lips, kissing Franny who looks worried.

BELLE
It s just like hide-and-seek, but 
you gotta be quiet to win... 50.



Toby stays quiet in the bottom of the grain pit, hearing the 
feet shuffle above him... 


Belle stands helplessly in the back of her home -- horrified 
to see them destroying everything as they search her house --

BELLE
CAN T YOU SEE THERE S NO ONE HERE -- 
STOP THIS --

A MAN starts to go upstairs -- 

BELLE (CONT D)
STOP -- THAT S JUST MY CHILDREN UP 
THERE --

Belle runs, following the Man, trying to stop them --

UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

CALEB, hearing his mother s shouts, runs to the top of the 
staircase --52.


DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Jeb looks up to the TOP OF THE STAIRS -- SEES THE BOOTS WITH 
SILVER SPURS--

JEB
THAT S ONE OF THEM COMING DOWN NOW --

DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

A SOLDIER COCKS HIS RIFLE -- FIRING WITHOUT LOOKING --

BELLE
NO -- THAT S MY SON --

FROM THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE -- Toby presses his face against the 
slats of the barn wall -- Belle s front door wide open he sees --

CALEB TUMBLE DOWN THE STAIRS 


CALEB S BODY CRUMPLES LIKE A LIMP DOLL -- LANDING AT BELLE S 
FEET -- 

The only sound is Belle s piercing SCREAM as she collapses to 
the floor --

And once Caleb s in her arms, she frantically checks for a 
sign that he s survived this -- that s he s still alive --

A sob breaks through as she realizes he s dead -- a mourning 
sound that s more animal than human -- Belle rocks his 
lifeless body, so small in death, just a boy.

Nate bursts in -- too late to stop it -- he takes in what 
happened to Caleb, then stares down at all the silent men.

NATE
What have you done?
(then)
GET OUT OF HERE -- GO ON --

Jeb ducks his head, trying to blend in with the exiting soldiers, 
even he is unable to bear the sound of a mother s torment... Nate 
sinks down and puts his arms around Belle and Caleb while Franny 
and Abner look on from the top of the stairs...


END OF ACT FOUR53.


ACT FIVE


Toby, now good enough to ride, hoists a saddle onto his 
horse.  Belle appears silently in the doorway, watching 
him... Feeling her presence, he turns.  They look at one 
another for a long beat.54.


TOBY
I m leaving.  But first, I m riding 
over there and killing Jeb 
Caulfield.

Belle looks at Toby evenly.

BELLE
If you go over there all shot up, 
barely able to sit in a saddle, I 
might as well dig another grave 
right next to Caleb s because you 
won t come back alive.

TOBY
(filled with rage)
I want to kill all the Caulfields for 
what they took from you, Belle --

BELLE
(corrects him)
From what they took from us, Toby.  
He was your son.  Caleb was your 
boy.

Shock and pain cross his face, confirming what he had just 
started to suspect... 

BELLE (CONT D)
But you must ve known that?  I 
think you knew it the moment my 
Daddy made me marry Harlan.  I 
think you knew it when you took up 
with that girl from Carthage.  But 
I know you knew it when you saw 
him.  He looked just like you, 
Toby.  He was your son.  Harlan 
didn t know it... But I think you 
did.

Toby crumples into his horse, breaking down.  Belle does not 
comfort him, but merely turns away and walks back to the 
house...

DISSOLVE TO:


Belle lies in bed, eyes open, she stares at nothing, 
listening to the wind... Franny stands in the doorway.

FRANNY
Mama, when are you going to get up?

Abner joins her, a worried look on his face.  

FRANNY (CONT D)
(plaintive cry)
Mama?

They can hear a KNOCK on the door from downstairs... 

HATTIE S VOICE
Franny and Abner, you come on down here 
now... someone s here to see you.

We stay on Belle, staring but unseeing.  She listens to the 
low voices without hearing.  Then just the wind...

NATE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY...

He crosses over to her, sitting on the edge of the bed.  He 
leans down and kisses the sides of her face.  

NATE
(whispers)
I love you... you hear me?  

Belle doesn t move.  Nate sinks to his knees beside her.

Belle stares at the top of his head as he kisses her hands.  
She withdraws from him, turning away.  He stares at her back, 
the row of buttons so familiar.  He leans down and kisses her 
before he leaves.


Belle comes downstairs and STOPS when she sees the PIANO in 
the sitting room.  She quietly walks over to it, touching the 
keys... Nate s gift to her.  She turns to see Hattie watching 
her.  Belle peers through the window into the inky darkness, 
having lost all track of time...

BELLE
(hopeful)
Is he still here...? 56.


HATTIE
Left.  Hours ago.

Belle slowly sinks to a chair in front of the window.

HATTIE (CONT D)
I was going to go back to the 
inn... do you need me to stay?
(looks upstairs)
I think the kids are asleep.

BELLE
Go...  We re fine.

Hattie nods, not sure, but collects her things.  

BELLE (CONT D)
I didn t get to ask... did they get 
across?

Hattie turns to Belle whose gaze remains fixed outside...

HATTIE
Yes.  Your plan worked perfectly.

Belle turns and looks Hattie for the first time.

BELLE
You re not going to be reckless 
anymore, leave things to chance, 
understand?  I ll help you, but you 
must tell me everything that s 
going on. 
(quieter)
I m not going to lose you, too.

Hattie tears up, then kisses the top of Belle s head before she 
slips out into the night... 

DISSOLVE TO:

Belle has fallen asleep at the window.  She stirs when she 
hears the sound of horses.  She holds up her lantern, peering 
out to see...

OUTSIDE - NIGHT

Jasper and Toby on horseback.  Belle EXITS her house -- once 
outside, the three take each other in...

TOBY
We ve come back to murder Jeb and 
Cordelia and then tomorrow we rob 
their bank. 57.


BELLE
Is that when the gold is coming?

JASPER
We don t know.  We re just going to 
take whatever they ve got.

Belle peers at them in the darkness, icy calm.

BELLE
I want revenge too... But a bullet 
for each of them while they sleep 
is little comfort.  I want the 
Caulfields to suffer like I ve 
suffered.  I want them to feel what 
it s like to have everything they 
love stripped away from them piece 
by piece.  And I don t want 
innocent people of Deliverance to 
lose lives because of it.  He was 
my son.  This happened in my house.  
And If you want my help, you ll do 
it my way.

Belle turns around and enters her house, leaving them in 
DARKNESS.


Belle places the lantern on the table and sits back down.  
After a moment, Jasper and Toby join her.  They wait.

BELLE
We ll rob the bank in daylight.  
That s never been done before, and 
they won t expect it.  No one but 
Caulfields get hurt.  

JASPER
But we ve got dynamite --

BELLE
And you ll blow up half the town.  Why 
do that when you can walk right in?

TOBY
How we gonna find out when the 
gold s coming in?

BELLE
When every deputy in town is on duty.  
I can get that information...58.



Belle looks at her reflection as she puts on her pearl 
earrings.  Reaching for the other in her china dish, she 
instead picks up the Prairie grass ring that Nate made her.  
She puts it on her finger, and overcome with emotion, sinks 
back down to the chair... she looks up at her reflection.  

DOWNSTAIRS - LATER

She heads out, but hesitates at the doorway, looking at the 
piano in the sitting room.  


Belle ENTERS.  Nate looks up from his desk.  He quickly 
rises.  Hope and longing written all over his face. 

NATE
Belle...

Belle enters his arms, allowing him to hold her... but just 
for a moment as they are out in the world.   

BELLE
(stepping back)
I wanted to thank you for the 
piano, it s beautiful... 

She sees the pain on his face...

BELLE (CONT D)
I also want to apologize --

NATE
Please don t.  No need.

From the cell in the next room, a DRUNK starts to yell --

DRUNK
DEPUTY -- I NEED WATER -- 

NATE
Can you just... wait here?  

Belle nods, sitting down at his desk.  Like Belle told her 
brother, figuring out when the payroll comes into the 
Deliverance Bank is the most important part...59.


Belle opens the CENTER desk drawer where she knew it would 
be, THE LEDGER.  She glances behind her and sees Nate, then 
runs her finger down the days and weeks between now and the 
day that will forever change her life and those she loves...

She hesitates slightly, watching Nate as he talks kindly to a 
man behind bars.  She closes the ledger before she can find the 
date, and half rises...

When she sees through the window Cordelia and Jeb passing by 
on their way to The Deliverance Bank.

Belle sits back down and quickly flips open the book again... 
refusing to look back at the man she loves, for this is about 
revenge, not Nate.  And Belle thinks she can have both.

Her eyes find what she came looking for...

And her delicate finger rests upon the date as we...

FADE TO BLACK.
