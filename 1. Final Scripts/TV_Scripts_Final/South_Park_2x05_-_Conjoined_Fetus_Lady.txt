               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               The kids are all gathered around Chef.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, children, it's Friday and you 
                         know what that means for P.E. class... 
                         we're gonna play DODGEBALL!!

               The kids all moan.

                                     KYLE
                         We don't wanna play dodgeball it 
                         hurts.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah!

                                     CHEF
                         -- So let's have half the children 
                         on this side, and half the children 
                         on that side.

               The kids all whine and head for their respective corners. 
               Pip quickly catches up to the four boys.

                                     PIP
                         Uh, excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I 
                         don't believe I know how to play 
                         dodgeball.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What?! Don't you have dodgeball in 
                         France?

                                     PIP
                         Well, no. And actually I'm not from 
                         France.

                                     STAN
                         Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A 
                         kid from that team is gonna try to 
                         bean a kid on our team in the head 
                         with a big red ball --

                                     PIP
                         Oh, dear...

                                     STAN
                         If the ball hits you, you're out. 
                         But if you CATCH the ball, HE'S out. 
                         And the last team to still have 
                         anybody standing wins.

                                     PIP
                         Oh what jolly good fun!

                                     KYLE
                         No it isn't, it hurts. I can't believe 
                         they let us play this in school.

               The kids all line up. Chef blows a whistle.

                                     CHEF
                         PLAY BALL!!

               A kid from the B team (That's the team WITHOUT Stan, Kyle, 
               Cartman and Kenny) throws the ball as hard as he can.

               The ball immediately SMACKS into the face of an unprepared A 
               team player (Clyde). Clyde flies to the ground, and starts 
               crying immediately.

                                     KYLE
                         DAMMIT! WE'VE LOST ONE ALREADY!

                                     CHEF
                              (laughing)
                         You're out, Clyde!!

                                     STAN
                         JORDAN, SWANSON, PULL FORWARD!! WE 
                         NEED BACKUP!!!

               Jordan and Swanson take obediently take their spots. The B 
               team player again hurls the ball. SMACK!! It nails Jordan in 
               the stomach, sending him backwards into the wall.

                                     STAN
                         WE'RE LOSING MEN FAST OUT HERE!!

               Chef yells out some coaching tips.

                                     CHEF
                              (still laughing)
                         Concentrate on your game... Be the 
                         ball...

               The team B player lets one fly. It heads for Kyle's face, 
               but at the last second, Kyle snags it from the air.

                                     KYLE
                         I CAUGHT IT!! I CAUGHT IT!!!

                                     CHEF
                         Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's 
                         on offense!!

                                     KYLE
                         Here, pip, you throw.

               Kyle throws the ball to Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, no I couldn't.

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, limey! Don't be a wuss!

                                     PIP
                         But --

                                     KYLE
                         Are you just gonna be a little French 
                         pansy your whole life?!

                                     PIP
                         I'm not Fren --

                                     KYLE
                         Throw the ball you stupid frog!

               Pip seems to be getting angry.

                                     KYLE
                         God damn, maybe if you didn't eat 
                         all those croissants you'd be able --

               Suddenly, Pip throws the ball violently at Kyle. Kyle 
               immediately crashes to the floor.

                                     KYLE
                         YOW!!!

               Chef runs over.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but 
                         you're supposed to hit kids on the 
                         other team.

               Kyle gets up, holding his nose.

                                     KYLE
                         OW! My nose! You broke my nose!!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (to Pip)
                         Damn, Pip, I didn't know you had it 
                         in you.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry...

                                     CHEF
                         That nose is bleeding pretty bad, 
                         Kyle. I think you might have to go 
                         to the Nurse's office.

               MUSIC STING. Kyle looks horrified. All the children look 
               horrified.

                                     KYLE
                         No... No it'll be okay...

                                     CHEF
                         Sorry, son. You'll have to let the 
                         nurse look at it. Come on.

               Chef pulls Kyle away by the arm.

                                     KYLE
                         No! NOOooooo!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude... He's going to the nurse's 
                         office.

                                     CLYDE
                         I heard the school nurse is hideously 
                         deformed!!

                                     BEBE
                         I heard she has tentacles and eats 
                         children for lunch!

               Cartman slowly walks up to Stan, who is worriedly watching 
               Kyle be dragged away.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Stan... Has anybody actually seen 
                         the nurse, and come back to tell 
                         about it?

                                     STAN
                         No, Cartman... Nobody ever has...

               The two boys swallow hard.

               Establishing.

               INT. NURSE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Kyle is sitting alone on the Nurse's operating table. 
               Everything is silent and still...

               Kyle looks scared shitless. He's shaking violently. There is 
               the smallest little BUMP. Kyle jolts and looks to his left 
               where a little mouse scurries away. Kyle breathes a sigh of 
               relief.

               Then, he hears the door opening. CREEEEEEEAAKKKK.... Kyle 
               can't take it. He closes his eyes.

                                     NURSE (O.S.)
                         Are you Kyle Broflovski?

                                     KYLE
                              (eyes still shut)
                         Y-Yes.

                                     NURSE
                         I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt 
                         your nose?

                                     KYLE
                         Y-Yes.

                                     NURSE
                         Young man, why do you have your eyes 
                         closed? I'm not going to hurt you.

                                     KYLE
                         I know.

                                     NURSE
                         So open them.

               The music builds and builds and finally reaches a climax as 
               Kyle pops his eyes open.

               Kyle smiles.

               Standing before him, is a fairly attractive, quite normal 
               looking woman in her late thirties.

               Kyle's smiles widens and he takes a deep breath.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh, whew!!

                                     NURSE
                         Now what seems to be the problem?

                                     KYLE
                         Aw, I just hit my nose playing 
                         dodgeball.

                                     NURSE
                         Oh, well I'll get you an ice pack.

               Now the nurse turns to her right. And Kyle sees, to his 
               horror, that she has a small, dead fetus growing outside of 
               her head.

                                     KYLE

                         What?

                                     KYLE

                         Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. 
                         I have a still born fetus growth 
                         attached to my head.

               All the boys are gathered around Kyle, who is relating his 
               story.

                         And when she moved up and down, the 
                         little fetus jiggled!!

                         it talk?

                         KYLE! THAT IS ENOUGH!!

               The boys all snap their heads towards Ms. Broflovski, who is 
               holding a large encyclopedia.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         I've been reading up on your poor 
                         nurse's condition, and it is nothing 
                         to be made fun of. It's called 
                         Conjoined Twin Msylexia.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Who the hell cares what it's called, 
                         as long as she doesn't touch me.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Now that's just the kind of 
                         unawareness that we need to fight 
                         against. Sit down, boys.

               The boys reluctantly sit. Ms. Broflovski sits in a chair 
               with the encyclopedia entitled "Freaks A-Z" in her lap.

               MUSIC begins like it's storytime.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         You see, boys, sometimes when babies 
                         are born, they're born as twins. But 
                         sometimes the twins get hooked 
                         together, and they're born as 'Siamese 
                         Twins'.

               She shows them a picture from the encyclopedia. (Use a real 
               picture)

                                     BOYS
                         Gross!!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         But sometimes, after the Siamese 
                         twins are joined together, one of 
                         the twins dies before birth. The 
                         living baby is born with the dead 
                         baby still attached.

               The boys look petrified.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Sometimes this dead twin is inside 
                         the living person. So even YOU could 
                         have a dead twin inside you and not 
                         even know it!!!

               Stan and Cartman SCREAM and run out the door.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         So now that you are educated about 
                         her disease, you won't need to make 
                         fun of her, right Boobie?

                                     KYLE
                         Uh... yeah.

               Kyle's mother gets up and walks away. Kyle just sits there, 
               scared stiff. He finally roles his eyes over to Kenny, who 
               breaks out laughing.

               Kyle doesn't laugh with him, so Kenny eventually stops.

               INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Kyle's mom is in the kitchen cooking, as Kyle's father reads 
               the paper at the kitchen table.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                              (not paying attention)
                         Mmm mm.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Feeling like an outcast, Being 
                         ridiculed every day...

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Mmm mm.

               The phone rings. Sheila answers it.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Hello?

               INT. STAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Stan's mother is on the other end.

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Hello, Sheila, it's Sharon, Stan's 
                         mother?

               CROSSCUT

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh yes, hello, Sharon.

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Sheila, I was wondering if you might 
                         know why my son is trying to split 
                         his head open with an ice pick?

               In the background, we can see little Stan going crazy. His 
               father is holding him back.

                                     STAN
                         No, no! I have to get it out!!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Well, Sharon, I was just trying to 
                         educate them about Conjoined Twin 
                         Myslexia

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         So this IS your fault. Would you do 
                         me a favor? Next time you want to 
                         scare the hell out of my child just 
                         go outside and sit in the road until 
                         a truck runs you over instead.

               Click.

               Kyle's mother just thinks with the phone in her hand.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         That does it. I must educate the 
                         entire town about this awful disease!!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Mmm mm.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

               Morning establishing.

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               The kids are all standing in their dodgeball uniforms, looking 
               confused.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, I don't get it. Why are we 
                         supposed to play dodgeball again?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I thought we only played on 
                         Fridays.

               Chef comes running in with a piece of paper.

                                     CHEF
                         Children! Great news! We've been 
                         asked to play in the State FINALS 
                         for dodgeball!!

               Again the kids moan.

                                     STAN
                         Aw, do we have to?

                                     KYLE
                         Can't we just play with that big 
                         parachute again or something?

                                     CHEF
                         You don't understand, children! If 
                         we can win State, we can play in the 
                         nationals in Washington D.C.!!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey! They have a zoo there!!

                                     CHEF
                         That's right! Now come on, we have a 
                         LOT of practicing to do!!!

               The kids start to take their places.

                                     STAN
                         Aren't we supposed to have WON 
                         something in order to go to State 
                         Finals?

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, Pip, you want to be on my team 
                         again?

               Pip looks absolutely thrilled.

                                     PIP
                         I'd love to!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Just try not to send anybody to that 
                         monster nurse this time Frenchy.

                                     PIP
                         Hey, I get quite disturbed when you 
                         call me that. You shouldn't make fun 
                         of foreigners. And besides, I hate 
                         French people.

               Chef blows his whistle and a "B" team member hurls the ball 
               and knocks Bebe out. The kids all laugh.

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

               Kyle's mother is sitting in the Principal's office with 
               Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly 
                         is a thrill seeing your cheery face 
                         again. What seems to be pissing you 
                         off today?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Nothing is pissing me off. I just 
                         want to start a movement.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Of course you do.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         I want to talk to you all about your 
                         school nurse.

               The Principal and Mr. Mackey exchange looks.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh, Nurse Gollem is absolutely 
                         qualified to --

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         No. no, no, I'm not upset about her. 
                         I want to make the public aware of 
                         her. Her disease should be brought 
                         to light, so that it can be understood 
                         rather than made fun of.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Oh... And what disease is that?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollem 
                         has Conjoined Twin Myslexia

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         What's that?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         She has a dead fetus attached to her 
                         head.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         She does?!

                                     COUNSELOR
                         You've never noticed that?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         No, I never did...

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Well, that's exactly what I'm talking 
                         about. This poor woman is forced to 
                         live in the shadows because she feels 
                         like an outcast. It is up to US to 
                         make her feel comfortable and welcome 
                         in our town.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Did you say a fetus? Sticking out 
                         from her head?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         I want to invite your nurse to a 
                         dinner party at my house this evening. 
                         I'd appreciate it if both you and 
                         Mr. Mackey would attend.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Do we have to eat Kosher stuff?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollem, but 
                         I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's 
                         say around eight?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Wonderful.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Now you DID say she has a fetus on 
                         her head?

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD

               The big yellow school bus drives down the road, past a sign 
               that reads 'Denver - 45 miles'.

               INT. SCHOOLBUS

               Ms. Crabtree is at the wheel. Chef is in the front seat, and 
               the boys are in the back.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, children, now WHO'S GONNA WIN 
                         THE STATE FINALS?!?!

               The kids don't respond.

                                     CLYDE
                              (very softly)
                         Denver?

                                     CHEF
                              (chanting)

                         UH!! HERE WE GO CO-OWS, HERE WE GO, 
                         UH-UH!!

               Chef walks up next to the driving Ms. Crabtree.

               Tons of parents have turned out for the dodgeball State 
               finals. The coach of the Denver team walks over to shake 
               Chef's hand.

                                     DENVER COACH
                         Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas the 
                         coach for the Denver Cougars.

                                     CHEF
                         I'm Chef. Coach of the South Park 
                         Cows.

                                     DENVER COACH
                         Well, I certainly want to thank you 
                         for bringing your team down. 
                         Apparently nobody else would play us 
                         because they know we'd just beat 'em 
                         silly. So I told the school board to 
                         find me some hick school from the 
                         mountains, and here you are. You're 
                         from South Park, yeah?

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah.

                                     DENVER COACH
                         My God, amazing where people can 
                         live nowadays. Well, we might as 
                         well get this over with, we gotta 
                         start thinking about D.C. Promise we 
                         won't make it too painful.

               The coach slaps Chef on the back and trots away. Chef looks 
               pissed.

               Seated around the dinner table are Kyle's mother, Kyle's

               the dead fetus.

               Everybody just sits and eats, uncomfortably. Nobody says a 
               word. Finally, Kyle's mother tries to break the ice.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         So... Uh... Where did you get your 
                         degree, Nurse Gollem?

               More uncomfortable silence.

                         Sheila, could you pass me the dead 
                         fetus -- I mean, gravy.

               Kyle's mother smacks Gerald under the table.

               A WHISTLE blows, and Token is smacked in the head with the 
               ball. He falls to the ground, bleeding. The parents in the 
               stands cheer wildly.

               That leaves only Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Pip on the 
               cows side and --

               The entire Denver school team still standing on their end of 
               the court.

                         Dammit! Come on, somebody catch the 
                         ball!!

               Behind Chef, all the kids sit looking like war victims.

                         little bastards to go!

               The cocky Denver player winds up to take another shot. But 
               this time, the ball sticks into Cartman's stomach. Cartman 
               quickly puts his arms around it.

                                     CARTMAN

                         Oh, bother.

               Pip looks at the ball like it smells.

                         what they don't understand.

               Pip stares the Denver player down. The Denver player gets in 
               a stance, starts to look confident.

               Pip winds up to take the shot --

               The South Park kids all fall down and moan from pain and

                         for your ass. It's turnin' red.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

               The large stage (from Weight Gain 4000) is again set up in 
               the middle of town. The Mayor addresses the large crowd of 
               townspeople.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed 
                         a great week for South Park. Ms. 
                         Hermans has opened the East wing of 
                         the library, and our own South Park 
                         Cows Elementary school dodgeball 
                         team is going to the national finals! 
                         Where they will undoubtedly be beaten 
                         senseless by the Washington team.

               The townspeople cheer.

                                     MAYOR
                         But most importantly, this week has 
                         brought to my attention a very serious 
                         and dreaded disease. Conjoined Twin 
                         Myslexia.

               Kyle's mother nudges his dad.

                                     MAYOR
                         And so it is in honor of this, that 
                         I declare this exciting week as 
                         'Conjoined Twin Myselxia Week'!

               The crowd cheers.

                                     MAYOR
                         And now, let's kick off our week 
                         long festivities with the first annual 
                         'Grand Conjoined Parade'!

               PARADE MUSIC begins. We can see a parade route, and everybody 
               standing on the sidewalks to get a view.

                                     MAYOR
                         Let's hear it for these brave souls!!

               The parade music gets louder, and Nurse Gollem, all by 
               herself, walks through frame, waving to a couple people 
               halfheartedly.

               As she walks out of frame, the parade music gets softer.

                                     MAYOR
                         What a glorious parade that was!! 
                         Let's hear it for the parade 
                         coordinators!!

               The mayor gestures to about eleven guys in suits, who stand 
               up and take a bow. Everyone applauds.

                                     NURSE
                         You know, Mayor, I really should be 
                         accompanying those kids to Washington 
                         in case they get hurt. That IS my 
                         job.

                                     MAYOR
                         Nonsense! This is YOUR week! You 
                         aren't going anywhere!

               INT. SCHOOLBUS

               Ms. Crabtree drives the kiddies again.

                                     CHEF
                         How much further is Washington D.C.?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I SAID SIT DOWN!!!

                                     CHEF

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

                                     CHEF
                         I said 'I've always wanted to visit 
                         Prague'.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh, me too.

               Meanwhile, the boys are in the back of the bus.

                                     STAN
                         Okay, what have you got?

               Kyle looks through his brown paper bag.

                                     KYLE
                         Some hadkafish... Some Gafagga...

                         I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly 
                         roll!!

                                     STAN
                         Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!! 
                         Places!!!

               Kyle holds one side of a rod, Cartman holds the other. Stan 
               loads the pie into onto the rubber band like a giant sling 
               shot.

               Stan lets it go -- Ms. Crabtree gets SMACKED in the back of 
               the head with the Jelly roll.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         OW!!

               Her face hits the windshield. The bus swerves out of control.

                                     BOYS
                         Woa!!

               Establishing.

               The school bus drives in and plows right into the side of 
               the Vietnam memorial.

               EXT. ULYSSES S. GRANT ELEMENTARY

               A lot of people have showed up for the big game. Chef and 
               the kids walk in to the large, decorated auditorium.

                                     CHEF
                         Damn man, this is the big time 
                         alright...

                                     STAN
                         Chef, we're hungry.

                                     CHEF
                         You can eat after the game. You 
                         children win this one and your 
                         national champions! Then you go on 
                         and play the Chinese.

                                     CARTMAN
                         My mom says there's a lot of black 
                         people in China.

                         What?

               But Chef is interrupted by a geeky looking referee.

                                     REFEREE
                         Are you Chef?

                         The Washington team has forfeited 
                         the game. Congratulations, you're 
                         national champions.

               Stan and the boys walk over to the Washington bench, where 
               all the kids are getting ready to leave.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, why did you guys forfeit?

                         Last year's national champions were 
                         the Austin Pirates. They played China 
                         for the world championship... Only 
                         four of them came back alive.

               The boys eyes pop.

               Establishing.

               INT. CHINA SCHOOL

               The Chinese children, (who all look alike, naturally) are 
               dressed in little red uniforms. They do their exercises 
               preparing for the big game.

                                     WASHINGTON KID (V.O.)
                         They do nothing but dodgeball day 
                         in, and day out. They use steroids 
                         and advanced training equipment to 
                         make them not kids, but animals...

               The kids work harder and harder. A Chinese man in a white 
               coat walks up and down giving the kids steroid shots in the 
               arm.

               INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               There is a large banquet hall in the Mayor's building. It is 
               quite large, and has lots of round tables with immaculate 
               place settings.

               Everybody is dressed formally in black tie and dresses.

                                     MAYOR
                         And so, at this honorary dinner, we 
                         take a look back at our beloved Nurse 
                         Gollem and the brave life she has 
                         lived. Roll the tape please, Mr. 
                         Garrison.

               Nurse Gollem is sitting at a table looking embarrassed.

                                     NURSE
                         Oh no...

               Mr. Garrison, in his tux with a fetus on his head, turns on 
               a projector. The film begins

               SCREEN

               A title comes up 'CONJOINED COURAGE: The life of Nurse Hilary 
               Gollem'

               CHEESY MUSIC begins ala Neil Diamond.

                                     SONG
                         YOU'VE GOT THE STRENGTH, YOU'VE GOT 
                         THE COURAGE, EVEN WITH A DEAD FETUS 
                         ON YOUR HEAD. YOU CARRY ON, YOU FIGHT 
                         FOR TOMORROW DEAD FETUS OR NO, YOU 
                         NEVER LET GO. YOUR MY CONJOINED TWIN, 
                         DEAD THING HANGING OFF OF YOUR HEAD 
                         WOMAN.

               As this song plays, still images of Nurse Gollem doing stupid 
               mundane things like driving, painting her house, shopping 
               and doing a puzzle.

               The big, yellow school bus pulls up in front of the shitty 
               little Chinese school.

               INT. CHINA SCHOOL

               All the Chinese parents are gathered on one side of the gym.

                                     CHINESE ANNOUNCER

                         decide!

               Chinese music and pageantry begins. Gongs and whistles, woman 
               throwing silk.

               The cows go to their end of the gym. Chef goes to the 
               sidelines.

                         'EM WHAT WE GOT!!

               Two Chinese announcer guys are in a booth, just like the two 
               white guys in Big Gay Al's.

                                     CHINESE SPORTSCASTER

                         are getting ready to play... I don't

                         SEEING the ball with their BIG 
                         American Eyes!

               The two sportscasters laugh.

                                     CHINESE SPORTSCASTER 2
                         Yea! Good thing they have those big 
                         eyes so they don't have to rely on 
                         that AMAZING AMERICAN INTELLECT!!

               The laugh even harder.

                                     CHINESE SPORTSCASTER
                         Oh, you say such things.

                                     CHINESE SPORTSCASTER 2

                         PLAY BALL!!

               The Chinese player hurls the ball like a bolt of lightening.

               It hits Clyde between the eyes, flipping head over heels 
               right off the playing field.

                                     CHEF
                         Holy crap...

               Another Chinese player throws the ball. Again the speed and 
               accuracy is amazing. It knocks Kyle in the balls. Kyle 
               doubles, over holding himself.

               Before he can recover, the Chinese player again launches the 
               ball, the time hitting Kyle right between the eyes. He falls 
               to the ground.

                                     CHEF

                         person with P.H.D. in Physics and 
                         math?

                                     CHINESE SPORTSCASTER
                         Stupid American!

               The two sportscasters laugh merrily.

               The Chinese player hands the ball to another teammate. This 
               Chinese kid winds up and throws a ball at Cartman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AAGH!

               Cartman tries to run, but the ball catches him in the back, 
               knocking him head over heels.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         OH! Another American is down! It's,

                         Americans look alike!

               They laugh merrily.

               Another ball is quickly launched. This one hits Kenny dead 
               on, blowing him backwards into the cement wall, where he 
               breaks every bone in his body and sticks like a wet sponge.

                         OH MY GOD THEY KILLED KENNY!

               Kyle is still lying on the floor, but manages to barely lift 
               his arm. We don't even see his face.

               Another Chinese player lines up.

                                     CHINESE ANNOUNCER
                         Oh my, I haven't seen an American 
                         die like that since Abraham Lincoln!

               On the stage, the Mayor again takes her place at the 
               microphone.

                         TWIN MYSLEXIA HATS!!

               The mayor puts a hat on her head, that says 'go cows' and 
               also has a large plastic fetus hanging off the side. The 
               townspeople follow suit, putting on their ridiculous looking 
               hats. Now everybody has a little fetus hanging off their 
               head.

               Nurse Gollem can't believe her eyes.

               Establishing. Time passes.

               INT. CHINESE GYMNASIUM - DAY

               Chef is standing on the sidelines looking desperate. All the 
               South Park players are on the bench behind him, looking in 
               desperate need of medical attention.

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         players... This should be over very 
                         shortly.

               The Chinese players all smirk and take aim at poor, lonely, 
               scared shitless Pip.

               The Chinese players wait for Pip to throw the ball.

                                     CHINESE PLAYER #1

               Chef looks around sadly at his beaten little players.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh what have I done?

               Cartman pulls up a seat next to Chef and starts eating a 
               tootie bar.

                                     CHEF
                         You know, Eric... I just realized 
                         something. I've been obsessed. And 
                         obsession isn't good.

               Cartman looks at Chef, smacking his lips.

                                     CHEF
                         If we had won the world 
                         championship... What then? It would 
                         only be a bigger let down the next 
                         year if we DIDN'T win.

               Cartman says nothing.

                                     CHEF
                         Our lives would have to revolve around 
                         dodgeball... Our lives were fine 
                         before.

               Cartman scratches his ass and farts.

               Meanwhile, little Kevin quietly walks over to the Chinese 
               team.

               Chef stands up and addresses his beaten players.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, I'm sorry children. I let it all 
                         go to my head. Can you ever forgive 
                         me? Come on, forget this stupid game. 
                         Let's go home!

               On the field, Pip is standing with the ball facing the 
               plethora of Chinese players. Pip still looks extremely 
               nervous.

                                     CHINESE PLAYER #1
                         COME ON THROW BALL!!

               Kevin walks up to the Chinese player and whispers in his 
               ear.

                                     KEVIN
                         Hey, if you want to make him throw 
                         the ball, say this.

               Kevin hands the Chinese a piece of paper.

                                     CHINESE PLAYER #1
                         Thanks. You American dumb ass.

               Kevin walks away.

                                     CHINESE PLAYER #1
                              (reading)
                         YOU FRENCH PIECE OF CRAP! THROW BALL!!

               Pip's eyebrows raise.

                                     CHINESE PLAYER #1
                         WHAT'S MATTER FRENCHY?! YOU GOT CREPES 
                         IN YOUR EARS?!

               The Chinese players all laugh. Pip turns red and starts to 
               shake. Another Chinese player grabs the piece of paper and 
               reads off of it.

                                     PIP
                         AAAAAAGHGHGHGHGH!!!!!!!!!

               Pip spins around and around. He becomes like a starburst of 
               energy.

               The Chinese kids look nervous, as Pip let's the ball fly. It 
               bounces around the entire gym, knocking down every Chink in 
               its path.

               The Chinese kids all scream in pain and fall to the ground.

               As Pip's violent fury ends, not a single China player is 
               standing.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         AND WINNER IS SOUTH PARK COWS!!

               The kids all moan.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, shut up pip. Can we go home 
                         now?

                                     PIP
                         Did you all see? I can't believe I 
                         threw such a ball with my own arm.

                                         EPILOGUE

               The Mayor's voice chimes out from the P.A.

                                     MAYOR
                         As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia 
                         Awareness week draws to a close, I 
                         would like to personally thank all 
                         of you for your enthusiastic 
                         cooperation. Now let's hear it ONE 
                         MORE time for our WORLD CHAMPION 
                         South Park Cows!!!

               The townspeople cheer with fetuses attached to their heads.

               The boys, all still bandaged and bruised look confused.

                                     KYLE
                         What the hell is everybody wearing 
                         on their heads?

               Stan shrugs.

                                     MAYOR
                         And now let's hear from the woman of 
                         the week! The incredible, courageous 
                         NURSE GOLLEM!!!!!

               The townspeople all cheer again as Nurse Gollem takes the 
               stage.

                                     KYLE
                         AAAGHHH!!!

                                     STAN
                         DUDE IT'S THE FREAK NURSE!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         HOLY CRAP!!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all 
                         WEEK against that kind of behavior!!

                                     KYLE
                         Well, sorry, dude, we weren't here.

               Nurse Gollem takes the stand.

                                     NURSE
                         Thank you, Mayor... I, uh... I don't 
                         know what to say, this has been quite 
                         a week.

               Kyle's mom wipes a tear from her eye.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         She's really touched.

                                     NURSE
                         What I really want to say is... Well, 
                         this may sound odd coming from a 
                         woman with a fetus sticking out of 
                         her head, but you're all a bunch of 
                         freaks.

               Everyone looks surprised.

                                     MAYOR
                         Uh... freaks with big hearts. And 
                         now --

                                     NURSE
                         Don't you realize that the last thing 
                         I ever wanted was to be singled out? 
                         I just wanted to do my job and live 
                         my life like any normal person, but 
                         instead you've made everybody focus 
                         on my handicap all week long.

               Everyone looks at each other.

                                     NURSE
                         Look, I don't want to be treated 
                         different. I don't want to be treated 
                         special. Or treated gingerly. I just 
                         want to be ridiculed, shouted at and 
                         made fun of, like all the rest of 
                         you do to each other. And take those 
                         stupid things off your heads.

               Nurse Gollem walks away, leaving the whole town to sit in 
               silence with their fetus masks.

               Just keep cutting to different groups of people, all of whom 
               feel ridiculous and have nothing to say.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Oh my, what an ungrateful bitch.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Yeah, the nerve of some people.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey! You know that nurse is actually 
                         pretty cool!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes 
                         her smarter.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I love you guys... Oh screw you guys!

                                         THE END
