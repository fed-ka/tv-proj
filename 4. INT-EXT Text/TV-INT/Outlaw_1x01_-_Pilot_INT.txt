  Morning light streams in REVEALING two lovers, naked in 
  bed... high-heeled boots and a thong on the floor... bottle 
  of WINE on the nightstand.  Signs of passion, but now, rest.

  The ALARM sounds --  Rough Justice  by THE ROLLING STONES -- 
  the Man stirs, turns it off and sits up.  Meet our hero, 
  CYRUS GARZA, 45.  He looks at the GORGEOUS BRUNETTE, with her 
  sexilly placed tattoos, asleep next to him.  He smiles at the 
  pleasant memory, then --

  -- he s getting dressed, pulling on jeans and a  Lee Atwater 
  Blues Band  T-shirt.

                              GORGEOUS BRUNETTE (V.O.)
                Stay.

  He turns, sees she s just waking.

                              GARZA
                I wish I could.  But I m already late. 
                I ll call you.

                              GORGEOUS BRUNETTE
                      (knows him better than that)
                No you won t.

  Dammit, she looks even better than she did last night.

                              GARZA
                Hell, what good s a lifetime appointment 
                if you can t enjoy your life?

  As he falls back into bed with her --


  Garza zips through traffic, talking on the PHONE.

                              GARZA
                I m going to the Wizards game tonight.  
                What s the over-under?  Okay, gimme the 
                under.
                      (beat, then skeptical)
                The Cavs are your stone-cold lock?  With 
                Shaq eating his way out of the league?
                                (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                              GARZA (CONT'D)
                      (beat)
                It s regardless.  Regardless of how fat 
                he is.  Irregardless is not a word, but 
                  double-or-nothing is.  I m in.  I gotta 
                go.  I m pulling into the office.

  He looks out the window and we REVEAL: The Supreme Court. 

                              GARZA (PRELAP) (CONT D)
                Stop right there --  


  No jeans.  No naked women.  It s the highest court in the land.  
  Nine judges wrestling with the biggest issues of the day.  Garza 
  is one of them, up on the bench, tearing into an earnest Lawyer.  

                              GARZA
                -- we ve all read your brief, and I can t 
                speak for my colleagues, though God knows 
                I wish I could, but your argument against 
                handgun possession is ludicrous.  You re 
                  basically asking us to bend the rules 
                because your client doesn t like them.  
                Well, guess what?  There are a lot of 
                rules I don t like either.  Like no 
                  splitting aces in Black Jack, terrible 
                rule.  Or the designated hitter.  Ruined 
                  baseball.  Or what about taxes?  I don t 
                like those.  According to your argument I 
                  shouldn t have to pay them. 
                      (over the lawyer s fumfering)
                I m sorry, but it s not the role of this 
                Court to pronounce the Second Amendment 
                extinct.  You gotta give us something 
                based on what s actually in the 
                  Constitution, not what you wish was in 
                there.  I hope for your client s sake you 
                have that.  

  The Lawyer stands there, mute.  He s got nothing.  Off Garza, 
  one of the most powerful guys in the country --


  The Wizards play the Celtics.  In the stands FIND Garza and 
  his DAD, 70, in a Celtics JACKET, on the way to their seats.

                              DAD
                See the way they look at you?  It s cuz 
                they don t like you.  You re not for the 
                little guy. 
                      (to a random fan)
                                (MORE)                                                                                      3.

                              DAD (CONT'D)
                My son the Supreme Court Justice, last 
                game he came to, he sat in a fancy-
                schmancy box with his pal Dick Cheney and 
                plotted the end of the world.

                              GARZA
                Actually we talked about girls.  

                              DAD
                Who?  His gay daughter who neither of you 
                think has the right to get married?  

                              GARZA
                Dad, can we just enjoy the game?

  As they take their seats, Dad turns to the Man next to him:

                              DAD
                Watch out.  He s pro-torture.


    Headlights from passing cars illuminate Garza and his Dad, 
  who is driving them home from the game.   

                              GARZA
                All I m saying is you don t have to pick 
                a fight with everyone. 

                              DAD
                I do when they tell me they don t believe 
                in global warming.  I know, you don t 
                believe in it either, but you re a 
                schmuck.

  Garza sees a car nosing into the road near the top of an 
  oncoming hill.  A warning:

                              GARZA
                Dad --

                              DAD
                I see him --                                                                                      4.


  The CAR LURCHES into the road.  Garza s dad swerves into 
  oncoming traffic to avoid it as HEADLIGHTS from a truck RISE 
  UP over the HILL directly in front of them.

                              GARZA
                DAD!

  The father STOMPS on the BRAKE.  We BLACK OUT and there is 
  the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.  


  Pews full of mourners.  An open CASKET laid in front as a 
  MINISTER delivers a eulogy MOS.  Garza sits in the first row, 
  deep in his own thoughts.  Behind him sits his oldest friend, 
  AL DRUZINSKY, 45.  As Al puts a comforting hand on Garza s 
  shoulder, we DISSOLVE TO: 


  CHYRON: 18 MONTHS LATER.  We re CLOSE ON the peaceful face of 
  GREG BEALS, who has lived more than a third of his 30 years 
  on death row.

                              BEALS
                Promise me something.

  REVERSE onto JEWELL WILLIAMS, Greg s fiancee.  Never missed a 
    visitation in eleven years.

                              BEALS (CONT D)
                Promise that you ll move on.  The girls 
                need a man in the house.

  He puts his hand to the PLEXIGLASS separating them.  Jewell 
  mirrors his hand with hers.

                                JEWELL
                Marry me.

  Before Beals can respond, his attorney enters.  It s Al -- a 
  bleeding heart, hopeless optimist and true believer. 

                              AL
                Okay.  It s not over.

                                JEWELL
                The Governor said no?

                              AL
                The Governor s an idiot. 

  Jewell looks back to Beals.  They ve been through so much.  
  This can t possibly be the end.                                                                                        5.


                              BEALS
                It s alright. 

                                JEWELL
                No, it s not.  There s nothing remotely 
                alright about this.  Here. 

  She hands Al an ENVELOPE, as Al opens it -- CASH. 

                                JEWELL (CONT D)
                It s not close to what we owe, but it s 
                all that s left.  Maybe it ll buy a 
                miracle, cause I m out of prayers.

                              AL
                Good, cause I m an atheist.  And keep this.  
                At least until we ve won.  Which we re 
                going to.  I just filed a request for a 
                stay with the Supreme Court.  It s a Hail 
                Mary, but we ve got the truth on our side, 
                and that s better than any prayer. 

  Off Al s pep-talk, we HEAR the DINGING of SLOT MACHINES.

                              GARZA (PRELAP)
                Bless me father, for I need a four.


  Garza, the life of the party, plays all seven hands at a 
  raucous blackjack table. He s flanked by beautiful women.  
  The DEALER hits his 17, gives him 21.  Garza cracks his 
  megawatt smile.  Waves the dealer off each of his hands.

                              GARZA
                Res.  Ipsa.  Liquitor.  Speaks.  For. 
                Itself.
                      (the Dealer reveals her card)
                Be kind. I m a poor public servant.

  The Dealer hits.  Busts.  Garza high fives the CHEERING crowd. 

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                And people say there s no justice.

  As Garza rakes in his chips, MERETA STOCKMAN, 30 -- a romantic 
  in a prim, proper and pretty package -- approaches the PIT 
  BOSS.  Mereta is Garza s law clerk.  He is her sun and stars.    

                                MERETA
                See that gentleman over there?  The one 
                with the... well, the really nice smile.                                                                                       6.


                              PIT BOSS
                Dimple Guy?

                                MERETA
                Dimple Guy.  Exactly.

  She snags a drink from a cocktail waitress.  Takes the swig 
  of unrequited love.

                                MERETA (CONT D)
                It s not enough that he sits on the 
                Supreme Court, or that he was a Rhodes 
                Scholar, or that he rescues dogs.  No.  
                On top of all that -- dimples.

                              PIT BOSS
                You got something I should know about 
                Prince Charming or not?


  The Pit Boss and his MUSCLE hustle Garza toward the exit.  
  Mereta hurries to keep up.

                              GARZA
                Counting cards is legal.  In Uston v. 
                Resorts International the Jersey Supreme 
                Court affirmed five to four.

                              PIT BOSS
                And the Jersey Bouncers just de-firmed 
                two zip.  

  Pit Boss and Muscle release Garza.  As they head off:

                              PIT BOSS (CONT D)
                He s on the Supreme Court?  No wonder the 
                  country s going down the crapper -- 

                              GARZA
                Last I checked, Mereta, you were a law 
                clerk, not a nurse maid.  That was a six 
                deck shoe I was beating.  No one beats a 
                six deck shoe.

  Mereta hands him a FOLDER.

                                MERETA
                Habeas petition from Greensville.  
                  Execution is scheduled in two days.  The 
                justices who weren t doubling down have 
                given their opinions.  It s four-four.  
                Gregory Beals  life is in your hands --                                                                                      7.



  An old rambling place decorated in Americana.  Books, briefs 
  and articles everywhere.  And on the couch beneath a stuffed 
  Bison head lies the sleeping PROTESTER.  Bathed in a narrow 
  band of light from an open door.  We follow the light into... 


  ... where Garza, at his ridiculously cluttered desk, his 
  rescue MUTT at his feet, watches DOCUMENTARY footage on his 
  DESKTOP.  Images of his DAD... marching alongside Robert 
    Kennedy... Cesar Chavez... orating... on courthouse steps... 

                              NARRATOR
                ...it was Garza s core values of love and 
                  compassion that led him to fight for a 
                minimum wage, better working conditions 
                and voting rights...  

  ....a lump in his throat, the son takes a sip of his Scotch, 
  PAUSES the film on the IMAGE of his old man.  The Protester 
  was right -- Dad would be disgusted.  The mutt watches as 
  Garza crosses to a legal BOX labelled BEALS, pulls out a 
  thick BRIEF, and as he settles in for a read...


  LUCINDA PEARL, 29, sits on a couch wearing a black leather 
  jacket, black boots, and a  Boys Are Stupid Throw Rocks at 
  Them  T-shirt.

                              EDDIE (O.S.)
                Can I help you?

  EDDIE FRANKS, 26, is Lucinda s opposite: A short, tightly 
  wound Brooks Brothers conservative.  She gives him a once-
  over, blows a huge bubble.  Pops it.

                              EDDIE (CONT D)
                I m Eddie Franks.  I clerk for Justice 
                Garza.

                              LUCINDA
                I don t want to be your lover.

                              EDDIE
                I m sorry.  What did you say?                                                                                    10.


                              LUCINDA
                You want to get in my pants, don t you?

                              EDDIE
                Uh, not really.  No.

                              LUCINDA
                Good.  Because I don t sleep with people 
                I work with.

  Before Eddie can respond, Garza enters -- 

                              GARZA
                Lucinda, excellent.  Come on in.  I see 
                you ve already met Eddie. 

  Lucinda POPS another bubble.  On Eddie, utterly confused:


  Lucinda and Eddie watch as Garza pours himself a drink.

                              GARZA
                Okay, tell me what you ve got.

                              LUCINDA
                Haldol.  The prison doctor pumped him 
                full of it.

                              EDDIE
                Pumped who?  What are we talking about?

                              GARZA
                Greg Beals.  I asked Lucinda to do some 
                  research.

                              EDDIE
                  Research?  I thought you d already 
                decided.  His execution is tomorrow.

                              GARZA
                Exactly.  So make it quick.  Haldol -- 
                why should I care?

                              LUCINDA
                You ever been on it?  Turns you into a 
                zombie.  Which is what Beals looked like 
                in that court room.  The DA even referred 
                to, and I quote,  his insensitive, 
                  remorseless face .

                              GARZA
                The DA tell the jury why he looked so 
                whacked out?                                                                                      11.


                              LUCINDA
                Nope.  Didn t say a word.  

                              EDDIE
                If no one said a word, how do you know he 
                was drugged?  

                              LUCINDA
                I hacked into the county jail logs.

                              EDDIE
                You did what?

                              LUCINDA
                Relax, Harvard.  They re public records.  
                I m not telling you anything you don t 
                have the legal right to know.  They doped 
                the guy.

  Mereta enters, NOTE PAD in hand.  

                                MERETA
                -- the nerve of some people.  Oh, am I 
                  interrupting?

                              EDDIE
                It s okay.  We were just getting tips on 
                breaking and entering.  The legal version.  
                And by they way, I went to Yale.

                              LUCINDA
                I know.

                              GARZA
                What is it, Mereta?

                                MERETA
                Politico called.  They re running an 
                absurd story alleging you have half a 
                million dollars in gambling debts and 
                saying this is another example of why 
                you re unfit for the job.  They want to 
                know if you d like to comment. 

                              LUCINDA
                Did they mention the affair with the 
                  Brazilian Ambassador s wife?

                              GARZA
                Okay, first of all, she didn t speak 
                English, so I had no idea who she was.  
                And second, how did you know about that?                                                                                    12.


                              LUCINDA
                I never removed the bug I put on your 
                phone during the hearings.  Get over it.

                              EDDIE
                Okay, who is she?

                              LUCINDA
                She is a private investigator. 

                              GARZA
                  Judiciary hired Lucinda to do oppo 
                research on me during my confirmation 
                hearing.  She worked alone and found 
                out... well, let s just say various 
                tidbits, all of which, thankfully, eluded 
                the Dems army of investigators.  And now 
                she seems to have found a few tidbits in 
                Beals that eluded us. 

                              EDDIE
                Justice, you re actually considering 
                granting him a new trial?

                              GARZA
                The prosecutor broke the law. 

                              EDDIE
                Even if that s true, and judging by 
                  Lucinda s in depth knowledge of illicit 
                drugs I doubt it, it doesn t matter. 

                                MERETA
                It does if it raises questions about his 
                actual innocence.  

                              EDDIE
                If there was misconduct, the defense had 
                eleven years to find out.  They didn t.  
                Just because Beals only has three meals 
                left, doesn t mean you get to change the 
                rules to give them another chance.  

  Under this, Garza grabs a DECK of cards.

                              GARZA
                Five bucks says I can cut the ace of 
                spades.  One cut.  No looking.

                              LUCINDA
                I prefer strip poker, but I m in.

                              GARZA
                Security says you re carrying.  May I?                                                                                    13.


  Lucinda pulls a KNIFE from her boot, off which Mereta shoots 
  Eddie an  oh my god  look.  Garza takes the KNIFE, slices 
  through the deck, finds the ace of spades  cut  in half.

                              EDDIE
                Great.  Fantastic.  Now we know how you 
                got lunch money in 6th grade.  

                              GARZA
                  I followed the rules.  Doesn t always 
                lead to justice.  Even if it s been 
                eleven years.  Beals deserves another 
                trial.  Mereta, I ll need a draft of the 
                opinion by six.  

                                MERETA
                What about Politico?  

                              GARZA
                Tell them I d join Gamblers Anonymous but 
                then I d have to stop gambling.  Great 
                work, Lucinda.

                              LUCINDA
                      (to Eddie)
                And you thought I was just hot.


  Garza exits the elevator, his keys already out.  He presses 
   unlock , and the lights of his Porsche flash.  Before he 
  gets to it a LIMO pulls up.  A tinted rear window rolls down 
  to REVEAL silver-haired SENATOR SIDNEY VIDALIN, 50s.

                                SIDNEY
                Get in.


  Garza joins Sidney in the back seat.  Sidney fumes, a rolled 
  up DOCUMENT in his fist.  

                              GARZA
                Had I known you were taking me to the 
                prom, I would ve brought you a corsage.

                                SIDNEY
                Do I look like I m in the mood for your 
                moronic jokes?

                              GARZA
                No, in fact I think there s actual steam 
                coming out of your ears.                                                                                    14.


                                SIDNEY
                Anderson v. Lynton Tobacco.  Frankel v. 
                  Portland.  Manilow v. Three M.  All five-
                four decisions.  Five-four.  These are 
                  precedent setting cases and they all went 
                south.  Because of you.  
                      (re: DOCUMENT)
                And now I have to read this telenovela 
                you call an opinion on Beals?  Are you 
                kidding me? Who the hell do you think you 
                are?  Going soft on the death penalty? 
                What happened to your principles?  You re 
                a judge who follows the Constitution to 
                the letter.  You don t make it up as you 
                go along.
                      (Garza smiles in disbelief)
                You think this is funny?  We didn t pick 
                you because of your  legendary genius  or 
                your toothy smile.  They might work with 
                a cute protester up in Atlantic City, but 
                in the big leagues you re a dime-a-dozen, 
                    a means-to-an-end, a cog in the wheel.

                              GARZA
                You re mixing your metaphors, but I get 
                your gist. 

                                SIDNEY
                Good.  So get your ass back upstairs and 
                make this thing right.

  Sidney hands the DOCUMENT to Garza.

                              GARZA
                It is right.

                                SIDNEY
                Look, if this new direction of yours is 
                about your dad s death, see a therapist.  
                If it s a mid-life crisis, screw your 
                  secretary.  But don t shift the god damn 
                balance of the Supreme Court.  We put you 
                in there, we can take you out.

                              GARZA
                You make it sound like you re gonna hire 
                  a hitman.

                                SIDNEY
                We re gonna impeach you.  And don t think 
                we can t do it. Section 1, Article 3: 
                justices shall hold their offices during 
                good behavior.  Who are we kidding?  That 
                rules you out.
                                (MORE)                                                                                    15.

                                SIDNEY (CONT'D)
                      (on INTERCOM, to the driver)
                Pull over.
                      (then)
                Who do you think leaked that story to 
                  Politico?  You re at the tipping point 
                here, Cyrus.  You don t vote the right 
                way on Beals, you are out. 


  Garza puts on his ROBE as we HEAR:

                              GARZA (V.O.)
                Gregory Beals is scheduled to be executed 
                today by the state of Virginia...


  Garza takes his seat on the bench alongside his Colleagues.  
  He scans the gallery, locks eyes with... Sidney.

                              GARZA (V.O.)
                There are those who d say that granting 
                him yet another trial is a fool s errand 
                which serves no purpose except to cause 
                chaos by delaying the wheels of justice.  
                There was a time when I would have said 
                those people are right... 


  Garza reads from his OPINION, which is what we have been 
  hearing him narrate.

                              GARZA
                But it seems to me now that chaos is a 
                fair price to pay for the life of another 
                human being...  

  ANGLE ON AL, seated in the gallery next to Jewell.                                                                                    18.


                              GARZA (CONT D)
                And that s why I am staying the execution 
                of Gregory Beals and sending the case 
                back for a new trial.

  Jewell hugs Al, as Garza sets his OPINION aside.  No longer 
  reading.  Talking from the heart:

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                I love this Court.  It s cautious respect 
                for precedent and neutrality has at times 
                saved our country.  But I came here a 
                  different judge, a different man.  I used 
                to be satisfied being cautious and 
                neutral.  Being Switzerland.  I m not 
                anymore.  The job of a justice is to 
                preserve the status quo.  Today I am 
                  announcing my resignation from the Court 
                because I am ready to change it.

  A beat of silence.  No one expected this.  Garza looks out to 
  where Sidney was sitting.  He s gone.  The gallery reacts, 
  and as we HOLD ON Garza, we,


  Garza looks out his window at the TV crews that have 
  gathered.  He s the star of this news cycle.  He turns away, 
  his eyes landing on a PHOTO -- a young Garza in a Boston 
  Celtics jersey standing next to his father -- when his CELL 
  RINGS.  He checks caller ID, then:

                              GARZA
                Admit it, you miss me already.


  Sidney in the backseat, on the phone.

                                SIDNEY
                You pissed off a lot of people today.

                              GARZA
                Yeah, and it feels pretty good. 

                                SIDNEY
                Enjoy it because by tomorrow, you re 
                gonna be the most hated man in America.
                You re on your own, pal.  I suggest you 
                get a bodyguard.

  Sidney hangs up.  ON Garza, alone with his father -- 

                                      END ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO


  CLAIRE SAX, 40s,  wife of , senior partner in a K Street 
  firm, looks out at the protestors as --

                                CLAIRE SAX
                The Left hated you when you joined the 
                Court. The Right hates you when you leave.  

  Garza is behind her, packing up photos and awards.

                              GARZA
                  Controversy is never bad for business, 
                but if you don t think my name will look 
                good on your firm s masthead I can find 
                someone who does.

                                CLAIRE SAX
                And this is strictly business?

                              GARZA
                  I thought so, but if you want to throw in 
                some incidentals...

                                CLAIRE SAX
                I don t.  

                              GARZA
                Then, yes, it s strictly business.  

                                CLAIRE SAX
                I can t believe I m even considering this 
                but what s your proposal?

                              GARZA
                Your firm gets my name on the door and I 
                get the same salary as you.

                                CLAIRE SAX
                You really think you re worth that?

                              GARZA
                No, but I know you do.  Oh, one other 
                thing -- I pick my cases and my team.                                                                                    20.


  Off him smiling, knowing she can t resist, we go to:


    Everything Garza s place isn t -- a picture of domesticity.  
  Al and Garza set the table at which WILLA, 16 and surly, does 
  her homework.  

                              AL 
                  I already have a job.

                              GARZA
                The firm s given me carte blanche.  We 
                can parachute in all over the country -- 

  LUCA, 6, races through, without stopping:

                              LUCA
                -- Dad, Benny hit me for no reason!

                              AL
                      (calling out)
                Ben, don t hit your brother!

                              GARZA
                We ll go wherever the action is.  In 
                  California, it s gay marriage.  In 
                Montana, euthanasia.  Connecticut, 
                  affirmative action.

                              WILLA
                Didn t you vote against all those things?

                              AL
                Don t you have a desk upstairs where you 
                can do your homework?

  Willa scowls, starts gathering her books as: 

                              AL (CONT D)
                Look, it all sounds very tempting.  But 
                thanks to you I m preparing for a little 
                trial called Beals.  

                              GARZA
                Yeah, about that.  I d like Beals to be 
                our first case.  

                              AL
                You were his judge, now you re gonna be 
                his lawyer?  Did you want to leave the 
                bench or get disbarred?

  Before Willa exits, to Garza --                                                                                     21.


                              WILLA
                Fascist.

                              GARZA
                It s completely legal and I need you. 
                I ve heard the best lawyers in the 
                country argue every day for the past ten 
                years.  None of them was as good as you.  
                Not to mention the fact that I trust you, 
                even though you ve raised your daughter 
                to think I m Mussolini. 

                              AL
                You should hear her mother.  Look, you 
                really want to do this?

                              GARZA
                You know better than anyone that our 
                whole legal system is based on making 
                sure someone gets a fair trial.  That s 
                why everyone s guaranteed a defense -- to 
                protect that one innocent person that s 
                been falsely accused.  Greg Beals might 
                be that person.  So yes, I want to do 
                this.  The only question is, do you? 


  Garza and Al sit across from CLARK HOGAN, 40s, earnest and 
    appealing.  Next to him is D.A. MANLEY FREED, 50s, neither 
  earnest nor appealing.  Clark looks directly at Garza:

                              CLARK HOGAN
                You ever been in love?                                                                                    25.


  A wave of surprise and discomfort ripples across Garza s 
  face.  He s never been in love.  Bailing Garza out -- 

                              AL
                I have.  Married 15 years.  

                              CLARK HOGAN
                Pam and I only got two, but she was my 
                life.  We were going to grow old 
                  together, take care of each other... I 
                still wake up every morning hoping to 
                find her next to me.  

                              GARZA
                Mr. Hogan, the DA just told us you re 
                thinking about asking the judge to 
                commute Mr. Beals  sentence to life.

                              CLARK HOGAN
                If it means preventing another trial.  

                              AL
                You don t want to relive it, huh?  

                              CLARK HOGAN
                I can t.  All those details, the what-
                if s...  I d worked vice, I knew how 
                  dangerous it was...

                              D.A. FREED
                Clark and his wife were on the force 
                  together.  

                              GARZA
                I can t imagine the suffering you ve 
                endured and I wouldn t ask you to revisit 
                any of it if I didn t believe that Mr. 
                Beals is innocent.

                              CLARK HOGAN
                You have proof of that?  I mean, if Beals 
                didn t do it, who did?  

                              GARZA
                We don t know, but --

                              CLARK HOGAN
                You don t know?  Then what are you doing 
                here?  You re a Supreme Court Justice, or 
                you were until you lost your mind --

                              D.A. FREED
                Clark --                                                                                    26.


                              CLARK HOGAN
                No, what the hell are they doing here? 
                My wife was murdered.  There was an 
                  eyewitness who saw Beals pull the trigger--

                              GARZA
                Actually we have some questions about 
                that witness.

                              D.A. FREED
                  Questions?  Isn t it a little late for that?

                              CLARK HOGAN
                You lawyers are all the same.  This is 
                just a game to you.  You don t care about 
                the truth.  All you care about is 
                winning.  You make me sick.  

                              D.A. FREED
                Okay look, stirring all this up is 
                exactly what Clark wants to avoid.  We re 
                offering Beals life in prison --

                              CLARK HOGAN
                -- which is more than he deserves.   

                              D.A. FREED
                And since this case has dragged on long 
                enough, tell him he s got twenty-four 
                hours to decide.


  Garza and Al on one side of the glass.  Beals on the other.  

                              BEALS
                They want me to plead guilty?

                              GARZA
                We could say no and go to trial, but if 
                we do that and lose -- 

                              AL
                -- which is a real possibility.  The jury 
                  deliberated all of thirty-six minutes 
                before coming back unanimously against 
                you.  Plus which, we ve lost three 
                appeals since.

                              BEALS
                That s before I had a Supreme Court 
                Justice for my lawyer.                                                                                      27.


                              AL
                If we had DNA evidence, maybe.  But we 
                don t.  

                              GARZA
                No, but we do have a great team and we re 
                  challenging the forensics and the 
                  eyewitness testimony. 

                              AL
                If you lose you ll be executed.  They re 
                giving you a chance to save your life.   

                              BEALS
                Justice Garza, you re the only reason I m 
                still here.  Tell me what to do, and I ll 
                do it.

  Garza considers this. It s hard.  A man s life is on the line. 

                              GARZA
                You know, most people think being on the 
                Supreme Court is about looking for the 
                truth.  But the truth is, that s rarely 
                what it s about.  Which is why I left.  
                This is your life, Mr. Beals.  I can t 
                decide this for you.  But if it were me, 
                  I couldn t say that I d killed someone, 
                if I hadn t.  If it wasn t the truth.

                              BEALS
                I didn t kill anyone.

                              GARZA
                Then there s your answer. 

  Off Beals, willing to follow Garza s lead --

                              JUDGE DENNER (PRELAP)
                I want the lawyers to approach.


  Garza, Al and D.A. Freed approach JUDGE RICHARD DENNER.  Fat 
  body, wise mind.  Holds Garza in high regard.  Or did.

                              GARZA
                Hey Dick, how you doing?  How s Martha?

                              JUDGE DENNER
                She s fine.  But I m a little concerned 
                about you.                                                                                      28.


                              GARZA
                About my resignation?  You should be 
                  thrilled.  You re probably on the short 
                list to replace me.  If they ask, I 
                promise I won t say anything about our 
                night in Vegas.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                I was talking about this case.  Did you 
                really have your client reject a plea to 
                commute his sentence to life?

                              GARZA
                He s innocent.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                Not in this court, he s not.  At trial 
                the state met its burden.  Your client is 
                presumed guilty.  The burden is on you to 
                convince me he s not.

                              GARZA
                Yeah, I m pretty clear on how that works.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                I hope you re equally clear that this 
                  courtroom will not be used as a soap box 
                for your sudden disregard for the justice 
                system.

                              GARZA
                I m not on a soap box.  My client didn t 
                get a fair trial.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                So you bent the rules to give him another 
                one, opening the flood gates in every 
                district court for endless re-litigation.  
                This could bring the system down.

                              GARZA
                You can t put the system before a man s 
                life.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                Damn right I can.  That s what a judge is 
                supposed to do.  

                              AL
                Excuse me, your honor.  But is the offer 
                still available?

                              D.A. FREED
                For another six hours it is.                                                                                    29.


                              AL
                  A moment?
                      (pulls Garza aside, tough)
                I know you left the Court to hit home 
                runs.  And that this offer might feel 
                like a double.  But to Beals it means 
                getting to grow old, to see his kids grow 
                up.  So before you turn down the offer 
                again, try and remember this is about his 
                life, not yours.    

  Garza looks at Beals and Jewell, who sits behind him in the 
  gallery.  Then to the Judge:

                              GARZA
                We re going to trial.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                I hope you know what you re doing, Cyrus.

  He waves them off.  Al and Garza step back towards Beals as -- 

                              AL
                One thing I disagreed with your dad about 
                was that you were a schmuck.  But it 
                looks like he was right about that, too. 

  And with that Al walks out of the courtroom.  On Garza, 
  stung, we --

                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                    30.


                                      ACT THREE


  Mereta paces, pulls out her notepad and CELL, dials as  --

                                MERETA
                She told me she d be here at six.  Maybe 
                she got stuck in traffic.

  -- Garza studies a  Universal Pain Assessment Chart  (the one 
  with smiley faces ranked 1 thru 10).  Sotto:

                              GARZA
                I d say we re at a solid four.

                                MERETA
                Hi, I m calling for Dr. Moore...  
                  Vacation?  Are you sure?  Felicia Moore? 
                The shrink? 

                              GARZA
                And we re at five...

                                MERETA
                I spoke with her earlier today.  She 
                  confirmed that the eyewitness recanted 
                his testimony.
                      (then to the phone)
                No, I don t want another doctor.  By any 
                chance did she leave a forwarding number?   

                              GARZA
                Forget it.  

                                MERETA
                      (ignoring him, into the phone)
                What?  She didn t mention a vacation.  

  Garza takes the phone from her.   

                                MERETA (CONT D)
                What are you doing?

                              GARZA
                The D.A. got to her.

                                MERETA
                But she was our case.

                              GARZA
                Which is why we re now at a 10.                                                                                    33.


                                MERETA
                What?

                              GARZA
                  Nevermind.  Look, I should ve told you to 
                sit on her.  I forgot how rough the game 
                is played.   C mon.  Let s go.  

  Garza heads out.  Mereta starts to follow when she sees the 
  pain chart.  Under 10 she reads  worst possible pain .  Off 
  Mereta s pained face:


  Garza pulls two BEERS from the fridge, hands one to Mereta.

                                MERETA
                Why did you hire me?  I mean, I know you 
                hired Eddie because he was number one in 
                his class.

                              GARZA
                I hired Eddie because he s smarter than 
                me.  I hired you, because you re prettier.  

                                MERETA
                Okay, you broke like ten laws just now.  

                              GARZA
                Fine. You re not pretty.  But as a 
                liberal elitist you believe in 
                  affirmative action for race and gender, 
                right?  So why not for high cheekbones?

                                MERETA
                I was in the top of my class.

                              GARZA
                You were seventh.  The other six applied.

                                MERETA
                Okay, well, since you clearly don t 
                respect me, maybe I should quit.

                              GARZA
                Most women would if they were you.  In my 
                  experience, women with your looks latch 
                onto rich men then spend their days 
                bitching because the contractor put the 
                wrong kind of marble in the master bath.  
                But you re here working your ass off which 
                  impresses the hell out of me.  Cheers.

  As he raises his BEER the DOORBELL RINGS.                                                                                      34.


                              GARZA (CONT D)
                That s Doc Levin.  My... herbalist.  

                                MERETA
                You have an herbalist?  Who makes house 
                calls?

                              GARZA
                Yeah.  I figured with all the changes in 
                my life, I could use a good cleanse.

  Garza takes a last swig, exits.  Off Mereta, curious -- 


  Garza shows in DOC LEVIN, a thick stump of a man. 

                              GARZA
                Look, Doc, I know I m due.

                              DOC LEVIN
                More like overdue.  You got an illness 
                here, and you didn t treat it.  Now we re 
                in a situation where you don t have much 
                time.

                              GARZA
                How long?

                              DOC LEVIN
                Are you gonna take it seriously?  

                              GARZA
                  Seriously?  This is one of the reasons I 
                left the court.

  To see an herbalist?  Sounds more like a conversation you 
  have with your oncologist.

                              DOC LEVIN
                So no ducking appointments?

                              GARZA
                No, no more ducking.  How long?

                              DOC LEVIN
                Best case scenario, six months.


  Mereta listens at the door, realizing why Garza left the 
  Court.  He only has six months to live.  And off this, we...

                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                    35.


                                        ACT FOUR


  Al races in, interrupting Lucinda and Eddie writing the brief.

                              AL
                I got the clerk to give us an extension -- 
                but only  til close of business.  Where s 
                Mereta?


  Mereta, on the phone.  The Mutt at her feet.

                                MERETA
                Nonono, please, Mr. Rains, don t hang up.  
                I just need five minutes --

  But clearly whoever she was talking to has hung up.  Mereta 
  sighs, defeated, when Al bursts in --                                                                                     39.


                              AL
                How fast can you write up some points and 
                  authorities?
                      (off Mereta)
                Are you crying? 

                                MERETA
                What?  No.  I was just... has Mr. Garza 
                told you why he left the Court?  

                              AL
                It was that or get impeached. 

                                MERETA
                I m serious.  You re his oldest friend.  
                Hasn t he said anything to you?

                              AL
                Yeah, that he left to make a difference.  
                Why do you ask?

                                MERETA
                ...I don t know... I just...

                              AL
                Did he say something to you?

                                MERETA
                What?  No.   It s just...  It s about the 
                case.   I mean, the only thing I ve 
                actually done is lose our star witness.  
                I can t even get someone who was at the 
                crime scene to give me five minutes on 
                the phone.

                              AL
                Who s that?

                                MERETA
                Simon Rains.  He was the crime scene 
                  technician.  Garza asked me to go through 
                the trial transcripts and I noticed he 
                was never called to the stand. I thought 
                that was weird.

                              AL
                You re right.  That is weird.

                                MERETA
                If he had evidence that supported the 
                  prosecution, they would ve had him testify, 
                right?  But maybe I m just being stupid.                                                                                    40.


                              AL
                You re not being stupid at all.  That s a 
                good lead.

                                MERETA
                It would be if he would talk to us. 


  Jewell absently fingers a MEDALLION around her neck as she 
  tracks Beals, being escorted by a Guard to Garza and Al at 
  the defense table.  Lucinda and Eddie watch Jewell and her 
  fiance exchange a loving gaze while Mereta watches Garza, 
    concerned.  The BAILIFF continues: 

                              BAILIFF
                In the case of Gregory Beals versus The 
                State of Virginia.  All having business 
                before this court draw near, and you 
                shall be heard. 

  The court room doors swing open.  Eddie turns, sees it s 
  Clark Hogan.  As Hogan finds a seat in the gallery:

                              EDDIE
                Poor guy.  Bad enough his wife s killed, 
                now he s gotta sit through this?

                              LUCINDA
                Exactly what the DA wants you to think.

  Garza moves to the lectern, notices a MAN in the gallery.  
  BUZZ CUT.  Windbreaker.  Nothing special about him except his 
  intense stare.  Garza takes a beat then turns to the Judge.

                              GARZA
                Gregory Beals is innocent.  For the past 
                eleven years he s been behind bars for a 
                crime he did not commit.  His children, 
                the woman he loves and his freedom have 
                been taken from him. The only thing he 
                has left is his innocence.  Today the 
                Defense will introduce new evidence that 
                proves -- 

                              JUDGE DENNER
                New evidence?  Justice Garza, you know 
                there is not a single case which allows you 
                to introduce new evidence on appeal.

                              GARZA
                Actually there s one, your honor.  This 
                case.  Beals.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    41.

                              GARZA (CONT'D)
                In Beals the Supreme Court held that the 
                  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty 
                Act does not prohibit the introduction of 
                new evidence on appeal when that evidence 
                can prove a defendant s actual innocence.

                              D.A. FREED
                Your honor, that s Justice Garza s opinion.

                              GARZA
                I was writing for the majority.

                              D.A. FREED
                Most of whom wrote opinions stating they 
                  disagreed with him on that point.  Not to 
                mention, that when Justice Garza wrote 
                that opinion he was clearly experiencing 
                a moment of personal crisis.

                              GARZA
                Excuse me?  I m not on trial here.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                -- Mr. Freed --

                              D.A. FREED
                I m just saying context is important if 
                you re going to consider using that 
                opinion to overturn every precedent and 
                  principle of jurisprudence.

                              GARZA
                What  principle of jurisprudence  is more 
                  important than the truth?

                              D.A. FREED
                Your honor, we re prepared to argue 
                  procedural issues -- judicial error, 
                faulty instructions to the jury -- 
                  questions Mr. Beals is legally entitled 
                to raise.  But the question of Mr. Beals  
                guilt was asked and answered years ago.

                              GARZA
                  Incorrectly.  The decision in Beals is 
                clear.  The system cannot be preserved at 
                the expense of an innocent man s life.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                Dammit, Cyrus.  I warned you not to bring 
                your soap box in here.                                                                                    42.



  Garza, Al, Eddie, Mereta and Lucinda huddle --

                              GARZA
                Eddie, I need you to research every 
                opinion Denner has issued from the bench. 
                If he won t listen to an opinion of mine, 
                maybe he ll listen to one of his own.  

  Jewell Williams approaches -- 

                                JEWELL
                What was that?  What just happened?

                              AL
                The judge refuses to hear new evidence.

                                JEWELL
                I don t understand.  It proves Greg s 
                innocent --

                              GARZA
                -- he says there are rules...

                                JEWELL
                Rules?  What rules?

                              GARZA
                  Technically you can t introduce new 
                evidence after a --

                                JEWELL
                -- and you didn t know that? 

                              GARZA
                I did, but --

                                JEWELL
                But what?   You told Greg not to take 
                that deal.  What am I gonna tell my 
                girls?  How am I gonna explain to them 
                that our own lawyer killed their father -- 

                                MERETA
                Killed him?  Okay, for your information, 
                Mr. Garza has six months to live and he s 
                spending them trying to save Greg s life.  
                      (to Garza)
                And don t try and deny it.  I overheard 
                you and Dr. Levin.                                                                                    43.


                              GARZA
                Okay, Jewell, listen to me: I know you re 
                scared, but it s not over.  Trust me.  
                But right now, I need a minute alone with 
                my team, can you give us that?  

                                JEWELL
                You were our last hope.

  The team watches as Jewell moves off, then:  

                                MERETA
                I know I shouldn t have eavesdropped, but 
                I m glad I did --

                              LUCINDA
                Me too!

                                MERETA
                -- because now we can focus on getting 
                you the help you need -- 

                              GARZA
                -- I think you misunder--

                                MERETA
                -- and on what really matters.  And for 
                me, that s you. 

                              EDDIE
                ... o-kay...

                                MERETA
                I love you.  I do.  And I don t care if 
                you re all hearing me say it.  Because 
                it s the truth.  

  All eyes on Garza who is, for the first time, at a loss. 

                              GARZA
                Uh...  wow....

                              LUCINDA
                Is it just me, or does it seem like the 
                feeling is totally not mutual?

  And on this incredibly awkward moment, we -- 

                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FIVE


  The whole team, including Mereta who s clearly still reeling, 
  eats pizza as Eddie enters, holding a CASE BOOK -- 

                              EDDIE
                I found a case.   Leeds v Gilbert .  In 
                it, Denner ruled that a case based on 
                  circumstantial theory falls apart if any 
                part of the theory is weak.  

                              GARZA
                What s the standard?

                              EDDIE
                  Reasonableness.

                              LUCINDA
                I ll tell you what s reasonable.  Me 
                being pissed off that the proof I found 
                is being ignored. 

                              GARZA
                Lucinda, what you and Eddie found, about 
                the time of death, is something that 
                Beals  original attorney reasonably 
                  should ve have discovered at trial.  

                              LUCINDA
                Yeah, if he hadn t slept through it.

                              GARZA
                But if we find something that was 
                  impossible to know at trial, then based 
                on Leeds we have a shot....  

                              AL
                Mereta s got something.

                              LUCINDA
                Besides a pathetic school girl crush?

                              GARZA
                Down tiger.

                                MERETA
                It s the crime tech on the case.  Simon 
                Rains.  He never testified.  I think he 
                knows something the prosecution doesn t 
                want us to find out.                                                                                    47.


                              AL
                Mereta and I pulled all the cases he s 
                worked.  He testified in every murder 
                except this one.     

                                MERETA
                It took us a while, but we finally 
                tracked him down.

                              GARZA
                And?

                              AL
                And he went out of his way to tell us 
                he s not protecting anyone.

                                MERETA
                And that -- 
                      (reading off her NOTEPAD)
                 You lawyers, cops, you re all the 
                same... You d turn on your best friend.   

                              LUCINDA
                He hates cops and lawyers. I kinda like 
                the guy.

                              GARZA
                So who is he protecting?  A best friend?  
                Maybe one of the other crime techs?  
                Was there another one at the scene?

                              EDDIE
                No.  But there was one at the lab.  She did 
                intake.  Catalogued and stored evidence.

                              GARZA
                What evidence?   I ve never heard of a 
                murder case with less evidence.  That s 
                one of the things that s been bugging me.  

                                MERETA
                You think it was stolen.

                              GARZA
                Eddie, you got a name for me?

  Off Garza, knowing they have a lead... PRELAP:

                                MERETA (PRELAP)
                Yes, I m calling for Rita Schmidt...                                                                                    48.



  High energy, boiler room feel.  Lucinda s on Facebook, 
  friending every  R. Schmidt .  Eddie, Al, Mereta and Garza 
  work the phone lists.  Into the PHONE:

                                MERETA
                ...I m with Blue Cross...  Are you sure? 

                              EDDIE
                Is this the Schmidt residence?  Yes, I 
                  represent the estate of Mr. Keith 
                  Schmidt... I have a bequest for a Rita 
                  Schmidt... no...?


  Less energy.  Empty coffee cups, soda cans.  Still on PHONES:


                      ALMERETA
  -- okay, but are you related -- yes, it looks like Rita s 
  to Rita Schmidt?   There s no subscription has expired... I 
  reason to get upset, ma am.   have this as R. Schmidt... 
      (to Garza)the R is for Roberta... oh, I 
  I think she just told me to apologize...
  screw myself in Greek.

                              EDDIE
                We ve Googled, we ve Facebooked.  I 
                didn t think you could disappear anymore.

                              GARZA
                Anything in the department s records?

                              LUCINDA
                Not since she quit in  99.  Two months 
                after the murder.


  No energy. Garza pops a beer, takes a deep swig.  Into PHONE:

                              GARZA
                Yes, hello.  This is Ross Barnes.  I m 
                calling from Oregon.  May I speak to Rita 
                Schmidt?  Yes, I know it s late, but it s 
                a family emergen-- 

  -- but the person has hung up.  Garza looks around the room.  
  Eddie, Mereta and the Mutt are asleep.  The phone list in his 
  hand: every name s crossed off.  Frustrated and tired, he 
  tosses the list.                                                                                      49.


  It LANDS ON HIS KEYBOARD, clearing his Oxford English 
  Dictonary screensaver to REVEAL HIS EMAIL account.  He stares 
  at it a beat, then nudges Eddie awake.  Energized --

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                I got it.

                              EDDIE
                Huh?  What?

                              GARZA
                We don t know how to find Rita Schmidt, 
                but maybe her ex-partner Simon does.  
                      (off the email screen)
                Odds are when we talk to him, he turns 
                around and talks to her.

                              EDDIE
                Yeah in a private, legally protected way.

                              GARZA
                U.S. Penal Code 634-point-8: Laws and 
                  regulations regarding wiretapping do not 
                apply to patently unlawful conversations.  
                I d say hiding a material witness 
                  qualifies as unlawful.

                              EDDIE
                Just out of curiosity, did you have to 
                look that up, or have you memorized the 
                entire penal code?

                              GARZA
                  Remember: 634-point-8.  In case you re 
                caught.  I m gonna go call Lucinda.

  As Garza head out -- 

                              EDDIE
                  Waitwaitwait.  Caught doing what?


  -- where Eddie watches Lucinda attach the wire to a small 
  digital RECORDER.  With mixed emotion:                                                                                    50.


                              EDDIE
                Esposito blew his dog whistle this 
                morning.  He got the okay to add a clerk.  
                I start Monday.

  Lucinda hits the  record  button on the RECORDER.  Takes out 
  her cell PHONE and dials.  Hands the phone to Eddie.

                              LUCINDA
                Go on, take it.  Give you one last story 
                to tell your Harvard buddies about your 
                week slumming it with the bad ass P.I.

  He smiles, amused, as SIMON RAINS picks up.

                              EDDIE
                Hello, Mr. Rains?  I m one of the lawyers 
                working on the Beals case.  Nonono, we 
                don t need your help.  We talked to 
                Rita...  Yeah, this morning.  She said 
                she d cooperate.  So, uh, just wanted to 
                let you know.  Thanks.

  He hangs up, gives Lucinda back the phone.  

                              LUCINDA
                Wow.  A natural born liar.  Who knew?

  TOUCH TONE BEEPS sound out from the recorder.  The number 
  dialed appears on the recorder s SCREEN.  Lucinda has tapped 
  the line.  She and Eddie listen in:

                                RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                First Baptist, how may I help you?

                              SIMON (V.O.)
                I need to talk to Rita Schmidt.

  Eddie looks at Lucinda.  This is so cool.  

                                RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                I m sorry, she s in a meeting right now. 
                May I take a message?

  Lucinda turns off the recorder.  Eyes the AREA CODE.  

                              LUCINDA
                215.  Looks like Garza s going to Philly.


  Garza enters, sees a WOMAN speaking with some parishioners.  
  He approaches, waits until she s free, then --                                                                                    51.


                              GARZA
                Seems like a great place to get married. 
                My fiancee and I are looking around.

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                It is.  It s a great place.

  RITA SCHMIDT, 30s, offers a peaceful smile.

                              GARZA
                That s what we ve been told... are you 
                the pastor?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                No.  I m his assistant.

                              GARZA
                Must be interesting work.  Have you 
                always done it?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                No...

                              GARZA
                Really?  What did you do before?  If you 
                don t mind my asking.

  She gives Garza a closer look, and her smile fades as she 
    recognizes him.  Her hopes of remaining hidden fading --

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                I was in law enforcement.

                              GARZA
                Around here?

  Beat.  There s no way around it.  She s been found.  So: 

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                I know who you are.  

                              GARZA
                I need to know what happened that night. 

  Off Rita, shedding a silent tear --

                                    END ACT FIVE                                                                                    52.


                                        ACT SIX


  Garza and Al and Beals sit opposite D.A. Freed and his team.  
  Eddie, Lucinda and Mereta are in the gallery, next to Jewell.  
  Behind the prosecutor sits Clark Hogan.  

                              JUDGE DENNER
                So I m assuming after our last little get-
                together that we re all ready to play by 
                the rules today.

                              GARZA
                Yes, your honor.

                              JUDGE DENNER
                  Excellent.  

  Garza stands, notices Buzzcut Man is once again in the back 
  row, staring.  Garza takes a beat to refocus, then:

                              GARZA
                I want to begin by saying I was wrong 
                when I suggested there was one opinion 
                that allows new evidence on appeal.  In 
                fact, there are two --  

                              JUDGE DENNER
                You re kidding, right?   

                              GARZA
                No, and I can t imagine you were either 
                when you wrote it.  In Leeds versus 
                Gilbert you wrote that in a case based on 
                  circumstantial theory --

                              JUDGE DENNER
                That was a tort case.  This is a murder 
                trial.  

                              GARZA
                -- you said any case, not tort or murder, 
                any case, falls apart if any part of the 
                theory is weak.  But how can you prove a 
                theory is weak without being able to 
                argue another theory?  And the only way 
                to do that, is to admit new evidence.

  Denner takes a long beat.  Then, pissed that Garza s trapped 
  him with his own words:

                              JUDGE DENNER
                Get on with it.                                                                                    53.


                              GARZA
                The defense calls Rita Schmidt.

  The courtroom doors open.  A Bailiff escorts Rita in.  D.A. 
  Freed consults his team -- who the hell is she? -- as the 
  bailiff swears her in.  Rita takes the stand.  Garza 
  questions her without notes.

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                Ms. Schmidt, can you tell the court what 
                your job was in April of 1998?  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                I was a crime scene technician with the 
                Richmond police department.

                              GARZA
                And were you working April 8th, the night 
                  Lieutenant Pam Hogan s body was found?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes, I was in the crime lab.

                              GARZA
                And did you catalogue the evidence 
                brought from the crime scene where the 
                body was found?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes, I did.

                              GARZA
                And was a pair of prescription glasses 
                among that evidence?  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes.

                              GARZA
                Did the glasses belong to Gregory Beals?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                No.

                              D.A. FREED
                  Objection.  Speculation.

                              JUDGE DENNER/GARZA
                  Overruled.

                              GARZA
                Who did they belong to?                                                                                    54.


                              D.A. FREED
                Your honor, she can t possible know whose 
                glasses they were!

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                They were Clark Hogan s.

                              GARZA
                Thank you.  I have nothing further.

  Murmur in the gallery.  Mereta, Eddie and Lucinda watch as a 
  stone-faced Clark Hogan leans in, whispers to the D.A.  

  Garza takes his seat next to Al as D.A. Freed stands, wobbly, 
  clearly forced to wing it.  A quiet aside:

                              AL
                You think Freed s gonna bite?

                              GARZA
                We re about to find out.

                              D.A. FREED
                I have no intention of re-arguing the 
                facts... but I have no choice but to 
                  challenge this outrageous accusation.

  Exactly as Garza hoped.  Freed turns to Rita, dismissive:

                              D.A. FREED (CONT D)
                You do know that Clark Hogan was married 
                to the victim?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes, I do.

                              D.A. FREED
                That he is a decorated police officer who s 
                served this community for over 20 years.  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes.

                              D.A. FREED
                And as they were married, isn t it 
                possible that if a pair of Captain 
                Hogan s glasses were found at the crime 
                scene, isn t it possible that his wife 
                had them on her when she died?  Brought 
                them from home, was going to give them to 
                the Captain at work...?                                                                                    55.


                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Yes, that s possible.  But it s not what 
                  happened.

                              D.A. FREED
                Really?  And how do you know that?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Because that night... when I came back from 
                  a break... he was trying to steal them.

  Eddie and Mereta watch as Clark Hogan shakes his head as if 
  to say  that s not true .  Incredulous:

                              D.A. FREED
                  A decorated police officer was trying to 
                steal his own glasses?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                He d realized that he had left them at 
                the scene... that they d been found and 
                brought to the lab... when I caught him, 
                he was... wild... strung out... he told 
                me he was an addict --

                              D.A. FREED
                Okay, this just gets better and better. 
                What s next?  He s Jack the Ripper?

  Garza sits there, impassive.  Knowing that if things are 
  going your way, you keep your mouth shut.  

                              RITA SCHMIDT 
                All I know is that he said his wife had 
                found out about his habit, and had 
                followed him to the crack house... He 
                said they argued and... like I said, he 
                was wasted... they were fighting and... 
                he shot her.

                              D.A. FREED
                And you re only telling us this now?  
                After eleven years?

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                He threatened me.  He said I d end up 
                like her.  I have three boys... 
                      (cracking under the pressure)
                I m all they have...

  One of Freed s lackeys hands him a piece of PAPER as --                                                                                    56.


                              D.A. FREED
                -- do you actually expect us to take your 
                word over that of a bereaved widower?  
                When it comes down to it, that s what 
                you re asking us to do.  Because there s 
                no proof, is there?  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                Her blood was on them... the glasses.

                              D.A. FREED
                What glasses?  
                      (holding up the PAPER)
                I have the evidence list right here.  The 
                list you signed off on.  And nowhere on 
                here is a pair of glasses.  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                That s because I took them.

                              D.A. FREED
                You took them?  

                              RITA SCHMIDT
                  I thought that someday I might need them, 
                for protection.

  Garza stands, holding an evidence bag, containing GLASSES. 

                              GARZA
                We d like Mr. Hogan s glasses to be 
                marked Defense Exhibit one --  

                              D.A. FREED
                Your honor, you ve already ruled on this.  
                The question of new evidence has been 
                asked and answered --  

                              GARZA
                -- yes, it has.  But that s not the 
                question that matters.  The one that does 
                matter, is whether you, whether any of 
                us, uses the law to prevent or to do 
                justice.  
                      (then)
                People come into this room searching, 
                hoping, expecting not just fairness, but 
                moral rightness.  Moral rightness.  We 
                all know the rules are there for a 
                reason, without them we d be living in 
                chaos.  We also know that when those very 
                rules we depend on put an innocent man 
                behind bars, to death even, there s 
                  something wrong.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                              GARZA (CONT'D)
                And there s something wrong with us, 
                deeply wrong, if we let that happen.  
                      (then, to Judge Denner)
                So many times I was sitting up there, 
                right where you are, feeling like my 
                hands were tied, like I was a prisoner.  
                In this case, your honor, your hands 
                aren t tied.  In this case you can do 
                what s right.  Justice demands it.  It 
                demands the immediate release of Gregory 
                Beals, and that Clark Hogan be taken into 
                custody for the murder of Lieutenant Pam 
                Hogan.  


  Start on Jewell, with her two GIRLS, standing with Garza and 
  Al.  Waiting.  The door at the far end of the hall opens.  A 
  Guard and Gregory Beals walk in, make their way toward them.

  Both Garza and Al watch as Beals is brought to Jewell.  The 
  MUSIC RISES, Aaron Neville singing  I Shall Be Released".  
  Beals gets down on one knee. 

                              BEALS
                Will you marry me?

                                JEWELL
                Yes.  Yesyesyes.

  They embrace, tears of joy.  The girls join them.  Garza and 
  Al watch.  After a beat, Beals approaches them.  

                              AL
                I m so happy for you, Greg.

                              BEALS
                Thank you so much.  And Justice Garza, I 
                don t know what to say.  You gave up 
                  everything to save a guy like me.

                              GARZA
                Who says you were the only one who needed 
                saving?

  Jewell arrives, to Garza:

                                JEWELL
                I wanted to give you this.    

  She takes the MEDALLION from around her neck.  Garza looks at 
  it and smiles warmly.                                                                                    58.


                              GARZA
                St. Jude.  The Patron Saint of Lost Causes.

                                JEWELL
                My sister gave it to me when all this 
                started.  But it s over now so...

                              GARZA
                He was my father s favorite.  Thank you.

  Jewell kisses him on the cheek, then Al.

                              BEALS
                You take care.

                              GARZA
                You too.

  Beals and Jewell walk away from Garza and Al, who watch as 
  they join their daughters.  Off the MEDALLION: 

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                You think I was one of Dad s lost causes?  

                              AL
                No.  I think you were his pride and joy.  

  Garza and Al turn, and walk away.  The camera lingers on the 
  reunited family as the MUSIC takes us to...


  Garza enters.  Surprised to find that the  neighbor  is none 
  other than Doc Levin.

                              GARZA
                Doc?  What are you doing here?   Is there 
                  a problem?  You got the money, right?

                              DOC LEVIN
                I got it, but your tab was already paid.

                              GARZA
                What are you talking about?

                              DOC LEVIN
                Some guy showed up this morning, paid 
                your nut to the penny.  

                              GARZA
                Some guy?  Who was he?  

                              DOC LEVIN
                I didn t ask.  He didn t say.  Only 
                hiccup is you gotta agree to drop some 
                case you re working on.                                                                                      61.


                              GARZA
                What case?  There is no case.

                              DOC LEVIN
                All I know is he said you were taking a 
                case against Big Pharma and he didn t 
                want that.  

    Processing this, Garza looks out the window, sees BUZZCUT Man 
  across the street, watching...  

                              DOC LEVIN (CONT D)
                So what do you want me to do?  

                              GARZA
                I don t know what you re gonna do with 
                his money, but you re taking mine. 

                              DOC LEVIN
                You re not for sale.  I respect that.  
                  Especially when it means I get paid two 
                for the price of one.

                              GARZA
                        (distracted, off Buzzcut Man)
                I gotta make a call, Doc. 

                              DOC LEVIN
                Hey, no problem.  I ll let myself out.

  Doc leaves as Garza picks up the phone and we...


  The PHONE RINGS.  A hand picks up, bringing the receiver up 
  to REVEAL Sidney.

                                SIDNEY
                Yeah?

                              GARZA
                It s me.  Call off the bodyguard.

                                SIDNEY
                I don t know what you re talking about.

                              GARZA
                The side of beef with the buzz cut.  He s 
                been following me everywhere.

                                SIDNEY
                I have nothing to do with that.  I told 
                you, you re on your own.                                                                                    62.


  He looks down the street.  Buzzcut Man is gone.

                              GARZA
                Then who is he?

                                SIDNEY
                I have no idea.  But wherever you are, 
                you should leave.  

                              GARZA
                And go where?

                                SIDNEY
                You should ve thought of that before.  

  And with that, Sidney hangs up.  Garza stands there, feeling 
  just as Sidney predicted, like the most hated man in America, 
  when there s a KNOCK and Al enters.

                              AL
                  Everything okay?   Cause you got game.  
                Unless you re planning on ducking me. 

  Garza looks out the window.  More to the world than to Al:

                              GARZA
                I m not ducking anybody.  
                      (then, to his friend)
                Let s do it.

  And as they head out, to take on each other and the world:

                                        THE END
