KYM, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking
furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances
impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell
phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder.
Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag.
ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling
WALTER, an irate patient who is screeching...
WALTER
I want my fucking Zippo now!
Walter starts yanking at his hair.
ROSA
Walter, that is a behavior...
WALTER
(raking his nails against
his forearm)
Fuck you!
ROSA
And you are making a choice.
Her cell phone rings...
ROSA
(to Walter)
Hold on...Hello?
WALTER
God!
KYM
Don't you get it yet, Waldo? She's
making a choice not to give you
your lighter because you'll torch
the Self-Help library again.
WALTER
I'm Walter. Kill anybody recently?
Run anybody over with a fucking
car?
Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but
gives no signal that she's heard anything. She yanks her cell
phone out of her bag as...
A tan Mercedes STATION WAGON pulls up in front of the House.

ROSA
(to Kym)
That them?
KYM
Yes. Finally.
Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags. They are oddly matched.
A Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World
Wildlife Fund tote bag.
WALTER
You're not letting her get behind
the wheel are you? Are you?
ROSA
Walter, you are only responsible
for yourself. (To Kym) This is all
your stuff?
KYM
You know you never gave me your
cell number.
ROSA
(sotto)
It was a mistake. I'm lucky I
didn't get fired. We've discussed
this. (She offers her hand) Good
luck.
Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand
barely... so very, very faintly.
Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is
wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym
talks rapidly over his shoulder...
KYM
Oh my god. Here you are. I thought
you were going to abandon me in
rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are
half an hour late. I've been
standing here with these lunatics.
You look so great.
Paul offers his hand to Rosa.
PAUL
Hello. I'm Paul Buchman.

Of course, of course.
KYM
Let's go, let's go. Where is
everybody?
CAROL, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car.
KYM
(loudly)
Hey Carol. How are ya?
CAROL
Hello Kym.
KYM
So where's Rachel? Carol, where's
Rachel?
Kym slides into the back seat as Paul loads the car.
CAROL
Getting everything ready at the
house.
PAUL
There is so much going on at the
house I can't tell you. You know
your sister's doing all of it
herself.
KYM
(eyeing the rearview
mirror as she arranges
her bangs)
My sister is bending the
environment to her will? Really?
PAUL
No wedding planners or anything
like that. Just her and Sidney and
a lot of their friends. She is so
thrilled you're here. Is that
everything, sweetheart?

The station wagon travels through a constantly changing
series of environments as they journey out of New York City
on their drive to suburban Connecticut.
Right away though, Kym lights up a cigarette and Paul and
Carol crank their windows.
KYM
So are all these busy young wedding
helpers staying at the house?
Because after eight months of
constantly revolving cell mates and
crazy people...
PAUL
You weren't in a cell, Kym...
KYM
...AND groups groups GROUPS...
PAUL
...And nobody was crazy, nobody was
in a rubber room...
KYM
...I was looking forward to a
little privacy for once.
CAROL
The only extra person staying at
the house is Emma, who's actually
been staying in your old room. But
she can move, I guess.
KYM
Rachel and Emma. Oh, great. How
relaxing.

Nachtmare?
PAUL
It's a nightmare so bad it's in
German.
KYM
Rachel must be totally freaking
out. Is she too tense?...
PAUL
She's a wigwam!
KYM
(right on top of him,
rifling through her bag
again)
...Is she eating? Or are all her
latent food issues rearing their
heads? Is she hoarding Snickers and
Cool Whip under the bed like in
high school? She never did put that
one to sleep.
PAUL
(genuine)
I don't think that that's a problem
for her.
KYM
No offense, Dad, but you never
thought that was a problem for her.
I'm kidding. It'll be great to see
her. Foodies are the worst, though.
They never get it together. There
were six of them on my floor in the
hospital and you could never get
into the bathroom. They would cry
at the chocolate pudding and one of
them was a guy. I can't wait to see
Mom.

The station wagon pulls into a CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY lined with
trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea. There are
several late model cars parked in the driveway of the
SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere
in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and
hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in
the swimming pool. The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and
friendly.
Paul unloads Kym's bags.
KYM
I'll do it, Dad.
She doesn't.

Sweaty and fed up with Carol's bike, Kym cycles into the
Buchman driveway. Paul has been watching for her out the
kitchen window while doing dishes. He waves and yells to his
wife.
PAUL
Carol, she's here!
KYM
Where did you think I was?
PAUL
I made you a sandwich, sweetheart!
Meatloaf!
Kym's shoulders slump.
Watching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel
the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen
to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of
milk. There is an awkward exchange of items. Paul hugs and
mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead.
Rachel opens the window, calls down.
RACHEL

Fiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN,
are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is
on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting.
Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly
white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel
arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized
meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the
enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're
suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan.

SIDNEY
Oh. I thought you said Satan Claus.
KIERAN
I thought she said Panty Hose. Or
Panda Claws.
EMMA
Pandas are endangered.
RACHEL
I know. We're having an endangered
Panda fleeing for its life for the
ice sculpture. Or impaling itself
on some bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney
Williams, my betrothed. Sidney,

KYM
Oh my god. You're black.
(To Rachel)
Sorry I called him a dawg.
RACHEL
That's fine.
SIDNEY
No biggie.
KYM
You don't look like a record
producer. You're supposed to have a
hapless lackey next to you with an
umbrella.
SIDNEY
Usually I do, but Mom's out
simonizing my car. Funny, you don't
look like Lucifer's Cupbearer.

The restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on
the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob
Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your
order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a
pinball machine.
Kym and Kieran are playing Foosball at the ancient table
where someone has painted Jamaican jerseys on all the
players. They are both viciously competitive and genuinely
irritated with each other.
KIERAN
Your hand is on the turf.
KYM
What turf?
KIERAN
The turf. The table.
KYM
So?
KIERAN
So we have to do it over now. It
was your shot and you get to do it
over.
KYM
What are you talking about?
KIERAN
Don't tell me you didn't know
having one hand on the turf makes
the play null.
KYM
Null. Maybe we should just play
Pinball.
C/U. The metal balls ricocheting around the interior of the
machine.
KIERAN

KYM
Uh uh.
KIERAN
It's beautiful. I've got a nice
place. My horse lives there.
KYM
Most people say "my girlfriend
lives there" or "my wife lives
there."
KIERAN
I live there and so does my horse.
He's very possessive. We're working
through it.
KYM
Have you had him a long time?
KIERAN
Yes. I may be a degenerate dope
fiend but I love my horse. I don't
have a wife or a girlfriend and
I've been clean almost seven years.
You could just ask, you know. Your
sister doesn't ask direct questions
either. She's incredibly cryptic.
KYM
That's a shrink thing, not a
genetic thing.

Paul, Rachel, Emma, Sidney, and Norman Sklear are sprawled on
the porch eating sandwiches and figuring out the seating
arrangement for the wedding by manipulating tiny origami
chickens, a tiny turtle, Monopoly pieces, spools of thread,
etc...each with a small name tag.
Paul sees Kieran's rental pull up, grins, and calls to
Carol...
PAUL
Carol, they're back!
Carol emerges with a tray of lemonade as the rental is
rolling to a stop. Kieran and Kym are climbing out of the
car...

All right. Where were we? Ah

please put the Rosenzwiegs
somewhere far away from me?
Paul sits heavily.
RACHEL
They're your friends, Dad.
PAUL
They're not my friends. I've just
known them my entire life.
SIDNEY
Just so you know, my mother expects
to be carried in by liveried
servants to the triumphant swirls
of the harp and seated on a solid
gold throne forged by nuns.
RACHEL
Really? Because right now I have
her shoveling kelp in the laundry
room. But I have it as a montage.
Kieran and Kym arrive on the porch. Kym settles herself on a
big comfy chaise.
KYM
Where are you putting me? In the
stockade?
PAUL
Kym, stop it. You're at the family
table.
Kym turns her face to the sun, shutting her eyes.

Oops. That's nine. I thought you

RACHEL

I am.
KYM

Where are you putting me?
RACHEL
I was thinking of putting you with
Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins
because they always get really
drunk and need wrangling.
KYM
Can someone else do it? I was
planning on enjoying myself.
RACHEL
You're the only one they're afraid

Still? God.

Kym opens one eye and sees Paul switch markers -- the
MONOPOLY DOG is back at the FAMILY TABLE. Rachel stares at
her father.
KYM
That's all I need. Another reason

PAUL
She doesn't hate you.
KYM
She's still mad about that thing at

Don't touch me.
KYM

Kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the
Buchman house, back into the chaos.
A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups

Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side
of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She
glows in her white and gold Sari.
They reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's
cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and
Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the
beautiful backyard.
Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to

Reshuffling as Sidney, his parents, Kayra, and Rachel, Paul,
Carol and Kym each place a hand on the silver cake knife.
RACHEL
Mom.
With nowhere else to stand, Abby lays her fingers lightly on
Kym's wrist. Emma's AUNT JOYCE, a cool professional photog,
SNAPS THE PICTURE.

SIDNEY
Dear God, bless this family and let
them always invite us for dinner
because my new wife can't boil
water or fry an egg. La Chaim.
EVERYONE
La Chaim.
Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a
spoon.
RACHEL
Friends and family, family and
friends! I have an announcement to
make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked
up!
Surprised whooping and hollering.
RACHEL
I'm exercising my bridely, knocked
up prerogatives and demand that
everybody starts dancing. And this
means you too, Mom!
Abby smiles.
SFX: The Deejay spins an infectious platter (TBD).
RACHEL
Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This
is my favorite song!
PAUL
Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing.
She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor.
Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance
floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym
and goes to sit down with Andrew. Kieran spirits Kym to the
patio, where they join the dancers.

THE RECEIVING LINE -- All members of both families are lined
up outside the entrance to the tent to greet the INNER CIRCLE
GANG and the LUCKY FEW OUTSIDERS who have been invited to
this evening's gala wedding reception party. It is twilight.

Everybody is spruced and rested. Rachel and Sidney have
changed into awesome party outfits.
Inside the tent, yet another group of musician friends are
currently laying down an evocative, hypnotic and extremely
cool, jazzy "world music" groove as the same attractive and
immaculate young servers (from the rehearsal dinner)
circulate with trays of delicious appetizers, wine, seltzer,
etc.
Kym is still wearing her sari. She stands next to her mother.
They are doing their wedding party duties. Neither woman is
looking at the other.
BOB THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
(to Abby indicating Kym)
And how is our little wayward girl?
KYM
Fine.
(Beat.)
I had an accident.
ABBY
And, how are you, Bob?
BOB
God, never better -- Isaac opened
his practice!
QUICK CUTS OF KYM
NICE FAMILY FRIEND
We're all so glad you made it! I
shouldn't be telling you this, but
there was actually a pool! Is that
hysterical?
DISTINGUISHED NEIGHBOR

with a twinkle)
If you're in need of any legal

Kym! Angela Paylin!!
Angela sports an intense tattooed image on the inside of her
right forearm. Her face features a unique piercing. Kym hugs
her. Their reunion makes her cry...Angela is nice.

The tent is fairly packed now with about 60-SOME ODD PEOPLE.
Everybody is getting along fine. With a single dramatic
gesture, Norman Sklear silences the band. Upon Norman's
instructions, the drummer works his cymbals in such a way
that the party-goers realize that something big is about to
happen. Norman Sklear now gestures for complete silence and
he gets it.
Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other.
SFX: LIVE BRAZILIAN PERCUSSION SLOWLY BUILDING, GROWING
LOUDER approaching the tent entrance from the moonlit
backyard.
ALL EYES ON THE ENTRANCE -- the swimming pool lights
shimmering outside as --
--FOUR SEXY BRAZILIAN DRUMMERS AND FOUR GORGEOUS BRAZILIAN
CARNIVAL GIRLS COMPLETE WITH HEADDRESSES AND FEATHERS DANCE
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD! The musicians blow whistles and
bang on drums. The cafe-au-lait beauties gyrate and pull
guests out of their chairs.
Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives
her a huge, sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy. Wedding guests
scream with delight and rush to the floor.
The drummers become more
impassioned with every beat. They
travel allover the dance
floor, a trail of guests behind
them. Sweat is dripping,
the girls are glistening wet, the
guests are pulled into a
massive pulsing heartbeat on the
dance floor.
Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until
Cousin Joseph, Matt and another male friend muscle their way
in.
Little kids swing each other around in circles.
Rachel and Sidney are practically doing it on the dance
floor. A Brazilian beauty shimmies over to them, her
headdress bobbing, her smile enormous.

Sidney immediately puts his head on her bosom. After a beat
Rachel does too, laughing.
SFX: POUNDING BRAZILIAN DRUMS
Carol stands quietly besides Paul and takes his hand and
whispers to him. Though not dancing, they are clearly
enjoying the carnival. Paul gives a little shimmy.
Abby and Andrew are huddled together at a table, talking
intensely. It's like they are blind to the spectacle.
Kieran offers his hand to Kym. She leaps up, spilling her
flowers. Kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd. They
circle each other. They come together almost violently and
dance like there's no tomorrow. Kym's head is thrown back.
Shoulders heaving, Kieran swings her around by the waist.
SFX: DRUMMERS DRIVING THE PARTY FASTER AND FASTER.
Emma shimmies wildly with her partner, her hair a mess.
Mr. and Mrs. Williams clapping wildly and doing the
limbo/hustle/drunken parent dance.
Guests stomping and cheering.
The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the
drummers who have their shirts off.
A dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from
a tank.
Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing. Sidney is
gulping champagne.
Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes
closed, chests heaving.
DRUMS CRESCENDO
Carol and Paul watching, laughing.
Andrew whispering in Abby's ear. She just stares off.
Kieran and Kym glued together.
Rachel tossing her hair wildly, Sidney behind her.
Everyone laughing, laughing, dancing.

The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling
backyard, reflections of the POOL LIGHTS shimmering off its
sides. The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically
deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special
lighting effects adding to the aura...
"Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super-
romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott.
An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside
patio in their finery. The oxygen guy and his matronly wife
are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking
intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer.
Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly
triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of
laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too.
Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing
with OLIVE the Dog.
Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed
by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the
water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of
smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights
the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the
illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches.
Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.
NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
(to Kym)
I can do a handstand!
She executes a truly terrible handstand.
KYM
That sucked.
The girl throws a rebellious dance move in Kym's direction.
KYM
Ouch.
The girl laughs and runs off.

where she finds Rachel and Sidney slow dancing alone and
dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still
covered with the ceremonial flowers. A single candle flickers
nearby.
The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence.
KYM
(to Rachel)
Hi. Where's Mom?
Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed.
RACHEL
Taking a break.
KYM
How can you take a break from your
own daughter's wedding?
RACHEL
Mom doesn't actually participate in
things.
KYM
And anyway, she hasn't even done
anything all day.
RACHEL
I was thinking about getting her a
cat. Cats are really annoying. At
some point you have to deal with
them, right? Or they starve to
death and piss on your sheets.
KYM
It's so nice here.
Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room.
KIERAN
You can run but you can't hide!
Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her,
dipping her to the floor. They careen into Sidney and Rachel.
Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her.
RACHEL
(totally into it)
Stop! Stop you fiend!
Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way
too amorous. Then:

Hello?
KYM
Hello?
RACHEL
Hello?
The ceiling light flicks on overhead and Abby enters the
living room. Blinking against the light, Rachel struggles to
her feet smoothing her dress.
RACHEL
Mom!
ABBY
Here you are.
SIDNEY
(from the floor)
Hello Abby. You're lovely. And I'm
not looking up your skirt.
Kieran is busting a gut not to laugh.
ABBY
I've been looking for you all over
the place.
ANDREW'S VOICE OFF
Abby? Where are you?
ABBY
I'm in here.
Andrew pops his head in.
ANDREW
They're bringing the car around.
ABBY
All right.
RACHEL
You're leaving?
ABBY
Darling, I'm exhausted. I had such
a marvelous time. Those dancers
were so beautiful. But weddings are
really for young people.

ABBY (cont'd)
I thought we'd just sneak off and
not make a big scene.
RACHEL
You could make a little scene.
ABBY
And here I am making it. Andrew and
I are going to Washington in the
morning.
KYM
Why are you going to Washington?
ABBY
It's the mother of all fund raisers
at American. I thought I mentioned
it. We're going to stay on about a
week - there are lots of meetings.
I thought since you two are going
away soon...
(to Kym)
...and I'm sure you don't want any
grown ups around checking up on
you...Will you still be here when I
get back?
Kym doesn't say anything.
RACHEL
What about our post-nuptial wedding
gossip reconnaissance, Mom?
ABBY
Well, can you come by early?
RACHEL
Um...
ABBY
Of course you don't want to do
that. It's your wedding night. You
don't want to get up early.
I have to get Andrew organized.
He's hopeless. And we'll be back in
a bit. It was such a lovely
wedding, darling.
She bends in for a kiss.

Wait! I want my mother and my
sister!

Rachel wraps one arm around Kym's neck and the other round
her mother and hugs them both to her. She has her eyes open.
They have their eyes open. They are stiff as boards.
Rachel stops hugging and looks from one to the other.
Her mom and sister look at her and each other.
Beat.
ABBY
Will you call me every day
about...?
She pats Rachel's tummy.
RACHEL
Yes. Of course.
ABBY
All right, then.
SIDNEY
Goodbye Abby.
ABBY
Good bye, Son-in-law.
Kym and Rachel watch their mother leave the room.
SIDNEY
(horrified)
I saw your mother's underwear.
Kym sees Abby and Andrew crossing the front porch through the
window.
KYM
I can't find my cigarettes.
Kym moves quickly from the room.

At the edge of the porch Kym sees Abby standing in the
moonlight at the front of the driveway with Andrew, waiting
for their car. Kym pauses.
Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction.
Kym, in the half dark, watches her mother.
Abby does not move a muscle.
Kym steps off the porch.
The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out.

lawn.

Kym looks back in through the window, sees her father awake,
in his robe, tired, gamely tidying.

Carol comes up behind Paul, envelopes him in a gentle bear
hug.

A `98 maroon CAMRY is idling in the circular driveway out
front, exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air. A
cute two-year-old girl is visible in a carseat and Rosa, the
staff nurse from Kym's halfway house, is at the wheel. The
car radio plays quietly as Kym opens the passenger door,
wiggling her finger at the little girl.
Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch.
Kym jumps a little.
The sisters lock eyes.
Kym looks pained. Paul is still moving around in there. She
wants to go.
Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at
the car.
She takes in Rosa who meets Rachel's look with a nod.
ROSA
Hi.
RACHEL
Hi.
KYM
(whispering)
Will you tell Dad?
Rachel nods. Kym is crying.
KYM
I love your baby!
RACHEL
Me too.
Rachel hugs her sister fiercely.
Kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door
open.
Rachel smiles her huge, luminous smile.
Kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window.

Bye!
