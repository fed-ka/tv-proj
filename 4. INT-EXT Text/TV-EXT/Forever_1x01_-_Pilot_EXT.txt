      Horns BLARE.  Traffic jammed.  Swarms of PEOPLE hurry down 
      the street.  All with purpose.  Some place to be.  This is, 
      after all, rush hour in Manhattan.  Through the crowd we see 
      a MAN walking.  Something about his gait, his demeanor *
      suggests a man much older than his 35 years.*

      The FACES that brush past begin to MORPH from present day to 
      faces of a bygone era; the  50 s, the  40 s, 1890 s.  Shoes 
      change from sneakers to old leather work boots.  Even the 
      street itself MORPHS from concrete to cobblestone.  The 
      buildings change from sky-scrapers to old movie houses to 
      tenements.  Soon, the street is filled with pushcarts and 
      wagons and kids playing stick-ball.  Essentially, a two 
      century time-lapse.  

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    My story is a long one.  It s 
                    exciting, romantic, full of 
                      adventure, intrigue, at times 
                      frustrating, lonely, and above all 
                    else... utterly ridiculous.  You 
                    probably won t believe me, which is 
                    fine.  In fact, I prefer it that 
                    way.  But I ll tell you anyway, 
                    because beyond all else, I have 
                    lots and lots of time...

      BACK TO PRESENT -- as people brush past on their cell phones, *
      the MAN taps on the face of a distinct, ornate, antique *
      pocket watch and for the first time we get a good look at 
      him.  HENRY MORGAN (35), handsome, but weathered; educated, 
        intelligent.  In his eyes we see wisdom but also experience.  
      This is a man who has done some living.  Two hundred years 
      worth to be exact.  


      Lightning ERUPTS in the night sky.  Rain pours down.  A storm 
      closing in.  An OLD SLAVE SHIP bounces atop the tide.


      Henry is drowning.  Falling deeper and deeper under the sea 
      along with the CREW, SLAVES, and TREASURES of the ship 
      (including Henry s watch).                                                                                      5.


      Upside down, Henry passes the OLD AFRICAN SLAVE.  Their eyes 
      meet one final time before -- HENRY IS YANKED UP!


      Henry GASPS.  Inhaling a first breath of life as he breaks 
      the surface of the water.  A rebirth.  He s naked.  Floating *
      in the Hudson River as the sun sets on PRESENT DAY New York.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    Since that night, nearly two 
                    centuries ago, every time I die, I 
                    always return in water and I m 
                    always naked.  Lends itself to some *
                    slightly awkward situations. Now *
                    you know about as much about my 
                    condition as I do.  All I know for 
                    certain is that the pain is real.  
                    It s just the dying part that s *
                    not.

      Henry swims to the shore and collapses onto the beach.  
      That s when he looks up to see -- TWO UNIFORMED COPS staring 
      down at him.  Henry looks up sheepishly...*

                                  HENRY
                    It s a long story...

      We TITLE UP --  FOREVER. 

                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                      6.


                                        ACT ONE


    The sun rises, as Henry heads down the steps of the jail *
      where he spent the night.  He s wearing police issue sweats 
      and a T-shirt.  He passes a LAWYER with a scarf sticking out *
      of his bag.  Henry swipes the scarf and knots it around his *
      neck.  He breathes deeply and takes in his surroundings.  *
      Another day...*

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    Just imagine all the things you *
                    could do with eternity.  See every 
                    corner of the world, speak 
                    countless languages, climb Everest, 
                    become a Sherpa, a pilot, a 
                    pianist.  Sexually, consider all *
                    the people, the places, the posi-- 
                    well, you get the idea.  In fact, *
                    there s almost nothing in this life *
                    I haven t done, except leave it.*

      On the street a WOMAN walks past.  Suddenly her face MORPHS *
      INTO ANOTHER WOMAN.  We will come to know her as ABIGAIL (27; *
        beautiful.)*

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, that s not the case *
                    for those around me.  Try watching 
                    as the people you love most in this 
                    world go off to another.

      Instinctively, Henry follows.  Jogging, he weaves through the *
      crowd, catching up to her. A wide smile on his face.  As she *
      turns, Abigail s face MORPHS back to the Woman.  Henry s *
      smiles fades.  *

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    Only then will you know what I do.  
                    That eternity is not really a 
                    blessing, but a curse...

      A CAR HONKS.  Snapping Henry back to reality.  Henry gets in 
      the car beside ABE (72), Henry s best (and only) friend.  Abe 
      hands him a coffee.

                                  ABE
                    Forgive me, but even for a man who 
                    died and then spent the night in 
                    jail, you look like crap.                                                                                      7.


                                  HENRY
                    Thank you, Abe, but I assure you, I 
                    look exactly the same everyday.  
                    Though that still may be like crap.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    Abe is the only one who knows my 
                    secret.  Fate brought us together 
                    years ago.  And if I ve learned 
                    nothing else from my time here, 
                    it s don t mess with fate.

                                  ABE*
                          (rolls down window)*
                    If it makes you feel any better, *
                    you ve smelled worse.*

                                  HENRY*
                    Very comforting.  Thank you.*

                                  ABE
                    Hey, you know what the beautiful 
                    part is?  Nowhere to go but up.

      Abe smiles as they drive away.  Henry shakes his head.  It s *
      nearly impossible for him not to be amused by Abe.*

                                  JO (O.S.)
                    Uck.  I wish I were dead.


      Andre (still nude) collects his clothes on the street, as Jo 
      PEELS OUT, SIRENS on her POLICE SEDAN, FLASHING --


      Abe glances over at Henry as they drive.*

                                  ABE
                    Correct me if I m wrong, but you ve 
                    never died in a train crash before?

                                  HENRY
                    No... I have not.*

                                  ABE
                    Well, as someone who has never 
                    died, and admittedly isn t looking 
                    forward to the prospect, I think 
                    this is cause for celebration.  You 
                      experienced something new today.  
                    Isn t that the whole point of life?

                                  HENRY
                    Abe, I think it s safe to say I 
                    have yet to figure out what the 
                    point of life is.  Mine anyway.

      This lands on Abe.  But he plays through it.

                                  ABE
                    Well, that s why we keep looking.  
                    How about I get us tickets to La 
                    Traviata?  I hear the soprano s got 
                    some pipes on her.

                                  HENRY
                    No.  Thank you. 

                                  ABE
                    Ball game?

                                  HENRY
                      I appreciate the effort but *
                      occasionally, after a violent 
                    death, a man needs a period to 
                    wallow.

                                  ABE
                      Understood.  How about a rib-eye 
                    for breakfast?                                                                                    10.


                                  HENRY
                          (considers)
                    ...I suppose I shouldn t wallow on 
                    an empty stomach.

                                  ABE
                    My thoughts exactly.

      Abe smiles as they pulls u in front of an ANTIQUE SHOP in 
      Lower Manhattan.  They re home.


      Despite being the middle of the day, the sign out front 
      reads, CLOSED.  CAMERA moves over various antiques.  A hand 
      snatches the PHOTOGRAPH of Abigail.


      The next morning, Henry charges down the busy street with a 
      sense of purpose.  Much different than the casual gait of the 
      man we saw in the opening scene.                                                                                    28.



      Henry GASPS for air as he breaks the surface of the water.  
      No matter how many times he dies, the first breath is always 
      the hardest.  A rebirth.

      Henry swims to the side of the pool.  He steps out, naked to 
      find -- SEVERAL TEENAGERS smoking a joint, mouths agape.

                                  HENRY
                    May I borrow one of your cellular 
                    phones?                                                                                    34.



      Abe drives.  Henry shotgun.  His hair still damp.

                                  HENRY
                    Aconite!  Called The Queen of 
                    Poisons.  Extremely fast acting, 
                    attacks the gastrointestinal 
                    system, hence the corned beef --

                                  ABE
                    The what? 

                                  HENRY
                    Nothing.  It destroys your insides 
                    and you experience this gut 
                    wrenching burning sensation in your 
                    stomach. Blistering on the lungs, 
                    tingling in your fingers, your face 
                    goes numb and then luckily you die.

      As they approach their apartment, they see -- FLASHING 
      LIGHTS.  Several POLICE CARS parked in front of the store.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    What s this?

                                  ABE
                    Maybe we were robbed?

      That s when Henry sees Jo exit the store and his heart sinks.

                                  HENRY
                    I m afraid not.

      As they pull over, Jo holds in her hand a baggie with the 
      bloody pocket watch.  She waves at Henry.  Dying and then 
      getting arrested, not the best way to end a day...

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    35.


                                      ACT THREE


      Henry races down the stairs of the police station and 
      directly across the street to -- the ME S OFFICE.


      Henry and Jo park in front of a small clapboard house.  Jo 
      holds a photocopy of a driver s license. 

                                  JO
                    The print belongs to a Hans 
                    Koehler.  He has no priors, is not 
                      officially a suspect and I ask the 
                      questions.  You re purely here for 
                    forensic evidence.

                                  HENRY
                    Consider me a curious observer, 
                    with a bit of a vested interest.

      She KNOCKS on the door.  No answer.  Jo peers inside.  Henry 
      notices a small driveway around the side of the house.  

                                  JO
                    Stop!  We don t have a warrant.

                                  HENRY
                    I m the suspect, remember?  You re 
                    simply following me to a suspicious 
                    location.  Look at that, probable 
                    cause.  

      Henry points to a DEAD RAT lying on the ground.

                                  JO
                    A rat?

                                  HENRY
                    Foaming at the mouth, distended 
                      diaphragm.  This one died from 
                    something it ate. 

      Henry unlatches the gate and heads down the driveway. 

                                  JO
                    Yeah, like rat poison.                                                                                    42.


                                  HENRY
                    Or maybe he munched on some of 
                    these.

      The backyard is filled with purple weed-like flowers.  

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Monkshood also known as Aconitum 
                      variegatum.

      Henry walks through the weeds and towards an OLD GARAGE at 
      the back of the property.  He peers in the windows, but can t 
      see anything through the dirt and grime.   

                                  JO
                    I have to call this in.  

      But Henry isn t waiting.  He opens the garage.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Henry, it could be filled with 
                    poison!  I ll go first.

      Jo steps in front of Henry.  Draws her weapon as they step 
      inside.


      Henry BURSTS out onto the roof.  Races over and checks the 
      air conditioning compressors.  They look intact.  No 
      tampering.  He scans the roof.  Just them and a few pigeons.

                                  HENRY
                    Perhaps I was a bit overzealous.

      Jo sighs.  Holsters her weapon when -- BANG! BANG!  Two shots 
      ring out.  Jo DROPS!  Bleeding from her shoulder.   HANS 
      KOEHLER stands by the roof entrance.  Off Henry s look...

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    51.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Koehler beckons Henry closer with his gun.  Arms raised, 
      Henry complies.

                                  KOEHLER
                    Saw cops all over this place.  Just 
                    a matter of time before one of you 
                    figured to check the roof.  Good 
                    timing.  I could use some help.

      Koehler points down at two CASKS of POISONOUS LIQUID. 

                                  KOEHLER (CONT D)
                    It was you or her.  I chose you.

    Jo lies on the ground, bleeding.  Her eyes flicker.  A little 
      life left.  She fades in and out of consciousness, not quite 
      seeing all of what happens next...

                                  KOEHLER (CONT D)
                    Grab one of those.  But be careful.  
                    You wouldn t want get a drop on 
                    you.  You can t imagine the pain.

      With some strain, Henry carries a cask.  He s well aware of 
    the pain.  Koehler walks behind, directing Henry to the air 
      vents, where he has a pressure booster waiting. (He s going 
    to discharge the poison into the vents.)

                                  HENRY
                    This isn t the answer.  Killing 
                    innocent people won t bring your 
                    wife back.

                                  KOEHLER
                    No, but it will make the bastards 
                    at MTA remember her.  They killed 
                    my wife and said it was her fault?!  
                    Those people took away the only 
                    thing in my life that mattered!  

      Henry gently places down the cask.  Koehler shoves him back 
      towards the other cask by the entrance.

                                  KOEHLER (CONT D)
                    Maybe I can t bring her back, but I 
                    can make them feel my pain.                                                                                    52.


                                  HENRY
                    I know how you feel.  I do.  I ve 
                      experienced pain and loss you 
                    couldn t even begin to fathom.  So, 
                    trust me, I know what it s like to 
                    lose someone.  To feel like life is 
                    playing a cosmic trick on you. 

      Henry places down the second cask.  Steps back, hands raised.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    But killing these people won t make 
                    your pain go away.  Nothing will.  
                    I can t let you do this.

                                    KOEHLER
                    Think you forgot I ve got the gun.

                                  HENRY
                    This may come as surprise, but 
                    getting shot, not the worst way to 
                    go.

      And with that, Henry LUNGES!  The gun drops from Koehler s 
      hands.  They wrestle for it when -- BANG!  The gun FIRES!  
      Henry holds up his hand.  It s covered in blood.  Shot in the 
      gut.  A fatal blow.

                                    KOEHLER
                    Don t worry.  You re going to a 
                    better place.

                                  HENRY
                          (gasping)
                    Doubt that.

      Henry fades, the WHITE LIGHT getting closer and closer.  
      Death is here.  Koehler makes it to his feet.  Turns on the 
      pressure booster.  Just as he is about to release the poison, 
      Henry races across the roof and DIVES!  The force knocking 
      them both off the ledge --


      Henry and Koehler plummet 200 hundred feet to the ground, 
      SMASHING through the roof of a parked taxi.  But, that s not 
      the end for Henry.  As the WHITE LIGHT consumes...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    53.



      Henry steps out of the tent and rips off his surgical mask. 
      He stares up at the bleak, cloudy sky.  Why?  Why must he see 
      so much pain and suffering?  That s when he hears... an 
        unmistakable sign of life.  A baby crying.

      He follows the sound.  Behind the tent, a NURSE cradles a 
      baby in her arms.  A ray of sunlight shoots down from above.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    But I ve also seen a lot of life.  

      The nurse turns.  It s ABIGAIL.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    A lot of beauty, a lot of wonder.

                                  ABIGAIL
                    Are you a doctor?  This baby was 
                    just recovered at one of the camps.  
                    He appears to be in perfect health.

    She smiles.  And when she does, Henry breathes.  She hands 
    him the baby.  Henry cradles the child in his arms.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    It s not the number of years we 
                    live that matters.  Our lives just 
                    add up to a series of moments.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                  HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    We never know when or where they ll 
                    happen, but they stick with us.  
                    Marking our souls forever.

      As Henry bounces the baby we notice NUMBERS TATTOOED on the *
      child s arm.  Henry cradles the baby.  It s tiny fingers grab *
      onto Henry s fingers, squeezing.  A lifeline...*
