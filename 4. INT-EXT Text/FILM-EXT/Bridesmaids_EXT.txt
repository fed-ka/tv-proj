TED
Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.
ANNIE
Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.
Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted
repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor.
TED
Sometimes it sticks!
ANNIE
No, I love it!
The gate starts to open. Annie exits.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Byyyyee!
4.
Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an
exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.
ANNIE
Oh, shit.
The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
DAY.
Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating
popsicles, smiling.
YOUNG ANNIE
Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your
husband, forever, to be your husband?
Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his
C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.
YOUNG LILLIAN
I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take
your husband, forever?
Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from
Chips.
ANNIE
I do.
LILLIAN
And now we will leave on our honeymoon
to...
LILLIAN/ANNIE
SEA WORLD!!
The girls rip the posters off of the trees.
An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway. They get
in the back seat, look straight ahead and just sit there.
END FLASHBACK - BACK TO RESTAURANT.
'S
thought.
LILLIAN
The madness has begun. Dougie's parents
are having an engagement party for us
next Friday.
ANNIE
Awesome!...
15.
Annie, in her jogging clothes, reaches for a wedding
magazine, but a woman's magazine catches her eye. It

ANNIE
(looking around) Ooh, what's this...
She finds the article. Hurry, before he gets away! Top
five ways to reel him in.
MAN (O.S)
Excuse me.
A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching
for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She
remembers the magazine! It reads #1. A simple, flirty

'S
working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it,
but it keeps ringing...
ANNIE
Hello?
HELEN (ON PHONE)
Annie!?
ANNIE
Yes?
It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend
from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all
smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere
turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a
cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots
of candles glowing.
INTERCUT:
HELEN
Hi.
ANNIE
Hi.
HELEN
Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of
Lillian's bridesmaids.
16.
ANNIE
Of course, Helen. Hi!
HELEN
Congratulations on being selected.
ANNIE
Oh, thank you.
Annie, reads #2. Expose your best asset. ASAP She
panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe,
flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but
politely smiles and goes back to his magazine.
HELEN
Annie?
ANNIE
Sorry, yes. Hi!
HELEN
Maid of Honor!!
ANNIE
Yeah. It is quite an honor.
HELEN
It's the number one spot. So how many
times have you been in the B.P?
ANNIE
I'm sorry, the what?
HELEN
Bridal Party?
ANNIE
I've never even been in a wedding before.
HELEN
What!? I've never even heard of that.
ANNIE
Um, well, it should be fun.
Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his
magazine! She reads#5. Make a funny observational joke
that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE
 SHE
and the golden retriever meet eyes.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Um Helen, can you hold on for a second?
17.
HELEN
OH--
Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy.
ANNIE
Hey, you're dog's really cute.
MAN
Oh thanks.
ANNIE
It's kinda funny right? That when girls
are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs
are cute.
Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
(beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some
girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly
girls. But I'm not friends with them.
I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But
some people I know who are considered
dogs, you know, they have a good
personality, and are better looking to
people cuz of that. And people who are
not nice...that's ugly to me. And female
dogs are called bitches, that's weird.
I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have
better ones.
The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.
HELEN'S VOICE
Hello?!
ANNIE
Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited
for all the wedding stuff and--
HELEN
YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from
Lilly with all of the other girls'
information, and when you respond to any
wedding related e-mails from now on, just
remember to hit REPLY ALL. Did you know
there are six of us?
ANNIE
Yeah, Lillian told me last night.
Awkward silence.
18.
HELEN
Well, can't wait to meet you and hear
what your planning for the bachelorette.
Any ideas?
ANNIE
Not yet. But they are coming, and I will
fill you in--
HELEN
Oop! There goes my other line. See you
Friday!
She realizes there might some research to do for this
bridal party' thing. She instead grabs two wedding
magazines.
ANNIE
Just these.
Noticing a magazine by the register that reads (some bad
MESSAGE)
ANNIE (CONT'D)
And this.
Annie is finally driving along. she hears sirens.
ANNIE
Shit!
She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum.
RHODES
Good afternoon ma'am, You in a hurry to
get out of the city?
ANNIE
No. Was I speeding?
RHODES
Is that even possible in this rig?
He finds this funny, Annie does't.
RHODES (CONT'D)
You know funny thing about brake lights,
you're supposed to have em.
22.
ANNIE
Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.
RHODES
Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches
Curve. That's a risky move.
ANNIE
I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the
city and they've never pulled me over. To
tell you the truth, those lights have
been out for like a year.
RHODES
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That
is not something you wanna go
broadcasting to a police officer. I might
feel obligated to give you a yea's worth
of tickets now.
ANNIE
What? No.. I-
RHODES
You just admitted it.
ANNIE
Can you do that?
RHODES
You admitted it. (beat) Yeah, I can't do
that though.
ANNIE
Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will
get the lights fixed tomorrow morning.
I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my
best friend's engagement party, I'm the
Maid of honor and so I really -
RHODES
Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a
wedding. She lost some of her hair from
the stress.
Again, not funny.
ANNIE
Am I getting a ticket?
He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep
her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence.
23.
RHODES
Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you
break the law. Um...license and
registration.
ANNIE
Here.
He writes a ticket.
RHODES
(searching for words) Ooo, I like that
air freshener. Did you get that at the
gas station?
ANNIE
I don't remember.
RHODES
Smells like Christmas. (sniff) Yeah, it
smells like Christmas.
He rips the ticket off.
RHODES (CONT'D)
Well, here you go. And just so you know
it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you
get those lights repaired, you wo't have
to pay anything.
ANNIE
Oh, Okay.
RHODES
Whoa, are those moon-pies?
ANNIE
Oh yeah.
RHODES
(mumbling) Oh, those are my favorite.
ANNIE
What?
RHODES
Nothing. (mumbling) Those are my
favorite.
ANNIE
Do you want one?
24.
RHODES
No. It's too much trouble, they look all
wrapped up.
She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one.
RHODES (CONT'D)
Well, have fun at your party.
Annie drives off. He watches.
EXT -THE HUNT CLUB. CHICAGO SUBURB.
Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet
and grabs the moon-pies. She walks into an elegant
country club dining room, lively cocktail party. Music,
happy people, etc. She is greeted by Lillia's mom,
LAURIE.
LAURIE
Annie, sweetheart!
ANNIE
Hi Mrs. Donovan!
They hug.
LAURIE
Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies!
Laurie takes the tray.
LAURIE (CONT'D)
Can you believe our Lillian?
ANNIE
I know, I'm so happy for her.
LAURIE
Well, clue me in. Is there anyone
special in your life?
ANNIE
Nope.
LAURIE
That's my girl. (whisper) Sleep around.
I'm serious. Travel the world and try all
the cuisine you can. You know what I mean
by that, right?
MARY, Laurie's friend, approaches.
25.
MARY
Laurie, where did you get that sweater?
It is one-hundred percent out-of-sight!
LAURIE
Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.
MARY
Ooooh. I can't even walk in there. The
blouses alone make my wallet open.
LAURIE
It's worth it, though huh? Mary, I want
you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.
MARY
Oh, very special job.
LAURIE
This is Annie Walker. She lived next door
to us in Milwaukee until the girls
graduated from high school.
ANNIE
Hi.
LILLIAN (O.S.)
Ann!
ANNIE
Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary.
Annie leaves.
LAURIE (TO MARY)
Her father ran off to Florida with a
younger woman who was working at a
Chrysler dealership.
MARY
Oh my.
LAURIE
Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She
also ended up moving to Florida to take
care of her parents.
MARY
Oh, that is tough. Well it's nice Annie
and Lillian have stayed friends.
LAURIE
They're like sisters.
26.
They continue gabbing as Annie rushes to Lillian. They
hug.
LILLIAN
Hey!
ANNIE
Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie?
LILLIAN
Smoking a cigar with my dad. Le's go
get a drink.
They weave towards the bar.
DOUGIE
Annie!!!
LILLIAN
Hold on Dougie, we're getting drinks!
They get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.
ANNIE
This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents
belong here?
LILLIAN
Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis
club I've been playing at.
ANNIE
Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I
pictured. Lucky you.
LILLIAN
Tennis courts are tennis courts if you
ask me. But I have met a lot of really
cool people here. I can't wait for you to
meet the girls.
ANNIE
Oh! So where's this guy you were telling
me about?
LILLIAN.
Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he
got back together with his ex or
something. Anyway, Dougie just told me.
Sorry.
ANNIE
That's ok.
27.
DOUGIE
There she is!
Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.
LILLIAN
Dougie, be careful. God, you reek!
He puts her down.
DOUGIE
Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold
feet you tell her what a great guy I am.
He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.
LILLIAN
(waving the cigar scent away) Ugh. Wash
your face.
She gives in and kisses him. Then says to Annie..
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
Come on. Let's go say hi to the rest of
the bridal party.
They approach LESLIE, Lillian's cousin, late 30's,
standing with her husband PAUL.
ANNIE
Leslie, hi! How are you guys?
LESLIE
Well, I just squeezed my third kid out
last month and I feel like I'm walking
around in a fat suit.
She swigs beer out of a bottle.
PAUL
I keep telling her she looks great.
(beat) Oh, I'm sorry. Is this your
boyfriend?
A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind
Annie. Paul goes to shake his hand. She stops him.
ANNIE
No, no. (to the guy) Hi. (to them) No.
Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.
28.
LILLIAN
Annie this is Dana, we met here in my
tennis class. Dana, Annie.
DANA
Hi! Dana Shig. Its so nice to finally
meet you Annie. I've heard so much about
you. This is my husband Ernie.
ERNIE has just put food in his mouth.
DANA (CONT'D)
Don't you just love weddings? I mean,
(she starts to cry) I just love like the
feeling and...everyone comes together you
know? And it's forever! It's a journey,
and WE get to go on it too!
ANNIE
Wow, that's beautiful. I never thought of
it that way.
DANA
This is all so amazing. I'm going to make
a scrap book for Lillian.
Dana takes her camera out then reaches out her hand.
DANA (CONT'D)
Hi. I'm Dana and this is my husband
Ernie. So...how did you two meet?
She refers to a bald man who looks like a chemistry
teacher, who is slowly walking by looking for someone.
ANNIE
No, I don't know him. He's not with me.
He's just passing by. I'm not here with
anyone.
BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good
looking stockbroker type.
BECCA
Lil! Is this Annie?!
Annie and Lillian walk over.
BECCA (CONT'D)
Hi Annie! I'm Becca. I've heard so much
about you. This is my husband Kevin.
29.
LILLIAN
Dougie's partner.
BECCA
So, are you so excited?! All of this
reminds me so much of my wedding.
ANNIE
OH--
BECCA
Two months now! It was the best day of my
life. I'm married now! It's like...I'm
just better now! It might sound weird
but... I feel legit. Just like, feminine.

BECCA (CONT'D)
Ooooops, where are my manners. Hi! I'm

MEGAN is Dougie's sister. An ODDBALL. She looks like she
might be at the wrong party. She is single and lovin' it!
MEGAN
Annie! Hey! What's up?
ANNIE
Megan! How are you?
MEGAN
I just got pins in my leg! I fell off a
cruise ship.
ANNIE

nighttime.
(MORE)
30.
MEGAN (CONT'D)
I was port-side, having a drink with a
gentlemen and old Megan here decided to
show off and I tried to climb into one of
the lifeboats with my clogs on. I saw a
dolphin.
ANNIE
Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK.
MEGAN
Listen Annie. You're single right? You
and I are gonna scam on guys this whole
time. You and I are gonna party and get
naked with guys. This whole time Annie,

Lillian re-appears, grabs Annie.
LILLIAN
Ann, there you are!
MEGAN
Think about what I said Annie!
LILLIAN
(to Annie) I'm saving you. Now I really
want to introduce you to Helen. looking
around) There she is.
In slow motion, a tall and gorgeous HELEN turns to us.
She wears a tight, cream-colored, floor-length evening

ANNIE
That is a lot.
HELEN
Perry donated a few for tonight.
The room is all aflame.
HELEN (CONT'D)
So how do you like our club?
ANNIE
Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's
very elegant.
HELEN
So you live in Milwaukee?
ANNIE
Yeah in the nice part. I work at

HELEN

ANNIE
Thank you.
LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.
Groomsman DEAN finishes a speech. They are now in the
dining room.
DEAN
So cheers to you two, our last single
friends finally crossing over into the
world of marital bliss, welcome to the
other side!
Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.
HELEN
Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris
the Third, an honored member of the
bridal party. In honor of Lillian and
Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity
to read a poem that I penned last summer
while I was sitting on a swing at an
exclusive resort in Santorini.
Annie whispers to the person next to her.
ANNIE
Am I supposed to give a speech?
As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees
everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a
fancy sheet of stationary.
HELEN
With every blink of an eye, every kiss of
a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand,
every...scent of a woman, every breath
you take, every move you make. Love
conquers all.
Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.
33.
HELEN (CONT'D)
They say when you choose a mate, yo're
choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a
lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going
to make a wonderful wife, because you
have been the best friend that I could
ever ask for.
Annie's face goes blank.
HELEN (CONT'D)
I have never had a friendship like this.
I'm so happy you two are finally taking
this big step together and I ca't wait
for all of the adventures that await us.
People are moved, sniffling. Including Lillian.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Now Dougly, sorry, inside joke. You
better not keep my Lil on a leash. I
still need my drunken nights at Rockin
Sushi! TO DOUGIE AND LILLIAN!!!
The crowd erupts with laughter and applause. People are
crying, hugging, and standing.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Thank you. Thank you! Now wher's Annie?
Annie? Stand up Annie.
The room looks around. Annie slowly rises.
HELEN (CONT'D)
There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor
everyone. And I'm sure she'd like to
take this time to say a few words. Annie?
Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as
she walks to the podium.
ANNIE
Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm
Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla
in here.
MEGAN
It's the candles Annie.
ANNIE
Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be
awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's
that saying?
(MORE)
34.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a
good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's
like a-like a toast. Is it Irish?
Something about a road...Oh God, 'm
blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy
to be a part of this whole celebration
and happiness. You two are so happy
together and hope you have a happy
lifetime of happiness and celebrating.
And I love you and....Lillian, w've been
best friends since we were like 5...'ve
never been to Greece...
't know
if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit
next to Lillian.
ANNIE (SINGING) (CONT'D)
Did you ever know that you're my
hero...You're everything I wish I could
be.. C'mon you guys know the words.
Some people reluctantly sing along.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
I could fly higher then an eagle. For
you are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy,
flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly
until we touch up high--
EXT-COUNTRY CLUB. LATER.
Lillian and Annie are at the valet.
ANNIE
Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
LILLIAN
No, you sang.
They both laugh.
ANNIE
God, I don't know, I was just maybe a
little out of my element, and after
Helen's speech--
LILLIAN
Ann, stop.
35.
ANNIE
I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of
your engagement party?
LILLIAN
Besides the impromptu concert from Bette
Midler, it was perfect.
They laugh and hug.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
I gotta go say bye to some people I do't
know. Drive safe.
Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air.
HELEN
Annie! Great job tonight..
ANNIE
I'm feeling slightly mortified.
HELEN
No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a
little nervous and carried away during
those kind of things. So listen, 've
been brainstorming some theme ideas for
Lillian's shower. I was thinking
somewhere along the lines of Alice in
Wonderland meets...are you ready?
Hollywood. And for the bachelorette?
Vegas.
ANNIE
Aren't I supposed to be planning some of
these things?
HELEN
Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--
ANNIE
She just got engaged two weeks ago.
HELEN
Well, I figured since you don't have any
experience that you might get overwhelmed
by events of this caliber.
ANNIE
Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can
handle it.
A guest walks by and taps Helen.
36.
GUEST
Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You
have beautiful cursive.
HELEN
Thank you.
The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you
couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of
all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you
soon.
Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.
WOMAN
You're very pretty.
MEGAN (O.S.)
Annie!
Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper.
MEGAN (CONT'D)
Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers.
A place just opened up near my house.
From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two
dollar wings and all you can eat MAN
sandwiches if you know what I mean.
Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.
NAIL TECHNICIAN
Your nail too short for french manicure.
ANNIE
(disappointed) Oh well...
NAIL TECHNICIAN
That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy.
ANNIE
Oh, great!
ANNIE
Here it is!
HELEN
Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.
ANNIE
Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly
it's you know, one of the best bridal
shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and
also, there's a restaurant inside, so um,
I figured, we could maybe have lunch
after. So, let's go!
She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer.
39.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh, I didn't see that.
She presses the buzzer.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
Hello?
ANNIE
Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids
dresses.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
What's your name?
ANNIE
Oh, Annie.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
(snotty) What's the reservation name?
ANNIE
(to the girls) Oh, she must be talking
about the restaurant. (back into the
intercom) No, we're here to look at
dresses.
VOICE FROM INSIDE
I heard you the first time. So I take it
you don't have a reservation for the
dress shop?
BECCA
(whispers) You didn't make a reservation?
ANNIE
Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to
make a reservation for that. Sorry!
Anyway, we're all out here now and--
VOICE FROM INSIDE
The next available appointment for
bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and
we don't take reservations over the
intercom so you'll have to call.
ANNIE
Seven weeks?!
VOICE FROM INSIDE
I'm sorry maybe you can't hear me. I just
said a few seconds ago that we do't have
a reservation for the next seven weeks.
(MORE)
40.
VOICE FROM INSIDE (CONT'D)
And when you make your reservation do't
forget you'll also need to make an
appointment.
ANNIE
What?
DANA
(whispers) You didn't make an
appointment?
VOICE FROM INSIDE
I SAID--
ANNIE
No, I can hear you. Would it be possible
for you to make an exception for us
because we drove all the way out here and
I didn't know about the reservation/
appointment thing so...
VOICE FROM INSIDE
Hold on.
LILLIAN
Annie, we can go somewhere else.
ANNIE
No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.
BECCA
This really is the best place though,
that's the thing.
HELEN
Listen, I know the--
WHITNEY
(intercom] Hello, this is the manager?
ANNIE
Yes, hello!
WHITNEY
We can fit you in seven weeks, that is
all we have available. We only take
parties that have a reservation and that
have made an appointment over the phone.
I'm going to ask you to not buzz in
again. Thank you. Byyyyyyye.
Helen approaches the intercom.
41.
HELEN
Whitney?
WHITNEY
(irritated) Yes? Who is this?
HELEN
Whit, it's Helen.
WHITNEY
Helen?! Hiiii!
HELEN
Hiiii!
WHITNEY
Hi!
HELEN
Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole
bunch of girls and we had a little
miscommunication and our reservation-
appointment wasn't made. Is there any way
to fit us in?
WHITNEY
Say no more.
Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily enter.
LILLIAN
(sotto} Wow, thanks Helen.
Andrea Bocceli music playing. Waiters in tuxes etc. The
girls sit at a beautiful table looking at men's.
LILLIAN
This place is kind of amazing. I did't
even know it existed.
BECCA
The southwestern cobb is really good. I
come here and eat sometimes.
MEGAN
Great, there's a fly that really likes
me.
ANNIE
They only have salads.
DANA
So Annie, what's your deal? Are you
dating anyone?
ANNIE
No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend
for three years but we broke up like six
months ago.
BECCA
Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What
happened?
ANNIE
It just didn't work out.
HELEN
Is that the guy who stole a bunch of
money from you and gave you an STD?
Everyone freezes.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Lillian told me.
Annie shoots Lillian a look.
LILLIAN
I'm sorry, I was just talking about you
cause I was worried about you and--
48.
ANNIE
No it's fine. But he didn't steal the
money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is
really common right now.
Everyone looks around.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Around fifty percent of sexually active
men and women acquire HPV at some point
in their lives and by age fifty, eighty
percent of women will be infected with a
genital HPV infection.
LESLIE
Really?
ANNIE
About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect
Americans each year.
MEGAN
Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The
fly's on the butter.
HELEN
Well, I don't have it.
ANNIE
Very few HPV infections show any signs or
symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected
people don't even know they have it, yet
they transmit the virus to their sexual
partner.
Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past.
We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear
came back normal so that's cule. But you
know, I'm dating, here and there...
HELEN
Do you have anyone in mind to bring to
the wedding?
ANNIE
Oh, I didn't even think about that.
LESLIE
Who needs a date? Just go stag and make
out with someone there.
49.
DANA
If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you
should come to karaoke night at my
church. We sing hymns to rock beats!
BECCA
Wait. I have the perfect guy for you
Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school
with Kevin.
LILLIAN
Mike from the fourth of July last year?
Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.
ANNIE
Really?
BECCA
And Kevin said he just sold his company
for an embarrassing amount of money. But
he's totally down to earth. You guys have
to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
HELEN
I know Mike too.
Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
MEGAN
The fly just committed suicide. Death by
butter.
DANA
Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you
could live out here and see us all the
time!
LESLIE
Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit
around and talk about nothing while your
vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper
towel.
HELEN
(sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going
to hear that word at lunch today.
DANA
I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met
him, I knew.
LILLIAN
Yeah Annie, you never know.
50.
ANNIE
Yes.
Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens.
ANNIE
What?! Come on!
She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
RHODES
Well, look who it is.
ANNIE
Oh hi.
RHODES
I see your still driving around with
busted tail lights.
ANNIE
I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I
forgot(laughing). You're not gonna give
me another ticket for that are you?
RHODES
Nah... The reason I pulled you over
today, is that--(searching) you were
driving too slow. Backing up traffic.
ANNIE
I was?
RHODES
Yep. You were going ten miles under the
speed limit. That's a moving violation.
It's...underdriving. It's in the books.
But, I'm just going to give you a warning
this time, but I do have to um...write
some stuff down on a piece of paper.
He begins to write. Beat.
RHODES (CONT'D)
Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master
Cleanse. You ever heard of it?
ANNIE
Yeah.
51.
RHODES
Cayenne pepper water for three days now.
It's supposed to clean you out, make you
feel lighter. It's working. The only
problem is I get so hungry. I just want a
big slab of ribs. You ever crave that
kind of stuff?
ANNIE
Don't talk about cravings right now. I am
PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking
everything in me not to stop and the
store and get like three kit-kats and a
bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right
now.
They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Sorry.
RHODES
No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We
had tampons in the pencil drawer.
Sometimes my friends and I would say they
were cigars and smoke'em. (beat) Okay. I
have finished writing down the things I
need to write, on this paper. OH!
He hands her a business card.
RHODES (CONT'D)
This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop
in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you
out for a good price with those
taillights. I'll write my name on here
so you can tell him who referred you.
ANNIE
Thanks.
RHODES
That's my name right there. In case you
forgot it from last time. It's Nathan
Rhodes.
ANNIE
Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I
get paid next week. Bye!
She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
52.
Annie's car pulls up.
Annie pulls in, her tank is way passed empty. She looks
in her purse frantically.
ANNIE
Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit
card at the restaurant! Shit!
She picks up her phone and dials.
62.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I
just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a
little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really
sorry. I will get there as soon as I
can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello?
The girls wait by the curb with their luggage. Megan
appears next to Annie.
MEGAN
Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do
you know how many men are looking for
trouble in this town right now? We are
gonna nail it down. We should tell
everybody we're twins cause guys looking
up with twins!
ANNIE
Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You
guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas!
Woo!
Lillian walks up.
LILLIAN
Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me
you weren't sitting with us?
ANNIE
Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to
blow all my money on a first class
ticket. I'm here though, right?!
LILLIAN
I'm so excited!
ANNIE
Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to
Lillian's bachelorette party! We should
probably get a bunch of cabs and head to
our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis
Royal Suites...
As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. The New
Marquis Royal Suites.
HELEN
Lillian, look what's happening.
71.
LILLIAN
Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?!
HELEN
I got a limo from the hotel.
We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!!
They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.
ANNIE
Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a
ride to the hotel. It's taken care of.
MEGAN
(from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie!
The girls' excited talking continues into the lobby.
LILLIAN
This hotel is amazing! You guys!
HELEN
Come on Lillian, you're staying with me
in the master suite. It's all set.
LILLIAN
Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one
hour! (waving her key)
UPSTAIRS. HOTEL HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS.
Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie
gets back into the elevator.
ANNIE
Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses
downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head?
Annie sneaks out, rolling her bag. She catches a cab.
Cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building. A sign reads
Hotel Rick. Vacancy. Some T.V.s. An old man rides a
bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling.
72.
A party bus pulls up. As the doors open, dry ice pours
out. Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy
lights. The girls all scream and run onto the bus. With
the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind.
The guys are carrying Annie on their shoulders, cheering
for her. She is laughing..
ANNIE
Ok, guys put me down, put me down. Whoa,
that's my breast.
BRIAN #1
Sorry.
She reads a text message from Helen. We're leaving
Sacrifice. It's boring. Meet us at the Jungle Lounge
ANNIE
It was nice meeting you guys. I gotta go.
DAVE
What do you mean? Where are you going?
80.
ANNIE
I'm here with a bunch of friends and 'm
supposed to meet them at this club.
MARK
We love clubs! We'll come with you.
DAVE
Come on, we'll get your cab.
ANNIE
Oh, Ok.
As the cab drives away, we hear:
BRIAN 1 (O.S.)
Dude, we gotta get Brian some food asap.
I've seen that look before.
Annie and the guys get out of the cab.
DAVE
Oh, shit. We can't go into this place. We
got kicked out last night.
BOUNCER
Hey, what'd I tell you guys?!!!
GUYS
Whoa, it's ok, we're just goin next door!
DAVE
Oh, Annie, here's your cut of the craps
money. Eight hundred bones.
ANNIE
For me?
DAVE
You won big for us tonight. Buy your
friends a round of drinks and come next
door after.
BRIAN 2
Yeah, bring your friends.
ANNIE
Bye guys.
DAVE
The Roller!!!
82.
GUYS
Woohoo/Yeah/ The Roller!/Annie!
They all high five. Annie turns to bouncer.
ANNIE
Hi. One please?
BOUNCER
60 bucks.
ANNIE
Here ya go.
Annie walks in.
GUYS
Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!
DAVE
What happened to you?
ANNIE
I don't even know.
DAVE
Roller, I can't stand seeing you like
this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a
shot!
ANNIE
I'll have two lemon drops.
INT BAR. HALF HOUR LATER.
Annie and Dave are wasted.
84.
ANNIE
That's what I'm saying. Some people have
everything and others have just little
bits of things. It's not fair. I don't
get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.
DAVE
I hate Helen.
ANNIE
That is the sexiest think anyon's ever
said.
Annie is outside of the hotel. Guys are pulling the girls
off of Annie.
NICOLE
Baker Community College bitch!
86.
The girls leave in victory. Dave turns and mouths to
Annie I'm sorry.
Everyone's laughing as they exit the club.
ANNIE
I need some gum.
BECCA
That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm
married.
MEGAN
It was awesome!
DANA
I got a picture of the balls. I got it!
LESLIE
(puts her arm around Annie). You lucky
bitch.
LILLIAN
Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment
of the weekend.
Annie finally feels a part of the group.
RHODES
Oh, I know what's going on. You're
jealous of that Helen girl.
ANNIE
Excuse me? No, I'm not.
RHODES
If you say so.
ANNIE
I'm telling you I am not jealous of
Helen, okay? She's tall and thin and rich
and pretty.
They both laugh.
RHODES
Oh come on, you know you got it goin'
on...
ANNIE
Oh yeah, I got it goin' on...
RHODES
You're right, you don't.
93.
ANNIE
(laughing) Thanks a lot.
They nudge each other. He accidentally nudges her off the
car.
RHODES
Sorry!
Now Annie is back in her running car.
ANNIE
Have a good rest of your shift.
RHODES
Actually, I'm heading home. Got my sister
staying with me for a few days. Sh's
been thinking of divorcing of her
husband.
ANNIE
Oh. Sorry.
RHODES
He had an affair and they've got kids so
it's complicated.
ANNIE
Hmm. Sounds familiar.
RHODES
My sister is a hell of a woman, you know?
And her husband is- you know what I think
cheating is? It's weak. It's a weak
person that cheats.
Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light.
ANNIE
No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um,
anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next
week. I have to make this drive
again...so...
She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees
her hickey!!!! She starts itching her arm, still flirting
and laughing.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the
soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh.
94.
RHODES
Yeah. I should go..now. Don't forget to
call my friend about those tail lights.
They're really starting to bug me.
ANNIE
I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend.
RHODES
You too.
He abruptly walks back to his car. She drives away
confused.
Annie's on the table while the DOCTOR examines her skin.
DOCTOR
Well, I've got good news for you. You're
going to live. Hahahah. It's not an
allergic reaction though.
ANNIE
Oh, that's good.
DOCTOR
You've got body lice.
ANNIE
Oh.
DOCTOR
Have you recently come in contact with or
slept anywhere that you think you might
HAVE--
95.
ANNIE
I know where I got it.
DOCTOR
You're gonna have to wash every fabric in
your apartment and I'll give you a
topical cream that should knock it out
pretty quick. I've got some samples.
EXT - LILLIAN'S APT. DAY
Annie sits on the doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch
of stuff in her arms and opens the door. They enter the
apartment.
LILLIAN
I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's
trying to figure out how to get my da's
family out here, they all have to fly at
different times, uggh. What's that on
your arms?
She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.
ANNIE
Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have
gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.
LILLIAN
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one
thing really quick. When is my hair
consultation?
Lillian frantically looks through her calender.
ANNIE
Listen, I want to talk to you about--
LILLIAN
Oh no. (starts to cry)
ANNIE
What's wrong?
LILLIAN
I knew it. I'm going to have my period on
my wedding day...and my honeymoon!
ANNIE
It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your
first time doing it.
96.
LILLIAN
It's our wedding night though!
ANNIE
You can still have sex, just put a towel
down in the bed.
LILLIAN
I can't believe this. This sucks. (beat)
Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you
think for the cocktail party before the
reception we should have a string trio or
a horn trio?
ANNIE'
Can you just realize what you just asked
me right now?
LILLIAN
What?
ANNIE
You just said a string trio or horn trio.
I thought you didn't want anything fancy,
you know, just keep it simple. Not a
big deal.
LILLIAN
I know but now that I'm planning
everything it's just...I wanna do it
right. It's once in a life time. It's my
wedding.
Lillian's phone rings.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me
because I won't let her invite everyone
from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If
you're not going to bring anybody, will
you let me know? I gotta free up some
spots. (into phone] Hello?
Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless.
Annie's car gets towed into the shop.
115.
INT - BILL COZBI'S AUTO ELECTRIC
BILL enters with a clip board. He is a stocky Milwaukee
good guy.
BILL
Rhodes told me a while back you might be
stopping in. I'm Bill Cozbi.
ANNIE
Oh, hi.
BILL
I was beginning to think we'd never see
ya.
ANNIE
Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
BILL
Nah, no one likes taking care of that
stuff. But you are going to have to leave
your car here for a week or so.
ANNIE
A week?
Annie gets out of Steve's car.
Annie drives past Rhodes' at his post, flicking her brand
new taillights. He sees her, but does't respond.
'T
pull her over. She drives by him again and swerves all
over the road. He really wants to pull her over, but he
doesn't. She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of
trash and diet coke cans out of the window. He still
ignores her. She gives up and goes home.
't get
to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we're
going in the right direction with annie uniting
bridesmaids and saving the day.
Annie pulls over. She puts the piece of paper in the
small paper bag. She gets out of the car, leaving it
running. A few seconds later she comes back without the
bag. Takes a deep breath and drives away.
Becca and Kevin are slow dancing happily very much in
love.
Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in.
They are all happy, he rubs her stomach.
Perry and Helen are dancing. They look like they are
talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses
her.
Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close.
Smiling and kissing. They've never looked happier. She
smiles at someone. It's Annie.
Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also.
Steve approaches.
STEVE
Thanks a lot for bringing me.
ANNIE
Thanks for coming with me.
Megan appears on her other side.
MEGAN
Yeah, thanks for bringing him.
135.
Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to
dance.
Annie is alone, watching everybody. We see the wedding as
a whole. It's a beautiful event. Colored lanterns,
twinkly lights, food everywhere. Simple, fun...very
Lillian.
Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception.
LILLIAN
So when does school start?
ANNIE
A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the
oldest one there.
LILLIAN
So what? Now you can have an affair with
your teacher and it won't be gross.
They walk down the steps.
LILLIAN (CONT'D)
Thanks for everything today. Yo've been
the best Maid of Honor ever.
ANNIE
Really?
LILLIAN
(kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at
all. You were pretty terrible. Today you
were good.
Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
ANNIE
Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to
the hotel.
LILLIAN
You're always gonna be my best friend.
They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.
ANNIE
I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs.
Price!
136.
Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie
runs towards the shuttle.
She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She
JUST missed it.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course.
The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on
the other side of it.
RHODES (O.C.)
Need a ride ma'am?
It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen
candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.
ANNIE
How did you know I was here?
RHODES
It was really complicated. I remembered
the name of this place, I called them up,
told them I was a cop calling on official
police business, doing a very big
investigation and uh, made them tell me
all the weddings they had planned for the
next two months with a bride named
Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]
Annie smiles.
ANNIE
Wow.
They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
So, did you get the moonpies?
RHODES
Yes I did.
ANNIE
Did you like' em?
RHODES
Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were
completely covered in ants.
ANNIE
Ooo, I didn't think about that.
137.
RHODES
You probably should have put it in a
plastic wrap or maybe a foil or
something. Tupperware would've worked but
then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm
gonna kiss you right now so...
He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about
to kiss.
Rhodes stops.
RHODES (CONT'D (CONT'D)
I didn't want to miss my chance again.
ANNIE
(SMILING)
Me neither.
They MAKE OUT.
The end.
ALT ENDING
Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up
next to her.
RHODES (O.C.)
Need a ride ma'am?
She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.
ANNIE
How did you know I was here?
RHODES
I'm a cop.
They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
ANNIE
So, did you get the moonpies?
RHODES
Yes I did.
ANNIE
Did you like' em?
RHODES
Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were
completely covered in ants.
138.
ANNIE
Ooo, I didn't think about that.
RHODES
The real reason I came here today is that
I have something that belongs to you.
He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.
He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets
in. They drive off into the sunset.
