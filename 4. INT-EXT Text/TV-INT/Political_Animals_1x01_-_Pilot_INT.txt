A TV plays DIANE SAWYER covering a POLITICAL EVENT.

DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)
Former first lady, Governor of Illinois 
and candidate for President of the United 
States Elaine Barrish Hammond just 
minutes from addressing the packed hall 
at Union Station in Chicago...  

PAN OFF the TV and across the suite to an interesting 
tableau:  THREE STYLISTS (two hair, one make-up) buzz 
around a SEATED WOMAN in a bathrobe with her BACK TO US.  

The STYLISTS apply finishing touches, while the WOMAN 
makes some FINAL NOTES on a SPEECH.  Diane continues: 

DIANE SAWYER (CONT D)
 not much you can say about the There s
s  been said:  she Governor that hasn t
been called everything from a feminist 
liberal icon, to an opportunistic closet 
conservative -- cold and ambitious, to   
warm, charming and unfairly maligned.

The woman lifts her head slightly, nods signalling her 
 ready, they exit.  The WOMAN rises, HOLD stylists she s
on HER BACK as she crosses to her closet.

Elaine Barrish walks the length of the long hall toward 
CAMERA.  We HEAR a discerning VOICE.

SUSAN (V.O.)
So that was it...  After thirty-two years 
of marriage you were compelled to ask for 
a divorce the night you conceded the 
nomination?

Elaine nods, always respectful and submissive where the 
President and his office are concerned.



Elaine is surrounded by Douglas, Brewer and MEMBERS of 
her MID-EAST CRISIS TEAM.  They talk over one another -- 
Douglas fumes -- in his mind, still in the last meeting.

American people really knew how this

SUSAN
Thanks for the invite, Madam Secretary.

ELAINE

SUSAN
You did, too.

A flash of understanding.  Together, they enter the room. 



Cocktail hour.  20 GUESTS join the HAMMONDS (a few famous 
D.C. faces:  Zbig Brzezinski, Christiane Amanpour).  

FIND SUSAN, alone, examining some PHOTOS of ELAINE on an 
antique table.  PICTURES of ELAINE with her BOYS, WORLD 
LEADERS, OPRAH, and even ONE of ELAINE AND BUD.  Years 
ago with their BABY BOYS.  Big smiles.  Promising.   

Susan looks up and over to the bar where Margaret 
refreshes her martini.  Susan approaches her.

smiles creeps across her lips.

SUSAN
Um, yes.  I do.

MARGRET
I always thought you were a rug muncher 
 like my daughter was at myself.  You re

looks.  At least she had strength of 
 just a character.  But you -- you re
rotten little thing, who makes a living  
saying really smart, really nasty things 
about people.  But you still have a 
boyfriend.  Good for you.  You must give 
one fuck of a hummer, lady.  

Margaret tosses back her drink and moves off.  Susan 
blinks, just run over by a verbal mack truck. 



The GUESTS are seated at a DINING TABLE.  Dinner amongst 
the in-laws would be awkward enough -- the HIGH-POWERED 
RANDOMS make the whole ordeal that much more bizarre.

ZBIG BRZEZINSKI
The journalist situation in Iran is a 
bind for the President.  He cannot fly to 
negotiate for fear of looking weak.  Yet 
he ran for election saying he was willing 
to sit down with these madmen.  Hakam is 
merely calling his bluff.  

BUD
 You nailed it, Z-bud.  Except, this isn t
 a G-D hostage crisis is a situation, it s
what it is.   

Bud tosses a look to Elaine, taunting her.

everything he can.

index and middle finger, sticks them IN HER THROAT and

her, barely noticed she was gone.

finally, to the impenetrable PRESIDENT PAUL GARCETTI.

Hakam is sick.  Pancreatic cancer.  
Before he dies he wants to begin 
 nuclear negotiations to freeze Iran s
program entirely.  He believes Iran has 
the natural resources to become the 
leading force in the Gulf -- but not 
without being in business with the West.

The CAMERA finally arrives ON ELAINE, who sits across 
from them in the OVAL OFFICE, finishing her briefing...

The room is silent.

ELAINE (CONT'D)
It was so much simpler when they were 
boys yelling at us about the Secret 
 get to Service detail, or why they didn t
learn to drive on the road like normal 
sixteen-year-olds.    

BUD
Yeah.  It was simpler.  Man... we had 
some good times -- 

ELAINE
Some fun times.  

 An acknowledgement of their earlier conversation, she s
admitting Bud was right.  She gets up, starts dressing --

ELAINE (CONT D)

he send you to Iran as a last ditch 
 effort to negotiate for the journalists 
release.  Hakam may not go for it -- but

it hits like a truckload of bricks.

She picks up A LARGE ITEM, probably a VASE -- 

BUD

As Elaine hurls the VASE we GO --

ANOTHER SMASH BRINGS US -- BACK INSIDE THE ROOM 

Bud has ducked both volleys.  He moves to her.

BUD
Settle down, Elaine.  Now I am the best 
person to get those journalists back and 
 not pissed I you know it.  Shit, you re
 just pissed wanted you to ask me, you re
 I thought of it first.  And I wasn t

Elaine grabs the rest of her things -- furious --

ELAINE
Listen to me, Bud -- we are done!  Done!66.



BUD
I love you, sugar.  If you think for a 
 giving up on us then you second that I m

She exits.  Bud smiles, still madly in love with her and 
sensing, in spite of her protestations, how mutual it is.

OUTSIDE THE MOTEL 

Elaine, still buttoning herself, huffs toward the car.
