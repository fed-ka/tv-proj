Jelena meets up with him and they share a huge kiss. The 
other girls can t help but notice - was it for their benefit 
perhaps?

AHSHA (cont d)
How can she get away with sleeping with a 
player when no one else can?

out in confusion and tears.

Raquel breathes deep, joining Jelena and the other girls up 
front. The MUSIC STARTS. Whatever friction they had, they not 
only start strong, they re killing it. In the end, they pull 
off a great routine. Ahsha surprises everyone, including 
Jelena, by pulling off the move she wanted her to do.

RAQUEL
(to Jelena and Ahsha)
We did it.

Ahsha hugs her, while Jelena steps off.

MONTAGE of the other groups going up. Finally--

OLIVIA

Marissa and Kyle head up with the rest of their group. The 
music STARTS. And they re immediately off. Marissa struggles, 
dragging down Kyle and Lexi with her.33.

As the girls disperse in various states of disarray, Raquel 
lingers. 

RAQUEL

We lost a couple of our own in that cut.

JELENA
Scared?

RAQUEL
Yeah.

Raquel looks to her for commiseration.

JELENA
(smiles)
You should be.

Jelena walks off. Raquel hangs behind, undone.34.




The CRESCENDO to crazy sex, the kind only two athletes can 
have. Jelena lays beside Terrence, both spent. The look on 
his face says it all. Whatever Jelena did to him, no one else 
has. Or can. And she sure as hell knows it.
