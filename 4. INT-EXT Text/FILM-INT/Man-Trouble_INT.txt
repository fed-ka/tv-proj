Seated off to the side, are two male soloists (VINCENT

He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He
suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist
discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off:
LEWIE
Spruance, would you like to show
me where it's marked smearing
here...
(hitting at the score)
... because I swear, I don't see
it.
JOAN
Sorry.
I didn't know I was.
LEWIE
Also, I'd be mildly content if I
could have a little less delirious
self-appreciation and some small
regard for remaining somewhere in
the vicinity of the goddamned note.

He returns his attention to the score. While Joan
grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus

others:
JOAN
I wasn't smearing.
HELEN
Sssh, come on now.
JOAN
No, I'm telling you, this is
personally motivated. Since I
moved out he's been doing this,
making remarks and being...
incredibly pricklike...

LEWIE
Now, if our lovely soprano would like
to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd
like to take it once again.
JOAN
(under her breath)
See what I mean?
LEWIE
Pardon me?
JOAN
I said fine, let's do it again.

THERAPIST
Now I want you to look at Harry
and tell him how you feel.
She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE, alias HARRY
BLISS. He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage.
Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to
the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL
can be heard.
ADELE
I feel like he's not plugged into
my needs, and I'm not getting
enough positive feedback...
Harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably.
ADELE
See, look at him shaking his head.
THERAPIST
Well, let's see what he wants to
say here. Harry, how do you feel
when she brings out this material?
HARRY
How do I feel? I feel she just
overheats on every little side
issue, and when I go to try and
communicate with the woman, for
some unknown reason she doesn't
believe a damn thing I say.
ADELE
Oh that's a lie.
HARRY
See what I mean?

No, you know what this whole thing

things that's got nothing to do
with this. I mean, I agreed to
come here, okay, but I have to
tell you, Iwo Jima's got a lot of
faulty notions in her head about
me that....
ADELE
Alright, there. Right now.
That's another thing I want to
interject...
HARRY
Pardon me, I was making a
statement here.
THERAPIST
Yes, let's try and hear each other
out if we can. Go on, Harry.
HARRY
Well, I forgot the upshot of what
I was saying, but...
ADELE
Okay, this syndrome where I've
asked him to address me by my
given name and he just goes on
ignoring my wishes.
THERAPIST
Alright. Look at him and really
tell him how you feel about that.
ADELE
I don't want you to ever call me
Iwo Jima again!
THERAPIST
That's a legitimate request, isn't
it?
Harry begrudges a slight nod.

If you can't call me Adele, don't
call me anything at all.

Better yet, can you take her by

you're saying'?
Reluctantly, he reaches over and takes her hand, mumbling
something which though indistinct, causes Adele's
features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the
edge of tears.

Good.
That's good... because
there's a lot of love here, isn't

Joan, moving with nervous alert, approaches a Mercedes

sedan parked next to an Econoline van. Placing her key
in the lock, she notes a flyer on her windshield. She
removes it, glancing briefly at this heading in bold
type: WOMEN - DON'T LIVE IN FEAR. A low RUMBLING sound
causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car,
where an attack shepherd (DUKE), slowly unsheathes his
teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the
closed window of the van.
Her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel:

Joan stands briefly in the dark, apprehending something
untoward. She reaches to a wall switch, turns on the
lights and sees:
The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures
have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept
from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie
rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand
piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished
surface.
Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden
patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the
window stands partly open.
ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the
room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens
it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door
after her.

A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the
devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him:
(In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the
piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints
around the frame of the broken window.)
MELVENOS
You sure nothing of value has been
removed from the dwelling?

No, nothing. That's what's so
disturbing. I mean, why would
someone do something like this...?

What do you mean, somebody doesn't

The Fingerprinter interrupts:
FINGERPRINTER
Not much on the window. A few
partials and a bunch of smears.
MELVENOS
Check out the bedroom.
As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom:
JOAN
You think this is someone I know?

For instance, just the other day
we had a homicide concerning a
dispute over a parking space.
JOAN
Who could it be?

You're not married, I take it.
Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she
fails to respond:

She's in the process of a divorce.

Well, let's see. Just walk back
and forth the way you normally do.
JOAN
(stands up)
Well I don't normally walk back
and forth, but... okay.
She attempts a few steps then stops abruptly:
JOAN
I'm sorry, I can't do it with
you watching me.
HARRY
Okay, but keep in mind that you
want to exhibit a very confident
attitude. Look like you know what
you're doing and where you're
going.
JOAN
Uhm-hmm.
HARRY
Just remember to stop short of
appearing a little dykey, because
that's not attractive.
JOAN
But I thought that's your point,
no to attract...
HARRY
No, no, you always want to remain
a little bit attractive. Otherwise
that can set somone off too.
JOAN
This is just impossible.
She moves back to the couch and sits down.
JOAN
You just can't win.
HARRY
Sure you can, it's just a matter
of degree.
JOAN
Well darn it, I give up...

Tell you what. Let me take you

table. She is well past the loosening effects of a
second glass of wine, is not unaware that Harry is looking
at her:
He lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his
eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in
front the window:
JOAN
How long have you been divorced?
HARRY
Oh, I'd say seven or eight years,
around there.
JOAN
And so you
like, well, assuming
you live a
single existence, I
*
mean most
men don't seem to enjoy
that, I've
read.
She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back
down:
HARRY
I have to
tell you the truth...

pauses)
I've been
observing your hands, and
I have to
use the word exquisite.

HARRY
You're probably quite a singer too.
(looking back
to her)
I'd like to come down and catch
you sometime.
JOAN
Yes, anytime. Do you like
Classical music?
HARRY
Very much. Even to the degree
that when it's playing on the
radio, I sometimes have to turn
the damn thing off.
Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit,
she laughs.
HARRY (CONT'D)
I just mean it starts to get to me
too much. I can't swallow my
saliva.
JOAN
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
laughed.
HARRY
Yeah, symphonies, operettas,
poems, things like that. All
those type of things really get to

Well, it was a while back there
that I did, yeah...
JOAN
You know that part? 'Yet as a
wheel moves smoothly, free from
jars, My will and my desire were
turned by love, The love that
moves the sun and other stars.'
He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of

Helen, show
occasional interest in the intense exchange
taking place
at the door:)
LEWIE
I'm extremely concerned about
this situation. I don't want you
living alone up there.
She regards him suspiciously. He modulates his voice to
a more persuasive and intimate tone:
LEWIE
Now come on, wouldn't you feel
much safer if you moved back into
our house?
JOAN
No, I wouldn't feel comfortable
about doing that.
LEWIE
Come here...

Darn it, Lewie.

Why are you resisting?
JOAN
These are very upsetting, really
shitty circumstances I'm dealing
with and I...
LEWIE
Do you know how hard all this has
been on me? Do you think it's
that easy for me to admit I want
you back?
JOAN
Couldn't you spare yourself then?
LEWIE
Are you seeing anybody?
Just tell
me that.
She rolls her eyes, sighing impatiently.
LEWIE
Come on, you're not the abstinent
type.
JOAN
Please, don't judge me by your
scrotal excesses, Lewie.
LEWIE
I know you're seeing somebody.
JOAN

Are you spying on me?

He pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her:
LEWIE
I don't believe you.
Who is it?

Joan and Harry
are seated on the couch having coffee as

they listen to
a CHOPIN NOCTURNE. He is doing his best

to emulate her
posture of thoughtful intensity as she
listens, but as
he steals a look at her his adult male
impulses causes
him to shift about slightly. She looks
over at him:
JOAN
It's not affecting you too much,
is it?
HARRY
No, it's very nice.
JOAN
It's Chopin, a nocturne.
HARRY
You know what's affecting me?
JOAN

You are.

That's the problem though, I want

HARRY
There's no problem.
He leans over and kisses her.
After a moment she breaks
off:
JOAN
Because I recently realized
something about myself. That I've
slept with a number of men in my
life just because I didn't want
them not to like me.
HARRY
(not averse to
being one of
them)
Uhm hmm.
JOAN
But the thing is, I didn't like
most of them that much, so why did
I care whether they liked me or
not?
HARRY
You know, I'm not one of these
guys who's going to look upon you
as an object.
JOAN
Oh, I know, that's not what I'm
saying...
HARRY
Because I look upon a woman as a
whole.
JOAN
What I'm saying is I don't know if
right now I might not go to bed
with you because I don't want to
be alone, so I thought maybe we...
could try to explore other modes,
or...

But you don't want me to bring you

around.

Pardon me?

HARRY
Other modes is fine. You don't
have to be shy with me.
(moving closer
to her)
I've been asked to do do every
kind of thing in the book.
He kisses her once more. Her response, is far less
tentative. As it begins to border on the ardent, she
breaks off again:
JOAN
God, it's so hard to pioneer in this
area... when you keep doing
that...

Joan and Harry tussle about with abandoned fervor under

hospital smock and is seated on the edge of bed occupied
by a woman in a drug-induced state of oblivion.

cable TV. I've had to sneak into
this cell next to me, with some
poor lithium zombie lying here
like a comatose cabbage...

JOAN
Maybe I better take this.
She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by
Harry's weight.
ANDY (V.O.)
And this is the lengths this
assassin is willing to go to
suppress me, because he does not
want me to have my book.
JOAN
Harry, excuse me, it's my sister.
He moves off of her and she leans across his torso,
pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:
JOAN
Andy... It's Joan.

44C
44C
ANDY
Oh you're there. Thank God.
JOAN
Where are you? Are you in New

for one day, just to have a simple
bone spur...

I was completely medicated...
JOAN
Andy, wait a minute...
ANDY
Do you understand the implications
of this, I have no underpants on,
and absolutely no recourse to my
rights!
Joan sits up, and in her alarm is unaware that one of her
hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on Harry's chest,
causing him to wince:
JOAN
Oh God, this is because of Red,
isn't it?
ANDY
Yes, it's because of Red, isn't
that obvious!?
Evidencing interest in their exchange, Harry manages to
reach to his cigarettes on the night stand.
ANDY
And if he and that fuckface lawyer
in his paid employ, think they can
... Wait.
(whispering)
I think I hear someone.
Joan turns to Harry, a stricken look on her face:
JOAN
What am I supposed to do?
HARRY
Find out where she is.

worry...
ANDY (V.O.)
I hear someone coming, I have to
get off.
JOAN

simple explanation...
She is cut short by the abrupt sound of the PHONE HANGING
UP on the other end. Again, she turns to Harry:

as Joan, white knuckling on the wheel, obsesses on Andy:
JOAN
I told her she shouldn't do this,
I mean, to be so maniacally
obsessed with this soul of mud
that she'd even want to write
a book about him, is beyond me...
HARRY
Well the guy must be doing
something right to have amassed
that amount of wealth.
JOAN
But she does this, you know, she
just periodically drops the entire
weight of her life on me like a
ton of bricks.

Joan, can I make a suggestion?
JOAN
Yes, please, anything.

You better try an keep up a little

There's nothing on here about her
foot. It says 'observation for

VITA
Okay, go ahead, I've gotta hear
this. Who is it this time?
HARRY
No, it's not what you think. This
is a very unique individual I'm

go and question Red Layls, or his

He's a little high up to go around
burglarizing people and sending
them nasty notes. So why don't
you just ease back on this thing

they can start ordering you

I'm not ordering you around. I'm

business, this manu-whatever, and
Red Layls, and your sister.

Socorro steps into the room. The door automatically
closes behind her. Duke, in a frenzy, leaps at her, then
runs toward the glass doors. He hurls himself at the
glass, then returns to Socorro. Thinking he's gone

Yeah, but that's before he tried

it was this tree surgeon...
She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her:

Wait a minute. How tall was he?
About six one? Kind of ugly?
Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW

He was about your height.

No, he wasn't, he was much taller.

through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of
suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands.
Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its
mate on the other side of the bed.
CLOSE ON HARRY
He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close
it when he sees:
POV OF DRAWER
A gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small
wrapped box.
He picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain
white card with a handwritten message on it:
CLOSE ON CARD
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, Harry, and
mostly, for being in my life. I love you, Joan."
BACK TO SCENE
Harry sits down on the bed, feeling the utter deficiency
of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception.
He stares blankly into space for a moment. Then he puts
the card back, picks up the box and without removing it
from the drawer, gives it a little shake.

They are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight.
Joan's hands encircle Harry's wrist with a new watch.

Seated at the dining table. He is deeply morose and
makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to
secure the clasp. (The empty box and the card rest on
the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way
into the house.)
HARRY
It's really very nice looking,
honey.
JOAN
Do you like it?
HARRY
Yeah.
I do.
Very much.
She finishes securing the watch.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Thank you.
JOAN
You're welcome.
HARRY
Yeah it's great and it's something
I really needed, so...
He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up
his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.

pensively, making the assumption that
he is looking at
her. When no response is forthcoming,
she attempts a
verbal solicitation:
JOAN
(without looking up)
You're probably wondering why I'm
smiling.
He looks over at her:
HARRY
What?
JOAN
I was just thinking that I find
this moody side of you very
attractive.
HARRY
Oh, uh-huh.

In fact, if you want to know, and
I can see you're dying to...

caresses his back)
I completely adore you.
HARRY
Well, same here, honey.
JOAN
Why are you all wet?
He lays his fork down and tries to make an awkward and
difficult excursion into the truth:
HARRY
You know, there is something I
feel I gotta say here, Joan,
that's been preying on my mind.
Something I maybe should've
handled a bit differently with
you from the start, about this
particular situation I'm in...

to be on her way to the police
right now, accompanied by a close
friend of mine...
Her bluff is immediately belied by:
HARRY (O.S.)
Honey?
It's me again.
Moncrief and Joan look toward the window:
HARRY (O.S.)
I have to tell you something.
Joan jumps from the bed and moves to address Harry:
JOAN
Don't say a word, Harry!
I'm not
alone!
Moncrief looks at the chauffeur, gesturing toward the
door.
MONCRIEF
Sturge.
Sturge exits to the hallway, leaving the door open.
POV OF HARRY
standing below the window, whispering:
HARRY (O.S.)
Who's there?
BACK TO SCENE
Moncrief steps in beside Joan:
MONCRIEF
I think you better come in here,
Mr. Bliss.

Joan looks from Moncrief to Harry:
JOAN
What agreement?
POV - HARRY
HARRY
(to Moncrief)
Bullshit! I never agreed to
anything!
(to Joan)
This asshole approached me and
tried to bribe me into working for
them, and I told him to go to hell!

MONCRIEF
I believe an agreement was implicit
in your acceptance of my check.

POV - HARRY AND STURGE - NIGHT
lurching about in a grappler's waltz below the window.
In the b.g. the old man can be seen leaning down to the
walkway, picking up the stingy-brim hat and returning it
to his head.
She turns from the window to see a subdued Andy entering,
her eyes showing signs of recent weeping. Behind her in
the hall, Moncrief can be seen greeting Red Layls.
Joan moves over to her...
JOAN
Are you alright?
... And in response to Andy's stoical nod:
JOAN
No you're not.
(embracing her)
What did that bastard do to you?
ANDY
I need a Kleenex.
She moves toward the nightstand with Joan following:

signing some kind of agreement
that...
ANDY
Wait, I want to tell you what he
said to me...
She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:
ANDY (CONT'D)
He said I was the only woman he's
ever really cared for...
JOAN
What?!
ANDY
And when he said it...
(blowing her nose)
... he had a tear in his eye...
Joan's jaw goes slack in disbelief.
ON RED
Glancing sourly at the two women, as he and Moncrief
enter.
MONCRIEF
Well this moves to the top of the
list, Red, as one of your more
stunning achievements.
RED
(irritably)
Get me something cold to drink,
will you?
MONCRIEF
Certainly.
ON SISTERS
Speaking in hushed, and in Joan's case, urgent tones,
while, in the b.g., Moncrief exits to the hallway.

hostage syndrome or something.

You 'love' him?!
ANDY
Yes, he's been a very important
man in my life, you know that.
JOAN
(raising her voice)
Oh, now he's not a fecal-faced,
great white shark!
Andy looks over at RED, now seated in one of the two
chairs in the room. Moncrief can be seen re-entering
and joining him.
ANDY
I don't know where she got that.
(back to Joan)
Will you please keep your voice
down. He's very sensitive to what
people say.
JOAN
'Sensitive'? Have you lost all
your beads?! This man had you
kidnapped and kept in a drugged
stupor for the last three weeks,
and now he's...
ON HARRY
Stepping into the doorway, holding Struge in a painful
armlock:
HARRY
Alright, what the hell's going on
in here?
RED
Who's this?
MONCRIEF
That's the dog trainer.
RED
I thought he was working for us.

RED
(to Harry)
Come over here, I want to talk to
you.
Harry releases Sturge and moves over to Layls, offering
his hand and trying to maintain his gruff manner:
HARRY
Mr. Layls...
Joan looks with dismay at Harry's apostasy as he shakes
"the great man's" hand, then quickly returns her atten-
tion to Andy:
JOAN
Will you listen to me! This man
is not only a bastard, he's a
scummy, soul-less little thug and
a criminal!
ANDY
Are you implying that I have
defective judgement in men, Joanie?
Red and Harry, as before. In the b.g., a hospital
employee wheels a cart holding several glasses of iced
tea. Moncrief moves over to the cart and the employee
exits.
HARRY
I just
want a say, that though
you're
someone in a category I
admire,
you've gone to some
lengths
on this thing here, that
I don't
entirely agree with...
RED
Sit down. I have a neck condition
and it aggravates me to have to
look up at you.
HARRY
Okay.
No problem.
As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up
and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:
HARRY (CONT'D)

thought on this, because...

Harry takes a second glass from Moncrief:

So if you intend to do that...
(after a sip of tea)
I might just have to have my shock
troops blow your brains out.
HARRY
Oh, uh huh.
RED

to Moncrief)
More sugar.

JOAN
And furthermore, this 'sensitive'
man's lawyer more than implied
they were willing to put your feet,
as well as probably mine, into a
block of cement!
ANDY
Oh that's just all talk...
(calling over to
Moncrief)
Would somebody please get me my
clothes!
ON HARRY AND RED
(In the b.g., Sturge exits on another flunky errand.)
RED
Just put yourself, Harry, for a
moment, in the shoes of a man
whose sole intention is to leave
the world a better place than he
found it, only to discover those
intentions have been painfully
slandered by someone he'd given
both his heart and his economic
support to, not to mention his
trust...

crooks!
HARRY
I'm not nodding my head, honey,
I'm just listening to the man.
ON ANDY
as Harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange with Red:
ANDY
Who is this guy, anyway? Isn't he
a little sleazy, Joanie, a bit
infra dig? I mean Lewie's a bit
of a stiff, but...
JOAN
You're going to talk to me about
sleaze, when you consorted with
some maniac tree surgeon, who was
flicking his tongue out at me like
some rutting iguana, and groping
at his naturalia at three in the
morning?!
ANDY
Oh, 'him.'
She looks to the chauffeur, re-entering with her clothes.
JOAN
Oh 'him'?!
He came at me with an
ax!
ANDY
Well, he's very immature.

belongings from Sturge, and as she moves toward the

tell you, and then I saw you with
this guy...

Don't worry, lady, we've got a car
on the way.

JOAN
(up into the light)
Will you please shut up and go
away!! This is private! Can't
you see that!?
HARRY
I just wanted to tell you, because
you don't know, how important you
are to me...
VOICE
(from above)
Step away from him, ma'am.
She waves the voice off, trying to listen to Harry.
HARRY
And I
needed you to know this one
other
thing about me, because I
don't
want to withhold anything
from
you anymore...
JOAN
Oh God, I don't want to know,
Harry. What is it?
HARRY
My real name's not Harry.
It's
Eugene.
JOAN
(profoundly relieved)
Oh.
(saying it lovingly)
'Eugene.' I love that name.
Eugene puts his arms around her. The "ET RESSUREXIT"
from Bach's B-Minor Mass BEGINS OVER the sound of the
ROTORS.
The CAMERA MOVES TO a REMOTE ANGLE, REVEALING them
bathed in a celestial cone of light from above, making
intimately emotional declarations and explanations to one
another.

The CAMERA SEARCHES OUT some familiar faces and FINDS
Socorro and her son-in-law, Balto. In the row behind

him, Vita, the waitress.
ON ANDY
restively fanning herself with a programme, seated in an
aisle seat next to Moncrief.

MUSIC OVER: Shadows from a barred window are cast onto
the wall behind Butch Gable and Eddy Revere, who sit
sulky and disinterested in the MFCC's cheerful Therapy
Hour Rap.

125D
MUSIC OVER: Red Layls lies with a plastic tube up his
nose. His hospital gown is open and his chest area is
laced up like a football. Through half-closed eyes he
watches the cardiograph line hooked up to his heart,
dance in tempo to the MUSIC.

Singing.
Her eye catches:
Eugene, arriving late. He moves
down the aisle searching
for a seat. He has forgotten to
remove the training
leash from his belt loop and the
tip of it hangs an inch
or so below the hem of his sport
jacket.

Finding an empty seat, he edges in past a couple on the
aisle and seats himself.

Listening.
ON JOAN
searching for him again and finding him, she smiles.
ON EUGENE
He returns her smile. His eyes shine and glisten with
emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly
childlike delight takes shape upon his face.
