We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
house the east end after the Second World War.
CUT TO:
We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through
those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.
SHIFTY
Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
fence, making a short cut.
5
Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping
over a fence at the end.
10
The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his
shoulder.
A BEAT.
He turns and walks off.
17
TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his
face, he seems a little more with it.
18
Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.
20
Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his
shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.
21
Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.
23
Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of
paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He
stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our
soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head
phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.
25
Silence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding.
He approaches his work van. "T. PALMER - BUILDER'S MERCHANT"
inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings
- he answers.
JASMINE
What's the matter?
Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray.
TREVOR
Nothing, I'm fine.
JASMINE
Why didn't you say good-bye?
TREVOR
You were gassing away to Nicola...
JASMINE
And why didn't you touch your
breakfast?
9.
TREVOR
I'm not hungry.
Off Screen Freddie yells.
JASMINE
What's the matter with you?
TREVOR
I'm fine.
She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs.
JASMINE
Where's the grey suitcase?
TREVOR
What? I can't hear you babe.
JASMINE
I want to start getting stuff ready
for next week - where's the grey
suitcase?
TREVOR
I'll find it when I get home.
JASMINE
It's all right babe I'll get it.
TREVOR
Jasmine, I'll get it when I get
home.
JASMINE
Babe it's fine, I'll get it down.
TREVOR
(Stern)
I'LL FIND THE FUCKING THING WHEN I
GET HOME.
CLICK!
He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then
starts the engine.
31
Trevor sits at the wheel, parked in a residential street. He
dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message
(V.O.)
This number is currently
unavailable please try agai...
He puts down the phone, and sits there, waiting, agitated.
34
TREVOR
I was trying to bell you geezer,
your phones off.
17.
SHIFTY
Yeah I know, mate?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Trevor, what do you want?
Trevor doesn't say anything, just nods his head, as if Shifty
should know what he's talking about. Shifty closes his eyes
taking stock.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Mate, you haven't... you haven't
paid me for last week yet?
Trevor looks a little uncomfortable.
TREVOR
Do me a favour, I've probably put
your fucking kids through college,
do you know what I mean?
SHIFTY
Mate, keep your voice down.
A BEAT.
Shifty considers.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Meet me at the top of the road by
the telephone box.
TREVOR
Mate you're a fucking diamond.
42
Trevor goes to walk away.
SHIFTY
Trevor...
TREVOR
Yes mate...
SHIFTY
Don't ever fucking come to my house
again.
TREVOR
Yeah, no worries, I'm sorry, man.
Shifty walks in, shutting the door. Rez walks past him to go
upstairs.
REZ
Who was that?
SHIFTY
Nothing, geezer wanted to talk to
me about a job.
REZ
What job.
SHIFTY
Labouring.
Rez ascends the stairs.
REZ
What did you say?
SHIFTY
I'd think about it.
Shifty goes to walk off.
44
Shifty and Chris walk for a moment in silence.
CHRIS
We gonna see your mum and dad
later?
SHIFTY
No.
CHRIS
I just heard... erm... I wasn't
being nosey, I just heard Rez...
Chris doesn't want to push the subject any further. There's
silence as they walk.
SHIFTY
...Do you know they've ignored me for
about a year...
CHRIS
I didn't know?
SHIFTY
...my mum puts the phone down when
she hears my voice...
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
My dad crosses the road if he sees
me in the street, then they fucking
summon me for a fucking job
interview.
Silence, the two carry on walking.
21.
CHRIS
For what?
SHIFTY
They just want me to meet some up-
his-arse-paki who'll look at me
like some lost fucking cause!
A BEAT.
CHRIS
You gonna go?
SHIFTY
Am I fuck.
52
Shifty and Chris approach a clapped out, red four-door VW
Golf circa 1986. As they loom closer Glen exits the car from
the back.
GLEN
What you saying you fucking rag-
head, you alright bad boy?
SHIFTY
Dowdy!
GLEN
You been on the roids mate you're
looking bigger?
Shifty's almost exasperated with Glen already.
SHIFTY
No, I haven't, no.
GLEN
You getting ready for a fucking
uprising.
23.
SHIFTY
Yeah, just a small one.
Shifty and Glen knock fists.
GLEN
We better be careful, seems like
there's a Tally-barn in town.
SHIFTY
Give it a fucking rest geezer.
GLEN
You know I'm only fucking about you
*
prick.
Glen looks over at Chris. He takes him in.
GLEN (CONT'D)
How you doing mate, you alright?
CHRIS
(warily)
Alright.
Glen grabs Shifty and pulls him to one side. His face is
close to Shifty's ear, his insipid breath hot.
GLEN
Who the fuck is that?
SHIFTY
Chill out, he's an old mate of
mine.
GLEN
Don't just bring any fucking Muppet
to the party, at least let me know
first, do you know what I mean,
give me a fucking heads up.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
(calm)
Yeah.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
(collected)
Alright mate.
A BEAT.
24.
GLEN
Anyway, I've got, erm, I've got a
message for you.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
What?
GLEN
Magnus wants you to call him
tonight?
SHIFTY
What? Magnus never wants me to call
him.
Glen shrugs.
A BEAT.
GLEN
I dunno, mate...
Shifty watches Glen.
SHIFTY
Where's the gear?
GLEN
Lenny's got it.
*
As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of
*
money to Glen. Seated in the driver's seat sits Lenny, a
frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket
giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking
corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She's pulling out a
crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the
window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny,
slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into
his lap.
SHIFTY
Alright Lenny?
LENNY
Alright mate.
SHIFTY
You alright Loretta.
LORETTA
Alright Shifty.
25.
56
Glen stands smoking, staring at Chris.
Suddenly Glen speaks.
GLEN
I fucking... I swear I know you
from somewhere?
A BEAT.
Chris can feel Glen's eyes on him.
CHRIS
I dunno...
GLEN
I do, I know you from somewhere.
Chris stays silent.
GLEN (CONT'D)
D'you used to knock out pills?
CHRIS
(dismissive)
Yeah, now and again.
Glen carries on staring at him.
GLEN
Yeah, yeah, I know where I fucking
know you from... you used to go out
with Serena Ellis?
CHRIS
Yeah, a few years ago?
GLEN
You'd fucking hope so, she's dead
you cunt.
Glen laughs at his own joke. Chris looks furious. Shifty
walks back over.
SHIFTY
Come!
GLEN
Right you done?
(Shifty nods)
Good.
(MORE)
26.
GLEN (CONT'D)
(he takes a final drag on
his fag)
Don't go blowing up any fucking
tube trains.
Glen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and
storms off, Shifty follows after him.
58
Chris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris
stands there for a moment his fists clenched.
SHIFTY
Mate, are you alright?
CHRIS
Yeah, I'm fine.
SHIFTY
What's the matter, what did he say?
27.
CHRIS
Geezer don't worry about,
just...don't worry about it, it's
cool, I'm alright.
60
Trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta-cabin
and let's himself in. We follow him into see Bob Moran,
portly, sitting at a desk, another gentleman, in a suit and
hard-hat stands before the desk. Bob spots Trevor.
BOB
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
TREVOR
Bob!
Bob comes around from his side of the desk.
BOB
No, Trevor, no.
TREVOR
Bob just hear me out.
BOB
Get out of my office.
TREVOR
Bob please I've paid out on all the
materials, I've lost money.
BOB
You should have thought about that
before you started bringing drugs
onto my site.
TREVOR
You owe me money.
BOB
I owe you fuck all.
TREVOR
YOU OWE ME MY FUCKING MONEY.
BOB
Tell it to the police, and I'll
tell `em why you got kicked off the
fucking job.
TREVOR
Bob, please.
28.
BOB
Fuck off, Trevor.
Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.
TREVOR
Bob.
Bob ignores him.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Bob I need this money.
Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to
him. Trevor stands behind them.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Bob!
Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.
BOB
Thank's for coming today Trevor,
we'll definitely be in touch.
Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with
emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it
together.
61
Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a
skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty
hands Chris a rolled spliff. Shifty doesn't say anything,
doesn't want to push Chris.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
Was that Loretta Martin in that
motor?
SHIFTY
Yeah.
CHRIS
I used to fancy her big time when
we were kids.
SHIFTY
Yeah, I remember.
A BEAT.
29.
CHRIS
She fucking... she loves a wrong'un
though don't she?
SHIFTY
Loves a wrong'un.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
What happened to her face?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Apparently... Glen... I think...
injected her with some fucking
cocktail... I dunno... smack, I
think... he passed out first... she
passed out... but apparently she
was lying up against a radiator...
the fucking thing came on full
whack. She was so out of it, she
didn't even know it was on....
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
...the paramedics had to peel her
off.
CHRIS
Jesus Christ!
Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts
ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He
hits reject.
62
Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something.
CHRIS
What's that?
SHIFTY
What?
Chris points.
CHRIS
That fucking thing.
65
Shifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that
helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam
are two handles.
CHRIS
What does it fucking do?
Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Mate, grab the other end.
Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to
Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
FUCKING HELL!
SHIFTY
SHIIIIIIIIT!
They're both cracking up laughing, loving it.
66
A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms.
68
Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to
walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He
pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried
on walking.
SHIFTY
Geezer, give me a minute.
Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his
jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to
unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n'
bass booming out.
73A
*
Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable.
75
Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16,
pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened
by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.
77
Shifty and Chris walk in silence. Chris looks about at the
buildings, his eyes searching across the domain that he once
knew so well.
CHRIS
Did you tell Rachel?
SHIFTY
What?
CHRIS
About me.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
No, I didn't.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
I thought it'd be a surprise.
Chris looks a little uncomfortable.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Mate, it's gonna be fine.
CHRIS
Who else is gonna be there?
SHIFTY
I dunno, lot of her new mates, I
don't know many of them.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
So what's the plan, are you gonna
go and see your mum and dad first?
Shifty looks at him.
SHIFTY
No.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
You should go man, see what they've
got to say?
SHIFTY
I thought you worked in
recruitment.
43.
CHRIS
What?
SHIFTY
When do you become a fucking family
liaison?
CHRIS
What are you talking about you
nutter, I was just saying?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
I'll be stuck in some fucking
warehouse... looking after twenty
Bengalis... knocking out dodgy
Fruit of the Looms.... I know
exactly who they want me to meet,
man.
CHRIS
It might not be, mate, it might be
some sweet little earner... in the
city somewhere, do you know what I
mean.
SHIFTY
I've got a sweet little earner.
CHRIS
Yeah, but you won't be sweating
bullets everytime the door bell
goes.
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
You're not knocking out weed
anymore, man.... This aint
college... you're in deep bruv...
that shit'll put you down for life.
SHIFTY
Only if you get caught, mate.
Suddenly from around the corner we see someone come sprinting
past. .
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Malik?
Malik, small, Turkish, stops dead in his tracks and spins
round, he carries a large black holdall.
44.
MALIK
(OUT OF BREATH)
Fucking hell Shifty... you alright
bruv... I didn't even notice you.
SHIFTY
What's going on?
MALIK
Long story, geezer (Looks at Chris)
you alright mate?
CHRIS
How you doing?
SHIFTY
Malik, this is an old mate of mine,
Chris.
MALIK
Someone's gotta be.
Chris laughs.
SHIFTY
Where are you going, man why you
running?
MALIK
Fucking hell, do you remember I was
telling you about Craig?
SHIFTY
No.
MALIK
Yeah you fucking do, Craig Whittle,
the guy who's seeing Desmond
Dodge's sister.
SHIFTY
What, Craig, small Craig.
MALIK
Yeah, yeah. D'you remember I told
you he had that job at the
pinnacles, the, erm, storage
warehouse.
SHIFTY
Yeah, go on.
He doesn't.
45.
MALIK
Anyway, Craig tells me every
Friday, on the fucking dot, a
delivery gets made, all this top
fucking electrical gear...
Shifty offers him a cigarette.
MALIK (CONT'D)
Cheers mate... yeah every Friday
[lights his fag] they make this
fucking drop off, but because the
lorry can't reverse into the
courtyard, something to do with the
angle of the gates or something, I
dunno mate, you'll have to ask
Craig, they fucking, cos they can't
get in, they leave all these crates
sitting on the fucking road...
SHIFTY
What... are you on your way there
now?
MALIK
What... no, no, no, I drummed the
place ten minutes ago blood. This
fucking... forklift went inside
yeah, with this first load, so I,
fucking, I nipped in, started
whacking in the gear, only turns
out they've got another forklift...
CHRIS
Hold up, hold up...Why are you
running?
MALIK
Cunt caught me right in the middle
a loading up.
CLOSE ON: SHIFTY AND CHRIS' FACES DROP.
MALIK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Are you sure you don't want
anything, I'll do you a proper
deal, sort you right out?
At that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes
heading toward them. The siren blares out. Chris and Shifty,
caught between a rock and a hard place, turn and sprint.
84
Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but
Shifty's like a whippet.
46.
SHIFTY
Follow me.
Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows.
85
Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a
wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in
a shitty garden pond.
MALIK
Fuck.
86
Shifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind.
SHIFTY
This is bollocks.
Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the
other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor
hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.
87
Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the
crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are
near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag
whipping off the back.
THE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE
CYCLE TRACK.
It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts
cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more
serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as
Shifty.
88
*
Shifty sits in an underpass. Random graffiti tarnishes the
walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall. Chris
is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard.
CHRIS
Mate, I'm telling you, this is no
way to live.
Chris sits down next to Shifty.
47.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'm serious, mate, you need to get
away from this shit, come and live
with me for a bit.
Shifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling
out a pack of fags.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'm serious, mate... Why not?
Shifty doesn't say anything.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
You'd love Manchester, man, it's
full of fitness.
Shifty stays quiet, and smokes. They sit their for a moment.
SHIFTY
I can't just fuck off.
CHRIS
Yeah, you can.
Shifty looks at Chris.
SHIFTY
Yeah, but I wouldn't mate... I
don't want to... I'm perfectly
fucking happy where I am...
89
*
There's a silence between the two of them. Shifty looks as if
he's mulling something over in his head.
SHIFTY
If Manchester's so full of gal, how
come you haven't got a bird yet?
CHRIS
I've been on nuff dates. Some of
them fucking lovely.
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I just haven't been able to get my
head around it since Serena.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Mate, that was four years ago.
49.
91
In the distance we can hear the faint resonance of traffic
and far-away cries from a children's playground....
CHRIS
Did you go to the funeral?
Shifty soaks in the question.
SHIFTY
Yeah of course I did.
CHRIS
Did anyone say anything?
SHIFTY
About what?
CHRIS
I dunno, about me?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Yeah.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
People were saying a lot of shit
about both of us.
CHRIS
Like what?
SHIFTY
Just... fucking...just rumors,
mate, bullshit.
CHRIS
Did you get drilled by the old
bill?
SHIFTY
Everyone did.
CHRIS
What did people say when I left?
50.
SHIFTY
I don't know mate. Whatever they
were saying about you they were
saying about me.
There's an uncomfortable silence between them.
CHRIS
I'm gonna get fucking lick-shot
tonight.
SHIFTY
You fucking know that... back to
mine... bit of munch... couple of
Uri Geller's...
CHRIS
You getting changed?
SHIFTY
Yeah, of course I am
CHRIS
Let's get a bottle of whisky.
SHIFTY
Fuck that.
CHRIS
Why?
SHIFTY
You always kick off.
CHRIS
No I don't.
SHIFTY
Mate, last time you drank a bottle
of whisky you pissed on my leg.
CHRIS
Bollocks!
Chris is laughing.
SHIFTY
In a club.
CHRIS
What!
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
In front of the bouncer.
51.
CHRIS
Oh yeah, I remember.
Chris cracks up.
SHIFTY
I gotta do one last drop off and we
can chill out.
93
Trevor gets out, he's furious and kicks the side of the van.
TREVOR
FUCK...
95
We see Shifty and Chris approach a house, Shifty leads the
way through the gate.
96
Trevor's driving, full of desperation. He phones another
number.
52.
TREVOR
(ON PHONE)
Ken, it's Trevor... yeah I'm alright
mate... yeah, no, not for about a
week... Look I can't get hold of
Shifty... I know, I know he's a
nightmare... you haven't got any
various have ya... what you're dry as
well... I know... I know but I can't
get hold of him... alright mate... look
if you see him yeah, get him to
call me straight away...
97
Malik walks, head down, carrying the bag of stolen gear.
99
Trevor's van pulls up behind Malik tooting his horn - Malik
almost defecates his jeans - Trevor winds down the window.
MALIK
(exasperated)
Fucking hell Trevor, my hearts
beating like a techno track.
TREVOR
You seen Shifty?
MALIK
(wary)
Earlier, yeah, why?
TREVOR
When?
MALIK
(suspicious)
This morning, why what's the
matter, what's going on?
54.
TREVOR
Get in and show me where to find
him, you know where he hangs out.
MALIK
I, erm, I'm on my way to, erm, my
bird's Trev...
TREVOR
Don't worry about it, we'll only be
about ten minutes.
MALIK
I don't think Shifty's gonna want
to see me at the moment though
Trev.
Trevor steps out.
TREVOR
Get in the FUCKING car Malik.
101
Shifty and Chris walk.
SHIFTY
You alright mate... you sound a bit
down?
REZ (O.S.)
I'm fine.
SHIFTY
*
Is that still job thing still on?
REZ (O.S.)
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it
be.
SHIFTY
Alright mate, I was just asking.
REZ
Just get here.
107
Shifty and Chris walk through the tunnel, from the far end we
see the shadow of a heavyset man approaching. Shifty and
Chris walk unfazed. Shifty recognises the guy.
SHIFTY
(under his breath)
Oh shit!
Trevor, appearing from the gloom, walks directly towards
Shifty.
TREVOR
Where you been geezer, I've been
trying to get hold of you.
He stops about a foot away from Shifty. Too close for
comfort. Shifty takes a step back.
SHIFTY
I've been busy, mate. You alright?
Trevor assesses Chris.
TREVOR
I need to get hold of some gear.
SHIFTY
There's nothing left Trev, that's
why I haven't answered?
Trevor's face drops.
TREVOR
(Turning nasty)
Don't fucking bullshit me Shifty.
SHIFTY
Mate, call me in an hour and I`ll
sort you out.
TREVOR
You won't answer your phone mate,
you've been blanking me all day.
SHIFTY
Mate, I'm in a rush, I'll call you
later.
58.
TREVOR
Fuck off, I know you're carrying,
don't try and mug me off.
SHIFTY
Take it easy rude boy. Just chill
out.
TREVOR
I am fucking chilled out, I just
don't like being mugged off, do you
know what I mean?
Trevor's in Shifty's face.
SHIFTY
I've had a long fucking day,
Trevor, just leave me alone.
TREVOR
Don't tell me what to fucking do
*
you Paki.
He pushes Shifty hard. Chris steps up.
CHRIS
Mate, leave it out!
Trevor's on Shifty and has him pinned up against the wall,
his hefty hand gripped around his neck, Suddenly he brings a
Stanley knife up to his temple.
TREVOR
Empty your pockets! EMPTY YOUR
FUCKING POCKETS.
CHRIS
Mate what are you doing?
SHIFTY
Just leave it, Chris. Trevor, think
about what you're doing, man.
TREVOR
JUST EMPTY YOUR FUCKING POCKETS.
Trevor edges the knife harder into Shifty's neck. Slowly
Shifty surrenders the large bag of coke and a cellophane bag
of crack with about two grand in cash.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Why do you lie to me you prick, why
do you tell me you weren't fucking
carrying.
SHIFTY
Trevor, you need to calm down.
59.
Trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife
nestling at the tip of Shifty's Adams apple.
TREVOR
Empty your fucking other
*
pockets!... NOW....NOW!
Shifty does what Trevor says.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
And the inside pockets you prick...
NOW!
At that moment, Trevor lowers his knife, Shifty takes heed
*
and grabs him, swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into
*
Trevor's face. They fall into a messy clinch, but their now
*
facing the opposite way. Chris and Shifty turn and sprint as
*
fast as possible. Trevor falls to his knees scrambling for
*
the drugs.
CUT TO:
110
*
Shifty and Chris come to rest behind a gathering of bushes.
Their lungs on fire as they grab for air. Shifty looks down
at his top and realises he's bleeding.
SHIFTY
Oh shit.
CHRIS
Mate, are you alright?
Chris reaches to help him, but Shifty swats away his hand.
SHIFTY
Get off me, man.
CHRIS
Mate, I'm only trying to help.
SHIFTY
It's a bit fucking late now.
CHRIS
Mate, the geezer had a fucking
knife at your throat.
60.
SHIFTY
Yeah exactly mate. Help might have
been fucking nice, do you know what
I mean?
CHRIS
What was I supposed to do?
SHIFTY
You're supposed to fucking help me,
man, fucking do something.
CHRIS
Mate, I'm sorry, I'm just not used
to being fucking mugged in tunnels.
It's not part of my daily routine?
SHIFTY
I'm surprised you didn't do a
fucking runner?
CHRIS
What are you talking about?
SHIFTY
I'm surprised you didn't fucking...
run off and leave me to sort out
the mess.
CHRIS
Fuck you, Shifty. Fuck you, man.
SHIFTY
Why, why, cos I'm speaking the
truth. Talking about the past,
talking about Serena. Oh no you
can't talk about that, you mustn't
talk about Serena.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Let's fucking talk about it. Let's
talk about how you left two weeks
after she died without saying
goodbye to me, everyone fucking
asking me what's going on, every
one saying shit about you, bad
mouthing you, let me tell you about
the fights I had sticking up for
you, the broken nose I got when
some meathead slagged you off,
let's fucking talk about that,
mate.
CHRIS
I left because of one fucking
reason... this shit hole...
(MORE)
61.
CHRIS (CONT'D)

so much... where has this place got
you, man, where has it fucking got
you, smartest kid in the class,
four fucking a levels and you're
getting chased by the police,
getting mugged, selling crack
cocaine to OAP's. Nice life.
SHIFTY
I'll tell you where it's fucking

four thousand a week...How much do
you earn in your little cubicle up
in Manchester...go on how much do
you fucking earn... you probably

CHRIS
You don't know what the fuck I've
been through.
SHIFTY
How would I you prick I haven't
seen you for four years.
CHRIS
Fuck you!
SHIFTY
No FUCK YOU!
Shifty turns and steams off leaving Chris seething.
112
*
Shifty walks down the path and opens the front door, calling
out.
SHIFTY
REZ...
The house is empty.
117
*
Five heavy looking bastards walk out of a house and towards a
serious looking black range rover. One of them opens the boot
and they throw in baseball bats, a crowbar, masking tape.
120
Chris sits on a wall the other side of the road, a carrier
bag full of beer. He sits, drinking, just staring at the
house, the music pumping from within. He watches as people
arrive. He looks about. He's anxious, upset, he doesn't want
to do this on his own.
121
Shifty exits his brothers house. He stands there for a moment
breathing hard, thinking, then heads off with conviction.
69.
127
Trevor sits at the garden table smoking a fag. Jasmine walks
outside.
JASMINE
What's this?
Trevor looks up.
TREVOR
I brought it for you.
He walks past her back into the house and kisses her cheek
she flinches slightly, She stands there for a second soaking
it in.
129
Chris sits on the wall, he downs his beer, straightens
himself up, and walks towards the house. A voice calls out.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
CHRIS!
Chris turns to see Shifty approaching. They stand there for a
moment. Neither one saying anything.
CHRIS
You alright?
SHIFTY
Yeah, I'm alright. You alright.
Chris looks down.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Look man, I'm not gonna do this
party...
Chris nods.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
I've got too much shit to deal
with.
A BEAT.
70.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
You don't have to come with me.
It's up to you?
CHRIS
Yeah, cool, I'll probably just grab
my stuff from yours then.
Shifty nods with acceptance, but Chris smiles.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
As if I'm not gonna come with you
nutter.
Shifty shakes is head.
SHIFTY
Fucking hell, man. I thought you
were gonna leave me cold.
CHRIS
I thought you were used to it.
SHIFTY
There's only so much one man can
take.
They walk off. Chris throws Shifty a light punch.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Now you start throwing punches.
130
Shifty and Chris cross a field, trudging through the ankle
length grass. They reach a hedge. Shifty reaches into the
bushes and starts rummaging around. He pulls out a black bin
liner containing something heavy. He unwraps one bin liner to
reveal another which has been tied with elastic. He undoes
another black bin liner until finally he's left with just a
leather sports bag.
139
Chris and Shifty make their way through the town. Shifty's
walking fast, dictating the pace.
CHRIS
Where are we going?
SHIFTY
To mine.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
We should just go, man, get the
fuck out of this shithole, leave
now, go to Manchester, tonight, I'm
telling you.
SHIFTY
Chris I can't. I'm not leaving...
I'm not leaving my brother.
Silence. They carry on walking, together, side by side.
141
The Range Rover creeps along the streets of Dudlowe.
77.
143
The Range Rover pulls into a turning.
145
The Range Rover turns off it's lights. The guys just sit
there waiting.
147
The Range Rover creeps along with its lights off.
149
The five heavies get out of the jeep. Pulling on balaclava's,
bats, knives, guns at the ready.
151
The five heavies approach the house.
80.
153
The five heavies assemble outside the door. One of them kicks
the front door with an almighty crash.
155
Shifty steps out the front door to look about. It's a nice
day. He looks up and down the street, nothing. He goes to
walk back in the house when suddenly his eye catches
something on the floor. He reaches down and picks up a large
jiffy envelope that's been left leaning against the bin
cupboard. Scribed across the front is: SHIFTY
157
Shifty stands at the river side. Chris beyond, watching.
Shifty reaches into his jacket and pulls out the .38
revolver. He throws it into the river.
CHRIS
Give me your phone.
SHIFTY
What?
CHRIS
Give me your phone?
He takes Shifty's phone and chucks into the river.
JUMP CUT TO:
163
Shifty and Chris sit in silence. The bus pulls up.
