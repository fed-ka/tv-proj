      The quiet of the night is shattered as the body SLAMS into 
      the sidewalk. 

      OVERHEAD ANGLE on Nena, her dead body in angelic repose, 
      blood spreads in a circle around her head, as if surrounding 
      her in a red halo. CAMERA TILTS UP to find the building from 
      where she leapt. Gargoyles on the parapet stand vigil, they 
      appear to watch over the body mockingly.

                                                                          FADE OUT:



      Rosemary walks down a Parisian street, following navigation 
      directions on her phone. Three months have blunted the grief 
      of losing her pregnancy.                                                                                       5.


      Her face reflects the sunny beauty of Paris. There is a 
      lightness in her step. Carrying a small gift bag, Rosemary 
      looks at her phone, turns the corner - into a dead end alley. 
      The young woman stops.

                                  PHONE (V.O.)
                    You have arrived at your 
                      destination.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No. This is not happening.

      She checks the screen. The blinking dot definitely indicates 
      she s there. Cafe  Miro. A PASSERBY walks behind her. 
      Rosemary turns.

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    Excuse me. I seem to be lost. I m 
                    looking for Cafe Miro  on Rue 
                    Geneta? Am I even close?

      The Passerby continues walking as if she doesn t exist. Beat.

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    Thank you for confirming the 
                      stereotype.

      Rosemary looks around. She pulls up another app on her phone, 
      starts typing furiously before approaching two FRENCHMEN 
      smoking cigarettes. They turn to her. She smiles. Rosemary 
      holds up her phone, presses play.

                                  PHONE 
                            (translation app)
                    Je suis perdu. Pouvez-vous me caf  
                    Miro 'rue Greneta diriger?

      As the men begin to gesticulate, pointing her in the right 
      direction.



      Rosemary approaches a woman sitting alone at an outdoor 
      table. As the woman lifts a glass of wine to her lips...

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Jules?

      JULES turn, her face lights up. Attractive but blunt, she s 
      been a friend since college. Jules stands and gives Rosemary 
      a hug. Holds her close...                                                                                      6.


                                  JULES
                    I m sorry.

      Rosemary nods. Doesn t want a pity party. She sets the gift 
      bag on the table in front of Jules.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    That s the last time I want to hear 
                    those words, okay? This is for you. 

                                  JULES
                    No, you didn t.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    For everything you ve done. 

                                  JULES
                    Moi?

                                  ROSEMARY
                    There s no way Guy would have 
                    gotten the job without you. A year 
                    in Paris. Teaching at the Sorbonne.

                                  JULES
                    Listen, all I did was put his C.V. 
                    on top of the pile. He s pretty 
                      impressive all on his own. By the 
                    way, you won t be thanking me once 
                    you see what they consider faculty 
                    housing.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    We ve been there. It s fine. 
                    Actually, it s perfect. It s just 
                    what we needed.

      Jules flags down a waiter, turns to Rosemary.

                                  JULES
                    White okay?
                          (Rosemary nods)
                    Un vin blanc, s il vous plait.

      The waiter places a napkin on the table, then moves off to 
      get the wine.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Your husband still writing the 
                    great American Novel?

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Every time I check, he s one 
                    revision away from  The End.                                                                                       7.


                                  JULES
                    He s always been a great writer. 
                    Problem is he s a perfectionist.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    That he is. And stubborn. And he s 
                    getting angry about it. Maybe Paris 
                    is the push he needs to finally 
                    finish.

                                  JULES
                    What about you?

                                  ROSEMARY
                          (shrugs)
                    I m coping. I ll find something 
                    sooner or later.

                                  JULES
                    Well, there are plenty of non-
                    profits around that could use your 
                    help. Fundraising is more art than 
                    science.

      The waiter returns with a glass of wine. The two friends 
      drink. Jules reaches out and takes Rosemary s hand. There s a 
      genuine closeness between these two.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    I m so happy that you re here. I 
                    want to take care of you. Give me a 
                    chance to pay you back for helping 
                    me survive the year of eating 
                      dangerously.

      Rosemary laughs.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    I mean honestly, what s left after 
                    no carbs, no fat, and no gluten? 

      Rosemary looks around, notices some older people glancing 
      their way. She releases her hand from Jules.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Is it me, or do we look like two 
                    lesbians on a date?

      Jules follows her look, sees the older people looking away.

                                  JULES
                    The hell with them. And don t knock 
                    it  til you tried it.                                                                                      8.

                          (scandalized)
                    Jules! 

                                  JULES
                    Just sayin . So you and Guy are 
                    okay? 

                                  ROSEMARY
                    He s been wonderful. Better to me 
                    than I am to myself.

                                  JULES
                    Rosemary. It s nobody s fault. You 
                    know that.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I know, but I can t help but think, 
                    if I didn t have that glass of 
                    wine, or... whatever. There are a 
                    thousand reasons I can think of, to 
                    feel guilty about. 

                                  JULES
                    And no reasons at all.

      Beat.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    This is exactly what I didn t want 
                    to do.

                                  JULES
                    Okay. When you two get settled, 
                    you ll come to my place for dinner. 
                    None of this French gourmet crap, 
                    I ll make chicken pot pie, that s 
                    Guy s favorite. 

                                  ROSEMARY
                    That s right. How did you know 
                    that?

      Jules pauses for half a beat.

                                  JULES
                    Lucky guess. Do we have a date?

      Rosemary nods, enthusiastic.

                                  ROSEMARY
                      Absolutely.                                                                                      9.


                                  JULES
                    You re so brave, Rosemary. When I 
                    first moved here, it took me a 
                    month before I ventured two blocks 
                    out from my apartment. And I know 
                    how to speak French. I have a 
                    feeling you re going to have a 
                    great adventure. You deserve one.



      Playing tourist for the day, Rosemary walks through the plaza 
      onto a smaller side street. She checks her phone, mapping her 
      next adventure, totally unaware of her surroundings. 
      Suddenly, a GYPSY BOY comes out of nowhere and grabs her 
      purse. Rosemary is yanked off balanced, but she manages to 
      hang on, slowing the boy down.

      He pulls harder, nearly separating her arm from the socket. 
      The strap on the purse breaks, the boy scrambles away with 
      Rosemary hot on his trail.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    You little shit! Give it back.

      The boy looks back behind him in disbelief. Rosemary is 
      actually gaining on him. The boy weaves through people on the 
      sidewalk, running as fast as he can.

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    Stop him. He s got my purse!

      Nobody moves to help. Rosemary is not giving up, she weaves 
      through the crowd only to see the boy running into the 
      street. 

      The boy glances back at Rosemary, a second before a car SLAMS 
      into him. He rolls up onto the hood, SMASHING into the 
      windshield, before landing hard on the ground.

      Rosemary stops short, breathless. She moves toward the 
      accident. The boy is hidden from sight on the other side of 
      the car. 

      The DRIVER gets out, going around the car. He picks up 
      Rosemary s purse and a wallet, along with some of the 
      scattered contents. Suddenly, the boy gets up from the ground 
      and hobbles away.

      Rosemary moves to the Driver, who hands her the stolen purse. 
      She watches the boy disappearing into the city.                                                                                     10.


                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    Is he alright?

                                  DRIVER
                          (in French)
                    You can t kill a cockroach.

      The Driver gets back into his car. Rosemary steps aside as he 
      drives away. She picks up a few remaining items on the 
      ground. Lipstick. Compact. Before moving to the sidewalk.

      Rosemary looks into her purse. Finds her passport. Sees the 
      wallet. She takes it out. It s designer chic, elegant.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    This isn t mine.

      She opens the wallet to see a wad of cash and credit cards 
      and a picture I.D. with an address. She looks at the picture - 
      an elegant woman. Even her I.D. photo looks beautiful. 
      Margaux Castevet.   

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    Margaux Castevet. This is your 
                    lucky day.



      WE VE seen this place before. Might recognize it as the same 
      street where Nena made her desperate suicide. In daylight, 
      the street looks magnificent. Sparkling clean. Surrounded by 
      grand beautiful buildings. Rosemary steps up to an impressive 
      structure. It s ancient, but immaculately maintained. 
      Gargoyles stand watch over the parapet. Everything about it 
      speaks of wealth and power. A plaque at the entrance reads 
       La Chime re.  



      The black limousine glides through the City Of Lights. Paris 
      is never more romantic and magnificent.                                                                                     15.



      The same scarf, wrapped around Rosemary s neck as she walks 
      onto the campus. She still has her  regular  wardrobe, except 
      for the finery keeping her warm on this brisk day. Rosemary 
      carries a small hamper - lunch for her and Jules.

      Up ahead, Jules sits waiting, smoking a cigarette. She sees 
      Rosemary, snubs out her smoke, and gives our girl a hug.

                                  JULES
                    It s about time you came to visit 
                    me. I was jonesing for my Rosemary 
                    fix.

      They start walking through the beautiful campus.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    It s been crazy. With the accident 
                    and moving. I spent the last week 
                    trying to organize the new place, 
                    find some local store we can 
                    afford. I swear, everything cost 
                    double where we live.

                                  JULES
                    You re living with the point zero 
                    zero one percent. It s a whole 
                    different world. 

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Well, we certainly don t belong.

                                  JULES
                    Did Guy tell you I put him up for a 
                    new job?

      Rosemary shakes her head.                                                                                    31.


                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    The post opened up when one of our 
                      professors suddenly  retired  with 
                    a co-ed to one of those clothing 
                    optional islands in Greece.

                    What s the position?

                                  JULES
                      Ironically, teaching Romanticism. 

      Jules smiles and waves at a passing Professor, who gives her 
      a curt nod back. The man looks rather stern, like if he 
      smiled his skin would crack. This is PROFESSOR FUCHS.

                    That s Guy s main competition. 
                    Professor Ludwig Fuchs.

                                  ROSEMARY
                          (laughs)
                    Sounds severe.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah. And he walks like he s got a 
                    stick up his ass. Very well 
                    published though. It d be a lot 
                    more money, plus the prestige.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Guy doesn t care about money. He 
                    wants to start writing again. I 
                    think he s had writer s block since 
                    the miscarriage.

                                  JULES
                    He needs a new muse. I d watch out 
                    for the co-eds.  

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I m not worried.

                                  JULES
                    You re that confident.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No, I checked them out before the 
                    term started. Didn t see his type.

      Jules laughs.                                                                                    32.


                                  JULES
                    Your husband never had a wandering 
                    eye. Not after he met you. 

                                  ROSEMARY
                    You re sweet.

                                  JULES
                    Where should we eat? There are the 
                    benches by the garden. Or if it s 
                    too cold, we can go to my office.

      Rosemary looks across the campus, she stops. Furrows her 
      brow.

      ROSEMARY S POV - CAMPUS

      Guy and Roman are in an animated discussion. It looks like 
      Roman is doing most of the talking. 

      RETURN

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Let s go to your office.

      Jules leads the way. Rosemary fingers her scarf, suddenly 
      feeling guilty about wearing it.

                                  JULES
                    Hey, I like your scarf.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    You do? Here take it.

      Rosemary puts her scarf on Jules who is pleasantly surprised.

                                  JULES
                    I like your husband.

      Rosemary gives her a sharp look.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    What? You re not wearing anything 
                    else I want.

      Rosemary laughs. She turns back to look across campus. Guy 
      and Roman sit close together. Conspiratorial.



      After a day of classes, Guy walks across campus to the Metro 
      station. His bag slung over his shoulder, he looks more like 
      one of the students than a teacher. 

      As he is about to join the crowd into the underground, a 
      black limousine pulls up to the curb. A window rolls down.

                                  ROMAN
                    Guy, can I offer you a lift?

      Guy pauses. Roman smiles.

                                  GUY
                    Is this a coincidence or are you 
                      developing a man crush? 

                                  ROMAN
                    Believe me, my interest is purely 
                    platonic.

                                  GUY
                    Sure, thanks. Save me a fare.

      Guy gets in. Sits across from Roman in the long sedan.



      Margaux moves through the floral area of an outdoor market 
      with Rosemary tagging along. Every kind of plants and flowers 
      are for sale. The scene is filled with color and vibrancy.  

                                    MARGAUX
                    I m so glad you decided to come 
                    along. Roman wouldn t be caught 
                    dead at the flower market.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I adore them. To me flowers 
                    represent love.

                                    MARGAUX
                    Of course, many do. The most famous 
                    being the rose. But flowers have 
                    many meanings. 

      She points out a couple...

                                    MARGAUX (CONT D)
                    Amaryllis represents pride. Poppies 
                    are symbols of magic, fertility, 
                    eternal life. Baby s breath means 
                    purity of heart and innocence.                                                                                    48.


      Margaux begins to gather flowers into a basket for a large 
      bouquet. Rosemary appears to be waiting for the right moment. 
      She hands Margaux some flowers...

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I was wondering. Who lived in our 
                    apartment before us?

      Margaux gives the slightest of pauses...

                                    MARGAUX
                    Why do you want to know?

                                  ROSEMARY
                    It s such a great place. Just can t 
                    imagine anybody wanting to move 
                    out. 

      Margaux remains silent.

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    What were they like, do you 
                    remember?

                                    MARGAUX
                          (shakes her head)
                    They didn t make much of an 
                      impression.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Do you know why they left?

      Margaux picks up a bunch of yellow flowers, hands them to 
      Rosemary.

                                    MARGAUX
                    I want to get these for you. 

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Thank you. They re beautiful.

                                    MARGAUX
                    They re Day Lilies. It means forget 
                    your worries. 

      On Rosemary with the flowers, her questions will not be 
      answered today.



      Flustered, Jules walks out of the building into the 
      courtyard. CAMERA ADJUSTS to find Laura Veaulieu on a bench, 
      a book in her hand. She watches Jules leave, then looks up at 
      the administration building.

      CAMERA WHIP PANS across the courtyard to another figure 
      outside. Mr. Wees is entering the garden area. He also stops, 
      as if waiting for something. In his hand, the same book.

      From ANOTHER ANGLE, Victoria Plasir ENTERS FRAME. By now, it 
      should become clear these are guests we ve seen at Margaux 
      and Roman s party. Victoria spreads a blanket on the ground, 
      she lays back on the blanket as if to enjoy the sun, she 
      places the same book on her chest, a hand touching it. 

      CLOSE - BOOK

        A compendium of criticism by Professor Fuchs.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Yoshiro Kawashiri rides up on a bicycle. He parks the bike, 
      takes the book out of his backpack.

      The four guests are at different areas of the courtyard, far 
      away from one another. No one looking at these four people 
      should make a connection that they are together in any way.

      Without a word or a glance to one another, the four begin to 
      subtly and silently move their mouths, as if repeating a 
      mantra. Their fingers make tiny circles on the books.



      Remaining far apart from one another, the four guests of the 
      party subtly and rhythmically repeat a phrase - one we do not 
      hear. Their fingers continue moving on the book.



      The entrance to the administration building has been cordoned 
      off by law enforcement. Police vehicles with flashing lights, 
      ambulances and a coroner s van are parked against the 
      building. ONLOOKERS are held away from the perimeter beyond 
      that.

      CAMERA FINDS Guy sitting alone on the side steps. He is 
      trying to make sense of what just happened. Jules comes up to 
      him, she is shaken, her eyes are puffy from crying.

                                  JULES
                    Dr. Carraro is going to be okay. I 
                    guess the scissors didn t reach any 
                    vital organs.

                                  GUY
                    That s good news.

                                  JULES
                    Do you have any idea what happened?

      Guy shakes his head.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    I never thought Professor Fuchs was 
                    capable of anything like that. I 
                    mean, he wasn t so much fun at 
                    parties, but I didn t expect him to 
                    have a psychotic break.

                                  GUY
                    I guess you never know what s 
                    hiding in a person s heart.

      Jules nods. 

                                  JULES
                      I probably shouldn t be bringing 
                    this up right now, but this is good 
                    for you.

                                  GUY
                    Don t, Jules.

                                  JULES
                    I mean it. It s sick, but now 
                    you re the best candidate for the 
                    job.                                                                                     54.


                                  GUY
                    I m not going to think about that. 
                    I don t want to prosper from 
                    somebody else s misfortune.

                                  JULES
                    Can you stop being a pussy for a 
                    second? You had nothing to do with 
                    his misfortune. He was bipolar, or 
                    on drugs or whatever.

      Guy looks away from Jules. 

      GUY S POV - A DARK FIGURE

      On the sidewalk beyond the crowd, a silhouetted man. He walks 
      with a cane, looks very much like Roman.

      RETURN

      Guy sits up. The hairs stand on the back of his neck.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                  GUY
                    Will you excuse me?

      Guy moves quickly away from Jules. He works his way past the 
      police vehicles, through the crowd of onlookers. 

                                  GUY (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    Roman!

      He finally clears the crowd, only to find the figure is gone. 
      Nowhere to be found. On Guy s rising disquiet...



      Strings of light are stretched across the roof top like stars 
      in the sky. A round table is placed in the middle of the 
      expanse. A large bouquet of flowers sits over starched linen. 
      The place settings are exquisite. 

      This is more of an intimate gathering than a party. Guests 
      include Laura Veaulieu, Mr. Wees, Victoria Plasir, Yoshiro 
      Kawashiri and Jules, who is enjoying a glass of wine with 
      Guy.                                                                                    58.


      The door opens to the rooftop. Rosemary steps out in the 
      dress. She is stunningly beautiful. Rosemary is met by 
      Margaux and Roman who gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                                    MARGAUX
                    Do I know how to pick a dress?

                                  ROMAN
                    You know how to pick a lady.

      Rosemary looks around, sees Jules and Guy who move to her. 
      Jules greets her with a hug and a kiss.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    Jules! What a surprise?

      She turns to Guy.

                                  ROSEMARY (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  JULES
                    Your husband is the new chair of 
                    the Department of Romanticism at 
                    the Sorbonne.

                                  GUY
                    I made the mistake of letting Roman 
                    know, and the rest is history. This 
                    is their idea.

                                  ROMAN
                    Life should be celebrated. 
                      Particularly when good things 
                    happen to good people.

      Rosemary gives Guy a kiss.

                                  ROSEMARY
                      Congratulations. I hope this is 
                      everything you wanted.

                                  GUY
                    Not exactly. Come here.

      He leads Rosemary away from the others. They move to the edge 
      of the roof top. Paris is before them. It s as romantic a 
      backdrop as can be.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    What s the matter?

                                  GUY
                    I think we should try again.                                                                                    59.


                                  ROSEMARY
                    What?

                                  GUY
                    I want us to have a baby.

      Rosemary looks at him...

                                  GUY (CONT D)
                    I think it s time. It s going to be 
                    different here. I can feel it. 

      She moves into his arms, holding him tight.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I believe you. 

      They kiss to affirm their shared desire. 

                                    MARGAUX
                          (calls out)
                    Did she say yes? Does she want a 
                    baby?

      Rosemary looks to Margaux then turns to Guy.

                                  GUY
                    I did not tell her, I swear.

      Rosemary s broad smile gives Margaux her answer. Everyone 
      APPLAUDS politely. Margaux moves to them.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    How did you know?

                                    MARGAUX
                    What else can it be? You have 
                      everything.

      Margaux brings out a small black box.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No more gifts.

                                    MARGAUX
                    No, this is not a frivolous thing, 
                    like a dress. This is serious.

      She opens the box to REVEAL a necklace with the gold amulet - 
      the same one Nena wore before her death. Margaux takes it out 
      and hangs the amulet around Rosemary s neck.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    What is it?                                                                                    60.


                                    MARGAUX
                    A family heirloom, filled with 
                    Tannis root from my greenhouse. 

      Rosemary breathes in the perfume of the amulet. Her head 
      swims with lightness.  

                                  ROSEMARY
                    It s pungent. 

                                    MARGAUX
                    It s actually quite powerful. It s 
                    there to protect you and the baby 
                    soon to be inside you. Promise me 
                    you ll wear it.

      Rosemary touches the charm, somehow, it comforts her. The 
      gold amulet sits twinkling around her neck.



      Jules takes a big gulp of her wine, stares at the person 
      across the table from her.

                                  JULES
                    So you re not just falling, he s 
                    pushing you off the building.

      Rosemary nods. Takes a sip of her tea.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    I m going to get you a glass of 
                    wine.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I m not drinking, remember? I m 
                    trying to detox before I ovulate. 
                    Which, according to my calender, is 
                    next Tuesday.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, maybe you need to rethink 
                    this whole getting pregnant thing.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JULES
                    Your dream. It s so obvious. 
                    Falling in a dream means you re 
                    anxious about something, you re 
                    afraid of losing control. Guy 
                    pushing you means exactly that. 
                    What did he push you into recently? 
                    By the way, very publicly.  

                                  ROSEMARY
                    But I m ready to try again.

                                  JULES
                    Your subconscious says you re not.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No. It s not that. 

      Rosemary takes out the picture of Nena and Jacques from her 
      purse. She hands it to Jules who looks at it, puzzled.                                                                                    63.


                                  JULES
                    I don t get it. Is Guy pressuring 
                    you into wife swapping?

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No! This is Nena and Jacques, they 
                    lived in our apartment three months 
                    ago. She either jumped off, or 
                    maybe was pushed off the balcony in 
                    our bedroom.

                                  JULES
                    Creepy.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    They re still trying to find him. 
                    Maybe my dream is a premonition.

                                  JULES
                    You think Guy is going to kill you? 
                    Boy, you really do need a drink.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    No. I don t think that. Of course 
                    not. I just know that whatever my 
                    dream meant, she had the answer. 
                    But now I ll never know because 
                    she s dead. 

      Jules studies the photograph.

                                  JULES
                    Maybe you can go talk to her 
                    friends.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I don t know anything about her. 
                    How would I find her friends?

      Jules points to a small tattoo on the inside of Nena s wrist.

                                  JULES
                    See that? That s a symbol for 
                    Coptic Christians. If she s devout 
                    enough to tattoo it on her wrist, 
                    she probably went to church. 
                    There s only one Coptic church in 
                    Paris.                                                                                    64.



      The Egyptian church rises in mid Paris. Though it is a 
      Christian church, the architecture and iconography have a 
      distinctly middle Eastern feel. 



      A SERIES OF SURREAL SHOTS:

      -- A PROSTITUTE leads a customer by the hand down a dark 
      alley. 

      -- In the shadows, he strips her top off. He s rough, but she 
      likes it that way.

                                  FATHER TEKEM (V.O.)
                    I saw him. In an alley in 
                      Belleville. Where the prostitutes 
                    ply their trade.

      -- The bodies twist, REVEALING the Blue Eyed Man. He raises a 
      sacrificial dagger.                                                                                    68.


      -- With a hand silencing her scream, the woman cannot escape 
      the dagger as it plunges into her chest.

      -- With demonic strength, the Blue Eyed Man pulls out her 
      heart. As he takes a bloody bite...

                                  FATHER TEKEM (V.O.)
                    He sacrificed a whore. Marcato 
                    killed her and ate her heart. 



      Guy walks briskly through the campus. A pretty co-ed, 
      MARIANNE, runs to catch up with him. 

                                  MARIANNE
                    Professor Woodhouse, I want to say 
                    I m excited for your class.

                                  GUY
                    Thank you...

                                  MARIANNE
                    Marianne.

                                  GUY
                    Call me Guy. You re in my Lake 
                    Poets seminar. Second row center. 
                    Right?                                                                                    71.


      She beams, so happy he remembers. 

                                  MARIANNE
                    I know you re new in Paris. If you 
                    need someone to show you what the 
                    real Paris is like, anytime...

                                  GUY
                    Thanks Marianne, I might take you 
                    up on that.

      She waves happily. Goes on her way. Guy smiles to himself, 
      getting hit on by a pretty young girl isn t the worse thing 
      in the world.

                                    JACQUES (O.S.)
                    It feels good when everything goes 
                    your way.

      CAMERA PANS to REVEAL Jacques Pascal walking a step behind 
      Guy.

                                  GUY
                    Yeah, sure.

                                    JACQUES
                    Pretty soon it ll feel quite 
                    natural to always be on top. It s 
                      addictive. You ll find yourself 
                    doing anything to stay there.

                                  GUY
                    You make it a habit to walk next to 
                    strangers and talk nonsense?

                                    JACQUES
                    It s an art. The seduction.

      Guy takes a closer look at his companion, seems vaguely 
      familiar.

                                  GUY
                    Do I know you?

                                    JACQUES
                    But nothing comes without a price. 
                    You know that.

      Guy stops, turns and faces him.

                                  GUY
                    I m not having this conversation 
                    with a stranger. Who are you?                                                                                    72.


                                    JACQUES
                    I am you.

      A HONK o.s., Guy turns to see Roman s limousine waiting for 
      him up ahead. He turns back but Jacques is already walking 
      away. Guy considers as he walks to the limo. Roman steps out 
      to greet him.

                                  ROMAN

                    want to meet you, today.

      Guy is thrilled. They climb into the limousine.



      The meal seems to have lifted everyone s spirits. The couples 
      come out the front door to the waiting limousine. 

                                    MARGAUX
                    Roman, let s walk. I need to clear 
                    my head from the wine.

      She starts walking ahead, taking Guy s arm for support. Roman 
      turns to the limo DRIVER, who is holding the door open...

      The Driver nods. Roman catches up to Rosemary. She takes his 
      arm as they follow Margaux and Guy.

                    was the flames on his body. Perhaps 
                    the new apartment. Or your sweet

                    No. It was you. Just hearing the

      Roman smiles, as they walk along, Roman seems to sense 
      something. He glances back behind them...

      Jacques steps up, levels the gun at Roman s head, point

      Guy quickly dials. On Rosemary s stunned terror...

                                        END ACT NINE                                                                                    82.


                                            ACT TEN



      Right after the shooting. Commissioner Fountain checks the 
      bodies...

                                  COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
                    They re still alive. Call for help.

      As Guy dials, Commissioner Fountain moves away to call for 
      police backup. Margaux rushes to her husband, checks him 
      quickly before turning to Jacques. She appears to check his 
      pulse...

      CLOSE - MARGAUX S HAND

      She is actually taking the ring off of Jacques  finger.
