LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY
Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury
box roof.
The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them.
Yet
they are alone in the world.
She dangles her legs, and we can hear
her kicking the glass below.
JULIANNE
I just admire your maturity,
that's all.
I mean, there are
people who would find that kind of
perfection boring.
Day after day,
year after year...
MICHAEL
... see, that's what I thought at
first.
How can you like someone
that perfect? No potential for
long-range livability.
Drinking their beers.
Side by side.
Both stare only at the game.
MICHAEL
Luckily.
The closer I watched,
the more the fault came into
focus.
Each imperfection its own
adorable slice of vulnerability.
JULIANNE
Such as.
MICHAEL
She's too genuine.
JULIANNE
Hate that.
MICHAEL
How can you trust someone you
can never mistrust?
JULIANNE
What's next?
Keep sipping.
Never look at each other.
MICHAEL
No matter how many times I
leave the toilet seat up, she
forgets and puts it down.
JULIANNE
Endearingly absent-minded.
MICHAEL
My very point.
Here's another one...
Shakes his head.
This one really gets him.
MICHAEL
Every day.
She makes the bed.
JULIANNE
Quite the little eccentric.
MICHAEL
At first, I thought it was a
gag, but she's always done it!
This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for.
JULIANNE
Is there a coup de grace in
here, somewh...
MICHAEL
She admires.
Tommy Lasorda.
JULIANNE
Waiter! Check, please!
MICHAEL
She finds him "personable."
JULIANNE
Can that kind of defect be
passed on genetically?
She looks over now.
And Michael is looking back.
Smiling the most
wonderful smile.
Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her,
until...
MICHAEL
Then again.
She has a few good
traits.
Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...
JULIANNE
Gimme like, eight and nine off
the top ten list...
MICHAEL
First girl I ever knew.
Who
lets me give her a bath.
The look in his eyes.
She can hardly bear it.
MICHAEL
And when I hug her, even in
public.
I don't have to let go
right away.
She lets me hold
her as long as I want.
He seems so deeply in love.
MICHAEL
Nice kid, don't you think?
A beat.
A slow nod.
A quiet...
JULIANNE
Looks like, from here.
CLUB - NIGHT
Michael putting Kim in the back of a cab.
As Julianne watches.
MICHAEL
Because I could come...
KIMMY
To the twins' soiree?
So they
can paw you and drool...?
JULIANNE (calls out, helpful)
They're gonna drool anyway!
Kim smiles.
He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.
She
waves past him at Julianne.
KIMMY (to both)
Enjoy each other.
And drives off.
As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him.
Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle.
Starts giving a little
massage.
JULIANNE
Should I whistle down a cab?
MICHAEL
Hey, cabs are expensive.
I'm
cheap, remember?
Turns his head, to see her.
She's still rubbing his shoulder.
JULIANNE
Sometimes.
About the dumbest
things.
Share a smile.
As always, it covers a lot of years.
MICHAEL
The El's right down the street.
Unless you're afraid of the
neighborhood.
She looks around.
It is an issue.
But she remembers...
JULIANNE
No.
I'm always safe with you.
She means that.
He takes her by the hand.
They begin walking...
JULIANNE
Pretty amazing girl, you've got.
Make that kind of sacrifice.
MICHAEL
What, leaving school...
JULIANNE
... all of it.
She's leaving her
family, her friends, everything she
knows.
She's putting her career
on hold, and she seems a pretty
ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
MICHAEL (quietly)
In her way.
JULIANNE
All to follow you in this dumb
job, where you travel 52 weeks
a year to College Station, Texas,
and such.
It's not a job for a
grown man, Michael, Peter Pan
never married.
He's let go of her hand now.
Looking down at the pavement before
him, fists in his jacket pockets.
JULIANNE (softly)
I don't think she's naturally
the... submissive type.
Aren't you
afraid she's gonna choke on this
stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...
MICHAEL (real quiet)
No.
Hit a nerve.
This is promising.
JULIANNE
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable
sports... most girls in her spot would
be angling to get Daddy to offer you
some juicy gig right here in t...
MICHAEL
She would never.
Never.
Even think
of that.
Paydirt.
Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk.
JULIANNE
I guess you're right.
That would
be deceitful... manipulative...
controlling... emascula...
MICHAEL
I got the point.
He looks over at her.
No smile on his face.
An edge we haven't
seen.
She shrugs...
JULIANNE
Still.
All's fair in love and
w...
MICHAEL
That would be a girl.
I don't
even know.
They've reached the stairs to the El.
A rickety train RATTLES
above them.
As they start up, she slips her arm around his
waist...
JULIANNE (murmurs)
Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'
crazy.
He slides his arm around her shoulder.
Pals.
They climb out of
frame.
ZOO - DAY
Michael and Julianne walking together.
He's eating his popcorn.
She carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle
cone, and a large drink.
MICHAEL
You're not eating.
JULIANNE
I never eat when I'm serene.
MICHAEL
You never eat when you're
despondent.
JULIANNE
I switched that around when you
weren't looking.
She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.
But her heart isn't in it.
MICHAEL
Last zoo we were in was...
Beijing, yeah?
Sure.
The rhinos
were fucking.
JULIANNE
Boy, those were the days.
And when she looks over.
His eyes are waiting.
MICHAEL
(softly)
Yeah, they were.
They're passing the hippo pen.
But they don't notice.
JULIANNE
That was nice.
The way you
said that.
So was that.
He's feeling restless, something.
Doesn't know quite
what to say.
MICHAEL
It's weird being the groom.
All
these things Kimmy has to take
care of...
JULIANNE
You need a baby-sitter.
That's
what I'm here for.
He holds her eyes.
Then looks down.
Awkward.
And the way he's
doing it begins to excite her.
JULIANNE
Say it.
He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is
about to...
... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.
We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.
His face from
shock... to amusement.
MICHAEL
Now, there's my girl.
... to tenderness.
PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
cardboard container.
Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.
It is really awful.
Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.
Her eyes
fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...
JULIANNE
See, I can only do it with
beer.
He takes out his handkerchief.
And with that and his hands, gently
scoops the worst of the mess off her.
The fact that he's touching
her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.
She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't
know why.
Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.
To the world
looking on, they are lovers.
MICHAEL
(murmurs)
See, better already.
And he kisses her face.
Not quite her lips.
But only an inch away.
We can feel her heart pounding.
He strips off his shirt, only a tank
top underneath.
MICHAEL
We'll go back to the bathroom,
you'll put this on...
Okay? She sniffles, okay.
Swallows.
JULIANNE
Bet you're glad I'm here to
take care of you.
He puts his arm around her.
MICHAEL
Bet I am.
Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...
MICHAEL
Hope that crazy person's not
still there.
We're on their backs...
JULIANNE (O.S.)
She doesn't scare me.
BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET
Julianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
beach club.
Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...
... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.
We SCAN
with her to find a crowd around...
... a three-on-three volleyball game.
Kimmy and two groomsmen on
one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.
The twins wear
spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
predictably uninhabited.
As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...
... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
defense.
The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
him a savage...
... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
proud of.
It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
Laughter, applause.
The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.
Kim plays good
sport.
Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...
... dashes off.
Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
set up.
Manned by beach club staff and family alike.
Michael's
pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.
Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
Julianne races across the sand to...
... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
clearly enjoying himself.
Julianne runs up to him, says something
into his ear.
He looks at her.
Then turns his station over to a
club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.
CLOSE now.
As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
He's watching her profile, curious, silent.
At the water's edge...
JULIANNE
(whispers)
Is anybody watching?
WALTER
I hope so.
This is all too
mysterious to waste on just me.
She reaches into her big bag.
Pulls out a single folded sheet of
paper.
JULIANNE
I picked up Michael's messages
for him, at our hotel.
I stole
one...
His face darkens.
The easy smile fades.
He holds up his palms...
WALTER
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's
mail, is not something...
JULIANNE
Sir, this is important! Haven't
you ever in your life cut one
corner, to make something important
turn out right?
His smile returns.
Just a little.
WALTER
Matter of fact, that's how I got
married.
The look holds.
She thrusts the paper out.
He still doesn't take
it.
JULIANNE
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated
from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
WALTER
(quickly)
I know Ben.
She opens the paper.
JULIANNE
"Mike.
We still have no answer to
our E-mail of Wednesday.
Which
option do you select? I don't mean
to rush you, but Personnel needs to
tie up the loose ends."
He takes the paper.
We see it now.
Looks authentic.
JULIANNE
I think he's been fired.
WALTER
It doesn't say th...
JULIANNE
He's said some things over the
past few weeks.
Look, this is why
I came up with the idea of you
offering him a job.
He looks up.
He's listening.
Closely.
JULIANNE
And why I couldn't say anything
before in front of Kim.
She bites her lip.
Seems so earnest.
JULIANNE
I just think of how... desperate
he must be feeling.
He's marrying
a rich man's daughter, and he's
about to become destitute.
You
know the kind of job market he'll
be facing?
He does.
WALTER
And you think he's kept this to
himself.
JULIANNE
He's too proud to beg for help.
And if you wait till this comes out,
your offer will be like charity.
Completely humiliating.
He's staring at her.
But his mind is working behind his eyes.
JULIANNE
If you do it now, it's like he's
helping you.
He can accept with
dignity.
He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.
WALTER
This fax could mean... any number
of things...
She nods.
She knows that.
WALTER
(softly)
Maybe.
I should call Ben.
JULIANNE
Then it could all come out, sooner
or later.
Nobody should be in on
this.
Just you and me.
Or, more
correctly, I.
She takes the paper back.
JULIANNE
What if, what if I could find
that E-mail?
The long straight look.
Maybe he's hooked.
JULIANNE
I never noticed.
Kimmy has your
eyes.
O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY
Skycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty
Japanese tourists.
A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.
Out
jumps...
Michael.
Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.
Digger says
something, Michael gives him a strong HUG.
Julianne raises one
finger to Michael, back in a second.
Leads Digger off by the hand.
CLOSE on them now.
Alone in the throng.
JULIANNE
Bye, handsome.
Digger just stares at her.
Those maddening judgemental eyes.
JULIANNE
You're going to say it, aren't
you?
DIGGER
Tell him you love him.
With
all your heart.
JULIANNE
I'm taking my next book to
Viking.
DIGGER
Tell him you've loved him for
nine years, but you were afraid
to realize it.
JULIANNE
I'm moving this book to Viking.
DIGGER
Tell him you're afraid of love.
Afraid of needing.
JULIANNE
Needing.
DIGGER
To belong to someone.
He touches her hair.
DIGGER
We all do, beautiful.
I'm sorry
about that.
Staring in her eyes.
Even Julianne has run out of words.
DIGGER
Tell him you know this is the
worst, dumbest, cruelest moment
to do this to him.
But there
it is, and he has to choose.
JULIANNE
And what will he do?
Digger isn't smiling.
His voice low, beneath the crowd...
DIGGER
He'll choose Kim.
You'll stand
by her at her wedding.
You'll
kiss him good-bye.
And you'll
go home.
He holds up one finger.
Almost touching her nose.
DIGGER
This is what you've come to do.
Now do it.
Wow.
She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.
She
kisses him on the lips.
And walks away.
He watches her go through the crowd.
Take
Michael's hand.
Lead him back toward the taxi.
SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY
The skyline of Chicago moves past us.
Slowly.
The NBC Tower,
Cityfront Center...
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Big weddings are so strange.
JULIANNE (O.S.)
You keep saying that.
Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Kim has all this stuff to do,
I hardly see her.
JULIANNE (O.S.)
Well, you've got the rest of
your lives.
REVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down
the Chicago River.
Wind-blown.
Close together.
JULIANNE
Getting your bed made.
Every
day.
They smile at each other.
Seem so comfortable together.
JULIANNE
You miss her, huh?
MICHAEL
No.
I've got you.
She nods.
That you have.
Staring in her eyes...
MICHAEL
Don't you throw up on boat?
JULIANNE
If you like.
And she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly
disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.
He laughs, as he
pulls her back down to the deck.
Of course, it was all a joke.
He
brushes back her hair.
Sighs.
Stares.
MICHAEL
I've been thinking a lot the
last couple days.
About us,
actually.
JULIANNE
(casual)
Have you.
He has.
JULIANNE
Well.
There's a lot of memories
to choose from...
MICHAEL
It's more than that.
That tightens her throat pretty good.
When she tries to speak, out
comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.
Softer, this time.
MICHAEL
I mean, it's embarrassing to
say it this way, but...
He stops.
Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.
So he
smiles.
She knows how to put him at ease.
MICHAEL
You've sort of been... y'know,
the woman in my life.
JULIANNE
(straight back)
You've been the man in mine.
Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.
No one knows quite what
to say.
MICHAEL
And I was thinking this could be
our last time.
Alone.
Together.
You know?
JULIANNE
Except for the hot affairs we'll
have twice a year.
MICHAEL
Except for that.
She's smiling so easily.
Who would guess her stomach is double-
knotted.
MICHAEL
I can hardly wait for your
wedding.
JULIANNE
Me either.
She watches his surprise.
MICHAEL
Boy, I never thought I'd hear you
say that.
Can I come?
She holds herself together.
Real soft with...
JULIANNE
I couldn't have it without you.
He's glad to hear that.
And then...
MICHAEL
It's normal to have... second
thoughts, huh? To be scared.
Is this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been
praying for.
JULIANNE
I wouldn't know.
I never had
that many first thoughts.
MICHAEL
I mean, you commit to a wedding.
And then it seems like... this...
momentum, you know?
You forget
you... chose it.
She nods.
Understands.
MICHAEL
You and I.
I mean, in all our
relationships with other people...
We didn't use the word "love"
a lot, did we?
We didn't.
MICHAEL
Kimmy says.
When you love someone.
You say it, you say it out loud.
Right now.
Or the moment...
Long beat.
MICHAEL
... passes you by, yeah.
She's a
smart girl.
Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
of water across the river.
For Michael and Julianne it goes
unnoticed.
MICHAEL
We don't have a song.
Hmm?
MICHAEL
Kimmy and I.
We don't have a song.
Is that a bad sign?
All Julianne can do is shrug.
Then...
MICHAEL
(sings, softly)
Someday, when I'm awfully low...
And the world is cold...
She doesn't want to cry.
So she puts all the strength she has into
fighting it back.
MICHAEL
(sings)
I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...
And the way you look.
Tonight.
He stops.
Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.
MICHAEL
Dance card filled?
JULIANNE
I'll check.
I have it on
powerbook, these days.
He holds up his arms.
And she moves into them.
He begins to dance
with her, turning so slowly.
And, yes, people are watching.
MICHAEL
(sings in her ear)
With each word, your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart...
She holds him closer.
Bites her lip.
MICHAEL
(sings)
And that laugh
That wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart.
He stops.
He looks at her.
She's still in his arms.
MICHAEL
Where did we first hear th...
JULIANNE
(straight back)
The night we met.
Right to his eyes...
JULIANNE
The night we fell in love.
He doesn't know what to do with that.
MICHAEL
So we heard it... like, right
that... that first...
JULIANNE
We danced to it.
Just like this.
Just like this.
A long beat.
And he has to say...
MICHAEL
I won't lose you, will I?
Her eyes close.
Then open.
Utterly lost in his.
JULIANNE
No.
Because I won't let you.
DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
VIEW through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby.
PULL BACK to see Julianne, just as she...
... KICKS the shit out of the glass! Almost breaks her foot.
JULIANNE
I can't believe this!
PULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key
ring in the heavy lock.
Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES.
Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.
MICHAEL
It's no big deal, she just gave
you the wrong keys that's s...
JULIANNE
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?
A JANITOR?
A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL
TAKE A BURGLAR!
SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA BE IN TH...
And she SLAMS her whole BODY against the glass, making it rattle ominously.
JULIANNE
WHERE'S A BRICK?
FIND ME A
GODDAMN BRICK!!
She looks around wildly, hysterical.
MICHAEL
What is the big deal about
getting this file tonight?
A good question.
She needs a good answer.
JULIANNE
I promised Digger I'd E-mail him
those figures.
From his face, that wasn't it.
JULIANNE
They are very important figures.
Apparently.
He's just staring at her.
JULIANNE
I'm up against a deadline.
MICHAEL
Me, too.
I'm getting married
tomorrow.
JULIANNE
That's my point!!
Now.
He really doesn't get it.
JULIANNE
I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be
busy with more important things.
So...
So?
JULIANNE
... tonight's my last chance.
He sighs.
MICHAEL
I forgot how cute you look.
When
you get impossible.
JULIANNE
It's just... up there... right in
front of Walter's... y'know, computer.
If memory serves.
Helpless.
JULIANNE
We could use... his computer, to...
just E-mail those suckers right ou...
MICHAEL
Tomorrow is Sunday.
Nobody's doing
business.
Crack of dawn, Monday,
Walter'll take you up there...
Her eyes fill with tears.
He is mystified.
Smiles tenderly.
MICHAEL
(softly)
Give it up, kid.
Touches her hair.
MICHAEL
You can't win 'em all.
And slowly, he takes her hand.
Leads her way.
She takes one
backward glance at the locked door.
Her last dream dies.
WALLACE ESTATE - DAY
Julianne climbs from her taxi.
Only slightly in awe, she sets off
past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
and timber.
It's a hike today, because the circular drives is
clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for
space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance
trucks, catering and florist and food vans.
ROSE GARDEN - DAAY
A steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,
altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
tables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by
rolling carts.
There, at the head table, Michael staring at us.
He looks like a
poor attempt to cover a hard night.
She locks onto his eyes.
What
the hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable.
She gestures
with her head, follow me.
Stalks off.
SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY
Bronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of
children's swings, regulation playground size.
Julianne sits in
one, moving slightly back and forth.
Trying to hold on to her
temper and her sanity.
In the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,
where crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight.
The
circus has come to town.
When she looks back...
Michael approaches.
Before he can draw a breath...
JULIANNE
I had the craziest dream last
night?
Walter and Kimmy had
asked your boss to...
MICHAEL
Look, I came down here to face
everybody.
I didn't want to
slink away like some coward...
JULIANNE
But the Scotch salmon was so
fucking good, you decided to
stay for brunch!
MICHAEL
She hasn't told anybody, what
am I supposed to do?
JULIANNE
Get married, apparently.
She comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.
JULIANNE
What the hell are you thinking
of, the goddamn wedding is SIX
O'CLOCK!!
He swallows hard.
Trapped.
MICHAEL
This is her family and her
fault.
JULIANNE
And your point?
MICHAEL
(ten years old)
Well.
How come she didn't...
JULIANNE
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS
YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR
EACH OTHER.
He just blinks.
MICHAEL
Hey.
This is a serious matter.
Thank you.
She POKES his chest, punctuating...
JULIANNE
I'll be right back.
TENNIS COURT - DAY
The court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.
There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
across the top of the court's chain-link fence.
Michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a
prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.
From somewhere, we
hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.
Incongruous
against...
MICHAEL
How is she?
Julianne absorbs this.
As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS
around...
JULIANNE
KNOCK IT OFF!!!
We now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the
endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.
Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.
STONER KID
(Minnie Mouse)
YES, SIR!
A Nazi salute.
When she turns back...
MICHAEL
I asked you...
JULIANNE
She admits it's her fault.
He absorbs that.
And then...
MICHAEL
Do you think she still loves
me?
We watch the struggle inside her.
Her voice drops...
JULIANNE
Sure, she does.
She's crazy
about you.
Now tears stand in both their eyes.
The stoners are doing their
Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing
in castrato harmony.
But our two don't notice.
MICHAEL
I keep asking, how can I explain
what happened? And I keep
getting that same answer all
night long.
Which is...
MICHAEL
I can't.
And it doesn't matter.
I drove her to it, because I
want things my way.
And even
if she did something tricky and
unfair... she was blinded by
love, okay?
Julianne swallows.
For obvious reasons.
JULIANNE
Does that make it right...
MICHAEL
Love doesn't have to be right.
It just has to be love.
The stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
Actually, they're getting better.
MICHAEL
She's giving up half her life
for me, and I'm bitching because
it hurts her.
STONERS
(singing)
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by...
MICHAEL
She's a saint!
And I'm a
worthless ingrate!
STONERS
(singing)
Your time has come to shine,
All your dreams are on their way...
MICHAEL
Tell her.
I'll marry her at six
o'clock, if she'll still have me.
The stoners blend on the high note.
It's pretty moving.
JULIANNE
I'll be right back.
WILLOW POND - DAY
Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
POND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's
surface.
He is relieved, reflective.
Head down, he never notices
that she is...
... dangerously freaked.
Too petrified even to hyperventilate,
we're lucky she's breathing at all.
We watch her life unraveling
before her glassy eyes.
MICHAEL
(never looks up)
Thank God you were here.
JULIANNE
(mumbles to herself)
Oh, yeah.
MICHAEL
I was so confused, so conflicted,
so... unstable.
JULIANNE
Well, it happens.
They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
area.
Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.
Everything
that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.
MICHAEL
I might have thrown away...
Searching for the right words.
JULIANNE
... your one chance for true
happiness?
MICHAEL
... yeah, that.
JULIANNE
You never want to do that, see,
that's always a... costly
turnover.
As they say in the
sport biz.
There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.
He hears that
now, and looks at her.
Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.
But
he can tell she's something.
MICHAEL
(softly)
Are you okay?
She stops walking.
She can't look at him, so she looks around.
Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
strung.
At the center of it all...
.... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous
swing.
He's maybe fifteen feet tall.
She points to it...
JULIANNE
The Big Hurt, huh?
MICHAEL
Nellie Fox.
Walter likes the
past.
And he likes the little
guys.
So Julianne nods.
Because she does too.
Squints up at Michael.
JULIANNE
Got a minute?
He nods, you bet.
Worried for her.
What is this? She looks in
another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...
... a stage that's been set up for the band.
Chairs, music stands,
sound equipment.
A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the
lawn.
Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.
Like the centerpiece
of a wedding cake.
JULIANNE
Why is the dance floor by the
gazebo?
She takes his hand.
They walk toward it.
MICHAEL
Kimmy's idea.
She thought it
would be such a romantic place.
For our wedding dance.
Looking down at her.
MICHAEL
What's up?
JULIANNE
Shhh.
Up the white steps now.
Together.
The gazebo floor has been
covered with hardwood.
The perfect place.
For a wedding dance.
And Julianne...
... turns, suddenly.
He almost runs into her.
She is staring up
at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.
He is caught,
transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.
JULIANNE
I have to say this quick, okay,
or I'll have this massive
coronary and you'll never have
to hear it.
Which you need to.
Does that make any sense at all?
The coronary part does.
We can feel her heart beating from here.
MICHAEL
Jules, what's wrong...
JULIANNE
This is the dumbest thing I will
ever do.
So dumb, in fact, that
I can't.
I don't think.
And then, she does.
She puts her hands flat on his chest.
Looks
in his eyes.
JULIANNE
Michael, I love you.
A heartbeat passes.
JULIANNE
I've loved you for nine years,
but I was too arrogant and
scared to realize it.
Now I'm
just scared.
He stares at her, dumbstruck.
She moves even closer.
JULIANNE
I know this comes at an
inopportune time, but I have to
ask this one really gigantic
favor, okay?
Holds her breath.
And...
JULIANNE
Choose me.
Marry me.
Let me
make you happy.
And in a half beat of excruciating silence...
JULIANNE
I know.
It sounds like three
favors.
His eyes are loving.
They care for her.
She swallows, lost in
them.
JULIANNE
But when you think about it...
Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...
... to his.
The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.
All of
her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...
... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.
They whirl to see...
... KIMMY, halfway up the path.
Her hands across her mouth, as if
to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,
and...
... runs.
Back Down the path.
Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING
her name.
A frozen moment, and...
... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.
All three running, SCREAMING
their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop
to watch from neighboring countries.
Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.
LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the
gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.
No way to catch her.
Still...
... Michael is racing for the cars.
Julianne, sprinting her guts
out, losing ground with every stride.
Michael JUMPS into a
Cherokee...
JULIANNE
MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER
CATCH HER!!
He GRINDS the gears.
She keeps RUNNING.
His engine FIRES.
JULIANNE
SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!
He BLASTS OFF.
She keeps going.
Gasping for air, clutching her side,
she's dying here.
Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!
Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!
JULIANNE
(to the world at large)
DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
ANYMORE?
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
TRUST??
Up ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.
She still has a chance,
DASHES to the next van.
BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome
rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
door open.
Stumbles in.
Keys!
JULIANNE (O.S.)
THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!
Michael SPEEDS away.
She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.
LURCHES off.
TAXI STAND - DAY
Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi.
The driver smokes,
paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular.
Then...
MANDY (V.O.)
Wallace egregious residence,
Mandy speaking.
JULIANNE
It's Jules, you guys haven't
had a call from, say, Kimberly,
have you?
MANDY (V.O.)
Oh, she's slipped out, the
little monkey.
Prob'ly with
Michael, doin' the nasty.
A shallow laugh...
MANDY (V.O.)
Or crying in her nachos, down
at Comskey Park.
Julianne's face SNAPS to alert.
JULIANNE
Ex-cuse me?
MANDY (V.O.)
I had this crank call?
From
some guy who thinks he saw her?
I said, what would a bride be
doin', on her wedding...
JULIANNE
You are so right.
What a
nerve on that guy!
Bring my
dress to church, huh?
Signals the driver, let's GO!
JULIANNE
I want to pick up a little
something for the ceremony.
UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT
A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL, fronted by nearly
a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated
curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety.
Our girls JUMP out of the cab,
and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead...
SAMMY
Whatever hap...
JULIANNE
(cutting this short)
We were bonding, we lost track,
we're officially sorry, now
let's put it behind us.
Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance.
And takes Julianne's
hand for support.
JULIANNE
Believe me, we got a bride who's
worth waiting for, yes?
Everybody nods.
JULIANNE
Out of our way.
DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT
White.
Pure blinding white.
Across FRAME floats more white, this
gauzy and ethereal.
It settles, its roots planting deeply in the
bride's hair.
TILTS UP to...
... the face of the woman who placed it there.
Julianne's eyes,
appraising this bride we cannot see.
And so softly...
JULIANNE
Don't worry, sugar.
Don't worry.
JULIANNE
When he looks at you, it will
be as if...
The words stronger.
Because there is no smile.
JULIANNE
... he's never seen a woman
before.
PAN DOWN the white until we are...
CLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.
HOLD.
And...
WALLACE POND - NIGHT
This is what all the preparation was for.
Tables, lights, balloons,
the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.
The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.
Two who are one.
PAN TO...
... the stage, the band playing.
Julianne conferring with the twins
and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.
Then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...
... KLUNKS it, for silence.
The band stops.
The dancers follow.
All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor.
She looks to
the couple.
Just below her.
Then, to the crowd...
JULIANNE
I'm a writer, too, not as
good as Michael.
But I do
steal from quality.
She raises her glass.
Everyone at the table does the same.
JULIANNE
This is to my best friend.
On
the occasion of his wedding.
Shouts of support, a few whistles.
Silence.
She tells Michael...
JULIANNE
If I have truly come to know
your bride as my new sister.
This is in her heart...
She has to stop.
Swallows.
Because she will not let herself cry.
JULIANNE
"Understand.
I'll slip quietly
away from the noisy crowd when
I see the pale stars rising,
blooming, over the oaks."
Deep breath.
Looks in his eyes.
JULIANNE
"I'll pursue solitary pathways
through the pale twilit meadows,
with only this one dream: You
come too."
A hush.
SHARP applause.
From four hundred hands.
But not from
his.
He is too moved.
Too understanding of what he has heard.
JULIANNE
I don't have a wedding gift.
But this is on loan.
Until
you two find your song...
And with that the band begins.
The opening phrases of a song we
have come to know.
Michael seems overwhelmed.
Julianne nods
toward the gazebo...
... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into
his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to
applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...
MANDY/SAMMY
(singing)
Someday, when I'm awfully low,
And the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you,
And the way you look tonight.
Soft two-part harmony.
As perfect as the words.
MANDY/SAMMY
(singing)
You're lovely.
With your smile so warm,
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
Just the way you look tonight.
Julianne can cry now.
Because she's tied with half the place.
MANDY/SAMMY
(singing)
With each word, your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart...
And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart.
Julianne begins to sing.
Unheard.
Unseen.
Even by the man she's
singing to...
JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY
(singing)
You're lovely, please don't ever change,
Keep that breathless charm,
Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...
Just the way you look tonight.
The band keeps playing.
The dance goes on.
Two people lost in each
other.
The way it's supposed to be.
