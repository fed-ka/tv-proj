GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest
skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed.
A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS
UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in
front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her
face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger
window.
GRADY
Hi, Tanya.
(to the others)
This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.
CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and
nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.
TANYA
Grady.. ..Emily's not here.
GRADY just smiles, nods.
TANYA (cont'd)
Is there anything I can do for you?
GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through
Tanya's sad umbrella.
GRADY
You're leaking, Tanya.
Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.
CRABTREE
Trip? ?
GRADY
She left me. Crabs.
CRABTREE
Left you...?
Who? Emily?
GRADY
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
CRABTREE
But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I
mean, what are we doing here?
GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his
windshield, turns on the ignition.
GRADY
I thought maybe I made it all up.
Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and
select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of
cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching
halt across the street, parks in front of another fire
hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a
GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.
MISS SLOVIAK
That's a nice greenhouse.
GRADY
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
CRABTREE
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby,
Tripp.
GRADY
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
CRABTREE
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always
do.
As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears,
riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.
SARA
Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you
again.
CRABTREE
Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.
SARA
Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to
wonder if you were ever going to--oh!
As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches
forward ...into Grady's arms.
GRADY
Easy there.
SARA
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't
know how anyone actually walks in these things.
MISS SLOVIAK
Practice.
Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific
curiosity in her eye.
SARA
I don't believe we've met...
MISS SLOVIAK
Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--
Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES
skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general
direction of Grady.
SARA
Poe!
CRABTREE
(mildly)
This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?
Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the
hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around
and is barking at the living room.
MISS SLOVIAK
Who ' s he barking at now?
GRADY
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
SARA
Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.
As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.
GRADY
I need to talk to you.
SARA
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.
(strategy in her tone)
Perhaps you could put some of these coats in
the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
GRADY
(reading her)
I don't believe I know where the upstairs
guest room is.
SARA
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--
CRABTREE
We'll just make ourselves at home.
(kneeling by Poe)
Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....
GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from
his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around
the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE
accosts him.
MAN'S VOICE
There you are.
GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he
sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the
person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in
the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.
WALTER
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in
here. You haven't seen it, have you?
SARA
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if
I was sitting on it.
WALTER
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
SARA
I doubt it, darling.
WALTER
(angling & bottle to the light)
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he
will be addressing 500 people in little over an
hour...
SARA
You want to keep him happy.
WALTER
If he' s happy. . .
(kissing her as he exits)
I'm happy.
As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in
the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally,
she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off,
returning to the clamor inside her house.
GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of
LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching
him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's
garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught
eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the
porch.
GRADY
James?
James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a
GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at
what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.
JAMES LEER
It's fake.
James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY
peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The
sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED
PISTOL.
JAMES LEER
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny
arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic
school.
GRADY
It's very convincing.
JAMES LEER
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but
they don't make them anymore. The caps.
GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers
and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.
JAMES LEER
It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry
rabbits' feet...
GRADY
...You carry firearms.
As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass
briefly over the jay. GRADY
notices, offers.
JAMES LEER
No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of
my emotions.
GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.
JAMES LEER
I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were
wondering. I crashed. I mean, not
intentionally...
James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be
seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
...but the other night, Hannah and I were
together, at the movies, and she asked me.
Since she was coming. So I ended up coming.
Too.
GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.
GRADY
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?
JAMES LEER
No! What gave you that idea?
GRADY
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent
her a room.
JAMES LEER
She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
(glancing back at the window)
Besides, she doesn't really know me. She
thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's
because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
GRADY
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she
knows it and try as she might to not let that
screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in
some way.
James looks away from the window, at Grady.
JAMES LEER
You're not like my other teachers, Professor
Tripp.
GRADY
You're not like my other students, James. So
what was the movie you two saw?
JAMES LEER
Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and
Frances Farmer.
GRADY
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
JAMES LEER
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
GRADY
Sounds like a good one.
JAMES LEER
(a crooked smile)
It's not bad.
GRADY considers James' fragile face.
GRADY
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In
workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a
bit out of control.
JAMES LEER
They really hated it. I think they hated it
more than any of the other ones.
GRADY
Well...
JAMES LEER
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to
write.
GRADY
(truly impressed)
Really? That's remarkable.
JAMES LEER
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in
bed I figure them out. The stories.
As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY
looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat.
Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against
the modest bulk of the cap gun.
GRADY
You cold, James?
JAMES LEER
(distant)
A little.
GRADY
So what are you doing out here?
JAMES LEER
It's colder in there. -
GRADY
(laughing)
You're right.
James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that
he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse
JAMES LEER
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought
...I thought I'd come out here and take a look
at it. You don't see one of those every day. It
looks like heaven...
GRADY
Heaven?
JAMES LEER
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in
heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in
crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the
way I remember it...
Abruptly, James glances at his watch.
JAMES LEER
I should be going.
James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a
moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
Goodbye, Professor Tripp.
GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off
then, leaving the light of the house behind.
GRADY
James.
(as he stops)
Don't leave just yet. There's something I
think you ought to see.
JAMES LEER
I'll miss my bus.
GRADY
This is worth it.
James looks conflicted.
GRADY (cont'd)
Trust me.
As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of
Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a
space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.
GRADY
Okay.
James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs
looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps
forward, and takes the hind legs.
JAMES LEER
He's still a little warm.
They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until
there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.
JAMES LEER
Yuck.
GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.
JAMES LEER
That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a
suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost
perfectly.
GRADY
(searching)
That's just what they used to say in the ads.
Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
JAMES LEER
Whose tuba is that anyway?
GRADY
Miss Sloviak's.
JAMES LEER
Can I ask you something about her?
GRADY
She is. Ah. Here we go...
GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of
boxers.
JAMES LEER
Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
gay?
GRADY
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the
time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a
pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.
GRADY
Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That
should take the pinch out of my ankle.
(handing the bottle to James)
Have one.
JAMES LEER
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
GRADY
Right. That's why you were standing in the
Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap
gun of yours tonight.
You're fine, all right,
you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth,
drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.
GRADY
I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.
Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth,
and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later,
he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill
from the lapel of his jacket.
GRADY
How 'bout we try that again.
As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK
stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.
GRADY
There's an explanation.
MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in,
unzips her suitcase.
GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front
lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a
little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.
GRADY
That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese
beetle trap.
MISS SLOVIAK
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN
squints through the screen door.
MISS SLOVIAK
There's Pop.
(turning)
Let me see it. The gun.
GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony
smirks.
MISS SLOVIAK
Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis
would carry. In a little beaded purse?
GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the
front screen door. Pop is still there.
GRADY
I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue
James Leer.
MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and
peers in at Grady.
MISS SLOVIAK
You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think
about going home. You look like you need a
little rescuing yourself.
GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS
stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron
in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then
slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.
As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a
perfunctory pat-down.
BOUNCER
(kidding him)
Clean tonight, hub, Professor?
GRADY
As a whistle.
Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to
Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.
GRADY
Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make
sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?
HANNAH GREEN
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
GRADY
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know
where James Leer lives?
HANNAH GREEN
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen
it.
GRADY
That strikes me as odd.
HANNAH GREEN
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in
Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once,
but...
(remembering)
Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's
house. He said she worked there. Or something.
I don't remember.
James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.
JAMES LEER
Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....
GRADY
What's he saying?
HANNAH GREEN
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's
always carrying around. He must've left it
inside.
GRADY
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street.
CRABTREE
and Q huddle inside.
GRADY
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the
auditorium.
JAMES LEER
(delirious, but insistent)
Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!
GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.
GRADY (cont'd)
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash
on the sofa.
HANNAH GREEN
The one in your office? It's the best one .for
naps.
GRADY
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We
could probably stand him up in the garage with
the snow shovels at this point.
As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls
into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.
GRADY
Ail right. In my office.
As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his
face.
HANNAH GREEN
Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.
GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and
drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has
his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.
Vernon Hardapple.
VERNON HARDAPPLE
You driving this car?
GRADY
Excuse me?
VERNON HARDAPPLE
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving
this car?
GRADY
It's mine.
VERNON HARDAPPLE
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
GRADY
You must be mistaken.
VERNON HARDAPPLE
Bullshit.
GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.
GRADY
Go home to your mother, Vernon.
Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.
GRADY
Wait here. I'll be right back.
CRABTREE
Where would we go?
TRAXLER
Is it good?
GRADY
(reading)
I don't know. It might be...
36
CUT
GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and,
hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.
Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone.
Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street
from the Gaskell's house.
TRAXLER
Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your
wife?
GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.
GRADY
No, my wife's out of town.
Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom,
then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway.
Walter appears on the front steps.
TRAXLER (cont'd)
Who's that guy?
GRADY
Her husband.
Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.
TRAXLER
What exactly are we doing here, Professor
Tripp?
GRADY
(staring at Sara)
Taking the long way home.
As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James
Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above
the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with
only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He
takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.
GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and
plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch
step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it,
then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.
A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the
door opens, GRADY
appears.
OFFICER PUPCIK
Good morning...
(eyeing Grady's robe)
Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but
I understand you attended an event at Sara and
Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one
of the last to leave...
GRADY is
scratching his head in mock thought.
GRADY
Well, there's always people you don't know at
these things, but I can't say there was anybody
particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one
guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
OFFICER PUPCIK
A jockey? You mean, like--
GRADY
Horses, right. Vernon something...
(thinking... )
Hardpple
Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.
OFFICER PUPCIK
Hardapple?
GRADY
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
OFFICER PUPCIK
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E; on Dr. Gaskell's
closet. And the dog's missing.
GRADY
That's weird.
OFFICER PUPCIK
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's
blind and we figure he just wandered off and
got run over.
GRADY
The perpetrator.
OFFICER PUPCIK
No, the dog.
GRADY
Just kidding.
Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing
With Assholes."
OFFICER PUPCIK
One other thing. About this kid, this student
of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know
how I could get in touch with him, would you?
GRADY
I might have his number on campus.
OFFICER PUPCIK
That's all right. We'll find him.
Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and
turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...
HANNAH GREEN (O.S.)
There you are...
GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across
the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
eyed and delectable.
HANNAH GREEN
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
GRADY
Oh. Well. I...
Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up
her thighs.
HANNAH GREEN
It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.
GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes
through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is
heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down
the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik
drive away in his big police car.
JAMES LEER
What do we do now?
#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him
#####RINGS.
GRADY
Hello?
SARA'S VOICE
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You
won't believe what's happened.
GRADY
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
so- gently ...hang up the phone.
GRADY
How 'bout we get the hell out of here?
James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath
his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack
swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of
KEYS.
GRADY
You start her up.
As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice
blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the
keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides
behind the steering wheel.
JAMES LEER
(as the engine roars)
How's that?
GRADY
Well done, James.
As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the
wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.
GRADY (cont'd)
Shit!
James blinks, pokes his head out the window.
JAMES LEER
You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.
Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared
ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in
front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.
GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a
modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the
JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.
JAMES LEER
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy
would live. What's it called again?
GRADY
Kinship.
JAMES LEER
Kinship. And what's here?
GRADY
Unless I miss my bet...my wife.
James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.
JAMES LEER
The one that left you?
GRADY
That's right. That one.
GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against
the glass of the living room window, squints inside.
Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the
hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's
sitting in the indentation.
JAMES LEER
Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-
GRADY
How can you tell?
JAMES LEER
You can see the outline of a butt.
As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
GRADY
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you
can start on the box.
As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.
JAMES LEER
Maybe she didn't come here.
GRADY
She came here. We'll just wait. In the
meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch
door.
GRADY
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since
she was twelve years old. And your hips are as
slim as hers.
JAMES LEER
It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you
know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.
GRADY
(a pang of guilt himself)
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about
that.
James takes another sad glance at the little door, then
drops onto ail fours.
GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James
slides out. GRADY
stays put, hands still on the wheel.
JAMES LEER
You coming?
GRADY
In a minute. Get us a table.
James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee
shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a
table with a view of the highway. GRADY
watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into
the booth and open his big, laminated menu.
Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY
kicks open his door, steps out.
GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he
speaks.
GRADY
C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm
sure. It's outside Scranton.
GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by
himself on the far side of the coffee shop.
GRADY
You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at
this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a
resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd
be pretty interested to learn that the good
people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his
entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this
up as I go along--
GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.
GRADY (cont'd)
Never mind. My mistake.
74
GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An
AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of
CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows
peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.
He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice:
James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it
says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE
NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the
Greyhound depot who picks up.
As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER
MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming
BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a
WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of
the sun visor.
MAN
(eyeing GRADY dubiously)
Professor Tripp?
GRADY
Grady.
MAN
Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.
GRADY
(re: their clothes)
Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.
FRED LEER
Hardly.
AMANDA LEER
We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck
would have it, the club was on the way, so...
(snapping shut the visor)
We were able to put in an appearance.
FRED LEER
Otherwise we would've been here earlier.
GRADY
Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a
little dinner.
FRED LEER
Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.
GRADY
That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might
be good for James to be with his family this
weekend.
FRED LEER
Well, of course, we can understand that.
GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him.
They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.
GRADY
Well. Let me go get him.
GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.
GRADY (cont'd)
I "hope you won't consider this forward of me,
Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you
ever attend Catholic school?
Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.
AMANDA LEER
Excuse me?
78
As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY
waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.
FRED LEER
Thank you. Professor Tripp.
GRADY
Take care of him.
AMANDA LEER
Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You
can be sure of that.
Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in
a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee
down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at
his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front
passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.
GRADY
Hey!
GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns,
elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady,
he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a
string-lets it drop.
GRADY (cont'd)
(softly)
Hey.
GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking
a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James'
MANUSCRIPT:
The Love Parade
He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light
that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.
80
Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block
full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window,
and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the
Galaxie in the middle of the street.
GRADY
(knowingly)
Crabtree.
84-
The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding
through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional
winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the
numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.
GRADY
This is it.
Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE
up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house.
The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.
CRABTREE
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on .
that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?
GRADY
I told you. They keep him chained in the
basement. Come on.
LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a
WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.
WOMAN SINGING
Why should I care though he gave me the air?
Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why?
And wonder why?
CRABTREE
Doris Day.
CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.
GRADY/CRABTREE
James Leer.
GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment
later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens
briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian
aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."
The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in
a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the
seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.
JAMES LEER
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
CRABTREE
We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.
As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
over.
GRADY
I can't believe you made fun of my robe.
The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide
open, but not a soul remains.
GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in
his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs
container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a
LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of
the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.
GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the
CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears.
Stenciled on its side panel is:
Kravnik's Sporting Goods
The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past
Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY
frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the
RECEIVER in his lap.
MAN (O.S. )
Hello? Hello...?
The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.
GRADY
Walter?
WALTER'S VOICE
Yes?
GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.
WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
Who's this ?
GRADY
It's Grady, Walter.
WALTER'S VOICE
Grady?
GRADY
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
WALTER'S VOICE
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ,
Grady, do you know what time it -is?
GRADY
(looking at his watch)
I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is
it?
WALTER'S VOICE
It's three-thirty, Grady.
GRADY
This is important.
WALTER'S VOICE
Oh?
GRADY
I... I...
WALTER'S VOICE
What is it, Grady?
GRADY
I'm in love with your wife.
WALTER'S VOICE
Excuse me?
GRADY
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even,
administrative.
WALTER'S VOICE
Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.
GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.
GRADY
No.
WALTER'S VOICE
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office
Monday morning.
As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone,
wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's
just done.
A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling
from-the window.
GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a
BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..
GRADY
Sara.
SARA
I tried to call, but apparently there's
something wrong...
Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.
SARA (cont'd)
...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was
ringing loud and clear this morning.
GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure
it's not good.
GRADY
Oh?
SARA
It seems one of our students is - missing and
his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
GRADY
(slumping to the porch)
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you.
It's all my-
Sara raises her hand, silencing him.
SARA
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady.
But more importantly, Walter's not very happy
and he's gotten the police involved. They seem
to think James Leer is somehow responsible for
all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where
James is, would you, Grady?
GRADY
Inside.
SARA
And the jacket?
GRADY
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to
the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil
stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.
GRADY (cont'd)
Someone stole my car.
SARA
Grady.
GRADY
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it
right there last night.
SARA
Are you sure you parked it there?
GRADY
Of course, I'm sure.
Ah, Christ, the puberty
police are back.
Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.
SARA
I'll deal with this. You dig up James.
Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in
the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.
PUPCIK
As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to
run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr.
Gaskell where we go from there.
GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.
GRADY
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
JAMES LEER
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you.
Professor Tripp?
GRADY
I'm a little worried, James.
JAMES LEER
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I
probably should be expelled.
GRADY
Well, let's see if we can keep that from
happening.
James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.
JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp...?
GRADY
Yes, James.
JAMES LEER
Even if I end up going to jail....
James smiles his crooked grin.
JAMES LEER (cont'd)
You're still the best teacher I ever had.
On this,
Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing
on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in
the rear
window of the police car, growing smaller.
SARA
This is not what the university has in mind
when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
GRADY
Would Walter really press charges?
SARA
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs
pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit
prickly this morning.
Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches
her take a drag on her cigarette.
SARA (cont'd)
You didn't happen to call the house last
night, did you, Grady?
GRADY
I think I might have.
SARA
And what do you think you might have said?
GRADY
I think I might've said I was in love with
you.
Sara's face remains .unchanged.
GRADY (cont'd)
He told you.
SARA
He told me.
GRADY
And what did you say?
SARA
I said it didn't sound like you.
Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her
car, and dives away.
GRADY looks after her sadly, then
turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt
which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."
CRABTREE
So- what do we do now? ,
GRADY
Find the jacket.
CRABTREE
Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?
GRADY
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her
car.
CRABTREE
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow
her pancreas.
104
GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND
that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at
him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box,
and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it
anyway, then spies something else.
James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.
GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS
off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a
SWEET, SOFT BLUR...
Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.
VERNON
Are you crazy!
The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares
at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.
VERNON (cont'd)
Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you
see the condition my girl's in?
As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on
Oola's tummy.
VERNON
You all right, cupcake?
OOLA
Who's Vernon?
A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching
asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah
Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.
VERNON
What the...?
Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails
wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.
CRABTREE
Tripp! Run!
GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as
CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then
turns back for another pass.
VERNON
Who the hell is that?
GRADY
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon
girl's clutch.
The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree--
swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken
flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady,
Vernon, and Oola.
VERNON
Woah.
Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.
VERNON (cont'd)
Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!
Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and
the oncoming Crabtree.
GRADY
No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.
CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the
passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a
FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.
Only, these ain't birds.
 - ^
GRADY
Oh... my... God!
These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.
CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and
smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI
painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.
As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free
of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail
the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the
Ohio River.
GRADY (cont'd)
(to Vernon)
I take it back.
Shoot him.
Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with
CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare
to leave in the Galaxie.
GRADY
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
VERNON
Shoot.
GRADY glances at little round Oola.
GRADY
Boy or girl?
VERNON
As long as it looks like her, I don't care.
You know what I'm saying?
GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.
GRADY
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
VERNON
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
GRADY
Sure.
VERNON
Stop calling me Vernon.
CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.
CRABTREE
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
GRADY (cont'd)
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
OOLA
Yea?
GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress,
snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.
GRADY
It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had
small shoulders, like you. Most people don't
know that.
As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.
VERNON
Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty
motherfucking ride.
Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into
Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.
CRABTREE
You mind explaining what you just did?
GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping
NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.
GRADY
Came to my senses. CRABTREE
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is
James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell
to come to his?
GRADY
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer
to jail, Crabs. I know that.
CRABTREE
Do you know he won't expel him?
GRADY
No. But I don't think that matters.
CRABTREE
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's
comforting to know that America's children have
you for a teacher.
GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the
buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.
GRADY
Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell
them what you know. You tell them to find their
voice and stick with it, because that's all you
have in the end. You tell the ones who have it
to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't
to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way
to get where you're going.
(ruefully)
Of course, it helps if you know where you want
to go.
(thoughtfully)
Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
that's made the last seven years worthwhile.
GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles
cryptically as he considers it. -
GRADY (cont'd)
As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...
Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.
GRADY (cont'd)
He's got you.
CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands,
watches GRADY walk away.
CRABTREE
Me? What can I do?
GRADY
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
(over his shoulder)
Improvise. You're good at that.
GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as
he walks toward the buildings in the distance.
CRABTREE
I'm sorry, Tripp.
GRADY stops, turns.
GRADY
You peeked, didn't you?
CRABTREE
I peeked.
GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter
anymore
CRABTREE
It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a
lot to admire. I've ...never read anything
quite like it.
If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit,
Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place,
and show. And GRADY knows it.
GRADY
You're not just trying to make me feel better?
CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.
CRABTREE
Scout's honor.
CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are
acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.
GRADY
Well, thanks for that, Crabs.
A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER
AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring
then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.
GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES
on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple
and crazy with veins.
GRADY
Are these the only ones you have?
The nurse's eyes crinkle.
GRADY (cont'd)
Kidding...
GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,
looks at
the Gaskell house.
GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.
Dark.
He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse,
standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting
onto its roof, melting.
GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the
glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he
pulls away, but not before leaving...
...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the
frost of the glass.
127
The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the
street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self
on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and.
..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little
pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol,
then looks up into the sky.
GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...
...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters
the silence.
NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his
hand.
GRADY
(as if addressing God)
Is that a suggestion?
GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO
SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen
DS23 appears.
It passes.
Slows.
Stops.
GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts
himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara
makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but-
not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.
GRADY
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
SARA
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you
out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?
GRADY
I'm through improvising.
SARA
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is
it true?
Did you lose it all?
GRADY
I lost it ail.
SARA
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
GRADY
I know.
SARA
And you're old.
Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her
fingers. Yanks.
GRADY
Ouch. How many?
SARA
Dozens. It's very sad.
Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes
when she looks into his, and-she glances away.
GRADY
I went and looked at-some babies just now.
SARA
Oh?
GRADY
(trying to make her laugh)
I guess you have to go on faith.
SARA
(she doesn't)
Some times...
GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the
HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.
GRADY
Did you tell Walter?
SARA
I told Walter.
GRADY
Does he still love you?
SARA
It didn't come up.
GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious
profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.
GRADY
Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I
didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been
waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're
who I need. Because nothing makes sense without
you. Because the best moment of every day is
the moment I first see your face. And because
when you leave a room, there's no reason to be
in it any more. It's just a room again.
Sara cocks her head.
SARA
Did you just make that up?
GRADY
(shaking his head)
In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about
it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy
painkillers.
She frowns good-naturedly.
GRADY (cont'd)
Even so...it's still true. Every word.
Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.
GRADY (cont'd)
Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might
tell you...
Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...
SARA
Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.
GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.
GRADY
You don't deserve me, you know.
SARA
I know, but sometimes...
Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening.
SARA (cont'd)
You just go on faith.
GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too,
drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other
side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door,
the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft
veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are
lost too, nothing more than a blur.
