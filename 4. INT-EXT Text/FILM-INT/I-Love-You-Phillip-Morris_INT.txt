Startled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and
pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once
heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment.
The door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him.
The nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next
bed over, frantically administering CPR.
SUPER: "TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY INFIRMARY - 1998"
A DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.
DOCTOR
Where's the crash cart!?
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.
Steven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE
counterpoints the bleakness of this scene.
STEVEN (V.O.)
(upbeat and happy)
Love sure is a funny thing...
It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes
you do all sorts of things you never
thought you'd do before. Love's the
reason I'm here actually.

Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS
and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at
them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face.
STEVEN'S MOM
Are you a happy little boy Steven?
Steven smiles and nods.
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
You've always been such a happy little
boy.
(then)
Now Steven, we want to tell you something
very important, but I want you to
understand that it doesn't change a
thing.
Steven awaits, smiling.
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
We're still gonna love you, you're still
gonna be our happy little boy and you're
still gonna--

YOUNG STEVEN
Shut up!
He glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother.
Her face says it all.
STEVEN'S MOM
It's true.
WHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts
putting things together.
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
Your brother overheard your Dad and I
talking and well, we didn't want you to
hear it from anybody but us.
(then)
It's true. You're a special little boy.
You know why? Because we chose you. Not
like your brother here who's natural.
STEVEN'S DAD
Your Mother's right. It's cause we love
you. So we put some money in a brown
paper bag and gave it to your real mom in
the hospital parking lot so you could
come home with us. Okay?
STEVEN'S MOM
It doesn't change a thing honey. We love
you just as much as we love your brother
here...
(best of intentions)
...and he's natural.
STEVEN'S DAD
So son, are you okay?
Steven smiles wide.
YOUNG STEVEN
Yes Daddy.
As his parents prattle on, Steven's VO comes full.
STEVEN (V.O.)
It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't
gonna let it get me down. No way. I was
gonna be the best son- No, the best

I/E. VIRGINIA BEACH CHURCH OF GOD - 1984 - DAY

A joyous Sunday. OPEN ON the LETTER BOARD of THE VIRGINIA
BEACH CHURCH OF GOD. The date reads, MARCH 1984.
A congregation packs the church to the rafters as a
Lawrence Welk-ish CHOIR praises Jesus to the tune of
Hallelujah! We Shall Rise.
Amidst this white-man's paradise sits a smiling and
healthy STEVEN- playing the organ with a happy-stick
planted firmly up his ass.
As the joyous flock whoops it up, Steven winks to his
wife (DEBBIE) and their 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER (STEPHANIE)
who sit in the first row.
Steven, oblivious, hits a sour note or two-- but keeps on
playing with happy abandon. The crowd continues to enjoy
the inspiring hymn.

I/E. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE STATION FRONT DESK, 1984 - DAY 6
A police receptionist (MANDI) at a switchboard in a small-
town police station answers the phone.
MANDI
Virginia Beach Police Department, how may
I direct your call?
Steven enters in UNIFORM, smiling wide. Mandi waves
happily. She covers the receiver and whispers.
MANDI (CONT'D)
Something came for you.
As he nods and moves on he's greeted by a VARIOUS
POLICEMEN. We can tell he's well liked.
STEVEN
Hey fellas.
VARIOUS POLICEMAN
Hey Steve, Steve, mornin', etc...
Steven arrives at his desk to find a large FILE BOX. He
turns it around to reveal writing on the side. It reads,

Steven switches off the small lamp beside Stephanie's

STEVEN

STEPHANIE

Okay.

Steven and Debbie kneel at the edge of the bed, praying.
DEBBIE
...and if it wasn't for you Jesus, I
would have never found that last coffee
filter and Prayer-Girls would have been
ruined. So thank you for that.
STEVEN
Amen.
Steven moves to get up but settles back in when she
continues.
DEBBIE
And thank you for Steffie's allergy
screen coming back all negative. I always
knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy
nuts. And finally I want to thank you
for this man Jesus. This man who works
so hard to make us happy without even a
thought for himself.
Steven smiles at that sentiment. Again he moves to get up
when--
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
This man who pursued me to the ends of
the Earth and promised me a life of
eternal happiness. A promise he has kept
oh Lord. Every day. Amen.
STEVEN
Amen.

CLICK. In bed with Debbie, Steven switches off the light

STEVEN
I'm absolutely bushed.
DEBBIE
Me too.
They turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After
a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his
arm around her, gently feeling her breasts.
Debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven
quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with
the gentle rhythm of everyday sex.
Just as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and
strikes a conversational tone.
STEVEN
Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots
of access? You know- records and things?
DEBBIE

Debbie quickly realizes where his head is at.
DEBBIE
Oh... that.

STEVEN
I swear honey- getting around the system's
so easy. No one would even know I did it.
DEBBIE
I know you want to find her Steven, but
you need to think about this.
STEVEN
You're right, I shouldn't have done it.
DEBBIE
You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd
you find?
Steven shrugs.
STEVEN
I haven't looked. It's downstairs.
DEBBIE
Really? Well let's go!
She moves to get up. Steven takes umbrage.
STEVEN
Well hold on- let me finish.
DEBBIE
Oh, right.
Steven thrusts and tenses.
STEVEN
There- that's got it.

Steven flips through the file box, reading through
various pages. Debbie watches with compassion as he
reads. Eventually he cracks an incredulous SMILE.

He reads on, his smile ever widening until-
He comes across something that concerns him and his voice
trails off. His smile fades, replaced by a look of dread.
Debbie grows concerned.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
What? What is it? Steven?
He cannot believe his eyes.

Amidst the moonlit shadows, the THUMPING of VIGOROUS
LOVEMAKING is heard. It continues, getting louder and
louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie-style
in the bed.
Building to the climax, Steven moans with pleasure.
STEVEN
I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come...
Suddenly we see the face of the MOUSTACHED MAN he's

I mean it's not just sucking cock. It's
wardrobe, it's hair, personal trainers,
big labels, resorts, fine dining... it
goes on and on and on. So I needed money.
And for a guy without a college
education, my options were limited.

Steven inexplicably pours cooking oil out onto a grocery
store aisle with a basket slung over his arm.

So I had no choice--

I became a con man!
SLIP-WHAM! Steven throws himself in the air and falls
flat on his back with a scream.

Of course that was easy for me, every

litigiously--

Steven stands atop a escalator, looking around.
STEVEN (V.O.)
But when money got really tight, the slip

He throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the

At the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.
A
beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame.

Dressed in pajamas, Steven and Kemple sit cross-legged at

DEBBIE
No. I would never say that. Why? Do you

Can you tell me exactly what he did?
As they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven
getting out of bed and looking around blearily.
He picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent-
mindedly PISSES-- missing the pan completely.
COP
He has several warrants out in Texas.
Fraud, forgery, embezzlement...
DEBBIE
What?
KEMPLE
I should have known... I should have said
something.

Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the
same thing. There were always signs. I
should have known he was gay when he
started shaving his chest.
KEMPLE
That would be a warning sign...

And all that Peter Allen music on his
Walkman.
KEMPLE
Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel
so bad now.

See him. Over there? Him? Anything you
want from outside, he's the guy. Candy,

Arnie notices one of the INMATES working in the kitchen
SPITTING a loogey into the mashed potatoes. He mixes it
in and CACKLES with glee.

Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed

Thanks for the picture and the article.
Sometimes it's just nice to know there's

Steven is holding the stainless steel ROLEX he gave
Kemple as a gift. He regards it wistfully.
STEVEN (CONT'D)

Do you think I broke his heart?
(snapping out of it)
Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the
machine... I'll try you again next time.
One O'clock. Don't forget.
He hangs up. Bored and lonely, he has a moment of repose.
Just then, a loud RUCKUS across the COMMON AREA gets his
attention.
Steven watches as a group of ROWDY PRISONERS throw
whatever they can find at a small BIRD as it flies
around, trapped in the cavernous hall.
The men LAUGH and HOOT as the bird is struck down and
lies motionless on the ground.
As the prisoners resume their activities, Steven notices
a GENTLE LOOKING INMATE approaching the bird.
Rapt, Steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops
up the bird and walks off. Steven is quite taken.

Oh she's an angel.
(then)
I think I'll be sure to write her back
and tell her I'm not lonely anymore...
that I made a good friend.
Phillip smirks for a moment, but soon Steven notices the
smirk turn to a reticent frown.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
What?
PHILLIP
Why'd I have to meet you today?
STEVEN
Something wrong?
PHILLIP
It's just- I'm being transferred to
Michael Unit today.
STEVEN
What?
PHILLIP
I'm sorry.
STEVEN
Don't be sorry. It's just across the
yard.
PHILLIP
Well I don't go into that yard so it
might as well be Oklahoma.
(then)
Just figures with my luck. I was born
Friday the 13th...
STEVEN
It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip.
In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day.
Don't worry, this right here. This is
destiny.
PHILLIP
But we only just met.
STEVEN
Listen, I've loved a lot. And I've been
around, so I recognize the feeling.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
That one you and me are having right now-
the one you're trying to forget exists
because you're going away. But there's
about 6000 volts shooting across this
table here and you know you can't deny
it.
PHILLIP
Don't you think you're coming on a little
strong?
STEVEN
I know you're trying to protect yourself,
I get that. It's fine. Give me a chance
to prove you wrong.
Phillip is melting but tries to hide it.
PHILLIP
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking
about.
Steven smiles wide as if to throw down the gauntlet.
STEVEN
Good...
Phillip turns to walk away and hides his giddyness.

Phillip passes the cells of Michael Unit, clutching his
belongings and soon enters his cell. He looks around
sheepishly until he is interrupted-
CLEAVON (O.S.)
You Phillip?
Phillip turns to see CLEAVON- a huge black inmate mopping
the hall outside his cell
PHILLIP
Yes.
He tosses Phillip a folded note.
He catches it and looks
at it with a smile.
PHILLIP (CONT'D)
Already?
Phillip opens it up. As he reads, his face brightens
considerably.

STEVEN (V.O.)
Phillip, hope your new place is nice.
Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate
made it to you okay. Check the T.P.
Phillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns
it over. A small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube.
STEVEN (V.O.)
I hope you try to make some new friends
and not be too shy. I guess I should tell
you a little bit about myself...

OPEN CLOSE ON a note as Phillip scrawls it.
PHILLIP (V.O.)
Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you
saying I'm shy. I guess you're right,
but I don't feel shy around you. I think
that means something...
As his VO continues, Phillip folds up the paper and
passes it through the bars back to Cleavon.
52
52
VARIOUS SHOTS as we follow the note being passed by
different hands and means throughout the prison on its
way to Steven.
PHILLIP (V.O.)
Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I
should tell you I'm diabetic so I
probably shouldn't... but I did anyway.
It's been so long since anyone's shown me
any kindness and well, it means a lot. I
just wish you were here...

Steven reads the letter on his bunk.

Phillip peers out of his cell to see Cleavon working his

Moments later, Cleavon passes him by. Phillip is bummed.

Again Phillip watches as Cleavon passes his cell without
leaving a note.
56

Phillip lays in bed, impatiently. He seems upset. He
anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the
mopping Cleavon working his way closer to his cell.
PHILLIP
Hurry up would you?
CLEAVON
I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot.
Besides I ain't got nothing for you
anyway...
PHILLIP
But it's been three days.
CLEAVON
You got a tracking number, motherfucker?
PHILLIP
No.
CLEAVON
Then shut your faggot ass.
Phillip slumps back onto his bed, depressed.
PHILLIP
Congratulations Phillip, scared off
another one.
A few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his
cell door sliding open.
He looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him.
CORRECTIONS OFFICER

This is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh
until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of
belongings.
Phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind
Steven.
PHILLIP
Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?
Steven slowly moves closer.
STEVEN
I know a guy. I took care of it.
I'm
gonna take care of everything...
Steven gently caresses Phillip's face. Phillip is
melting. Then suddenly, Phillip grabs Steven's ass.
PHILLIP
Enough romance, let's fuck.
They launch themselves onto the bunk and as they get to
business...
FADE OUT.

Phillip and Steven spoon in a glowing post-coital cuddle.
PHILLIP
And for a while I was Executive Assistant

STEVEN
Really? What's a Broadway producer doing
in Atlanta?
PHILLIP
I didn't ask.
STEVEN

I mainly just rode around town in his
limo, drinking and sucking him off.
There's a moment of silence, then a realization...

him for a little while anyway. Then I

Melvin.
STEVEN
Phillip- you amaze me.
PHILLIP

SCREECH interrupts him.

As the MUSIC seeps into their dark cell, Steven reads a

tries to pull him off the bed.

No. No... I can't dance.

Steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a
while, but with Phillip's help he begins to settle in.
Soon they are nestled into each other, swaying sweetly to
the music.
64

The MUSIC CONTINUES as a group of prisoners watch a VHS
copy of GHOST on a TV.
Phillip wipes away a tear and Steven holds him closer
while, in the front row, a ONE-EYED LATINO jerks off to
the sight of Demi Moore.
LATINO MAN
Yeah you fucking bitch...
65

MUSIC CONTINUES as tray after tray is filled with gray
slop. This persists until suddenly two of the trays
receive a beautiful STEAK and some SHRIMP.
Steven nods at the Slopmaster and offers a wink to a very
impressed Phillip.

smiling at one another.

They continue to dance. Footsteps approaching are heard.
GUARD (CONT'D)
I said lights out. Turn it off.
CLEAVON (O.S.)

Turn it off or we're coming in.
CLEAVON (O.S.)

CLANK! OFFSCREEN we hear the cell door open and the sound
of a scuffle is heard.
VOICES (O.S.)
ON THE GROUND! FUCK YOU! MY WORD IS MY

And as the sounds of a horrendous beating echo through
the cellblock, Phillip and Steven dance their dance-
oblivious to all but each other.
FADE TO BLACK.

Phillip and Steven sleep soundly together in the bunk. A
CLAXON blares and their cell door OPENS- accompanied by
the sound of a dozen others.

Phillip tries to follow but a guard knocks him back down
onto the bunk.
STEVEN
Don't you touch him!

STEVEN
Don't worry Phillip- I'll-

Shut up and move.

another guard keeps him there. He grows more and more
upset, pacing and working himself up.
Finally, the guard leaves and Phillip exits his cell and

Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage
service in good faith and was given an
inferior product. She is entitled to deem
that work to be unacceptable according to
the contract that Mr. Evans signed.

The terms of that contract were ambiguous
at best. The truth is, defendant engaged
my client for three years without full
payment.

LAWYER (CONT'D)
Your honor, I don't have to tell you that
none of this is admissable or applicable
to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's
histrionics do not erase the fact that
his client is in breech of contract.

He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have
to say?
Steven is stonewalled. He looks to Eudora as if to say,
"What do I do now?" and it terrifies her.

resolutely to the judge.

This seems to be cut and dried here, sir.

Mister Russell is treating this like an

STEVEN
I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken
man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't
go to Yale. My education was modest. I
went to a small school. I grew up on a
small farm. But I passed the same bar
exam as my colleague here and I am not
going to let him push around this humble

This scores with the judge.

He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.

I brought it up to him once, just to get
him talking. That's the thing about
having kids, you know? Gets people
talking. Shared experience. Builds
bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he
tells me he's worried about her- mamma

With the popularity of HMO's in today's

It's a critical business. A powerful

Steven makes breakfast in his tightie-whities while
talking on the phone. Phillip is in the background doing
a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table.
STEVEN
I could not speak more highly of Steven
Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight
shooter. We were damn lucky to have him
at Prudential as long as we did.
In his own world, Phillip chimes in.
PHILLIP

Dan continues to wax on about Steven.
LINDHOLM
Employee of the year two years running?
Developing software with IBM? You're the
kind of people we need here Steven. We
want you as our Chief Financial Officer.
So what do you say? I want your answer
right now. C'mon Steven- let's light
this candle.

An uptight assistant (RHEBA) leads Steven into his fancy
new office.
RHEBA
...for example "he's in a meeting" sounds
better than "he's away from his desk" at
least I think so, but whatever you
prefer.
STEVEN
That's fine... sure.

She leads him to his new desk which is stacked with
folders, files, printouts and reams of data.
RHEBA
I pulled all the claims for the last two
years as well as the statements,
transfers and confirmations from the
bank. Most of it's routine and I think
you can get up to speed in a day or two.
(then)
Anything else I can do for you?
STEVEN
Uh.... cup of coffee?
RHEBA
I'll do it today but I don't do that
really.
Steven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers
before him. He looks concerned as he begins to leaf
through.

Steven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the
company honchos. Dan Lindholm lords over the gathering
at the head of the table while a suit (MARK) reads from a
report to the group.
MARK
Crossover from traditional markets shows
declination and inverse diffusion seems
commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO
penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO
as usual but attenuation is growing more
prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for
Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with
training wheels.
Everyone LAUGHS, but no one quite as hard as Steven who
desperately tries to fit in.
Larry Birkheim, the CEO of USAMM sits beside Dan
Lindholm. He chimes in.
BIRKHEIM
Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've
only had the one quarter to play catch up
but I tell you, we can't wait to get some
insight here.

STEVEN

BIRKHEIM
Mark's projections.
STEVEN
Mmm hm.

BIRKHEIM
They seem kind of flat.
STEVEN
Oh.
Okay. Ummm...
Steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I
think maybe... well I could just read it
to you but uh... it might be better to
just uh...
The group looks at him quizzically.
Just as it seems
Steven has been up to nothing--
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Well, I'll just show you. Todd?
TODD, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full
of detailed tables. Steven walks the board through an
incredibly well prepared presentation.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
If you look here at Mark's projections
again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see
they're just that- projections.
Projections based on a model set by my
predecessor. I decided to reject that
model and do things a little differently.
I want to show you my results. This is
what we actually made in Q3--
Todd flips to the next card. The graphs GROW
exponentially. The group is intrigued.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Now let me tell you how I did it...
Todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the
unseen image.
And as Steven explains himself, Dan and Birkheim smile
broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance.

OPEN CLOSE on a candy wrapper opening. A hand removes
the candy revealing an INSPIRING MESSAGE printed inside
the wrapper- "When two hearts race, both win."
ON PHILLIP. He's deeply touched by the sentiment as he
chews on the candy. He puts the wrapper on the
REFRIGERATOR with a MAGNET.
He opens ANOTHER. He chews and reads- "Commit random acts
of kindness"
Again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator.
He opens ANOTHER and pops the candy in his mouth.
He
reads- "A smile is a flower on your face"
He's disgusted by the trite sentiment and THROWS THE
WRAPPER IN THE TRASH. A beat later, he REMOVES THE CANDY
from his mouth and THROWS THAT IN THE TRASH TOO.
Just then Steven walks by in a TUXEDO, adjusting his tie.
PHILLIP
The tux? Where are you going?
STEVEN
It's just a work thing. Were we supposed
to--
PHILLIP
No- I just thought- it's fine. Where you

STEVEN
These are ready for Dan ...
VERA

STEVEN
Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's
office. I asked him, "What's your fee?"
He says, "I charge $50 for three
questions." So I ask, "Don't you think
that's a little expensive?" And he says,
"Yes it is... Now what's your final

But in the time between receiving the
money and paying it out- it was just
sitting there, not making interest or
anything.
116
116
At his desk, Steven leafs through the company finances.
STEVEN (V.O.)
It occurred to me to set up an investment
account where the held money would earn
interest for the short time that the
company had it. We're talking twenty two
million at any given time here, so even
short term the interest adds up pretty
quickly. I'd be making the company
millions virtually overnight.
He leans back to think to himself.
STEVEN (V.O.)
...and I of course would take a
commission. Say... fifty percent. The
only problem with that was-- I wasn't the
one signing the checks.

"Yes it is, now what's your final
question?"

stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is
a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring
if you know what I'm saying.
STEVEN

Oh... how long till we can get a new one?
LINDHOLM
Nope. Time to overhaul the program. I got
a computerized system already on order.
No more room for pilot error.
Steven hangs his head, visibly disappointed.
LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
Should be up and running in a couple
months. I want you signing the checks

He continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious

Eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it
closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective
trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written
on the now missing page above.
The embossed text reads, "837,502.12"
He stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar.
He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers.
AUTOMATED TELLER
Hello, you've reached the Automatic
Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please
enter your personal account number
followed by the pound sign.
Steven quickly enters some numbers. As he listens he
flips through Birkheim's desktop calendar.
AUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D)
Thank you. Your account balance is eight
hundred-thirty seven thousand five
hundred and two dollars and twelve cents.
To repeat this-
It's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And
turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry
that reads, "Harris County Police, 12:30"
He leaps out of the chair and exits the office.
128
128
Steven furiously shreds documents in the company's PAPER
SHREDDER. Moments later the same SECRETARY enters the
room with an armload of work- enraging Steven.

A CLAXON BLARES and the cell door slides OPEN with
metallic ROAR, revealing a very impatient Steven with a
few days stubble on his face.
STEVEN

Steven hurries to the phone and dials. He nervously
awaits an answer. Then-
STEVEN
Hi Helen it's me. Is--
He's interrupted and proceeds to listen.
The look on his
face says it all.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Okay... mmm hmm...
Through the glass wall outside the phone room, we watch
as Steven continues to absorb the bad news.
He hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the
CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief.

I/E
NEW HOUSE, 1996 - HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - DAY
154
OPEN CLOSE ON the stainless steel ROLEX. WE'RE BACK
outside Steven and Phillip's house in a POLICE CRUISER.
Steven stares at it, reflecting on his memory of Kemple.
STEVEN (V.O.)
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I
just don't like talking about some
things.
The door opens and a HOUSTON COP hands him a black
LEATHERETTE CASE.
HOUSTON COP
This what you wanted?
STEVEN
Oh thanks.
HOUSTON COP
Diabetes huh?
STEVEN
Yeah...
The cop gets in and they drive off.

The HOUSTON COP and a DRIVING COP ride up front, not
paying much attention to their passenger.
In the REAR, Steven nervously and quietly prepares an
INSULIN SYRINGE and inexpertly INJECTS IT in his belly.
STEVEN (V.O.)
I wasn't going to lose Phillip. No way.
I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna
break Phillip's. I was gonna make
everything alright. No matter what it
took, I was going to escape.
He gives a quick look around and prepares another
syringe. After another injection, he prepares another.
And then ANOTHER and ANOTHER...
156
The DRIVING COP watches the road blankly until his nose
catches a putrid scent in the air.
DRIVING COP
Fuck... what is that?
The other cop smells it too. They begin to look around.
The Driving Cop glances back to see Steven CONVULSING AND
FROTHING AT THE MOUTH like a rabid bobble head doll.
DRIVING COP (CONT'D)
Fuck!
They turn around.
HOUSTON COP
Ahh! He shit himself! Get us to the
hospital!
The SIREN WAILS.
157

Steven wakes up in a hospital bed. A little bleary at
first, his eyes scan the room. He's alone.
He sits up, pleased and very excited. He pulls out his
IV, hops out of bed and heads for the window when-

CLANG! He stops short to find his ankle is shackled to
the bed.
STEVEN
Shit!
The door opens and the Houston Cop peers his head in. He
looks back to his unseen partner.
HOUSTON COP
He's up.

Three manacled PRISONERS, one of them Steven, follow a
CORRECTIONS OFFICER into the Processing Area at the
Harris County Jail.
Each of the men are still in their street clothes and
manacled separately.
CORRECTIONS OFFICER
Take a seat.
They take a seat on a bench outside a large steel door as
the officer talks to a PROCESSING CLERK. Steven is
visibly agitated and ignores the other men on the bench
with him.
The FIRST PRISONER turns to the SECOND PRISONER.
FIRST PRISONER
What'd they get you for?
SECOND PRISONER
Grand Theft.
You?
FIRST PRISONER
B and E.
The Second Prisoner turns to Steven...
SECOND PRISONER
How about you?
...but STEVEN IS GONE.
The man looks around.
Across the room, Steven stands in an elevator amidst a
group of lackadaisical JANITORS, clutching a mop. The
prisoner watches in awe as the doors CLOSE.

The elevator doors OPEN to reveal Steven, not with the
janitors, but with a GROUP OF OFFICERS-- re-emerging from
the elevator and back into the processing area.
The LEAD OFFICER talks to the clerk.
LEAD OFFICER
This slippery son of a bitch is going
straight to lockup.
Steven heaves a sigh.
160
160
Steven, in a fresh prison jumpsuit, paces while talking
on the phone.
STEVEN
C'mon Phillip, pick up, it's me.
I'm
sorry. C'mon.
(then)
Dammit!
He hangs up.
A nearby inmate chimes in.
NEW CELLMATE
How long you in for?
STEVEN
Not long.
(picks up phone)
Can you hit me in the face with this?
And off the inmate's quizzened expression--
161
161
OPEN CLOSE on Steven's BLOODY FACE. A PRISON PHYSICIAN
is examining it closely. We notice Steven is wearing
WHITE SCRUBS (as opposed to the doctor who wears GREEN
SCRUBS).
PHYSICIAN
That's a pretty big gash. Just stay
still...
STEVEN
It sure hurts...

As Steven talks and the doctor looks, Steven stealthily
plucks the doctor's ID BADGE and slips it in his pocket.
162
162
Steven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls
out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER. He breaks it open and drips the
ink into the water.
And as the water turns GREEN, Steven removes his white
scrubs and plunges them in the sink.
163
163
The NIGHT GUARD watches his monitors when a rap on the
glass gets his attention. He looks up to see Steven in
newly (and badly) dyed GREEN SCRUBS, awaiting exit on the
other side, holding the stolen ID BADGE against the
glass.
NIGHT GUARD
`night Doc.
He pushes the buzzer and Steven pushes open the door.

OPEN CLOSE on a GAVEL striking. Steven stands before the
judge flanked by his attorney and a bailiff.
HOUSTON JUDGE

The judge begins FILLING OUT A FORM. He barely looks up

HOUSTON JUDGE
Mister Russell is a flight risk. The
bond is set. Nine hundred thousand.
STEVEN
This is bullshit.
(sotto to attorney)
Set a reduction hearing.
ATTORNEY
(off this)
Your honor we'd like to set a reduction
hearing.
HOUSTON JUDGE
That's your right, but I strongly advise
you don't.
The judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT
THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see.
It clearly reads his bail amount, his charge, everything.
As the Attorney PRATTLES ON in the background, Steven
just STARES AT THE FORM LONG AND HARD.
HOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D)
Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow.
Steven interjects.
STEVEN
(sotto to Lawyer)
Next week.
The attorney looks at him quizzically and turns back to
the judge.
ATTORNEY
We'd like next week if that's okay.
STEVEN

Oh the thirteenth if possible.

A block of holding cells well stocked with men waiting on
the legal system.
We soon come upon Steven who is furiously SKETCHING OUT A
COPY of the form from the judge's bench from memory.
167
167
OPEN CLOSE on an opened envelope next to Steven's sketch
and a letter.
STEVEN (V.O.)
Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't
beat around the bush. I got into a spot
of trouble here in Houston and find
myself needing help. That's right, jail
again. Anyway I was wondering if you
could type up this thing for me on your
computer just like I sketched out...
As Steven `reads' the letter we reveal a MAN hacking away
on a computer nearby. As we move closer, we see that
he's the MOUSTACHED MAN from the night of his car crash
and he's not wearing pants.
168
168
Steven opens a letter and pulls out the FORGED FORM.
STEVEN
Great!
He grabs a pen and begins filling it out.
169
169
Manacled to a line of prisoners, Steven shuffles through
a crowded hallway. Courthouse staff are everywhere.
Steven spots a HARRIED woman approaching with an armful
of paperwork.
He reaches into his jumpsuit and pulls out the FORGED
DOCUMENT and as she passes- HE DROPS IT.
STEVEN
Ma'am?!
The woman turns back, annoyed.

Steven and Phillip sit manacled, side by side. They stare
at the floor in miserable uncomfortable silence.

No response. Phillip can only sit and stew.

PHILLIP
From the moment we met, you've done
nothing but lie. Our whole
relationship... just lies. I'm such an
asshole. You took advantage of me- just
like all the rest of them. You were
supposed to protect me- but you've done
nothing but make a fool of me. And you
expect me to love you? How can I love
you? I don't even know who you are. And
you know what's sad? I don't even think
you know who you are. So how am I
supposed to love something that don't
even exist? You tell me.
Eventually a POLICEMAN stands before Phillip.
POLICEMAN (O.S.)
Morris.
You're up.
Before he stands up, Phillip manages a terse statement.
PHILLIP
I will never forgive you Steven. Never.
Steven is speechless as he watches Phillip walk away-
disappearing down a long corridor.

PHILLIP carries his belongings past a line of hulking,
cat-calling convicts.
STEVEN (V.O.)
...But I knew he was right. Phillip,
Jimmy, Debbie- they've all been right.
My whole life was nothing but a bunch of
lies. Lies to make people love me, lies
to keep them from leaving me and lies to
make them give me their money.
He enters his cell.

A sheet is pulled over the cardio victim's corpse and
Steven watches as it is wheeled out of the ward.
He returns his bleary gaze to the ceiling.
STEVEN (V.O.)
I've been in this bed for months now.
Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps
me going is the thought that I might get
a chance to see Phillip one more time.

But I don't know how much longer I can do
this...
Steven's eyes roll back into his head as he slips into
unconsciousness.

A slightly built, effeminate inmate (SAMUEL) raps on
Phillip's open cell door as he enters.
SAMUEL
Got a minute?
PHILLIP
Samuel.
You want some crackers?
SAMUEL
No... thanks. Look- I just talked to my

Phillip calms himself.
PHILLIP
Just tell me where he is. What happened?
DOCTOR
He slipped into a coma for a few days.
He's conscious now, but he's very sick.
We had him transferred to a private care
facility. There was nothing we could do
for him here. It's just a matter of time
now.
Phillip listens in devastated silence.
188
189
Phillip is INTERCUT with the helpless Steven.
PHILLIP
Steven. Oh God... Why didn't you write
me? I don't know how this happened, they
say I'm fine. Oh God, who did this?
(then)
It doesn't matter. I had to talk to you
Steven.
(tearing up)
I am still angry with you, but I need you
to know something. Even if sometimes I
don't know who you are, I love you. I
never stopped loving you.
(smiles)
You and me are just fools for love I
guess- written in the stars or some crap
like that.
(tears)
But it was never better, never more real
than with you Steven. I realize now that
all that crazy shit you did- in your
fucked up way- it was always for me.
Always for us. You are the most amazing
man Steven. It takes my breath away. And
even though I can't be with you now, I
will always be yours... Forever.
He steels himself as best he can.
PHILLIP (CONT'D)
Now if you have to go, go. It's okay.
I'm right there. Okay? I'm right there.
Tears surface again.
He chokes back a sob.

As a single tear runs down Steven's face, the nurse puts
the phone on the hook and leaves.
Steven lies motionless.

Uh- my friend in the infirmary... Uh,
they got a call from that long term care
place and uh, well a few days ago Steven-

...I'm so sorry Phillip.
Phillip nods as it washes over him. He sends Samuel on
his way with a look. Once he's alone, Phillip lets go
and SOBS.
He buries his face in his pillow. After a long while-
CLANG. A sound gets his attention.
A BOSSY GUARD stands
at the door of his cell.
BOSSY GUARD

Phillip composes himself and follows the guard out.

The guard leads Phillip down the corridor. Still coming
out of his mournful haze, he becomes curious. They arrive

FLASHBACK. Steven sits over an untouched tray of food,
staring at it detached.
STEVEN (V.O.)
Faking your death from AIDS is no easy
task, believe me. But after watching
Jimmy die, I thought I could make it
convincing. First, you have to starve
yourself- I ate half as much every day
for ten months. After that, you have to
fake all sorts of symptoms.

You gotta keep this up for months until

FLASHBACK. Months later, Steven sits up in his bed. He

After some searching, Lawrence pulls out a file entitled

Lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some
forged forms- stuffing them into the folder.

Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls
out the pill. He secretly places it into a small HOLE in
his mattress for safe keeping.

FLASHBACK. Again, we are at the first hospital scene of
the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches as a

DOCTOR
Where's the crash cart!?
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.
With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his
mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills. He stuffs
them into his mouth as fast as he can.
STEVEN (V.O.)
But the hardest part by far is getting
transferred to a private care facility.
It's standard procedure for late stage
patients, but convincing them I was about
to die would involve taking a few risks.
He chases the pills down with a glass of water.

one thing.
Phillip is listening.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
I know you thought we were nothing but a
lie- but underneath all those lies there
was always something that was real. I
thought about what you said to me. You
said you don't know who I am. But I have
to tell you- I know now. I know who I
am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a
CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an
escape artist. Those Steven Russells are

At a window, a CLERK stamps a few documents and hands
them to Steven, who is dressed in his lawyer attire.
Steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom.

At the urinal, Steven whistles to himself.
SUPER: "Steven Russell was arrested two weeks later
trying to secure Phillip's release."
Steven turns his head to find the man at the next urinal
staring at him. It's a very surprised Birkheim with a
badge affixed to his jacket reading, "JUROR".
Steven SMILES at him.

Steven sits in court while a FEMALE D.A. argues her case.
SUPER: "An embarrassment to the State of Texas and
Governor George Bush, Steven was given an unprecedented
life sentence."
She nods to the audience where Lindholm sits smiling.
SUPER: "Coincidentally, the D.A. who prosecuted him was
the Sister in law of Dan Lindholm- Steven's former boss"

Steven smiles wide, shackled in a solitary 6 by 7 cell.
SUPER: "Steven sits in 23 hour-a-day lockdown, with only
one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise."
Steven stares at his Key West CALENDAR with a small photo
of Phillip attached to it.
The cell brightens, everything around Steven blooms with
white light. He looks to see.
