      FADE IN:

      EXT. TEMPLE OF HARMONIC BLISS. SANTA ROSA - NIGHT (N/1)11

      A Victorian gingerbread villa tastefully overlaid with a 
      pastiche of Buddhist and other mystic symbology -- bells, 
      wheels, flags, yin/yang circles, eyes, etc.. 

      A well made SIGN planted on the lawn declares this is "The 
      Temple of Harmony, devoted to Psychic Wellness under the 
      guidance of Kristina Frye.  Healing through clairvoyance."   

      ROSEMARY TENNANT, 50's, an ageless beauty, classy dresser,  
      at present angry and in tears, comes storming out of the 
      front door.    

      KRISTINA FRYE, 30's, appears a beat later and stops in the 
      doorway. 

                                  KRISTINA
                    Rosemary, please don't go.  I'm 
                    only trying to help you.  

      Rosemary puts her hands over her ears.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I'm not listening to you any more.  


                                  KRISTINA
                    You're making a terrible mistake. 
                    You're in serious danger.  

                                  ROSEMARY 
                    I'm not listening.

      Rosemary's out to the street and marches off.  Kristina 
      shakes her head sadly.

      EXT. SANTA ROSA STREETS - NIGHT22

      Rosemary walks along a quiet downtown street.  Three or four 
      people out and about.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She takes it out of 
      her bag, looks at the caller ID, tosses her head in 
      irritation and puts the phone away unanswered.  Keeps 
      walking.  A beat.  And suddenly a nondescript SEDAN pulls out 
      from a parking spot at the curb, and rockets up the street.  
      The car hops the curb, and makes a beeline for Rosemary.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     2.

      CONTINUED:22

      Eyes wide in fear, she tries to get out of the way, but the 
      unseen driver swerves after her, clipping some garbage cans, 
      before it HITS HER, throwing her over the hood and into the 
      windshield.  She rolls off onto the ground into the gutter.  
      The sedan stops for a beat, then drives off.  

      CLOSE ON ROSEMARY:  Lying in the garbage strewn gutter.  We 
      watch as the light goes out of her eyes.  

33EXT. SANTA ROSA STREETS - NIGHT 

      Later.  Same angle on Rosemary, under a draped sheet now.  
      She's at the center of a small circus of cops, forensics, and 
      gawkers.  A YOUNG COUPLE tells a Santa Rosa PD OFFICER what 
      they saw.

      JANE, LISBON, CHO and RIGSBY come across the yellow tape, to 
      meet with DETECTIVE MARCO FRANCIS, 30's.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Thanks for coming so quickly.

                                  LISBON
                    Your victim is the widow of Macon 
                    Tennant. 

      Francis shakes his head, looks blank.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Founder of CalSecure Financial and 
                    The Lieutenant Governor's close 
                    friend. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    We got to use the chopper.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Cool.

      They reach the body.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                    Two witnesses saw a silver sedan 
                      deliberately chase her down.  We're 
                    getting paint off those trash cans, 
                    hoping for a make and model, and we 
                    already have a partial plate.

                                  LISBON
                    Sounds like you're on top of it.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     3.

      CONTINUED:33

                                    FRANCIS
                    Sure.  But I don't mind getting 
                    your back-up.

      Jane clocks a flirtatious smile from Francis to Lisbon.  She 
      isn't biting.  

                                  LISBON
                    We're not back-up.  We're lead.  

      Francis kinda likes that she's a hardass.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Yes, ma'am.  

      Cho kneels to lift the sheet off the victim.  Jane glances 
      down at her as well.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                    A few days ago Rosemary here filed 
                    a missing persons report on her   
                    teenage son, Travis.  He'd been 
                    gone over a week.  Ran away twice 
                    before, with one stint in juvie. 

                                    RIGSBY *
                    What was the juvie charge?

                                    FRANCIS
                    DUI on a learner's permit.  Her 
                    house is eight blocks south, so we 
                    figure she was walking home.  From 
                    where, we don't know. 

                                  KRISTINA
                    She was with me.

      They all turn to find Kristina Frye has materialized right 
      behind them.

                                    FRANCIS
                    And who are you exactly?
                          (irritated, to uniform 
                            cops)
                    Who let her past the tape?

      Kristina affects an air of serene sadness, waving away 
      Francis' concerns.

                                  KRISTINA
                    My name is Kristina Frye.  I was 
                      Rosemary's spiritual advisor.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     4.

      CONTINUED: (2)33

      Jane's smiles, intrigued.  

                                  JANE
                    Please tell me I heard that  *
                      correctly. *

      Lisbon checks Jane with a look... She leads Kristina aside, 
      Jane follows.  The others go back to the car.

                                  LISBON
                    Ms. Frye, she was with you, where?

                                  KRISTINA 
                    At my home.  We just finished a 
                    session.  We contacted her husband.

                                  LISBON
                    Her dead husband?

                                  KRISTINA
                    That's right.  He told her this 
                    would happen.  He warned her she 
                    was putting herself in danger.

                                  LISBON
                    From whom?

                                  KRISTINA
                    I don't know.  I'm merely a 
                    channel.

                                  JANE
                    A channel for what?

                                  KRISTINA
                    For the energy of the departed 
                    souls.

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  Of course.  So, you knew this 
                    murder would happen?  

                                  KRISTINA
                    Her husband knew it.  I just passed 
                    his warning on to Rosemary.

                                  JANE
                    I see.

      Jane talks to Lisbon as if Kristina isn't there.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     5.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    By her own admission, she's either 
                    a channel for the energy of 
                    departed souls, or she's involved 
                    in the murder.  So you have a 
                    choice.  Call in the Ghostbusters, 
                    or arrest her.

                                  LISBON
                    Cool it. 
                          (to Kristina)
                    Ms. Frye, if you wouldn't mind, in 
                    the morning, we'd like you to come 
                    into our office to answer a few 
                    questions in more detail.

                                  KRISTINA
                    If it will help you, I'd be glad 
                    to.  Please, call me Kristina. 

                                  JANE
                    Anything for an audience huh, 
                    Kristina?

                                  KRISTINA 
                    You're smiling, but where is all 
                    that anger I feel coming from?

                                  JANE
                    Not from me.  Maybe you're 
                      projecting.

                                  KRISTINA
                    Rosemary was my friend.  Am I sad?   *
                    Of course.  Angry?  Only that  *
                    someone could do such a terrible  *
                    thing.  Don't take this the wrong  *
                    way, but you're totally misreading  *
                    the situation. *

                                  JANE
                    You think so?  Oh, this is gonna be  *
                    good.    *

      FADE IN:

44INT. CONFERENCE AREA. CBI HQ - DAY (D/2) 

      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt talk with Kristina Frye.  She has 
      an odd calming presence.  She's speaking to everyone, but her 
      connection is with Jane.

                                  LISBON
                    How long have you known Rosemary 
                    Tennant?

                                  KRISTINA
                    Almost three years.  

                                  JANE
                    Do you charge for your services?

                                  KRISTINA 
                    Yes.  How much depends on the 
                    resources of the individual client.  
                    I never turn anyone away.

                                  JANE
                    How much did you charge Rosemary?

                                  KRISTINA
                    Five hundred dollars per hour.

                                  JANE 
                    How many hours a week? 

                                  KRISTINA
                    Five or six.

                                  JANE
                    That's three grand a week.  Nice.

                                  KRISTINA 
                    Rosemary was a troubled soul.  
                    She needed intensive help.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What was troubling her?

                                  KRISTINA
                    Her husband had been a powerful 
                    anchor in her life.  After his 
                    death, she was adrift, vulnerable.

                    People she shouldn't have trusted

                    Oh, too many to mention.  As a 
                    result, I think her relationship 
                    with her children suffered.

                    I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable

                                  VAN PELT
                    Travis went missing several days 
                    ago.  What did she have to say 
                    about that?

                    For free then.  You act arrogant

                    consumed by terrible guilt and self-

55EXT. TENNANT HOUSE. SANTA ROSA - DAY 

      A grand place, but not what it once was.  Jane, Lisbon and 
      Rigsby approach.  

                                  LISBON
                    Do we know who's home?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Until two days ago, the residents 
                    were Travis Tennant, Rosemary 
                    Tennant and a semi-permanent house 
                    guest, name of Jeremy Hale.  A 
                    portrait photographer.  Mrs. 
                    Tennant's boyfriend according to 
                    the gardener and the pool guy. 

      Suddenly, the door opens and a friendly GOLDEN RETRIEVER runs 
      out.  CLASSICAL MUSIC ECHOES from inside.  JEREMY HALE, 30's, 
      bearded artist-type, stands in the doorway. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     10.

66INT. LIVING ROOM. TENNANT HOUSE - DAY 

      Classic decor is now accented by mounds of papers and 
      magazines, dishes that haven't been cleaned and empty beer 
      bottles and wine glasses on the coffee table.  Lisbon and 
      Rigsby sit as Jane looks around.  Jeremy tries to clean up.   

                                  JEREMY
                    Sorry about all this.

                                  JEREMY
                    I was at a gallery opening, but 
                    someone's always here.  Rosie liked 
                    having people around.  And you know 
                    us creative types -- any chance to 
                    put off work.   

      Jane looks at framed PHOTOS on the piano.  Pictures of 
      Rosemary and her late husband, Macon.  Photos of the whole 
      family -- Travis and Clara -- during happier times. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    How long have you lived here?

                    Going on six months.  I'm a 
                      photographer.  Rosemary and I met 
                    at a show.  I came to do a 
                    portrait, and I guess we just kind 
                    of gelled.  I never left.

                    Did I love her and vice versa?  
                    Yes.  But lovers?  We were close.

                    Over a week ago.  Rosie found drugs

                    I felt bad about that actually. 
                    It's too much.  But Rosemary was a 
                    very generous person.  To refuse 
                    her generosity would be to deny her 
                    essence. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    The day before she died, she made 
                    an appointment with her estate 
                    lawyer.  Told him she wanted to 
                    make further alterations to the 
                    trust.

                    I can only imagine it had something 
                    to do with Travis.  Cut him off and  
                    maybe it would straighten him out. 

      Suddenly Jane calls from upstairs.

      Lisbon, Rigsby and Jeremy exit the living room and head for

77INT. JEREMY'S ROOM. TENNANT HOUSE - DAY 

      Moments later.  The room is full of LARGE PORTRAIT PHOTOS -- 
      some hanging on display, others stacked in the corner or 
      laying flat on a tabletop.  Many are of Rosemary Tennant, but 
      there are photos of other women as well.  Camera equipment 
      and lights are set up against a backdrop -- a makeshift 
      studio.   

      Jane holds a PORTRAIT of the victim in his hands.  Looks at 
      it and smiles.

                    Rosemary was an easy subject.  The 
                    photos still don't do her justice.

                    This is quite a set-up.

                    Full dark room, top-of-the-line

      A look between Jane and Jeremy.

                    You say Travis left because he and 
                    his mom had a fight.  Are you sure 
                    about that?

      Jane clocks Jeremy's awkwardness.

                                  JEREMY
                    Of course.  I was there. 

                                  JANE
                    I think Mrs. Tennant turned a blind 
                    eye toward her son's problems 
                    because he lost his dad.  Travis 
                    didn't leave because of her.  He 
                    left because of you. 

                                  JEREMY
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JANE
                    I think this was Travis' room. 

      Jane moves around the studio.

      Jane moves to the window.

                    Over here, this pane of glass has a 
                    crack in it.  Just about the right 
                    height for an elbow or a fist.  
                    That must have been some argument

                                  JEREMY
                    Okay, that's enough.

      Jane gets in Jeremy's face.  Jeremy nervously clenches his 
      fists. 

                                  JANE
                    The only question is, did you take 
                    his room as soon as he left?  Or 
                    did he leave because you took his 
                    room?  

                                  JEREMY
                    You're in my personal space.  
                    Please step back.

      Jane steps back.

                    Excuse me.

                    So you kick him out of here and he 
                    needs someplace safe -- someplace 
                    to hide where change can't find 
                    him.     

                                  RIGSBY
                    So where did he go?

      Jane glances up at the ceiling.

      Jane and Lisbon and Rigsby and Van Pelt sitting around.

                                  LISBON
                    I know Travis Tennant is suspect 
                    number one, but Jeremy isn't 
                    exactly in mourning right now.

                    I'll do some digging on Hale.  See

                                  LISBON
                    Who's to say the kid's not dead 
                    too?  Maybe Jeremy killed both of 
                    them.   More money in the will for 
                    him.  Anything on the business 
                    side?

      Rigsby hits the laptop.

                                  RIGSBY
                    The psychic was right -- every high-
                    end con artist and social parasite 
                    in town was hitting Rosemary up for 
                      a million.  But those guys are all 
                    white collar leaches, not 
                      murderers. 

      Suddenly, CLARA TENNANT, 20's, Rosemary's daughter, enters

                    answer your question -- no.  Travis 
                    is still missing.  We're doing 
                      everything we can to find him.  Can 
                    you tell us about your mother?  
                    Anything might help.

                          (nerves frayed)
                    I just can't believe she's gone.  
                    I mean, first my dad and now... She 
                    was such a great person, everybody 
                    loved her, and for her to die in 
                    the gutter like that?  Like 
                    garbage.  My God.  It's horrible.  
                    She was such a good woman. 

                                  LISBON
                    People say she changed after your

                                  CLARA
                    Well, yes.  Somewhat.

                                  LISBON 
                    In what way?

                                  CLARA
                    She, she sort of lost control.  My 
                    father kept it all going, but Mom 
                    was never that person.  Not 
                    together. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Can you give us an example?

                                  CLARA
                    When I was in college, my brother 
                    would call to tell me people were 
                    ripping us off.  Mom was always 
                    investing in one bad scheme or 
                    another.  I tried to warn her, but 
                    she wouldn't listen.  

      Jane leans forward and nonchalantly touches her hand 
        establishing a physical rapport.

                    Jane, I'll never doubt you again.  

                                  JANE
                    You ever doubted me?  

      As Jane and the guys stand --

1111EXT. PARK. CAROUSEL - NIGHT 

      Moments later.  Travis gets into a chariot.  As the carousel 
      starts to turn, the guys take positions.  

      The MUSIC PLAYS.  The LIGHTS FLASH.  Eyes welling with tears, 
      Travis doesn't notice Jane passing one horse after another, 
      moving closer.  Then their eyes connect and, like a deer in 
      headlights, Travis realizes something's up.  He turns and 
      sees Cho in one direction, Rigsby in another.  He grabs his 
      backpack to bolt. 

                                  JANE
                    Travis, wait...

      ANGLE: Travis turns, desperate, but they're all around him. 

      Off Jane as the carousel continues to spin --

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT (N/2 CONT'D)1212

      Lisbon and Cho question a terrified Travis Tennant.  

                                  LISBON
                    Travis, we know why you took off.  
                    We know about the fight you had 
                    with Jeremy.  Why didn't you call 
                    somebody?  Why did you just run?

                                  TRAVIS
                    Because there wasn't anything they 
                    could do.  Because I didn't want to 
                    cause anymore trouble. 

                                  LISBON
                    Trouble for who?  They were your 
                    family.  

                                  TRAVIS
                    You guys don't understand -- I 
                    loved my mom so much, but after the 
                    blowout with Jeremy, I couldn't go 
                    back there.  There was no way.

      Clara stands with Jane watching her brother through the

                    We use to go for walks together, 
                    you know.  Maybe if I had been home 
                    that night she'd still be alive. 
                    Maybe...

                                  LISBON
                    Travis, here's the truth.  Since 
                    your dad died, your mom had given a 
                    lot of your money away.  Then she 
                    brought Jeremy into the house and 
                    made your life miserable. 

                                  CHO
                    Even though you took off, you knew 
                    where she'd be that night.  You 
                    knew how she'd walk home.

      Travis erupts.  Stands, kicking back the chair.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Are you saying I did this?  After 
                    my dad died, my mom was all I had.  
                    You don't think I wanted to be 
                    there for her?  Then that dirtbag 
                    Jeremy moves in.  Starts bossing me 
                    around, telling me what to do.    
                          (holds back crying)
                    She was my mom.  I didn't kill her. 

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS1515

      Again, Jane rests a gentle hand on Clara's shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    I believe him.  

      Jane gestures for her to go inside. 

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ. - CONTINUOUS1616

      As Travis tries to gather himself, the door opens and his 
      sister Clara enters.  They stare at each other for a brief 
      moment then embrace.   

                                  CLARA
                    We'll be alright.  We'll be fine.   

      Jane stands in the doorway, watching.

1717INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt approach Rigsby at his desk.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Travis is hurting.

                                  LISBON
                    Or lying.  Don't forget Jeremy Hale 
                    stands to inherit a few million, 
                    too.  Why not speed up the process?  
                    Finance a nice long photo shoot in 
                    South America and lay low for a 
                    while. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    I heard from Rosemary's probate 
                    lawyer.  Guess who she had just 
                    added to her will?

      Jane leans in to read Rigsby's computer.

                                  JANE
                    Kristina Frye.

                                  RIGSBY
                    The ink wasn't even dry yet.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Kristina told us she knew in 
                    advance that Rosemary was in 
                    danger.  Why tell us that if she's 
                    guilty?  

                                  JANE 
                    How diabolically clever would that 
                    be?  Making us dismiss her as a 
                    suspect because she's made herself 
                    look like one.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Or maybe, just maybe, she has a 
                    rare and precious gift and she's 
                    trying to help us.

                                  JANE
                    A rare and precious gift.  Who gets 
                    these gifts anyhow?  How come no 
                    one ever gets a gift for seeing 
                    horse race results?  How come dead

                    Who says there's no Easter Bunny?

      Suddenly the PHONE RINGS.  Van Pelt answers. 

                                  VAN PELT
                          (into phone)

      She hangs up.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    That was Kristina Frye.
                    She says she's picking up on 
                      something.  Something that could 
                    help us.

      Jane grabs his jacket.

                                  JANE
                    I'll come.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Does he have to?

      Lisbon thinks, nods, yes.

                                  LISBON
                    If she's conning us, we need to

                                  VAN PELT
                    She isn't.  I can tell.

      And as Jane and Van Pelt exit --

1818INT. FOYER/WAITING ROOM. TEMPLE OF HARMONIC BLISS - DAY  

      Jane and Van Pelt are buzzed in.  They enter the front door 
      of Kristina's cozy, well-appointed home.  Couches and chairs 
      accent the decor of the entry, making it more of a waiting 
      room.    



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     24.

      Jane looks around like a kid in a candy shop.  POSTER-SIZE 
      TAROT CARDS hang framed on the walls.  A beautiful PHOTO 
      portrait of Kristina, crystals and shamanistic paraphernalia 
      abound.  He whispers to Van Pelt.

                    Aren't you the least bit interested 
                    in what she has to say?

                                  JANE
                    No, but I love the mirror.  
                      Conveniently placed, isn't it? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JANE
                    It's one-way glass -- textbook 
                      clairvoyant trick.  She studies 
                    clients' body language before they 
                    come in.  Come on, I bet she's 
                    watching us right now.

      Jane playfully waves to the mirror, then heads for the door 
      connecting to the adjacent room.  Puts his hand on the knob. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    You can't go in there. 

                                  JANE
                    Sure I can.

      ANGLE: Jane throws open the door and peers inside hoping to 
      catch Kristina in the act.  Unfortunately there is no window 
      on the other side and Kristina's nowhere to be found.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     25.

      Suddenly, Kristina clears her throat.  They turn to find her 
      standing behind them, having entered from a different room, 
      cup of coffee in hand.

                    loss.  Is that why you gave up your 
                    calling?  

                                  JANE
                      A calling?  Is that what this is?

                                  KRISTINA
                    Yes.  A calling.  A gift.  As you 
                    like.  It's clear that you have it.  
                    Why did you give it up?

                                  JANE
                    It was those suits.  The dry 
                    cleaning was killing me.

                                  KRISTINA 
                    Always dancing.  Why is that?

                                  JANE
                    Don't try to cold read me. 

                                  KRISTINA
                      I wouldn't know how. 

                                  JANE
                    We both know that's not true.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Can we, um... talk about the case?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Did you speak to Rosemary 
                    yet?  Did she give you permission 
                    to speak to us?

                                  KRISTINA
                    No.  Not yet.  It often takes some 
                    time for souls to make a full 
                    transit.  

                                  JANE
                    The celestial bus is running late?    

      Kristina stands.

                                  KRISTINA
                    I called to offer my assistance.  
                    Clearly you're not interested. 

      Van Pelt gives Jane a fierce glance.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     27.

                      interested.  

       Kristina hesitates, then --

                                  KRISTINA
                    I had a vision of the car used to 
                    kill Rosemary.  Water rushing into 
                    windows.  Tires under water, 
                    resting on concrete.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Concrete?  Like a swimming pool? 

                                  KRISTINA
                    Bigger.

                                  VAN PELT
                      A reservoir maybe?  There's 
                    Founders Lake, just outside town?

                                  KRISTINA
                    Yes.  A reservoir.

2020EXT. FOUNDER'S LAKE - DAY 

      Local Police, DIVERS and a TOW TRUCK surround the reservoir.  
      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt watch as the same SILVER SEDAN that 
      hit Rosemary Tennant emerges from the water at the end of a 
      tow-truck winch.  Jane eyes Kristina observing nearby.  Cho 
      climbs off the back of the tow-truck, clipboard in hand.

                                  CHO
                    Damage to the front end is 
                      consistent with a vehicle versus 
                      pedestrian collision.  But get this  *
                    -- the VIN number matches Rosemary 
                    Tennant's own registration.  

                                  LISBON
                    It's her car?

                    Two moving violations show Travis 
                    used the vehicle all the time. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    It could have been Jeremy.  He had 
                    access to it as well.

                    Put one of them in this car that 
                    night -- traffic cameras, a witness 
                    at a gas station.  If it exists, I

                    I'm on it.

      Santa Rosa Detective Francis approaches.

                                    FRANCIS
                    You going to arrest Travis Tennant, 
                    or you want us to do it?

                                  LISBON
                    Sorry, Detective, but everything 
                    we've got so far is circumstantial.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Well, I go with my gut.  Ninety 
                    percent of the time if it feels 
                    right, it's meant to be. 

                                  LISBON
                    And what about the other ten 
                    percent?

      He checks Lisbon out, smiles.  Cho and Francis move off to 
      take a look inside the sedan.  Jane keeps watching Kristina.

                                  JANE
                    If anyone needs arresting it's 
                    Kristina Frye.  She knew Rosemary 
                    was in danger.  She knew where to 
                    find the car.  The murder weapon.  
                    Which means either she really does 
                    have supernatural powers or, she 
                    was involved in the crime.   

      Lisbon smiles.

                                  LISBON
                    Come on.  She simply did what you 
                    do so well.  With an air of great 
                      confidence, she made an educated 
                    guess.  Where else would you dump a 
                    car around here?  She's a good 
                    guesser.

                                  JANE
                    Well, yes.  That's possible also.

                    Yes.  And that's what you object 
                    to, isn't it?  Not that she's a con 
                    artist, but that she's so good at 
                    it.  Maybe even better than you.

                    Not at all.  Alright, yes.  Not 
                    better than me mind you, but she's 
                    good.  It's the good ones that are 
                    most dangerous.    

      Van Pelt is agitated by their certainty.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Excuse me, but you might consider 
                    the possibility that she's actually 
                    honestly in touch with things that 
                    are beyond your understanding. 

                                  JANE
                    That would be golf, and musical 
                    theater.

      Cho comes back from the sedan carrying a pair of gloves in a

                    of Mom's jewelry is missing also.

                    Someone stole your mom's car and

                    here?

                                  CONNIE
                    Baby?

      Suddenly Jeremy enters from the kitchen, seemingly oblivious 
      to their arrival.  He's wearing boxers and is shaking a can 
      of Reddi-Whip in his hand.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hi, Jeremy.  

                                  JEREMY
                    Hey...

                    Let's go talk.  You're going to

                                  RIGSBY
                    Or a lot more whipped cream.  Your 
                    call.

      Off Jeremy, stunned, and seemingly guilty as sin --

      FADE IN:

2525INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT (N/3) 

      Lisbon and Cho question Jeremy Hale.  Jeremy is a little more 
      guarded, ill-at-ease.

                                  LISBON
                    Rosemary was killed by someone 
                    driving one of her own cars.    

                                  JEREMY
                    Okay. 

                                  CHO
                    A Silver Chrysler.  You ever drive 
                    that car, Jeremy?

                                  JEREMY
                    No.  That's the car Travis drove.  
                    Not my style.

                                  LISBON
                    Thing is, we found gloves in the 
                    car that come from your photo lab.  
                    What're the odds we find your DNA 
                    on them?   

                                  JEREMY
                    Travis could have taken those. 

                                  CHO
                    Travis has an alibi.  You could 
                    have taken the car in order to 
                    throw suspicion on him.   

                                  JEREMY
                    I could have I suppose.  But I 
                    didn't.

                                  LISBON
                    You moved out of the Tennant house 
                    fast.  Running away almost.  Why 
                    was that?

                                  JEREMY
                    I got into it with the kids.  That 
                    Clara is insane.  I thought she was 
                    going to assault me.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     34.

                    They think you killed their mother.

                                  JEREMY 
                    They don't know anything about me.  
                    I loved her.

                                  LISBON
                    Of course you did.  That's why you 
                    gave Rosemary's necklace to your 
                    hot young girlfriend. 

                                  JEREMY
                    It's no good to Rosemary, is it?  
                    So shoot me, I'm a pragmatist. 

      Lisbon opens a file folder.  Pushes three different PHOTOS of 
      DIFFERENT OLDER WOMEN across the table.  

                                  LISBON
                    Good word for it.  Miami, New York, 
                    Chicago.  All widows.  All 
                      contributors to your budding 
                    career. 

                                  JEREMY
                    All alive and well and still good 
                    friends of mine, if you care to 
                    speak to any of them.  Well... 
                          (tapping one of the 
                            photos, smiling)
                    Phoebe might be a little ambivalent 
                    about me, but all the others... 

                                  LISBON
                    Have you ever met Kristina Frye?

      Jeremy hesitates.  Lisbon notices his thumb nervously tapping 
      the tabletop. 

                                  JEREMY
                    The name is familiar, but no.  
                    I don't think so.

                                  LISBON
                    She was Rosemary's psychic.  I 
                    think you do know Kristina and 
                    you've taken her photograph. 

                                  CHO
                    Jane tells us one of your portraits 
                    is hanging in her foyer.

      CONTINUED: (2)2525

                                  JEREMY
                    I take a lot of pictures. 

                                  LISBON
                    Two beneficiaries on the same will, 
                    both intimate friends of 
                      Rosemary's, but you've never 
                    actually met.  What are the 
                    chances?   

      ANGLE: Jeremy's thumb finally stops tapping the table.

                                  JEREMY
                    I want a lawyer.

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY (D/4)2828

      Rigsby leans over and taps away on his computer. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Boss... check this out.  Info on 
                    Kristina Frye. 

      Lisbon approaches.  Van Pelt, curious, follows.

      ANGLE ON:  Multiple windows open connecting Frye's finances 
      to five different deaths around the state. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    In the last ten years, each of 
                    these people left her named in 
                    their wills.  Paydays ranging from 
                    ten to two hundred thousand 
                    dollars.  

                                  LISBON
                    It might be the psychic and Jeremy 
                    have a business partnership, 
                    fleecing vulnerable women.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So Jane might be right.

                                  VAN PELT
                    It doesn't prove anything.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  But's it's a good place to 
                    start a conversation with Frye. 

      Off Van Pelt's reluctance --        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     36.


2929INT. LIVING ROOM. TEMPLE OF HARMONIC BLISS - DAY 

      Cho and Jane sit with Frye.  

                                  CHO
                    Kristina, how well do you know 
                    Jeremy Hale?

                                  KRISTINA
                    He's Rosemary's lover.  Something 
                    of a user I'd say.  But genuinely 
                    fond of her I think.  And quite a 
                    talented photographer.  He took my 
                    picture. 

                                  JANE
                    You know he's also named in the 
                    victim's will?

                                  KRISTINA
                    If that was Rosemary's decision, 
                    fine.  What are you getting at?

                                  CHO
                    Over the last decade, five 
                    different people have named you in 
                    their wills. 

                                  KRISTINA
                    Against my expressed wishes.  I've 
                    helped hundreds of sick clients 
                    confront their fear of dying.  I 
                    assure them that I'll try to speak 
                    to them after they're gone.  But 
                    I've never asked for anything in 
                    return.  Ever.  

                                  CHO
                    Why did Jeremy Hale get nervous 
                    when your name was mentioned?

      Kristina smiles, takes a beat.

                                  KRISTINA
                    Probably because he and I had sex 
                    on a couple of occasions.  We had 
                    fun.  He's very good. 

      Jane's disarmed by her candor.

                                  JANE
                    Have you spoken to Rosemary yet? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     37.

                                  KRISTINA
                    Yes I have.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh you did.  What did she say?

                                  KRISTINA
                    She was very taken with you for 
                    some reason.  She said you're a 
                    good man.  A deeply misguided and 
                    damaged man, but good. 

                                  JANE
                    Nice of her to say so.  Did she say 
                    who killed her?

                                  KRISTINA
                    No.  She doesn't know.  But she 
                    wants me to keep helping you in any 
                    way I can.  

                                  JANE
                    Now that you mention it, I'd like 
                    to listen to those CDs of your 
                    sessions together.

                                  KRISTINA
                      Absolutely.

                                  JANE
                    And can you have Rosemary appear at 
                    the reading of the will?

                                  KRISTINA 
                    She's a departed soul.  Not a 
                    wedding singer.  You can't book her 
                    in advance.

                                  JANE 
                    Shame.  They don't have watches I 
                      suppose... *

                                  KRISTINA *
                    No schedule to keep. *

3030EXT. TENNANT HOUSE - DAY 

      A brisk autumn day.  Jane pulls up in front of the house.  
      Dooley, the Retriever, is running around.  Travis is out 
      front tossing a ball with his lacrosse stick as high into the 
      air as he can and catching it.

      It's out of sync with his emo-punk appearance and kind of 
      touching for that reason.

                                  JANE
                    Nice cradling.

                                  TRAVIS
                    You play lacrosse?

                                  JANE
                    No.  Fast moving sticks scare me.

      Travis throws the ball up again.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Did you find who did it yet?

                    Not yet.

      Clara comes out of the house. 

                                  CLARA
                    Hi.  Find anything?

                                  JANE
                    I think Kristina Frye is 
                      responsible for your mother's 
                    death.  I need you to tell her that

                    To contact your mom when the will

                                  CLARA
                    I don't understand.  How will 
                    getting in touch with my mom help 
                    you catch Kristina?

                                  JANE
                    She won't really be getting in 
                    touch with your mother.  She's a

                    But how do you know she won't 
                    really pull it off?

                    I don't like it.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Me neither, but what's the 
                      alternative?

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's immoral.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Don't know about that.  But they 
                    say your brain gets cooked if you 
                    use them a lot.  Makes you 
                      infertile, too. 

                                  VAN PELT 
                    What are you talking about?

                                  RIGSBY
                      Microwaves.  What are you talking about?

                    The seance this evening. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    We were looking at the microwave.
                    The seance has nothing to do with 
                    anything.

      Van Pelt makes an exasperated gesture...

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's wrong to play with that stuff.  
                    Raising the dead.

                                  JANE
                    We won't actually be doing that. 
                    Raising dead people.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You say that.  You don't know.  
                    You're mocking the occult.  You 
                    don't have any belief in the 
                      afterlife.  You don't know what 
                    you're getting into.

                                  JANE
                    I know seances are tools for con 
                    artists like Kristina to manipulate 
                    people.

                    Booo!

      Van Pelt jumps.  Rigsby laughs a little too boorishly.  Van 
      Pelt's angry and embarrassed and gives them both a hurt look.

                                  VAN PELT
                          (angry)
                    Laugh.  Go ahead.  It's really 
                    important to you that Kristina's a 
                    fake, isn't it?  Because if she isn't, 
                    if she does have a gift, everything 
                    you mock, everything you discredit, 
                      everything you stand for is turned 
                    upside down.  

                                  JANE
                    Er, yes.  True.  Unlikely, but 
                    true.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What if your family is looking down 
                    at you at this seance tonight, 
                    trying to talk to you, but they 
                    can't, because you won't believe?

      Beat.

                                  JANE
                    That would be very sad.

      Van Pelt realizes what she just said.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

                                  JANE
                    It's okay.  

      Van Pelt runs off.  Rigsby follows her.  ON Jane, pain in his 
      eyes.

3333INT. LIVING ROOM. TENNANT HOUSE - NIGHT (N/4) 

      The house is full of people.  Jane, Lisbon, Van Pelt, Clara, 
      Travis, Jeremy, Kristina and several MOTLEY RECIPIENTS of 
      Rosemary's eccentric largesse.   

        A HIGH-CLASS LAWYER sniffs at Jane and Lisbon and Clara.

                                  LAWYER
                    Really, it's quite irregular.

                          (firmly)
                    It's what my mother wanted.

                                  LAWYER
                    Very well. 

      He addresses the room.

                                  LAWYER (CONT'D)
                    If you would all please sit down...

      The principals sit around on sofas.  The rest, including the 
      CBI team, sit on chairs against the walls.

      Jane remains standing (in Clara's view). 

                                  LAWYER (CONT'D)
                    At the request of Rosemary and her 
                    daughter, Clara, the reading of the

                                  KRISTINA
                    A contact ritual.  Some call it a 
                    seance.

                          (with distaste)
                    A seance.

                                  KRISTINA
                    Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  
                    With your help, I'm going to try 
                    and contact Rosemary.  Will you all 
                    hold hands with your neighbor on 
                    either side.  Everybody.  Good.  
                    Thank you.

      Everybody does so, including the CBI team.

                          (an aside to Jane)
                    Would you turn down the lights.

      Jane turns off the lights.

                                  KRISTINA (CONT'D)
                          (to the room)
                    The veil will be drawn back and 
                    Rosemary will come to us as long as 
                    we believe.  As long as we believe.  

      Silence.  The room's in darkness, lit by moonlight and a 
      candle on the coffee table.    

                                  KRISTINA (CONT'D)
                      Everybody, please concentrate on 
                    the candle at the center of the 
                    table.  Look at it and concentrate 
                    on Rosemary.  Rosemary, come to us. 
                    Come to us.  Speak.  

      The candle is rifled by a gust of wind.  A gasp from the 
      audience.  Clara looks to Jane to reassure herself that he's 
      on top of things.  He smiles, nods.  

      But then A GHOSTLY VOICE -- very quiet at first -- surprises 
      him.  

                                  ROSEMARY (O.S.)
                    Kristina?  Kristina?  

      In answer to Clara's quizzical look, Jane shakes his head, 
      puzzled.  He doesn't understand it either.

                                  KRISTINA
                    Yes, Rosemary, it's me.  I'm here. 
                    As I promised I would be.  All your 
                    friends and family are here also.  
                    Is there something you want to say?  
                    Or ask?  Rosemary?

                                  ROSEMARY (O.S.)
                    Clara... Clara?

      Clara is wide-eyed in fear and amazement.

                                  CLARA
                    M-mommy?

      Clara crouches beside the bannister, hands over her ears.

      Jane follows her in, crouching down beside her.

                    I know what you're doing.  And it

                    This is all some scheme you and 
                    Kristina cooked up, isn't it?  
                    Well, it's very effective, but I'm 
                    not buying it.  I can't.   

      This dashes Clara's last rational hope that Jane is screwing 
      with her.

                    She wouldn't take my call.  Her own 
                    daughter?  I just got mad.  I got 
                    so mad.

      She turns on the headlights and swerves out into the street.  
      She knocks over the garbage cans, hops the curb and hits 
      Rosemary.

                    Then I went back to the house and 
                    took a pair of Jeremy's gloves from

                    I dumped it in the reservoir.

                    It didn't occur to me until later 
                    when you started trying to pin the 
                    blame on Jeremy, but when you first 
                    came here, you expressed great 
                    horror that your mother died in the 
                    gutter.  Not in the road, or the

      INT. CONFERENCE AREA. CBI HQ. - NIGHT4747

      Clara, in handcuffs, is escorted by a Santa Rosa Uni Officer 
      to see Travis.  Travis stands with Jane and a SOCIAL SERVICES 
      COUNSELOR.  Lisbon and the others watch.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Clara, I know that you weren't 
                    thinking right when you did what 
                    you did.  Mom forgives you.

      This is Travis becoming a man right here, but Clara doesn't 
      want to go there.  Pretends all's well. 

                                  CLARA
                    You be good to Aunt Jo.  Don't 
                    leave your clothes everyplace, 
                    okay.  Be respectful.

      Travis sees that she's not going to connect...

                                  TRAVIS
                    I will.  You take care.  I love 
                    you.

      He gives her a kiss on the cheek.  The Uniform Cop takes 
      Clara away.  Travis shakes hands manfully with Cho.

                                  TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Thank you for letting me speak with 
                    her. 

      Jane, sad as hell, watches Travis exit with Cho.  We pick up 
      Detective Francis talking to Lisbon.

                                    FRANCIS 
                          (quietly to Lisbon)
                    Was meaning to ask.  Do you ever 
                    date other cops?

                    I know a lot of females on the job 
                    have rules about that stuff.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes I do.  Have rules.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Can I see a copy of your rules?  
                    Maybe there's a loophole.  Or 
                      something.

                                  LISBON
                    No loopholes.  But it was nice to 
                    meet you, Detective Francis...

      Lisbon shakes Francis' hand briskly and exits, leaving him 
      nonplussed.

      From a distance, Jane smiles at that exchange, and lays on 
      his sofa.  Despite office bustle, he closes his eyes.  We let 
      him be for a beat, then...

                                  KRISTINA (O.S.)
                    You sleep here?

      Jane opens his eyes, smiles at her, but resists the urge to 
      sit up.  

                                  JANE
                    I find the noise restful.  Like the

                                  KRISTINA
                    I came for my recordings.

      She points at the stack of CDs on Jane's desk.  Jane allows 
      himself to sit up. 

                                  JANE
                    Help yourself.

      She puts the CDs in a shoulder bag.

                                  KRISTINA
                    I have something I need to tell
