  11EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

          Johnny's Range Rover cruises along through the wooded
            countryside.

                                        SARAH V.O.
                          I appreciate you driving us out
                        to see my father.


  22INT. RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny is driving, Sarah in the passenger seat and JJ in
          the back, playing Gameboy.  The kid does not look happy.

                                        SARAH
                        This was not a good time for my
                        car to die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It must be nice to have your dad
                        move back to Cleaves Mills.

                                        SARAH
                          "Nice"--that's one way to describe
                        it.

          Sarah checks her watch.  Johnny notices.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wasn't happy about leaving
                          Florida?

                                        SARAH
                        He didn't have any choice.  With
                        Mom gone and him suffering his
                        second stroke, the doctors said
                        it wasn't a good idea for him to
                        live on his own.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about your place?

                                        SARAH
                        He wouldn't even discuss it.

          She checks her watch again.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - TEASER - 4/29/05 - GOLD     2.


    2CONTINUED:2

          She catches Johnny watching her.

                                        SARAH
                        I told him I'd be there at ten. 
                        I don't want to be late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's funny, when we were going
                        out, you were always late.

                                        SARAH
                        I was not.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, you were.  I missed the first
                        twenty minutes of every movie we
                        saw.  How did ET get to Earth?  I
                        don't know.  Why did the Empire
                        need to strike back?  Beats me.

                                        JJ
                                  (sarcastic, nose in
                                  Gameboy)
                        Way to go, Mom.

                                        SARAH
                        Now you're ganging up on me.
                                (seeing the turn off)
                        It's the next right.


  33EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

          The Rover turns off onto a side road and past a sign that
          reads, "FOXGLOVE RETIREMENT HOME"  'More Than Friends,
          We're Like Family'.  There's a picture of a smiling elderly
          man and woman.  The perfect place to spend your golden
          years.


  44INT. RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS

          As they pull up in front of a large, Stephen King-picture
          perfect house with a manicured lawn and wide front porch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This looks fantastic.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you think, JJ?

                                        JJ
                        Cool.  Can we go home now?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - TEASER - 4/27/05 - PINK     3.


    4CONTINUED:4

          Sarah gathers herself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You okay?

                                        SARAH
                                (covering)
                        I'm fine.  Let's go.

          She gets out, Johnny and JJ follow...


  55INT. FOXGLOVE - MOMENTS LATER

          They ENTER into the large foyer with a large floral
            arrangement--TALL STALKS OF FOXGLOVE--in the center. 
          Several elderly residents walk past in conversation. 
          Johnny notices a look on JJ's face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong?

                                        JJ
                        It smells in here.

                                        SARAH
                        Smells like what?

                                        JJ
                        Old people.

          Johnny stifles a laugh, then gets a stern look from Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He said it.

          Johnny spots a UNI-SEX RESTROOM (they have these in
            converted houses, unlike what you might find in a
          commercial hospital).

                                        JOHNNY
                        You guys go on, I'm going to visit
                        the little old persons' room.

          JJ laughs.  Sarah isn't amused.  Johnny points at JJ as
          he moves away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's him, not me.


  66INT. RESTROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Johnny's at the sink, washing his hands.  He goes to touch
          the soap dispenser and--WHOOSH.          DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - TEASER - 4/27/05 - PINK     4.


  77EXT. FIELD - VISION

          Johnny is standing in the woods.  It seems peaceful enough
          as he turns and SEES the back of what appears to be an
          OLDER WOMAN sitting on the ground against a rock.  Johnny
          steps closer to get a better look.  As he steps around,
          we see the woman's eyes are open, her face seems peaceful
          and content, but there's something wrong about her.  Her
          eyes don't move, her skin seems pale and dried.  As Johnny
          leans down to look closer at her face, a LARGE BUG suddenly
          CRAWLS OUT OF HER MOUTH.  Johnny jumps back.  It's now
          obvious that she's DEAD.


  88RESUME - RESTROOM

          Johnny flashes quickly out of the vision, staring at
          himself in the mirror.  What the hell was that?


  99INT. FOXGLOVE - JUST OUTSIDE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

          As Johnny opens the door to head out, there's a Little
          Old Lady standing there with her back to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me--

          She TURNS as Johnny finds himself looking straight into
          the face of the very same Woman he just saw in his vision --
          dead as a doornail.

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        I'll never get used to these co-
                        ed water closets.

          She enters the bathroom, closing the door behind her. 
          OFF Johnny's look,

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  1010INT. FOXGLOVE - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny hesitates as he sees Sarah talking to a younger
          looking woman.  MARY JANE STAMPWELL, she wears gardening
          gloves and hat, she carries a basketful of freshcut
            FOXGLOVE.  She's friendly but there's something odd about
          her.

                                        MARY JANE
                          I wasn't expecting you 'til ten.

                                        SARAH
                          I didn't want to take a chance
                        with the traffic.

          Johnny joins them.

                                        SARAH
                        Mrs. Stampwell.  Johnny Smith. 
                          Johnny's an old friend of the
                        family.

                                        MARY JANE
                        Mister Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like you've got a green
                        thumb.

                                        MARY JANE
                        These lovelies--Foxgloves, my
                          favorite.  The house is named for
                        them.

          It's kind of creepy, the way she sniffs at the flowers,
          caresses them as she arranges them in a vase.

                                        SARAH
                        How was my father's first night?

                                        MARY JANE
                        A bit restless.  They all are at
                        first.  He had roast beef for
                        dinner and a double helping of
                        apple pie.

                        Wow.  I microwaved some leftover
                          macaroni and cheese.

          JJ laughs.  But Mary Jane just stares at him.

                        The house is restricted to senior
                          citizens only.

                        To be perfectly frank, I don't
                        believe a younger man would fit
                        in here.

          Now it's Sarah that stifles the laugh, as Johnny gives
          up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, you're probably right. 
                        I don't know what I was thinking.

          Awkward BEAT, then....

                                        MARY JANE
                        Well, I should check on lunch. 
                        It was nice meeting you.

          She walks away.

                                        JOHNNY

  1111THEY TURN A CORNER

          and run into Bruce, who s walking an old man, MR. COLBERT.

                        What are you doing here?

                                        BRUCE
                        I have a few physical therapy
                          patients here.  Hey, JJ.

                                        JJ
                                (still reading his

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah's father just moved in here.

                                        BRUCE
                        Really?  That's great.  I mean,
                        it must be nice to have him close?

          Sarah nods and forces a smile, as the OLD MAN clears his
            throat...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, my bad.  Everybody, this is

                                        BRUCE
                        You have to shout at him.

                        It's something the patients made

                        That sounds cool.

                                        SARAH
                        It sounds terrible.

                        Well, we better finish our walk.

          Bruce shrugs and walks away helping the old man.  Mr.

  1212THEY ROUND THE CORNER,

          as Sarah STOPS and SEES...

          MARTY

          Sarah's dad, 75, a gruff looking man with white hair and
          a slightly frail body.  At the moment, he's getting a
          lesson in how to play the DRUMS from SPYDER, early 20s, a
          heavily tattooed rocker type in scrubs who works at the
          home.  Marty, his back to Sarah and Johnny, is banging
          the drum sticks on the table top.  He's enjoying himself.

                                        SPYDER
                        That's pretty good.

                                        MARTY
                        I used to play a little when I
                        was young.  Always dreamed I was
                        the next Gene Krupa.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey, Dad!

          He suddenly stops drumming, his expression shifting
            slightly.

                                        MARTY
                        That's enough for today.

          It's an awkward moment.  When it's obvious Marty isn't
          going to make introductions, Sarah sticks her hand out to
          Spyder.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm Sarah, the daughter.

                        Spyder.  The orderly.

          As Sarah shakes his hand, Johnny looks at the tattooed
          snake crawling ominously up Spyder's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Drummer, huh?

                                        SPYDER
                        Yeah.

                                        JJ
                        You got a band?

                                        SPYDER
                        Yeah.  Mostly we play in my garage. 
                        We're trying to get enough cash
                        to cut a demo tape.  Studio time

          Another awkward lull, then...

                                        SPYDER
                        Well, I guess I better go see if
                        anybody fell down.

          He walks away.  Johnny steps forward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Bracknell.  Remember me?

          Marty glances up at Johnny.

                                        MARTY
                        I'm old, not stupid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No sir, I didn't mean...

                                        MARTY
                          I certainly remember my daughter's
                          husband.

                                        JJ
                          Husband?  Johnny's not...

          Sarah stops him with a touch.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt is my husband, Daddy.  Johnny
                        was my boyfriend back when Mom
                        was...

          She stops herself, as Marty cuts her a look.  He looks at
          Johnny again, then...

                                        MARTY
                        You used to climb our oak tree.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smiles)
                        That's right.

          It seems like everything might settle down, then...

                                        MARTY
                        You kids ruined my back yard. 
                        Tore up the bushes and ruined the
                        grass.

          So much for happy memories.  Sarah tries to switch gears...

                                        SARAH
                          I brought JJ.  Say hi to your
                          grandfather.

          JJ freezes, as Johnny finally gives him a little push

          Marty suddenly stops and looks over at Johnny and Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        We're gonna take a little walk. 
                        You two take your time.

          Sarah hesitates, then walks away.  Johnny looks at Marty,
          all he sees is a stone wall, then he follows Sarah out.

                                        MARTY
                        Where was I?

          Johnny finds Sarah staring out a large window.

                                        SARAH
                                (covering her pain)
                        He looks good, doesn't he?  A
                        little pale, but that's to be
                          expected...

                                        SARAH
                        I don't want to talk about it. 
                                (beat)
                        I'm glad he's taking an interest
                        in his grandson.  A boy should
                        know his grandfather before it's
                        too late.

          A BEAT, then...

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Sarah Anne?

          Sarah and Johnny turn to see the very same little Old
          Woman Johnny saw in his bathroom vision.

                                        SARAH
                                (surprised to see her)
                        Mrs. Anderson?  Oh my God! 

          Sarah and the woman embrace.

                                        SARAH
                        It's been... twenty years.

                        Bumble Bee.  I forgot all about
                        that.

                                        BEBE
                                (to Johnny)

                        and stick her fingers in the honey

                        Did she?

                                        SARAH
                        I can't believe you remember that. 
                        And I had no idea you were here.

                                        BEBE
                        Marty didn't mention it to you?

                        We didn't get a chance to talk.

          Sarah realizes Johnny is standing behind her.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry.  Johnny, this is Mrs.
                          Anderson, a very dear friend of
                        my mother and father.

                        We've met... kind of.

                        Call me Bebe, everybody does.

          They shake hands, WHOOSH...

          Another QUICK FLASH from the previous vision.  The BUG
          CRAWLING OUT OF HER MOUTH.


  1515EXT. FOXGLOVE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny flashes out, even more disturbed by what he's seen.

                                        SARAH
                        Bebe s husband was in charge of
                        my father's old Army unit.  They

                        That's amazing.

                                        BEBE
                        Joe's been gone six years now. 
                        You don't know how it lifted my
                        spirits to see Marty again.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm happy Dad has a friend here.

                                        BEBE
                        Oh, you know your father--he's
                        such a people person.

          Sarah exchanges a look with Johnny, 'people person'?

                        God rest her soul.

          Sarah can't help but be touched and slightly bothered by
          the comment.

                                        BEBE
                        Well, I'm off for bingo.  Don't
                        be strangers.  Toodle-oo!

          She moves off.  Johnny isn't sure what to do...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah, that woman is...

                                        SARAH
                        A Godsend.  Maybe Dad and I won't
                        ever be close, but at least I
                        know he won't be completely alone.

          Johnny decides not to say anything until he knows more
          about the situation.


  1616INT. SHERIFF STATION - LATER

          Johnny is talking to Walt in his office.  Walt is busy

                        I'm sure.

                        dead.

                                        WALT
                        Let's face it, John, everybody
                        who goes to live at one of those
                        retirement places, ends up dying
                        there.  It's the ultimate one-way
                        trip.

                        Bebe Anderson didn't look like
                        she was checking out anytime soon.

                        guy named Donnie Palmer.  Big
                        strong kid, athlete, he drops
                        dead waiting for a bus.  No

                        into the asphalt.

                        That's a heartwarming story.

            Something else is troubling Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Has Sarah talked to you about her
                        father?  Why they don't get along?

                        She's always kept that part of
                        her life private.  I get the
                        feeling she and her dad were never
                        close.  Her mom was the buffer,
                        and when she died the relationship
                        just got worse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's strange, because when we
                        were kids, Sarah and her dad were
                        very close.  I remember wishing
                        my father and I could be more
                        like them.

                        When her mom died, Sarah and I
                        had broken up for a few months. 
                        She was 'finding' herself.

  1717INT. FOXGLOVE   CARD ROOM - AFTERNOON (DAY 2)

          Marty is playing cards with some other RESIDENTS, including
          Bebe.  Johnny and Sarah stand in the doorway.  Johnny
          holds a picnic basket.

                        Dad, I made a picnic lunch.  I
                        thought we could eat out on the
                        lawn.  It's such a nice day.

                        That sounds lovely.  Go have lunch
                        with your daughter, Marty.

          Marty doesn't look up from his cards.

                        I'm down a dollar and a half.

          Sarah is crestfallen, as Bebe notices her reaction.

                        I don't want your money.  I just
                        want to be left alone.  Why is
                        that so hard for everyone to
                          understand?

          He gets up and walks away.

                                        BEBE
                        I'm sure he didn't...

          Sarah turns and rushes away in the other direction.

                                        BEBE
                        Sarah?

          Johnny considers Bebe, then goes after Sarah.

          Johnny looks for Sarah, when he runs into Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Just the man I've been looking
                        for.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you seen Sarah?

                                        BRUCE
                        No.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny starts away, as Bruce grabs him by the arm.

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa, hold on!  You can't leave
                        yet.

                        What are you talking about?

                                        BRUCE
                        It's Live Entertainment Tuesday,
                        and the Great Boudini's van broke

                        I pick up a few bucks booking
                        talent for the residents.  Every
                        Tuesday there's a live performance. 
                        Today it was going to be a

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's this got to do with me?

          Off the moment, we...

                                                                                CUT TO:


  1919INT. FOXGLOVE - CARD ROOM - LATER

          All the residents, including Marty, Bebe and Mr. Colbert
          are gathered on chairs in front of the makeshift stage. 
          Mary Jane stands at the back.

                                        BRUCE
                                (holding a microphone)
                          Jonathan the Mysterious will now
                        choose an object from the box and
                        astound you with his supernatural
                        powers.

          Johnny shoots Bruce a glare, then sticks his hand in a
          box and pulls out a small silver locket.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's now searching the darkest
                        corners of his mind. 

          Johnny puts his hand over the mic and leans in close.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        If you don't stop that, Jonathan
                        the Mysterious is leaving.

          Johnny hesitates, but Bruce can't help himself.

                          Jonathan the Mysterious needs
                          complete silence.
                                (beat, Johnny starts
                                to speak)
                        Total stillness.

                          Absolute quiet.

          Johnny rolls his eyes, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is there a Mrs. Pforzheimer? 
                        Iris Pforzheimer?

                                        MRS. PFORZHEIMER
                        Yes!  That's me!

          Johnny concentrates, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This locket was given to you by
                        your mother on your fourteenth
                          birthday.

          An elderly woman gasps...

                                        MRS. PFORZHEIMER
                        That's right!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (without looking)
                        There's an inscription on the
                          inside... To my darling Iris,

                        Thank you!  Thank you!

          Even Bruce is impressed by the moment, as Johnny reaches
          into the box again.  He pulls out a captain's sailing
          cap, then looks around and steps up to a large man, MR.
          JOHNSON.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I am.

                        You used to have a sailboat called
                        the "True Love."

                                        MR. JOHNSON
                        That's right.

                        It burned.  A mysterious fire
                        while it was docked.

          Mr. Johnson is clearly uncomfortable with the direction
          this is heading.

                                        MR. JOHNSON
                        There's no need to go into all
                        that--

                                (cutting him off)
                        There was an insurance claim.  An
                        arson investigation.  There were
                          questions concerning...

          Mr. Johnson suddenly snatches the cap from Johnny's hand
          and quickly rises...

                                        MR. JOHNSON
                        That's enough!

                        I, uh, forgot to take my
                          medication!

          He quickly exits the room.  Johnny shoots Bruce a look
          like "Anymore pal?".

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, it looks like that's all
                        the time we have!

                        What about the Shadow Man?

          Johnny turns as the residents begin to get anxious.

                                        ANOTHER OLD LADY
                        Yes, what about that?  I'm afraid
                        to leave my room at night!

                                        THIRD OLD LADY
                        Is it my time soon?

          They start to crowd Johnny, ad libbing "Tell us."  Mary
          Jane quickly steps in.

                                        MARY JANE
                          Alright, that's enough.  Let's
                        thank our guest.

          Everyone applauds, as Johnny turns and finds Bebe standing
          in front of him.  She's holding a gold bracelet.

                                        BEBE
                        I was wondering if you might touch
                        this?

          Before he can react, she puts the bracelet in his hand,
          WHOOSH--


  2020EXT. FIELD - DAY

          Bebe is once again dead in the field.  Stylize rapid fire
          shots that are CLOSE ON different angles: face, foot,
          eye.  A bug comes out of her mouth, very horror
              movie/nightmare-looking.


  2121RESUME - CARD ROOM

          Johnny comes out of vision to see the live Bebe staring
          at him expectantly, a smile on her face.  Johnny shakes
          his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry. 

                                        BEBE
                        It was a gift from my husband.  I
                        was hoping you could tell me that
                        he's alright.  Even happy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sure, wherever he is, he's
                        both if he's thinking about you.

          She smiles and walks away, as Bruce steps up to him.

                        She can't go on any solo walks.

          FADE IN:


  2323INT. FOXGLOVE - EARLY MORNING

          Johnny and Sarah rush up as Bebe's body, covered by a
          sheet, is being wheeled out of her room on a gurney. 
          Mary Jane speaks with DR. MARTIN.

                                        MARY JANE
                        I've tried to contact her family.

                                (she sees Sarah)
                        Excuse me, Doctor.

          She approaches...

                        Oh, Sarah, I'm glad you came. 
                        Your father is very upset.  He's

          She hurries away, as Johnny hesitates, then steps up to
          the doctor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doctor, I recently met Mrs.
                          Anderson.  I was wondering if you
                        could tell me how she died?

                                        DOCTOR
                        Well, I can't be sure until we do
                        an autopsy.  If you want my
                          professional opinion, it was sudden
                        cardiac arrest.  She passed in
                        her sleep.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          As Johnny takes this in he turns to see Mr. Colbert
          standing across the hallway.

                                        MR. COLBERT
                        It was the Shadow Man.  He took
                        her just like he's gonna take the
                        rest of us.

          There's something dark and disturbingly obvious about his
          tone.

                                        BRUCE V.O.

                        When I told you not to let her
                        out alone, it must have changed
                        the future.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's what I'm saying, I spoke
                        to the night duty nurse and she
                        said Mrs. Anderson never tried to
                        go outside.  She said she ate
                        dinner and went straight to bed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That doesn't make sense. 

          They both ponder this.  It's a chilly moment.

                          nonsense?

                          Normally, no.  But since I met
                        you, I try to keep an open mind
                        about things.

          Good point.


  2525EST. SHOT - FUNERAL HOME - NEXT DAY (DAY 4)

          The funeral home is on the grounds of the lovely old New
          England cemetery.  Gnarled old trees, crooked old
          headstones from the 1700s.  Again, classic Stephen King
          feel.  Cars are pulling up for Bebe's memorial.


  2626INT. FUNERAL HOME

            Post-service, black-garbed MOURNERS stand in little groups,
            including Marty, Mr. Colbert, Johnny, Sarah, Bruce.  A
          closed distinctive PINK COFFIN sits at the front of the
          room, a PHOTO of Bebe next to it.

                          Something doesn't add up. 

          Bruce notices that Mary Jane is deep in conversation with
          a man in a dark suit, MR. WARREN.

          CROSSING SHOT

          Spyder crosses as Sarah passes him to where Marty is
          sitting alone, his cap in his hands.

                        Margie?

          He turns to see Sarah, his momentary lapse of memory
          corrected.

                                        SARAH

                        I was thinking, before we go,

                        Hey.

          She just keeps walking.  Marty turns to look as he and
          Johnny connect for a moment, eye-to-eye.  For a instant,
          there's a look of humanity and compassion in the old man's
          eyes.  Something he won't or can't offer his daughter.


  2727EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

          Sarah is walking briskly through the cemetery.  Johnny
          catches up to her, keeps walking with her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah.  Please, stop. 

          Sarah stops, and looks around at the headstones surrounding
          them.

                        My friends are dead.  Nearly
                          everybody I've ever known or cared
                        about is dead.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're wrong about that.  There's
                          somebody who cares a great deal
                        about you.  You're just too full
                        of anger to see her.

  3030EXT. FIELD - DAY - VISION

          Again, Bebe is dead in the woods.  Then Vision Johnny
          turns and sees, a few paces away, an ARM sticking up out
          of a stream.  He walks over, looks down at AN AFRICAN
          AMERICAN MAN lying face up but underwater in the stream,
          eyes open.  He leans in closer, sees something truly
            chilling: the number 342 written in magic marker on the
          man's neck.  He looks back at Bebe, and notices "343"
          scrawled on the bottom of her foot.

          Out of the vision, Johnny is staring at Marty.

                                        MARTY
                        You might be able to see things
                        other people can't.  But there's
                        a lot about life even you don't
                        know.

          Marty walks out, as Johnny considers the comment...


  3232INT. SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Bruce walk into the room.

                                        BRUCE
                        And they both had numbers written
                        on them?

                                        BRUCE
                        That just doesn't make any sense.

          Johnny stops as his eyes fall on something across the
          way.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny?

          Johnny steps past him to the far wall.  Bruce FOLLOWS.

          One particular picture catches Johnny's attention.  It's
          the African-American man from his previous vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who is that guy?

                                        BRUCE
                        Uh, that's Mr. Nichols.  He passed
                        away about a month ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He used to have the same room
                        Bebe was in, didn't he?

                                        BRUCE
                        Now that you mention it, I think
                        he did.  John, what's going on?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I'd like to know.


  3333INT. BEBE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Bruce walk back in to the empty room.

                        What are we looking for?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.

          Johnny notices some of Bebe's personal items in a box. 
          He picks up several items and then a small framed photo
          of a much younger MARTY, HIS WIFE, BEBE AND HER HUSBAND.

          Johnny's on the phone to Walt, trying to keep his voice
          down.

          Sarah, home-cooked goodies in tow, looks in to see Marty,
          sitting alone, staring out the window, lost in his own
            thoughts.

                        up on our offer, you could have
                          home-cooked meals every night.

                        We've been over this.

          Sarah, stung, tries to let it roll off.

                        Navy bean.  Mom's recipe.

          The mention of her mother cuts through him like a knife.

                        You have to keep up your strength.

                        I don't have to do anything.

          Sarah sees something in his hand, reacts, recognizing it.

                          I didn't know you kept it.

          She reaches out her hand, he jerks away.

                        Let me be.

          Wanting to help him, not knowing how, she looks at her
          father, fighting back tears.

                        I can't do this... not now.

          He heads out of the room.  Hold on Sarah for a beat, gut-
          punched, mind racing.  She sits down on the edge of the
          bed.  BEAT.  Then we see Johnny pass the door, then
          reappear and enter the room.

                        I was late.  I should have been
                        there, and I wasn't.

                        It wouldn't have mattered.

          He searches for a way to tell her, then--

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly)
                        She didn't suffer.

          Sarah looks at him, realizing...

                                        SARAH
                        You saw my mother die?

          Johnny eyes never leaving Sarah's, as she begins to tear
          up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She heard your voice on the
                          answering machine--you told her
                        you were in the library studying. 
                        She smiled when you said that. 

          On Sarah, so needing to hear this.

                                        SARAH
                                (smiling through her
                                  tears)
                        She did?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then you told her that you loved
                        her.  She picked up a picture of
                        you and held it.
                                (beat)
                        Sarah, your voice was the last
                        thing she heard.  It was your
                        words, "I love you," that she
                        held inside her heart when she
                        passed.  What more could a person
                        want?

          Sarah stares at him, then starts to crumble.  He pulls
          her into a hug, her shoulders trembling from the release. 
          She sits up, looks Johnny in the eye.

                                        SARAH
                          I blamed myself all these years. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  It's time to let it go.

          She wipes her eyes.

                                        SARAH
                        If only I could get him to
                          understand.

                                (into phone)
                        I don't think that will be
                        necessary, Sheriff.  Thank you.
                                (hangs up, turning to
                                  Johnny and Bruce)
                        I'm not going to have you two
                          arrested.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One last request, may I see Mrs.
                        Anderson's ashes?

                                        MR.  WARREN
                        If it'll help satisfy your morbid
                        curiosity.

          As he turns to a shelf with a box on it,

                                        SPYDER
                        Mr. Warren, if you don't need
                        me... 

                                        MR.  WARREN
                        Of course.  Make sure the casket
                        room is locked.

                                        SPYDER
                        Yes sir.

                                        MR.  WARREN
                                (setting down the box)
                        May I present Mrs. Bebe Anderson.

          Johnny reaches out and picks up the box -- WHOOSH


  5555EXT. FIELD - DAY - VISION

          SHAKY CAMERA POV of somebody running, then extra super
          close up of A TENNIS BALL.  Suddenly we hear PANTING. 
          It's someone playing catch with a DOG?


  5656RESUME INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

          Out of vision, Johnny seems a little thrown as he looks
          at Bruce and Mr. Warren.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

                        Let's go.

                        What did you see?

          Johnny grabs him by the sleeve...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Later.

          He drags Bruce out of the room.


  5757EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - LATER

          Bruce's car sits parked in the far parking lot.


  5858INT. BRUCE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce and Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        I still don't get it.  Why would
                        someone replace Bebe's ashes with
                          a dog's?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good question.  This is the only
                        place between here and Bangor
                        that has an animal crematorium.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's the connection between
                          Foxglove, the funeral home, and
                        the animal shelter?

          Johnny suddenly spots something in the distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think he just walked out the
                        back door.

          Bruce looks off, as...

                          Apparently, it takes three minimum-
                        wage jobs to make a living in
                        this town.

    58CONTINUED:58

          They watch as ANOTHER STEP VAN drives into the darkened
          lot and parks end-to-end with Spyder's van.  A YOUNG MAN
          gets out and greets Spyder with a hand shake. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Who the hell is that guy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Beats me.

          They watch as some paperwork and cash exchanges hands,
          and then each man opens the back of their respective vans
          and what appears to be a COVERED BODY is slid out of
          Spyder's van into the back of the step van.  Another
            handshake and each man climbs back in his truck and drives
          away.

                                        BRUCE
                        That wasn't what I think it was...
                        was it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  Follow him.

                        The other guy.

          As the step van drives off, Bruce discreetly tails him,

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  5959EXT. WINDING COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          Around twists and turns in the curvy road, Bruce's car
          trails the step van until it disappears behind tall,
          ominous gates that clang shut before Bruce and Johnny can
          follow.


  6060EXT. GATED AREA - SAME

          Bruce and Johnny get out of the car, look for signage. 
          There is none.  Just dense woods, a chain link fence and
          razor wire on top.

                                        BRUCE
                        What now?

  6161EXT. WOODS - FEW MINUTES LATER

          Bruce and Johnny drop into frame, having scaled the tall
          fence from the other side.  Finding themselves in a wooded
          area.  It s very creepy as they break out flashlights.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is this place?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have no idea.  Let's go.

            Reluctantly, Bruce follows Johnny into the dark woods.

                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE TO:


  6262EXT. DEEPER INTO THE SAME WOODED AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

          Johnny is just ahead of Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        We've been walking for ten minutes
                        and it's nothing but trees and
                        bushes.

                                        JOHNNY
                          A little further.

                                        BRUCE
                                (sniffs)
                        What is that smell?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That can't be good.

          Bruce takes several steps forward and stumbles over
            something and hits the ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You alright?

                          I ripped my pants.  What the hell
                        did I trip over?

          When Bruce shines his flashlight around behind him, they
          both see what he tripped over:

          IN THE LIGHT

          A FOOT attached to a hairy leg sticking out from behind a
          tree, THE NUMBER 839 written across the ankle.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  6363EXT. WOODS  -  CONTINUOUS

          Utterly freaked-out, Johnny and Bruce hear DOGS in the
            distance, start to run.  As they do, they start to stumble
          over and see other bodies, arranged in horrible ways:

          A BODY SITTING PROPPED AGAINST A TREE

          A CORPSE LIES UNDER ROCKS

          The African American Man's corpse is in a stream (as it
          was in the vision)

          Bruce stumbles again and lands with his flashlight a few
          inches from a WOMAN'S SLIGHTLY DISTORTED FACE.

                                        BRUCE
                        This must be Hell.

          WE hear JJ's voice:

                                        JJ V.O.
                        It's a soul snatcher!


  6464INT. MARTY'S ROOM - SAME

          Marty and JJ.

                        Your mother said that?

                        Kinda.

          Marty considers things.  He knows there's no monster, but*
          things just aren't right.  Starting with Bebe's sudden*
          death, the behavior of the other residents and his*
          grandson's obvious fear and apprehension.*

                                        MARTY
                        I might be crazy, but I know when
                        somebody's yankin' my chain. 
                        There's no such thing as a demon
                        that snatches peoples' souls. 
                        Not in this world anyway.  Maybe
                        we should...

            Suddenly, they hear FOOTSTEPS in the hall outside, then
          an ominous SHADOW passes under the door and STOPS.*

    64CONTINUED:64

          JJ steps quickly behind his grandpa as they both watch as*
          someone or something jiggles the door handle, then MOVES*
          ON.  Marty looks back at JJ who's frozen with fear.*

                                        MARTY
                        That's about enough of this*
                          nonsense. *
                                (to JJ)*
                        You stay here.*

          Marty crosses to the door and quietly OPENS it.  He looks*
          back at the kid.*

                                  (whispers)*
                        Lock this door behind me.  And*
                        don't open it to anyone but me--
                          understand?

          JJ nods.  Marty's about to go, when he has another thought. 
          He looks around, then reaches up and grabs an iron bookend*
          off a shelf.  He checks its weight to use as a weapon,*
          then he steps over to JJ and hands it to the kid.*

                                        MARTY
                        Just in case I'm wrong.

          Marty pats him on the top of the head and EXITS the room. 
          JJ quickly locks the door behind him and considers the
          bookend in his hand (he should mimic whatever we just saw*
          Marty do with it) -- hoping to God that he won't need to*
          use it.


  6565INT. FOXGLOVE HALLWAY  - CONTINUOUS

          Marty heads off on the trail of the receding footsteps,
          just catching a glimpse of a DARK FIGURE disappearing
          around the corner...

                                (to himself)
                        What the hell...?

          He picks up the pace as he FOLLOWS around the corner...*


  6666INT. FOXGLOVE - BASEMENT - MINUTES LATER

          Marty comes around a corner and sees a light on beyond a
          door marked "TRASH ROOM."

          He peers around the doorjamb and sees Mary Jane slip off*
          a dark, hooded robe, bundle it and shove it into the back*
          of an upper shelf.*

          Marty steps out to confront her.

                                        MARTY
                        It's you.*

          Johnny and Bruce are locked in a creepy, empty, windowless

          worst, then he sees...

          Walt notices Johnny across the room.

                        It's called a body farm.

                        they use dead bodies for scientific

                        one did.  These people all died
                        of natural causes.  Spyder was
                          supposed to cremate or bury the

                        get out of bed in the middle of
                        the night.  Do you know how many

                                        SARAH
                        Daddy, you don't have to...

                                        MARTY
                        Yes, I do.
                                (beat, trying not to
                                  break)
                        No matter what it was, Margie was
                        always there to protect me.  To
                        love me.  Then, when she needed
                        me the most... 

          Sarah looks at him, it's only in this moment that she
          realizes they've both been blaming themselves for the
          same thing all these years.

                                        SARAH
                          I know...

                                        MARTY
                                (emotional beat,
                                  regrouping)
                        It was easier to push you away
                        than admit my failures.  As a
                        man, and a husband... and a father.
                                (beat)
                          I should have been there for her. 
                        And I should have been there for
                        you.  I'm sorry for that.  I hope
                        you can forgive me.

          The tears well up in both their eyes, as...

                                        SARAH
                        Oh daddy.

          Sarah falls into his arms, as they both begin to cry.

                                        MARTY
                        I miss her so much.

                                        SARAH
                        Me, too.  Me, too.

          They hold each other as the SHOT PULLS HIGH AND WIDE.

                                                                  TIME DISSOLVE TO:

          Walt and Johnny come up as Marty is being loaded into the
          ambulance.  JJ is there too.

                                        WALT
                        JJ?  What are you doing here?

          He sees Sarah, as she holds Marty's hand while PARAMEDICS
          load him into the ambulance.

                        Sarah?

          She steps away for a second.

                                        WALT
                        Is your dad okay?

                        He hurt his leg.  They're taking
                        him to the hospital.  I'm going
                        to ride with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?

          Sarah glances over at JJ.

                                        SARAH
                        Why don't you ask your son?

          Johnny and Walt both look at JJ as Sarah climbs into the
          back of the ambulance.  They close the doors and drive
          away, leaving JJ to answer a lot of questions.  Off his

  7979EXT. FOXGLOVE GROUNDS - DAY - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER

          CAMERA FOLLOWS Sarah as she strolls over to where Johnny,
          JJ, Walt and Marty (his leg in a cast) are having a picnic
          on the lawn under the big trees, foxglove blowing in the
          breeze.

                                        SARAH
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't make it a habit.

          She and Johnny exchange a smile.

                                        WALT
                        I was just telling these guys
                        that they picked up Spyder in
                        Boston.  He was trying to pawn
                        his drum set for a bus ticket to
                        Mexico.

                                        MARTY
                        He wasn't a bad kid.  Not very
                        bright, but not bad either.

          He locks eyes with Sarah, maybe for the first time ever.

                                        MARTY
                        People make a lot of bad choices
                        when they're confused.  You just
                        hope that the people who love you
                        will still be there when you
                        finally figure things out.

          Sarah smiles back at him.

                                        WALT
                        If Johnny hadn't busted up Spyder's
                        little operation, you would've
                        ended up at the body farm, too.

                                        MARTY
                        I'm still gonna end up there.

          They all stare at him.

                                        SARAH
                        What are you talking about?

                                        MARTY
                        Signed myself up as a body donor. 
                        Place makes a lotta sense. 
                          Besides, a man wants to be useful
                        when his time on Earth is over.

          Dead silence as they all digest this.

                                        MARTY
                        Once the spirit leaves the body,
                        what's it really matter?  Mummified
                        or eaten by wolves, in the end,
                        who really cares?

          A long BEAT, then...

                                        JOHNNY

                        Cool!

          Marty gets a kick out of this, as he grabs JJ around the
          neck...

                                        MARTY
                        I'm starving, who wants to eat?

          As Sarah shakes her head and starts passing out food, and
          they all enjoy this new day in sun.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          basket where Johnny, Bruce, JJ, Walt and Marty (his leg
          in a cast) are preparing to have a blanket picnic on the
          lawn under the big trees, foxglove blowing in the breeze.

                                        SARAH
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope this isn't going to be a
                        habit?

          She and Johnny exchange a smile.  Sarah gives Walt a kiss
          on the cheek.

                        of you, but I'm starving.  Let's
