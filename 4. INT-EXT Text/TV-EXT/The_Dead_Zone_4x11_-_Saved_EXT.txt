          It's a sprawling, posh, but understated resort--more the
          kind of place Bush Sr. would be found than P. Diddy. 
          Bruce and Johnny get out of the car.

                        Wow.  I can almost smell the money.

          Johnny hands the keys to the VALET.

          Bruce goes through the revolving door, Johnny follows
          him, but when he puts his hands on it -- WHOOSH!

  55RESUME - JOHNNY

          Is spit out of the revolving door, shaken by the weirdness
          of this intense FLASH VISION.  He stares at the empty
          door as it swings around again, convincing himself that
          it's indeed empty.

                                        BRUCE

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          Greg Stillson and his new girlfriend, MIRANDA ELLIS, are
          on her family s vintage sailboat.  Greg moves up behind
          her and kisses her on the neck, a cocktail in his hand.

                                        MIRANDA
                        We're getting close.

                                        STILLSON
                        Where are we going anyway?

                                        MIRANDA
                        Just out past the reef.  There's
                        a great picnic spot on the outer
                        island. 

                                        STILLSON
                        As long as we get back in time
                        for the party.

                                        MIRANDA
                          Reverend Purdy's shakedown.

                                        STILLSON
                        I know, but it's important.  Your
                        father will be there.  Although,
                        I'm still not sure if he likes
                        me.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Are you kidding?  You're the first
                        guy I've dated that he's approved
                        of since... I can't remember.

          The boat crests and dips on some waves, as Stillson seems
          a bit unsteady.

                                        STILLSON
                        Whoa.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Feeling dizzy again?

                                        STILLSON
                        I guess I'm not much of a sailor. 
                          I better grab another Dramamine.

          He plants another kiss on her and moves to the open
            hatchway.  He TURNS...

                                        STILLSON
                        Have I told you how much I love
                        you?

          Miranda smiles, as Stillson climbs below deck.  It's only
          as he's gone that we see another look come across her
          face... it's not love.



          Bruce and Johnny walk the dock.  There are some very nice
          boats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Ellis boat is called the
                        Seamore 9.  It's docked in slip
                        F8.

                                        BRUCE
                        I bet these boats cost more than
                        my apartment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bigger too.

          Johnny and Bruce find slip F8.  It's empty.

                                        BRUCE
                        You think Stillson and Miranda
                        took a little day cruise?

          Johnny touches the piling.  WHOOSH--



          In the open ocean, Greg Stillson scrambles around the
          deck of a sailboat, screaming  Miranda!   Frantically
          looking out into the waves.  There s obviously been an
            accident.



          Out of the vision...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - ONE - 3/30/05 - GREEN            10.

                        She's gone overboard.

                                        BRUCE
                          Miranda?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call Walt.  Have him contact the
                        Coast Guard.  Tell him it's an
                        emergency.

          He looks out towards the open ocean.



          In dramatic contrast, Miranda and Greg are on the boat,
          looking picture perfect.  They are out of sight of the
          shoreline, carving through the waves, sails full.  She
          steers with her foot while she reaches for some dip.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You feeling alright?

          Greg is the color of guacamole.  He shakes his head.

                                        STILLSON
                        It's the movement.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Maybe you should lie down.

                                        STILLSON
                        Maybe you're right.  Of all the
                        incredibly beautiful, intelligent
                        women, I had to fall for a sailor.

          He forces a smile and vanishes below deck.  When he's
          gone, we see something shift in her eyes, something we
          don't quite understand.

                        John.  It wasn't easy to convince
                        these guys to start an all out
                        search on the word of a psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know what I saw.  Miranda was
                        gone and Stillson was calling her
                        name.  He seemed... terrified.

                                        BRUCE
                        I never liked the ocean.  Too
                        many things down there that can
                        eat ya.

          The Officer calls out to them from his radio station
          inside.

                          Sheriff, we just got a radio report
                        from the far side of the island. 
                        They found the Seamore.

          Off Johnny's look at Walt...



          Bruce, Walt, Johnny, and the Coast Guard Captain return
          from the Coast Guard station.  They round a corner into a
          spontaneous press conference with senior SENATOR HARLAN
          ELLIS.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        I have a brief statement.  I'd
                        like to thank everyone involved
                        in the rescue operation.  I
                          emphasize 'rescue'.  Miranda is a
                        strong willed young woman.  If
                        anyone can come through this, she
                        can.

          Ellis seems put off by the timing of such a personal
            question.

                                        SEN. ELLIS

          it.

                          I figured the boat would be sealed
                        off as a possible crime scene.

                                        STILLSON
                        There was no crime, haven't you
                        been listening?  Now let's do
                        this before anybody sees us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's reputation you trying to
                          protect?  Yours or mine?

          Stillson steps onboard, Johnny hangs back for a beat and
          studies the boat.  Then he reaches for the rail to steady
          himself as he steps aboard and--



          Miranda laughs as she jumps onboard.

                                        STILLSON
                          Remember what you promised me?

                                        MIRANDA
                        No matter what happens, I'll never
                        tell. 

          She and Stillson hold a look, she means about his father,
          but covers with a smile, deflects.

                                        MIRANDA
                        So you're afraid of the water,
                          sweetie, so what.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'd only do it for you. 
                                (he pulls her close)
                        I'd do anything for you.           DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - TWO - 3/30/05 - GREEN           20A.



          Out of vision, Johnny looks around.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How long have you been afraid of
                        the water?

          Stillson looks back and realizes what's happening.

                                        STILLSON
                        You really are creepy, you know.

          Johnny moves across the boat, touches the hatch,



          Stillson weaves a little, drink in hand, as he goes below.



          Johnny confronts Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How many drinks did you have?

                                        STILLSON
                        You tell me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't going to work unless
                        you're honest with me.  Which I'm
                        sure goes against your better
                        nature.

                                        STILLSON
                        I came to you, remember?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hard)
                          I remember.  I remember everything. 
                        Now you tell me what really
                          happened out there or I walk!

          Johnny instinctively grabs Stillson by the arm...



          Flashing out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You fought with her.  It got rough.

          Greg backs away from Johnny.

                                        STILLSON
                        No.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I suppose you only had one
                        drink.

                                        STILLSON
                        I felt sick.  I went below deck
                        to lie down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How long were you down there?

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't know, twenty, thirty
                          minutes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thirty minutes?  The boat could'a
                        drifted 10 miles in that time. 
                        Did you tell the Coast Guard?

          Stillson's silence speaks volumes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong with you?

                                        STILLSON
                          I didn't do anything wrong.  So
                        save that holier than thou crap
                        for someone who gives a damn.

          Stillson walks away...



          Johnny's car heads down the driveway, away from the hotel. 
          PAN OVER to see A BIG MAN IN DARK GLASSES watching it
          leave.          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - TWO - 3/30/05 - GREEN            27.



            Sprawling shingle-style Old Maine mansion.  Understated. 
          Johnny and Greg are heading for the front door.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't know if this is such a
                        good idea. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why?  Because he'll think you're
                        crazy running around with a
                          psychic?

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm not sure how I'm going to
                        work it into the conversation.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're a politician, make something
                        up.



          Greg and Johnny walk out.

                                        STILLSON
                        Not puttin' on much of a show.

                        Say what?

          Johnny stops and turns.

                        It's just something I know.  I'm
                        sorry.

          Johnny starts away, as Stillson grabs him.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're lying!  She can't be dead!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told you I'm sorry.  Now let go
                        of me.

          Stillson holds him for a BEAT, then slowly releases his
          grip.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I suggest you let the search play
                        out and then make the appropriate
                          announcement.  Otherwise, you're
                        going to have to explain to the
                        world how you recruited a psychic. 
                        I'm not sure how that might play
                        in the heartland. 

          Johnny walks away, as we hold on Stillson's look of
            emotional torment,



          Johnny walks into the station.  He checks his watch...
          5:13 PM.  He picks up a bus schedule, WHOOSH ...



          Johnny finds... Miranda, headed for that line of people. 
          Her hair is tucked under a baseball hat, she's wearing
          sunglasses, just as in his vision.  He looks back across
          the station and SEES...

          He grabs her by the wrist and yanks her away, as he's

          She's stopped cold.  Looks at him, senses he's telling
          the truth.  Johnny catches a glimpse of one of the guys
          talking on a HAND-HELD RADIO.

                                        JOHNNY

          He pulls her through the side door.



          He leads her to where his car is parked.  Johnny opens

                        and what's going on?!

          Out of nowhere a BLACK SEDAN screeches around the corner,
          heading straight for them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I will, I promise.  But right now
                        we need to go!

          She hesitates, then seeing something genuine in Johnny's
          eyes, she jumps into the car.



          Johnny cuts in front of a truck, roars through a red light,
          and he loses the sedan.          DEAD ZONE: "SAVED" - THREE - 3/30/05 - GREEN          34.


  6060THIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS AN EXCITING CHASE SEQUENCE.



          Johnny's parked in an industrial area, where they can
          disappear.  Miranda's taking some deep breaths, trying to
          calm herself down as they walk a bit.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I just needed some air.

                        What was the plan?  Take on a new

                        It wasn't really a plan.  Just a
                        way to buy enough time to figure
                        things out.  A temporary fix.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He liked me enough to ask me to
                        look for you.

          She looks at him, fear in her eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Relax, you've probably figured
                        out we're not exactly friends.

                                        MIRANDA
                        How well do you know him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well enough to understand why a
                          beautiful young woman would give
                        up everything to get away from
                        him.

                                        MIRANDA
                        It didn't start out this way.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were in love with him?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I think I was in love with the
                        idea of being in love.  But in
                        the end, it's a perfect stranger
                        that rides to my rescue.

          She looks at Johnny, the gratitude and relief in her eyes. 
          There's even a hint of attraction. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        Thank you.

          As she reaches over and gently touches his hand... WHOOSH



          Johnny looks at Miranda, tries to shake off the shock of
          what he now knows.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Stillson killed his father?

          Miranda can't understand how he could know...

                                        MIRANDA
                        How could you...?

          They lock eyes for a beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That must be why they're after
                        you.  They must realize what you
                        know about James Stillson's death.

                                        MIRANDA
                        They?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stillson's people.  All we need
                        is some proof that he actually
                          committed the murder.  First we
                        have to switch cars and find
                          someplace you can hide.

          As they get back into the car...



          Johnny and Miranda walk towards their car.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Consumed in flames.  How's that
                        for biblical?  It's like they
                        knew I'd end up here.  Like
                        somebody's pulling my strings.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I hope we find them before they
                        find us.

          The BIG MAN steps out. Johnny instantly realizes what's
          going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                          MIRANDA, RUN!

          The Big Man whips out a TASER GUN and jams in hard into
          his chest.  Johnny receives a powerful burst of electricity
          and drops to his knees.  Meanwhile, ANOTHER MAN has grabbed
          Miranda and throws her into a dark sedan.  As the Big Man
          makes his escape, Johnny reaches out and GRABS the guy's
          shoe and pulls it off.  ON JOHNNY watching in pain as
          Miranda disappears.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          The familiar vision of Armageddon comes blasting back.



          It's dark, as Johnny finds himself face-to-face with the
          man whom he knows instantly is behind all of this.  Malcolm
          Janus is holding the Bible, speaking directly to Johnny
          in a weird "visiongram."  Although he speaks to him, they
          don't really make direct eye contact...

                                        JANUS
                        We finally meet, Mr. Smith. 
                        Forgive this unorthodox method of
                          communication, but I needed your
                          complete, undivided attention. 

          As they BOTH hold the same Bible and OPEN it to a book
          marked passage...

                                        JANUS
                        I've marked a passage for your
                          perusal.  From the Book of Daniel. 
                        I think you'll find it's quite...
                          enlightening.  If you'd allow me
                        to begin...
                                (reciting from memory)
                        "And I have heard of thee, that
                        thou canst make interpretations,
                        and dissolve doubts: now if thou
                        canst read the writing...

          As Johnny continues on, reading from the text... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        "And make known to me the
                          interpretation thereof, thou shalt
                        be clothed with scarlet... 
                                (beat)
                        ...and a have a chain of gold
                        about thy neck...

          As Johnny shuts the Bible, he flashes out of this most
          unusual vision, we're CLOSE ON the simple gold cross on
          the cover --
