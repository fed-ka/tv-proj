      Open on a montage of deserted streets, streaked with early
      morning sun, in an upscale Capital Hill neighborhood of well-
      maintained Federal and late Victorian row houses.  We see a
      newspaper deliveryman pitching plastic-wrapped copies of the
      Washington Post onto stoops.  Over the montage, we hear NPR's
      Morning Edition (taped from an actual show as close to air
      date as possible)pop on mid-sentence. The hosts are discussing
      the upcoming presidential election.

2INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING2

      Cut to an old Zenith clock radio on a bedside table.  Nearby
      are multiple prescription pill bottles, a half-empty Wild
      Turkey bottle, a couple of Tom Clancey paperbacks and a pair
      of wire-rimmed reading glasses.  The voices of the NPR hosts
      have now been joined by a rumble of steady, contented snoring. 

      We pull back to reveal a man buried under his bedcovers,
      only a patch of his shiny dome visible in the pillows.  We
      start traveling across the room, passing a walnut valet stand
      draped with a navy blue pin-striped suit.  A tiny American
      flag pin winks from the lapel.  In passing the accessory
      tray, we catch a glimpse of a heavy gold watch, Blackberry,
      wallet, a plastic box of Tic-Tacs, Chapstick, a cocktail
      napkin scrawled with an address, a swizzle stick and a few
      campaign buttons.

      As we approach the window, we hear two cars pull up outside,
      followed by the opening and slamming of doors.  By the time
      we peer outside, the sidewalk below has filled with a half
      dozen grim-faced men in suits and several others in dark
      blue slickers with the legend "FBI" emblazoned in yellow on
      the back.  Two of the men briskly mount the steps of the
      stoop.  A sharp rap is heard on the door downstairs.

      The man in the bed does not stir.  We hear the door being
      answered, some muffled conversation, and then someone quickly
      shuffling up the stairs.  The bedroom door swings open to
      reveal a large, 50ish man with a ruddy face and a full head
      of unruly, silver hair.  He's wearing a ratty, plaid bathrobe
      and slippers.  This is GIL JOHN BIGGS, Republican senator
      from the State of North Carolina.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Hey, Vern.

      No response.

                                    GIL JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Vernon!                                                                                        2.

      The figure in the bed stirs.  Senator VERNON SMITS, an
        unpleasant-looking man in his late 60's, lifts his head from
      the pillow and squints at GIL JOHN.

                                      VERNON
                    What?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Were you by any chance scheduled to
                    turn yourself in at the DOJ this
                    mornin'?

      VERNON shoots up in bed. 

                                      VERNON
                    Fuck!

      He fumbles for his glasses at the nightstand and looks out
      the window.  An FBI agent holding a shotgun stares up at him
        impassively.

                                      VERNON (CONT'D)
                      Goddammit!

      He races for the bathroom.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Okay, so that's just piss-poor staff
                    work.

      The sound of running water.  Then the clatter of an old
      electric toothbrush.

                                      VERNON
                          (mouth full)
                    Mother fucking son-of-a-bitch!

      We hear a screech of tires outside on the street.  GIL JOHN
      peers out the window as a TV news truck pulls up to the curb. 
      The crew spills out onto the street and starts running towards
      the house.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Take your time.  I'll make some coffee
                    for everyone. 

      He turns to leave.  Now we hear the hum of an electric shaver.

                                      VERNON
                    Fuck me!  Fuck me!  Fuck me!

      GIL JOHN looks back at the bathroom door, and then around
      the room, as if measuring it.                                                                                        3.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Gonna miss you, buddy.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

3INT. -- SENATE FLOOR, U.S. CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY3

      CREDITS roll over a rapid sequence of scenes depicting the
      four senators, GIL JOHN BIGGS, ANDY GUZMAN, ROBERT BETTENCOURT
      and LOUIS LAFFER, JR. first at work, then heading home. 

      -- ANDY, showboating on the Senate floor.

      -- GIL JOHN, sleeping through it.

      -- ROBERT, looking at watch, then standing up, stretching,
      picking up briefcase.  On his way out of the chamber, he
      loosens his tie and awkwardly tries to bump fists with the
      black doorkeeper.

      -- LOUIS, running with oversized briefcase to catch the light
      rail Capitol subway, door closing just before he can get on. 
      Through the window of the departing train, we see ROBERT,
      now in a jogging suit, oblivious to his stranded colleague.

      -- ANDY, in a limo, being driven through a Capitol Hill
      neighborhood, passing ROBERT jogging towards home.

      -- GIL JOHN, emerging from a cab in front of his house, as
      LOUIS, cleaning leaves from the gutter looks down from a
      ladder placed against the house.

      -- ANDY, jacket off, mixing a gin and tonic in the kitchen.

      -- GIL JOHN, now in sweats, grabbing a beer from the
      refrigerator.

      -- All FOUR of them converging on the living room, three of
      them plopping down into the couch a' la Simpsons in front of
      the TV.  Only LOUIS remains standing, picking up discarded
      garments and starting to fold them.  As ROBERT and ANDY look
      around the couch for the remote, GIL JOHN flips open an old
      pizza box and finds it, right where he'd left it.  He hits
      the power button, and we start to hear that day's political
      coverage from a newscast as close to air date as possible.

                                                                          FADE TO BLACK

4INT. LIVING ROOM, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING4

      The sound of the evening's news gives way to the next
      morning's news, now punctuated by a dog barking.                                                                                        4.

      We open on an unmade cot, then travel to the couch, which
      has been pulled out into a hide-a-bed, already neatly made
      up, then on into the kitchen.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

5INT. KITCHEN, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C.5

      A madly aggressive Coonhound, hurling himself at the back of
      the door.  A young dreadlocked gas meter inspector in
      coveralls peers apprehensively through the window.

      LOUIS LAFFER, JR. 45ish, balding, bespectacled Republican
      congressman from Nevada and owner of the building, arrives
      at the door to intervene.

                                      LOUIS
                    Buster!  Down!

      He ineffectually tries to wave the dog off, clearly trying
      to avoid touching him.  The dog bumps up against him, and
      LOUIS recoils.

                                      LOUIS (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, Gil John, will you control
                    your damn dog?

      At the kitchen table, GIL JOHN, lost in the sports section
      of the paper, calls out to his dog.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Buster.  Come here, boy.

      The dog continues to howl.  LOUIS shouts to their visitor
      over the din.

                                      LOUIS
                    Keeshawn!
                          (gesturing)
                    Go around the house!  The basement's
                    unlocked!

      The nervous meter man nods, and quickly disappears around
      the corner.  LOUIS rushes over to the sink, squirts himself
      with soap and frantically works it into his hands.

                                      LOUIS (CONT'D)
                    I swear to God, Gil John, that dog
                    is racist.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    How can he be racist?  He doesn't
                    bark at Robert.                                                                                        5.

      ROBERT BETTENCOURT, a dapper, 50ish, African-American senator
      from Pennsylvania, also Republican, dressed in white collared
      striped shirt with rep tie, gold cuff links and suspenders
      looks up from his newspaper and over at the dog.  Buster
      starts wagging his tail. 

                                    GIL JOHN (CONT'D)
                    'Course, could be the French cuffs
                    and cologne are throwing him.

                                      LOUIS
                      Now,that's racist.

      GIL JOHN finishes off his coffee, stands up, and reaches for
      his jacket.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Nah.  I got nothin' against blacks. 
                    Spent my whole life around 'em. 
                    It's the gays I hate.  Just kidding,
                    Louis.

      LOUIS looks around anxiously.

                                      LOUIS
                    Why me?  Why didn't you say that to
                    Robert?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Because Robert hates gays, too.  So
                    he wasn't offended.

      ROBERT ignores them both.

                                      LOUIS
                    I'm not offended either.  I'm a
                        nationally-prominent critic of gay
                      lifestyle, for crying out loud, okay?

      LOUIS sits down at the table, picks up a section of the paper
      and snaps it open indignantly.

                                    GIL JOHN
                          (shrugs)
                    Fine with me.
                          (to Robert)
                    You goin' to the caucus this morning? 
                    I got a car out front.

                                      ROBERT
                      Excellent.

      ROBERT gulps down his coffee and stands up.  He pulls on his
      suit jacket, shoots his cuffs, and as he smooths his lapels, 
      he suddenly remembers something.                                                                                        6.

      Reaching back over the newspaper, he grabs a porcelain sugar
      bowl.  He lifts off the top, revealing a cache of tiny
      cloisonn  American flag pins.

      As LOUIS fishes through the bowl and extracts a pin, we hear
      scuffling and a thump from downstairs, followed by the clatter
      of steel tools spilling onto the floor.  Over in his corner,
      Buster's head shoots up.

                                      LOUIS
                    Oh, shit...

      The dog rockets through LOUIS's outstretched arms and the
      basement door.  Over the meter man's scream, we

                                                                                  CUT TO:

6INT. TOWN CAR, ON THE WAY TO CAPITOL, WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY6

      ROBERT and GIL JOHN, in the back of a town car speeding toward
      the Hill.  ROBERT, already on his Blackberry, glances over
      at GIL JOHN and does a doubletake.

                                      ROBERT
                    Is that Vernon's tie?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Yeah.  He won't miss it in prison.

                                      ROBERT
                    Who steals a tie with grease stains? 
                          (laughing)
                    What else did you acquire?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Who cares?  Vern wasn't as tight-
                    assed about his shit as you are.  By
                    the way, who are we going to get to
                    replace him?

                                      ROBERT
                          (back to Blackberry)
                    I dunno.  Louis's call -- it's his
                    house.  You seen the latest RNC
                      internals?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    No, but my wife has.  Someone on my
                    staff keeps feeding 'em to her, so
                    she calls me up from Memphis every
                    day screaming that I'm a lazy-ass
                    fuck who's out to ruin her life by
                    losing the race.                                                                                        7.

                                      ROBERT
                    It is a little unusual that you don't
                    campaign.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Why should I?  My opponent's had two
                    mini strokes since he was nominated. 
                    Who's going to vote for a walking
                    timebomb?  Besides, everybody in the
                    state knows my record.  Two undefeated
                    seasons, eleven conference titles,
                    two national championships. 

      ROBERT nods respectfully.

                                      ROBERT
                    That does speak for itself.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

7INT. MINORITY CAUCUS ROOM, CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY7

      A RNC party OFFICIAL in holding forth to 10 or so Republican
      senators in an ornate Capitol meeting room.  The senators
      are sitting in gold ballroom chairs, sipping coffee, a few
      of them taking notes.  Behind the OFFICIAL, a Powerpoint
        presentation is in progress, although the bulleted data points
      bear no obvious relationship to what is being said.

      In the back of the room, ROBERT stirs his coffee while GIL
      JOHN yawns.  His young chief of staff, TAMMY STACKHOUSE, as
      focused and intense as GIL JOHN is laid-back, leans forward
        attentively, note pad on knee.

                                      OFFICIAL
                    Okay, folks, so here's the takeaway
                    on Afghanistan from the party's
                      perspective.  With Obama's ten-year
                      fade-to-black, we don't lose the
                    war.  With Romney's all-in-for-as-
                      long-as-it-takes, we win the war.
                    We're the GOP; winning is what we
                    do.  We've tested this. Not losing
                    doesn't work for us.  Not losing is
                      a Democrat thing. 

      The OFFICIAL takes off his glasses and pauses for dramatic
      effect

                                      OFFICIAL (CONT'D)
                    So that's what the trip is all about,
                    ladies and gentlemen. You go to Kabul,
                    you stand with the troops and you
                    say loud and clear, "We can do better
                    than not losing".                                                                                        8.

      GIL JOHN snorts and looks over at TAMMY, who is busily
      scribbling notes on a legal pad.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    You're getting this down?

                                      TAMMY
                    Yes, sir.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Why?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

8INT. CORRIDOR, U.S. SENATE, WASHINGTON, D.C - DAY8

      GIL JOHN and ROBERT are the first through the large oaken
      doors of the caucus room.  Behind them, TAMMY is talking
      quietly on her cell phone.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Whoever put that on my schedule is
                    about to have a bad day.  What a
                    waste of time.  Do I look like someone
                    prepared to fly to fuckin' Kabul for
                    the goddamn national committee?

                                      ROBERT
                    You do not.  You look like someone
                    prepared to fly to Philly for the
                    World Series.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    You get me, Robert.  I'll give you
                    that.

      As TAMMY rejoins the two men, we hear a cell phone playing
      the Tar Heel fight song.  GIL JOHN pulls it out of his pocket.

                                    GIL JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (looking at screen)
                    My wife.

      He turns away from the others and flips open the phone.

                                    GIL JOHN (CONT'D)
                    What is it, Maddie?

                                      MADDIE  (V.O.)
                    You're going with the delegation to
                      Afghanistan, right?

      GIL JOHN slowly looks around at TAMMY, who is now staring at
      her feet.                                                                                        9.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Why would I do that, Maddie?

                                      MADDIE (V.O.)
                    Because a full brigade of North
                    Carolina Guard rotated over there
                    last week?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    So what?  They know I support 'em. 
                    I'll make a video...

                                      MADDIE (V.O.)
                    Gil John, everything's changed.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Changed?  How changed?

                                      MADDIE (V.O.)
                    Taylor had another mini stroke last
                    night.  He withdrew from the race.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What?  That's... that's good!  Well,
                    not for him, obviously, but shit,
                    that's an outstandin' development.

                                      MADDIE (V.O.)
                    Wrong.  The party replaced him with
                    Digger Mancusi.

      GIL JOHN stops pacing.  He looks stunned.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What!

                                      MADDIE (V.O.)
                    You're in a real race now, darlin'. 
                    You can't just sit in your man cave
                    anymore, waitin' to be re-elected...

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Goddamn son of a bitch!

      GIL JOHN hurls his phone across the hall.  It caroms off a
      door, skitters along the floor, stopping at ROBERT's feet.

      ROBERT looks down at the shattered phone.

                                      ROBERT
                    That's an iPhone.  Who smashes an
                    iPhone?                                                                                        10.

                                      TAMMY
                    He's got a new opponent.  Digger
                    Mancusi.

      ROBERT starts to laugh.

                                      ROBERT
                    Digger Mancusi?  The Duke basketball
                    coach?

      TAMMY nods gravely.

                                      TAMMY
                    We're fucked.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

9INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM, CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY9

      LOUIS is meeting with a family values lobbying group that
      advocates against gay marriage.  The event is basically a
      photo op, staged in front of a bank of flags in a Capitol
      Hill conference room. 

      SIMON, the group's curiously effeminate executive director,
      is presenting LOUIS with an absurdly tall, kitschy, brass
      sculpture of a wedding-cake couple to honor his support for
      their agenda.  About two dozen people have crowded into the
      conference room, and a PHOTOGRAPHER, a videographer, and
      SHELBY, a reporter from LOUIS's hometown of Reno, Nevada,
      are present to capture the occasion.

                                      SIMON
                    Senator Laffer, on behalf of the
                    Council for Normal Marriage -- and
                    all the born and unborn children
                    conceived within normal marriages --
                    it is my privilege to present you
                    with our 2012 "Say No to Sodomy"
                    Award!

                                      LOUIS
                          (nervous smile)
                    My.
                          (inspecting the award)
                    "Say No..."

                                      SIMON
                          (emphatically)
                    "..to Sodomy"!

                                      PHOTOGRAPHER
                    Could you move in closer, gentlemen?                                                                                        11.

      SIMON throws an arm around LOUIS, who visibly stiffens.  As
      the PHOTOGRAPHER clicks away, a flustered LOUIS tries to
      compose himself.

                                      LOUIS
                          (studying the award)
                    Thank you, Simon.  I'm deeply honored
                    to receive this... this recognition. 
                    But I'm not the only one saying no
                    to unnatural unions.  There are
                    millions of normally married Americans --
                    the men married to the women -- who
                    are also repulsed when they think
                    about two men together.  Or two women
                    together, though maybe not as much... 

      He glances over at JULIE, his chief of staff.  She's drawing
      a finger across her throat.

                                      LOUIS (CONT'D)
                    So hats off to the Council for Normal
                    Marriage and the important work
                    they're doing to prevent not just
                      state-sanctioned sodomy, but also
                    mutual masturbation, frictation, and
                      barebacking across this great land
                    of ours.

      JULIE drops her face in her hands.  Off SIMON's gleaming
      eyes, we

                                                                                  CUT TO:

10INT. SENATE SUBWAY, U.S. CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY10

      LOUIS, cradling his bizarre new award, wanders onto a waiting
      car of the underground light rail train that travels between
      the Capitol Building and the Senate Office Building.  GIL
      JOHN and ROBERT are seated together in the back, GIL JOHN in
      a sullen funk.

                                      LOUIS
                    Hey.

                                      ROBERT
                    Hey.  How'd it go?

      LOUIS sits down and shrugs.

                                      LOUIS
                    What's TMI mean?

                                      ROBERT
                    Too much information.  Why?                                                                                        12.

                                      LOUIS
                    I dunno.  My staff's always saying
                    it.

                                      ROBERT
                    We're going to lunch.  Wanna join
                    us?

      LOUIS looks down at his cumbersome trophy.

                                      LOUIS
                    Um...

                                      ROBERT
                    No worries.  You can bring your
                    friend.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      An array of sparkling crystal and gold-embossed china on a
      crisp, white tablecloth.  We pull back to reveal ROBERT, GIL
      JOHN and LOUIS seated at a table for four, with LOUIS's "Say
      No to Sodomy" trophy propped up in the empty chair.

                                      LOUIS
                          (to Gil John)
                      Afghanistan?  Are serious?  Why?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    I support the troops.

                                      ROBERT
                    His wife's making him.  Basically a
                    campaign swing.

                                      LOUIS
                    But you don't campaign.

                                      ROBERT
                    He does now.  Taylor dropped out. 
                    He's got a new opponent.

                                      LOUIS
                    Who?

                                      ROBERT
                    Digger Mancusi. 

      LOUIS's eyes widen.

                                      LOUIS
                    Digger Mancusi?  The Duke coach?                                                                                        13.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    How the hell do you know who Digger
                    Mancusi is?

                                      LOUIS
                    My nephew goes to Duke.  He's like a
                    god in North Carolina, right?

                                      ROBERT
                    Right.

                                      LOUIS
                          (to Gil John, catching
                            himself)
                    I mean, you're a god, too, Gil.  But
                    you're like a retired god.  He's
                    active.
                          (a beat, then blurts
                            out)
                    Holy cow, you're fucked...

                    Thank you, Louis.

                                      LOUIS
                    Sorry.  Afghanistan.  Good play. 
                    Very senatorial.  Digger can't do
                    that.
                          (to Robert)
                    You going, too.

                                      ROBERT
                    Thinking about it. You ought to go,
                    too, Louis.  It's bicameral.  You'd
                    be welcome.

                                      LOUIS
                    Me?  Why?

                                      ROBERT
                    I dunno. Couldn't hurt for youto
                    pose with a few Spec Ops guys in
                      wraparounds.

                                      LOUIS
                    What do you mean by that?

      GIL JOHN rises suddenly.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    I gotta go.  Late for a meeting.

      ROBERT checks his watch.                                                                                        14.

                                      ROBERT
                    Me, too.  Louis, could you take care
                    of the check?  We'll square up with
                    you later.

      Before he can answer, both men are gone.  Pull back on the
      forlorn sight of LOUIS sitting at lunch alone with his trophy.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

12INT.  ROBERT'S OFFICE BATHROOM, SENATE OFFICE BLDG - EVENING12

      ROBERT is unzipping his garment bag in a small bathroom
      adjacent to his office.  He removes a silk bathrobe and
      elegant pinstriped pajamas from the bag and starts to put
      them on.  We hear the sound of the TV playing in his office,
      as we

                                                                                  CUT TO:

13INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE, SENATE OFFICE BLDING - EVENING13

      A flat-screen TV, on which we see C-span coverage of Senate
        proceedings.  The caption below reads: "Senate filibuster of
      the Buffet Rule". Senator MOWER is speaking, passionately. 
      We pull back to reveal ROBERT's administrative assistant,
      AARON STIMSON, a seasoned Capitol Hill veteran.

                                      MOWER
                          (on TV)
                    Mr. President, this body has already
                    debated the Buffet Rule and rejected
                    it.  The White House can demagogue
                    all it wants, but we cannot get this
                    economy back on track by taxing job-
                    creators.  Job creators are people,
                    just like corporations.  You take
                    away their incentives, they won't
                    create jobs.  They just won't feel
                    it. History proves that.

      ROBERT appears beside AARON.  He's clad in elegant pinstripe
      pajamas, silk paisley dressing gown and black velvet slippers
      with gold embroidered crests.  On the collar of his pajamas,
      he's wearing a tiny American flag pin.  He's clutching a
      leather shaving kit.

                                      ROBERT
                    This is so old school.  What happened
                    to the implicit filibuster -- where
                    we just threaten to do it and nobody
                    loses any sleep?                                                                                        15.

                                      AARON
                    Harry Reid's no dummy.  Calling our
                    bluff keeps Republicans -- and only
                      Republicans -- off the campaign trail.

                                      ROBERT
                    What time am I on?

                                      AARON
                    3:45 a.m.

                                      ROBERT
                    Do I have a speech?

                                      AARON
                    Not unless you want one.  No one's
                    going to see it.  I can get Andrea
                    to knock something out.

                                      ROBERT
                    No.  No, I guess not.

                                    AIDE
                    If I can make a suggestion.  You're
                    going to the private contractor fund-
                    raiser tomorrow.  You could get
                    something nice about them into the
                    record.

                                      ROBERT
                    I suppose it beats my doing bird
                    calls.  Or defending the rich. Rough
                    up some bullet points.

      ROBERT pulls a cell phone out the pocket of his dressing
      gown, and punches in a number.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    You watching this?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

14INT. GIL JOHN'S OFFICE, SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - AFTERNOON14

      GIL JOHN in his office, which looks more like the rec room
      of the coach he once was.  Signed basketballs, photos and
      other sport memorabilia line the walls.

      Relaxing on a sofa, tie at half-mast, nursing a glass or
      scotch, GIL JOHN is watching the filibuster.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    I thought we adjourned.  What the
                    fuck's he doing?                                                                                        16.

      TAMMY enters his office.

                                      ROBERT
                          (on speakerphone)
                    Same thing you'll be doing in a few
                    hours -- filibustering. 

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Fuck I am.

                    Am I?
                          (Tammy nods)
                    Fuck, I am. 

                                      ROBERT
                    Just thought I'd call to remind you
                    in case you were getting liquored up
                    for the evening.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    That's what normal people do, Robert. 
                    We don't all have season tickets to
                    the opera.

                    Tammy, get some coffee in him.

                                      TAMMY
                          (V.O.)
                    I'll try, Senator.

                          (V.O.)
                    Both of you can kiss my ass.

      ROBERT laughs, snaps his phone shut and reaches for the door.

16INT. CORRIDOR, U.S. SENATE, WASHINGTON, D.C - EVENING16

      ROBERT emerges from his office with AARON.

                                      ROBERT
                    Have someone wake me up at 3:15.  I
                    want to grab a shower first.

                                      AARON
                    Yes, sir.                                                                                        17.

      As he pads down the long marble corridor, ROBERT passes the
      night crew -- a cleaning crew is pushing a cart full of brooms
      and supplies.

                                      ROBERT
                    Oh, Randall.

                                      RANDALL
                    Good evening, Senator.

                                      ROBERT
                    Where do we stand on the water rings
                    on the burled side table in my office?

                                      RANDALL
                    The finish has been damaged, Senator. 
                    That's not a cleaning issue.

      As he passes RANDALL, ROBERT makes a game-show buzzer sound.

                                      ROBERT
                    Wrong answer, Randall.  The right
                    answer is, "Whatever it takes." 
                    That's how you get ahead.

      RANDALL watches ROBERT continue on down the corridor.

                                      RANDALL
                    I'm retiring in three days.

                                      ROBERT
                          (over shoulder)
                    Plenty of time.  Your call.  It's
                    about the pride, Randall.

      ROBERT and AARON turn the corner and disappear.  Off a
      nonplused RANDALL, we

17INT. SENATE CLOAKROOM, CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT17

      ROBERT is asleep on one of two dozen cots that have been set
      up in the Senate cloakroom.  Three other senators are snoring
      away, lit only by a TV with the sound off.  On the screen,
      another senator is at the podium, apparently singing.

      As we pan over this scene, we become gradually aware of the
      sound of a woman moaning.  ROBERT eyes flicker opens, and he
      sits up suddenly.  In the shadows of the far side of the
      room, he can just make out a couple in the throes of
      lovemaking.  ROBERT clears his throat and they freeze.  He
      then looks down at his watch: 3:10.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        18.

18INT. CORRIDOR, U.S. SENATE, WASHINGTON, D.C - NIGHT18

      ROBERT, in dressing gown, emerging from the cloakroom.  AARON
      awaits him with garment bag, shaving kit and a steaming cup
      of coffee.

                                      ROBERT
                    Since when is the Senate cloakroom
                    being used for hook-ups?

                                      AARON
                    I think it's the cots -- the novelty
                    of it. 

      ROBERT takes the coffee, shaving gear and garment bag and
      crosses the hall to the men's room.

                                      ROBERT
                    What happened to dignity, to privacy? 
                    I miss old Washington, when people
                    fucked in broom closets.

      He bangs open the door and disappears into the men's room.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

19INT. SENATE FLOOR, U.S. CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT19

      The Senate floor, deserted save a handful of senators and
      their aides, among them LOUIS.  The press gallery is likewise
      nearly empty -- only a few AV technicians and the same
      REPORTER we met in LOUIS's office are watching. 

      Meanwhile, in the well, a SENATOR, arms outstretched, is
      singing in a surprisingly rich baritone.  A portable CD player
      resting on the podium is providing accompaniment.

                                      SENATOR #1
                    "And the world will be better for
                    this, that one man, scorned and
                    covered with scars..."

      ROBERT and AARON are entering the chamber, ROBERT reviewing
      his list of talking points.

                                      SENATOR #1 (CONT'D)
                          (big operatic finish)
                    "...still strove, with his last ounce
                    of courage, to reach the unreachable
                    star!"

      The SENATOR doesn't come within a mile of the final note,
      but the handful of legislators and staff present give him a
      rousing ovation.                                                                                        19.

                                      SENATOR #1 (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.

      ROBERT, who doesn't even look up from his notes, continues
      walking towards the well.

                                      ROBERT
                    Will the gentleman from Verona take
                    five?

      The SENATOR chuckles and gathers up his papers and CD player.

                                      SENATOR #1
                    He will, sir.  He yields to his
                    colleague out of the great state of
                    fatigue which has overcome him.

      As the SENATOR steps away from the podium, ROBERT pats him
      on his back and takes his place. 

                                      ROBERT
                    I commend the gentleman for striving
                    with his last ounce of courage and
                    so forth.  He reminds me of our
                    troops.

      The SENATOR pumps his fist as he leaves the well.

                                      SENATOR #1
                    Hoo-ah!

      As the SENATOR heads up the aisle, he passes GIL JOHN,
      disheveled, tipsy, making his way to his desk. 

                                      ROBERT
                    As well as our brave private security
                      contractors.
                          (referring to notes)
                      Particularly those from Carthage
                    Security Systems, Triple Canopy,
                    Inc., 3-D Global Solutions and other
                    members of the Southeast Asia Private
                    Security Association.  These are the
                    real heroes.

      Speech completed, ROBERT has settled into a seat next to GIL
      JOHN and is checking his email.  In the well, another SENATOR
      is reading a list of names.                                                                                        20.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Who the hell are these people?

                            (distracted)
                    What?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Must be Afghan war dead.  Wish I'd
                    thought of that.

      ROBERT stares at him.

                                      ROBERT

                    "...Kelly A. Ayotte... John Henry

                                    GIL JOHN
                    You sure?

                                      SENATOR #2
                    "... ... Gil John Raymond Biggs ..."

      GIL JOHN shrugs.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Who can keep track, you know?  There
                    are what, a hundred of us?

                                      SENATOR #2
                    "...John Forbes Kerry... and Andrew
                    Ramos Guzman."

                                      ROBERT
                    Hey... Andy Guzman.  There's an idea.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What?

                                      ROBERT
                    Andy -- for the house.  Shoulda
                    thought of him.   Ever since his
                    marriage blew up, he's been staying
                    at some hotel.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Is he up for election?                                                                                        21.

                                      ROBERT
                    Yeah.  But he's safe.  Twenty point
                    lead.

      ROBERT stands up and stretches.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    I'll sound him out and run it by
                    Louis.  What are you doing for a
                    speech?

      GIL JOHN looks down at the prepared text in front of him.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    I dunno.  Somethin' Tammy worked up.

      ROBERT hands GIL JOHN his own text.

                                      ROBERT
                    Here, just read mine again. 
                      Contractors'll love you.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Hey, thanks.

      ROBERT leaving the Senate chamber, joined by AARON.

                                      ROBERT
                    Have you seen Senator Guzman this
                    morning?

                                      AARON
                    Nope.  But I believe you did.  In
                    the cloakroom.

                                      ROBERT
                    That was him? 

                                      AARON
                    According to... well, pretty much

                                      ROBERT
                    Good source.

      ROBERT peels off and goes into the cloakroom.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        22.

22INT. SENATE CLOAKROOM, CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING22

      The lights are up and RANDALL is folding up cots.  ANDY is
      sitting on his cot tying his shoes and looking over his
      speech.  At Robert's approach, ANDY looks up.

                                      ROBERT
                    Got a moment, Andy?

                                    ANDY
                    Robert, what do you think I should
                    read -- the Bill of Rights or e-mails
                    from my ex-wife's boyfriend?

                                      ROBERT
                    There's time for both.  Listen, you
                    still looking for a place to live?

                                    ANDY
                          (looking up)
                    I am, I am.  Why?

                                      ROBERT
                    Louis and Gil John and I are looking
                    for a new roommate.  And you seem
                    like someone who could really use a
                    room.

                                    ANDY
                    Got that right.  It's hard to have a
                    date.

                                      ROBERT
                    I know.  I heard you dating this
                    morning.  In fact, it woke me up.

                                    ANDY
                    Oh.  Sorry. 
                          (stands up)
                    That's just between the three of us,
                    right?

                                      ROBERT
                    Too late.  This is high school.  So
                    what do you think?

                                    ANDY
                    Possible.  I'd have to check out the
                    house.  It's not a dump, is it?

                                      ROBERT
                    Are you kidding?  It's Louis's place.
                    We have to use coasters.  Come check
                    it out tonight.

                    Works for me.  I'll swing by and
                    pick you up. 

      ANDY stands up and stretches out his back, painfully.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm getting too old for this.

23INT. JOHN'S OFFICE, SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - AFTERNOON23

      Later that day, in GIL JOHN's office, TAMMY is briefing her
      boss, ticking off items with customary briskness.  She sits
      ramrod straight in a chair facing the senator's desk, an odd
      positioning since GIL JOHN himself is stretched out on the
      sofa on the other side of the room.  Exhausted from being up
      all night, GIL JOHN is having trouble tracking his aide's
      clipped recitation of action items.

                                      TAMMY
                    So if we're going to commit on the
                      Afghanistan trip, I'll coordinate
                    the schedule with the RNC and contact
                    DOD public affairs.  Do we want to
                    run it by the campaign first?

      Off GIL JOHN, who starts to reply but is cut off by a strong,
        southern-accented female voice from the speakerphone on his
      desk.

                                      MATTIE (V.O.)
                    No.  We're definitely committing. 
                    Do we have dates?

      We now see why TAMMY is facing the desk and not her boss.

                                      TAMMY
                    The 21st through the 24th, Mrs. Biggs.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Wait a minute.  The 21st is...                                                                                        24.

                                      MATTIE (V.O.)
                    That'll work for us.  The debate's
                    not until the 26th.  Anything else?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Debate?

                                      TAMMY
                    One last item, ma'am. Do we want to
                    enlist any other colleagues?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What debate?

                                      MATTIE (V.O.)
                    No, I want G.J. on camera in every
                    shot.  Too many VIPs, it cuts down
                    on his exposure.

      GIL JOHN finally sits up and pulls on his suit jacket. TAMMY,
      facing the speakerphone, doesn't notice.

                                      MATTIE (CONT'D)
                    It's going to be tricky, G.J.  You
                    got to hit all the fear buttons
                    without looking afraid yourself. 
                    Like you're there personally staring
                    down al Quaeda for America.  Know
                    what I mean?  Gil John?

      He's gone.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

24INT. LOUIS'S CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE, WASH D.C. - AFTERNOON24

      A local news interview with AL HICKCOK, the 40ish rancher
      who's running for LOUIS's congressional seat in Nevada. 
      AL's wearing a cowboy hat, plaid jacket, and he's sitting on
      a fence rail with a deer rifle across his lap.  He looks
        good-natured and totally comfortable in his skin.

      We pull back to reveal LOUIS, JULIE and another young aide,
      JAMES, viewing the interview.  JULIE and JAMES are watching
        attentively, but LOUIS paces in the back of the room in front
      of a row of three antique one-arm bandits.

                                    AL
                          (on TV)
                    Well, I happen to enjoy hunting,
                    have ever since my grandfather took
                    me out -- I must have been seven
                    years old -- to track a pack of timber
                    wolves who were preying on our cattle.

                                    AL (CONT'D)
                    I told that to Louis once, when we
                    were both state legislators, and he
                    about fell over.  His eyes got all
                    wide and he said, "You hunted wolves? 
                    Wasn't that dangerous?"  I said,
                    "Yeah, for the wolves!"

      AL roars with laughter.

                                    AL (CONT'D)
                    But you know, Louis is great. 
                    Different backgrounds, that's all.

      JULIE reaches for the DVD machine and kills the interview.

                                      JULIE
                    You get the general picture,
                      Congressman.  He's trying to paint
                    you as a wimp.  And the numbers
                    suggest he's getting some traction.

      LOUIS sits down and slumps into his chair, despondent.

                                      LOUIS
                    So what am I supposed to do?  Switch
                    to lo-rises?  Wear Doc Martens 1460s
                    on the Senate floor?

      His aides exchange puzzled glances.

                                      JULIE
                    Sir, we think we need to prepare a
                    more aggressive communications package
                    for the campaign, especially free
                    media.
                          (motioning to James)
                    James just fielded an invitation for
                    you from The Colbert Report, one of
                    those "Better Know a District"
                      segments...

                                      LOUIS
                    Wait a minute.  Nobody does those
                    anymore.  You got no control.  Colbert
                    makes you look like a horse's ass.

                                      JAMES
                    Yes, sir.  You gotta be pretty ballsy
                    to do it.

      LOUIS stares at him for a moment.

                                      LOUIS
                    Which is your point.                                                                                        26.

                                      JAMES
                    Well...

      They are suddenly interrupted by ROBERT, who knocks on the
      doorframe.

                                      ROBERT
                    Louis?  Got a minute.  It's important.

      JULIE and JAMES take their cue, quickly leaving, closing the
      door behind them.

                                      LOUIS
                    What's important?

                                      ROBERT
                    It's not important.  I just don't
                    like to wait.

      ROBERT walks over to the slot machines, pulls a few quarters
      out of his pocket and starts to play.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    What do you think of Andy Guzman?

                                      LOUIS
                          (shrugging)
                    Guzman? Okay, I guess.  I worked
                    with him on a couple reconciliations. 
                    Bit of a showboat.  Why?

                                      ROBERT
                    He needs a place to stay.  Like right
                    away.  His wife kicked him out.  His
                    seat's safe, so you won't have to
                    worry about turnover.  You got another
                    quarter?

      LOUIS fishes into his pocket and flips ROBERT a quarter.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    So what do you say?

                                      LOUIS
                    I guess it'd be all right.

                                      ROBERT
                    Great.  He's coming by tonight.

      ROBERT suddenly hits the jackpot.  A hundred quarters sluice
      into the tray, bells ringing.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    Damn, I didn't think this thing
                    actually paid out.                                                                                         27.

      ROBERT paws at the tray, shoveling the quarters into his
      briefcase.

                                      LOUIS
                    Neither did I.

      ROBERT flips a quarter back to LOUIS and heads for the door.

                                      ROBERT
                    Gotta go to a reception. See you
                    back at the house.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      being held in his honor in a ballroom at a Washington hotel. 
      He is stopped by ED CARTHAGE, CEO of a private security firm.

                    Senator! Appreciate the shout-out. 
                    Even on C-Span 2 at 0300, love hearing
                    the Carthage Security name-check on
                    the Senate floor. Then to hear it
                    again at 0530 from your buddy Biggs?

                    You've only been in business three
                    years, Ed.

                                    ED
                    What can I say?  President Peace
                    Prize has been good for business.
                    Listen, Senator, I'd like you to
                    meet an outstanding young patriot...

      He motions to an intense-looking man in a crewcut and aviator
      glasses to join the conversation.

                                    ED (CONT'D)
                    This is retired Special Forces Captain
                    Brandon Carshaw, one of my best people --
                    he's just back from Afghanistan.

                                      ROBERT
                    Welcome home, Captain.  How do you
                    like being a private contractor?

                                      BRANDON
                    How do I like making a quarter-million
                    a year?  Very much, sir.                                                                                        28.

      ROBERT laughs.  He notices a clear plastic tube coiling out
      of BRANDON's ear.

                                      ROBERT
                    Must make up for all those years
                    living off lizards and paint chips.

                                      BRANDON
                    Price of freedom, sir.  I was happy
                    to serve.

                                    ED
                    The Senator's on his way over to the
                    sandbox next week, Brandon.

                                      ROBERT
                    Maybe.  We don't know who's on the
                    CONDEL yet.

      ROBERT feels a hand at his elbow.

                                      AARON
                      Gentlemen, if I might just steal the
                    Senator away for a moment.  He's got
                    a lot of folks to thank here.

      BRANDON whips out a business card and hands it to ROBERT.

                                    ED
                    Anything I can do on the security
                    front, sir, just let me know.  I'd
                    be happy to coordinate your trip.

                                      ROBERT
                    Thank you, Captain...

      The AIDE practically spins ROBERT away from the conversation.

                    What's wrong?

                          (hushed, urgent voice)
                    The grand jury just came back.

      ROBERT slowly swivels to face his aide.  AARON would not
      have interrupted him if the news were good.  ROBERT's face
      falls as we

26INT. LIVING ROOM, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING26

      LOUIS and GIL JOHN are drinking shots of Jack Daniels in the
      living room.                                                                                        29.

      It's still early in the evening, but they're already half in
      the bag.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Okay, so one more reason why you
                    should make the Afghanistan trip...

                                      LOUIS
                    I wasn't aware of even one.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    That interview with the guy runnin'
                    against you.  Hickcok.

                                      LOUIS
                    How'd you see that?  It was local.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Christ, Louis, nothing's local
                    anymore.  Even I know that.  It went
                    viral.  YouTube.

                                      LOUIS
                    Shit.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Point is, if you're holding pressers
                    in front of an MRAP in Kandahar, the
                    other side can hardly call you out
                    for being a fag.

                                      LOUIS
                    He wasn't calling me a fag.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Well, he sure as hell wasn't calling
                    you Arnold Schwarzenegger.

      LOUIS sways in his seat, trying not to pitch over.

                                      LOUIS
                      Schwarzenegger's a fag.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What are you talkin' about?  Like
                    twenty women accused him of sexual
                    assault.

                                      LOUIS
                    Never proven. 

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Look, Louis, I'm tellin' you, man,
                    you need to go. Get your ass behind
                    a SAW or M-2 or somethin'.                                                                                        30.

                                      LOUIS
                    What are they?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Light arms. 

                                      LOUIS
                    Right.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    You never handled a weapon in your
                    life, have you?

      LOUIS laughs, too loudly, as we

                    How's this going down, Aaron?

                                      AARON
                    Legally, you should be fine for now. 
                    No way they empanel a jury until
                    after the election.  But the ethics
                    committee will have to convene.

                                      ROBERT
                    But those are closed sessions, right?

                                      AARON
                    Yeah, but you can expect the
                      Democratic staffers to leak like
                    crazy.

                                      ROBERT
                    There's nothing to leak.  There was
                    no kickback.

                                      AARON
                    Well, then, maybe someone will leak
                    the lack of evidence.  You know Gil
                    John's on that committee, right?

                                      ROBERT
                    Christ, that's right...
                          (after a moment)
                    Okay, we need to change the subject
                    when this breaks.  Get me on that

                    You want to leave the country?

                                      ROBERT
                    You got a better idea?

      While they stand on the corner, a limousine glides up to the
      curb.  The window lowers, and ANDY, black tie, grins out at
      them.

                    Ready when you are, boss.

28INT. ANDY'S LIMO, ON THE WAY TO ALPHA HOUSE - NIGHT28

      As ROBERT slides into the jump seat, he feels like he's just
      entered a rolling discotheque.  Salsa music blares over the
      sound system, and a multicolored rope of LED lights pulsates
      in time with the music.  One side of the limo is paneled
      with mirrors and a small wet bar with full array of liquor. 
      ANDY, with drink in one hand, has his arm around a companion,
      ADRIANA, a spectacular 30ish Cuban-American billionaire
      heiress.

      ROBERT looks totally nonplused.

                                    ANDY
                    I know what this looks like. 

                                      ROBERT
                    What does it look like?

                                    ANDY
                    Like I'm bringing my mistress to
                    check out my new crib.  But the truth
                    is we just met.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Although I've been backing him for
                    years.

                                    ANDY
                    And I've been fronting for her!  Who
                    knew?

                                      ROBERT
                    Who knew what?

      ANDY gazes at ADRIANA appreciatively.                                                                                        32.

                                    ANDY
                    That she was so much more than an
                    illegible signature.  And it gets
                    better: She's setting up a SuperPak
                    for me!

                                      ADRIANA
                    Shhhh!

                                    ANDY
                    Yes, shhh!  We can't coordinate! 
                    Forget I mentioned it.

      ADRIANA extends her hand.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Adriana de Portago. 

                                      ROBERT
                    Robert Bettencourt.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Are you a junior senator or senior?

                                      ROBERT
                    Senior.  Unlike Andy, who has no
                    standing at all.

      ADRIANA playfully squeezes ANDY's arm.

                    A girl has to start somewhere.

29INT. KITCHEN, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT29

      ADRIANA, ROBERT and ANDY standing in the living room of the
      house, surveying an unmade cot and a small hill of dirty
      laundry that has been built up in the corner.

                                      ADRIANA
                    You guys aren't really senators, are
                    you?

                                    ANDY
                          (to Robert)
                    Are you kidding me?  This is how you
                    live?

                                      ROBERT
                    It's how Gil John lives.  I live on
                    the non-hillbilly side of the room.                                                                                        33.

                                    ANDY
                    Let's see the rest of the house.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

30INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT30

      ADRIANA is bouncing on the bed, laughing.

                                    ANDY
                    Wait, wait, don't start without me!

      He dives in after her and pulls the covers over them.  More
      laughter.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                          (muffled voice, from
                            under covers, to
                            Robert)
                    This is more like it.  What's the
                    rent?

                                      ROBERT
                    Actually, Andy, on account of my
                      seniority, I'll be moving into this
                    room.  You'd be sleeping with Gil
                    John.

      ANDY's head pops up from under the covers.

                                    ANDY
                    I don't think so.
                          (to Adriana)
                    Let's go, honey.

                                      ADRIANA
                    I want it!  I want it!  I've never
                    had a love-nest!

      Then...

      The thunderous sound of a shotgun BLAST from downstairs.

                                      ROBERT
                    What the hell...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

31INT.  BASEMENT, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT31

      LOUIS, shaking, looking down at the discharged shotgun in
      his hands.  A teetering GIL JOHN is staring at LOUIS in
      disbelief.  He starts to laugh.                                                                                        34.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    How could you miss that?  How could
                    you fuckin' miss that?

      We cut to the other side of the basement, where a large
      pumpkin has been set up in front of an old mattress.  About
      three feet above and to the left of the perfectly intact
      pumpkin, there's a large blackened hole, still smoking, where
      the spray of shot pellets tore through the mattress.

      We hear the clatter of the others coming down the basement
      stairs.

                                      LOUIS
                          (meekly)
                    Give me a break.  I'm shit-faced.

                                      ROBERT
                    Jesus, Gil John...

      GIL JOHN grabs the shotgun from LOUIS.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    So what?  We're only 20 feet away,
                    for Chrissake!

      GIL JOHN swings the shotgun up and lets fly at the pumpkin --
      BOOM!  BOOM!  ADRIANA screams and covers her ears.  Ejected
      shotgun shells fly across the basement, bouncing off the
      furnace.

      We cut back to the MATTRESS, which now has two new holes. 
      Fibers of stuffing fill the air.  The pumpkin remains
      unscathed.  GIL JOHN looks down at the weapon, mystified.

                                    GIL JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Fuck me.  Must be the sighting.

      LOUIS, too shaken by all the gunfire to gloat over GIL JOHN's
      errant shots, heads for the stairs. 

                                      LOUIS
                    I'm going to bed.  I gotta do an
                    interview in the morning.
                          (noticing Adriana)
                    Who are you?

                                      ADRIANA
                    Adriana de Portago.

      LOUIS thinks that over for a moment.

                                      LOUIS
                    From Miami?                                                                                        35.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Yes.

                                      LOUIS
                    You gave me some money once.  Thanks.

                                      ADRIANA
                    You're welcome.

      LOUIS then notices ANDY.

                                      LOUIS
                    Andy.

                                    ANDY
                    Louis.

                                      LOUIS
                    You joining us?

                                    ANDY
                    If I can have the upstairs room.

                                      LOUIS
                    No problem.

                                      ROBERT
                    Hey, wait a minute...

                                      LOUIS
                    It's my house. 
                          (glancing at Adriana)
                    Thanks again for your support.

      A beguiling smile from ADRIANA.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Any time.

      ADRIANA looks over at ANDY and mouths the word, "Cute." 
      LOUIS shuffles up the stairs.  Another BOOM!  As we 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

32INT. KITCHEN, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING32

      The kitchen TV, with latest election news.  ROBERT's seated
      at the kitchen table, skiming the Wall Street Journal.

                                      ROBERT
                    You know how long I've been waiting
                    for that room?

      GIL JOHN, pouring chow into his dog's bowl, ignores him.                                                                                        36.

                                      ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    I'm so tired of living in squalor. 
                    No offense.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Just as well.  I'd move out before
                    sharing a room with Andy Guzman. 
                    Then y'all'd be back to where you
                    started.

                                      ROBERT
                    What's your problem with Andy?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Damn hot dog.  It's never not about
                    him.  Ever try doin' a joint press
                      conference with him?  I did, once,
                    on the hurricane relief bill.  Spent
                    40 minutes holdin' my cock while he
                    took credit for a bill I wrote!

                                      ROBERT
                    You didn't write it.  Your staff
                    wrote it.  You didn't even read it.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    What for?  Bill didn't have a chance. 
                    But that's not the point...

      GIL JOHN sits down at the table and pours himself his coffee. 
      ROBERT puts down his newspaper.

                                      ROBERT
                    Listen, Gil, something's come up. 
                    You may not have heard about it yet...

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Well, that may be because I don't
                    want to hear about it.

                                      ROBERT
                    That grand jury in Philadelphia? 
                    Looks like I might get indicted.

      GIL JOHN whistles softly.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    That's rough, Robert.  Sorry to hear
                    that.

                                      ROBERT
                    The U.S. attorney's a bigoted wacko. 
                    He's been turning over rocks for...                                                                                        37.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Okay, so we can't talk about this,
                    right?

                                      ROBERT
                    Why not?

                                    GIL JOHN
                    An indictment will trigger a hearin'
                    with the ethics committee, which I
                    sit on.

                                      ROBERT
                    You do?  Well, then, I think you
                    should know that this thing is
                      racially-motivated and...

                                    GIL JOHN
                          (with finality)
                    I doubt it, but I really don't think
                    we want to talk about this, Robert. 
                    Besides, maybe you won't get indicted.

      We hear Buster growl.  The two men look around to see ANDY
      and ADRIANA standing at the kitchen door, dressed in a rumpled
      version of the clothes in which we lost saw them.  ADRIANA
      bends down to pat Buster.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Hi, baby!

      ANDY looks at ROBERT with a crooked grin.

                                    ANDY
                    We'll take it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

33INT. LOUIS'S CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE, WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY33

      LOUIS, taking a deep breath, walking into his office.  A
      camera crew is setting up for the Colbert interview, and
      JULIE, JAMES and SHELBY are hovering about.  STEVEN is behind
      LOUIS's desk, feeding quarters into the slot machine.

                                      LOUIS
                          (voice breaking)
                    Mr. Colbert...

      He's interrupted by a whooping siren followed by the clatter
      of cascading coins. STEPHEN spins around, smiling with
      delight.

                                      STEPHEN
                      Congressman!                                                                                        38.

      The rest of this scene will be improvised, with STEPHEN
        interviewing LOUIS.  The questions can be about anything,
      but the Wimp Factor should be brought up.  For instance,
      STEPHEN could tee up a question with something like,
      "Congressman, I don't see sexual preference..."

      In any event, the interview does not go well.  At its most
        embarrassing point, we

                                                                                  CUT TO:

34EXT. ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON34

      A cab, pulling up in front of the house.  LOUIS emerges and
      trudges slowly up the stairs to the brownstone and fumbles
      with his keys.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

35INT. FOYER, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - AFTERNOON35

      LOUIS, letting himself in.  We hear a football game in
      progress in the living room.  He hangs his keys on a key
      caddy, takes off his overcoat and walks quietly into the
      kitchen.  He grabs a bottle of beer from the refrigerator
      and heads for the living room.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

36INT. LIVING ROOM, ALPHA HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - AFTERNOON36

      LOUIS, joining ROBERT and GIL JOHN on a couch in the living
      room.  The coffee table in front of them is littered with
      junk food and beer cans.  LOUIS reaches forward, opens a
      decorative box on the table, withdraws a coaster and puts it
      under his beer can.  The other two take no note of him. 
      After a moment, LOUIS grabs a handful of taco chips and leans
      back into the couch.

                                      LOUIS
                    So I'm thinking I might go to
                      Afghanistan.

      His two housemates look at him with surprise.

                                      ROBERT
                    Oh, yeah?  What changed your mind?

                                      LOUIS
                    Nothing really.  Just thought about
                    it, seems like a good move.

                                    GIL JOHN
                    Colbert rip you a new one?                                                                                        39.

                                      LOUIS
                    No, no...
