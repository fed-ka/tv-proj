      ANDREW (27, intelligent, boyish but not a manchild) watches 
      football. With him is STU (28, Andrew s roommate, loyal, 
      slightly dickish), and PETE (58, Andrew s dad, retired cop). 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Andrew is a guy s guy. He likes 
                    sports and Liam Neeson movies. 

      FREEZE on Andrew s game face.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    But Andrew also has another side. A 
                    hidden side.


      Andrew drives, sings  My Heart Will Go On .

                          (sings)
                    Near! Far! Wherever ---

      A bee flies into his mouth. He loses control, crashes ---

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Andrew s Heteromanticism grew 
                    directly from watching his parents.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    He believes they were brought 
                    together by destiny - An idea 
                      strengthened by the fact that after 
                    his mom died ---

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    --- his dad tried to find someone 
                    he clicked with in the same way.                                                                                       2.


      The final photo is of Andrew s dad and ROSEANNE BARR.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    So far he s been unlucky. 


      Andrew s Dad moves his stuff (drum kit, Thomas Kincaide 
      paintings) into Andrew and Stu s apartment.

                    Just until my divorce from Roseanne 
                    is finalized.

      On Andrew and Stu, not excited about this.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Andrew hopes upon hope that the 
                    girl he s destined to be with comes 
                    to him soon.

      Andrew s dad turns the thermostat to 95.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Very soon.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ZELDA (28, whip smart, thoughtful with a killer personal 
      style) at a Halloween party dressed as Lady Justice, sword 
      and all.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Zelda is a girl s girl. She likes 
                    pedicures and German Shepherds.

      Off Zelda, balancing cocktails on her scales of justice, 
      MATCH CUT TO ---


      --- THE LADY JUSTICE SEAL on a courtroom wall. Zelda crosses 
      in front of it. She s a lawyer, defending NUNS against what 
      looks like the Haliburton corporation.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    But she loves the legal system, the 
                    order and sanity it offers ---


      13 YEAR OLD ZELDA circles job openings in the newspaper while 
      her 40 year old MOM does a black velvet painting of Stevie 
      Nicks.                                                                                       3.


                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    --- which growing up, she craved. 

                                    ZELDA S MOM
                    If the universe wants me to have a 
                    job, Z, it ll bring me one.  


      Zelda is on a coffee date. It s not a match.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    She s trying internet dating. She 
                    likes that she can control exactly 
                    who she meets. 

      Her date leaves, passes ANOTHER GUY on his way in. From 
      Zelda s reaction we can tell this guy isn t the one either. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    But like Andrew, she s still alone.

      finger (clear polish) runs over it, finds what she s looking 
      for:  CRUSH ONLINE DATING - SUITES 300-325 


      LYDIA aka BIG BIRD (35), presides over Monday morning s staff 
      meeting. She is tall and blonde and cool with the nickname. 
      She reads a letter while an employee hangs a framed photo of 
      a family on the  Success Wall .  

                                  BIG BIRD
                       ...because if it weren t for 
                     Crush , I would never have met the 
                    love of my life and had our three 
                    wonderful boys.  

      Big Bird crumples the letter, disgusted.

                                  BIG BIRD
                    We re getting way too many of 
                    these, people. The idea is to keep 
                    them paying the monthly fee. They 
                    won t do that if they get married!

      Andrew and Stu (they are co-workers as well as roommates) 
      stand in the back of the crowd. 

                                  BIG BIRD
                    It s thinking like this that 
                    brought this company to the brink 
                    of bankruptcy. Keep pushing the new 
                    App, folks! They swipe, they click, 
                    they hook-up. 
                          (re: The Success Wall)
                    And remember: Every time a picture 
                    goes up there, you have all failed. 

      Dead silence from the company.                                                                                      5.


                                  BIG BIRD
                          (big smiles)
                    Okay! 

      Big Bird leads a round of applause to end the meeting. 
      Everyone disperses. Andrew approaches the Success Wall.

                                  ANDREW
                    This place used to do real 
                      matchmaking. 

      A sign on the wall:  We Connect Souls .

                                  ANDREW
                    The only things we connect anymore 
                    are penises and vaginas.

                                  STU
                    I know. Isn t it great?

      Ding! Zelda steps off the elevator, looks around. Lost. She s 
      on the phone. 

                                  ZELDA (INTO PHONE)
                    No, you can try a child as an adult 
                    but not the other way around. 

      Andrew sees her. He can t breathe.

                                  ZELDA (INTO PHONE)
                    No, it doesn t matter if the crime 
                    is adorable. 

      Zelda notices Andrew. This breaks her concentration. 

                                  ZELDA (INTO PHONE)
                    Can I call you back? 

      She hangs up.

                                  ZELDA
                    Hi. I m Zelda. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Andrew.

      They both just look at each other for a moment. 

                                  STU
                    And I m Stu.

      They both turn to Stu. Whatever strange sensation had just 
      bewitched Andrew and Zelda, they ve been snapped out of it.                                                                                      6.


                                  STU
                    So what do you want, lady?

                                  ANDREW
                    Stu.

                                  STU
                    What? She doesn t work here. She 
                    could be a spy for OkCupid. 

                                  ZELDA
                    I m here for an interview. About my 
                      experience on the site?

                                  ANDREW
                    You want the Relationship Labs. You 
                    came in the wrong way. They have 
                    their own special entrance. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Like a dog door.

                                  ANDREW
                    Exactly. Come on. I ll take you 
                    there. 

      MOMENTS LATER - Andrew and Zelda turn a corner, breeze 
      through the FRAUD and USER EXPERIENCE divisions. 

                                  ANDREW
                    The interviews are helpful but it s 
                    the raw data that tells us what 
                    people really think.

                                  ZELDA
                    Ooh. What do they really think?

                                  ANDREW
                    Well, for instance, when a guy 
                    chooses a girl on the site, guess 
                    how important it is that she have a 
                    college degree?  

                                  ZELDA
                    I m gonna go with  Of no 
                      importance? 

                                  ANDREW
                    Correct! Look at you.

                                  ZELDA
                    Well I am college educated.                                                                                      7.


                                  ANDREW
                    Which is of no importance to me.

      They turn a corner, move through BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE and 
      GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT. This company is big.

                                  ANDREW
                    So uh, lemme ask you...

                                  ZELDA
                    I m here as part of a failure 
                    couple, not a success couple.

                                  ANDREW
                    Great. I mean I m sorry. Wait, 
                    how d you know ---

                                  ZELDA
                    Well you re clearly taking me the 
                    long way...

                                  ANDREW
                    Oh. And you think that s because I 
                    wanted... No. I m just showing you 
                    the scenic route. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Is that so?

                                  ANDREW
                    Yeah, if we d gone the quick way 
                    you d have missed really amazing 
                    sights. For instance. 

      He stops, refers to a printer with a picture of Bob Marley 
      taped on it and a speech bubble that says  We be jammin .

                                  ZELDA
                    Wow. I owe you an apology. 

                                  ANDREW
                    I think you do. 

      They re on the move again, enter THE RELATIONSHIP LABS. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Here we are. I m sorry it didn t 
                    work out for you with the site. 

      The door to the labs opens, revealing DAN, the interviewer.

                                  DAN
                    Zelda? Hi. You wanna come on in, 
                    your date s already here.                                                                                        8.


      He refers inside where a young woman named TONI (24) waits.

                                  TONI
                    There you are.

                                  ANDREW
                          (thrown)
                    Oh. So you re...

                                  ZELDA
                    Bye. 

      Zelda steps inside the room. Dan closes the door on Andrew. 

                                  ANDREW
                          (to himself)
                    Bye? Bye or bi? Did she mean bye as 
                    in goodbye or bi as in --- 

                                  STU (O.S.)
                      Bisexual?!

      Reveal that Stu is now standing right next to him. How long 
      he s been there is unclear.

                                  ANDREW
                    Shh.

                                  STU
                    You should ask her out. Dating a bi 
                    girl is like winning the sex 
                    lottery!

                                  BIG BIRD (O.S.)
                    Stu!

      Stu runs off. Andrew stays. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    He waits. 

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

       The Graduate . The scene where Ben waits for Elaine outside 
      of her classroom, framed and positioned exactly the way 
      Andrew was outside the lab door. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Just like the hero of his third 
                    favorite movie waited for the girl 
                    he loves.

                    filmed at USC. And this classroom 
                    right here ---

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      THE SAME DOOR, from the same angle. No one waits outside. 
      SUPER:  7 YEARS AGO . We move toward and THROUGH THE DOOR ---


      --- revealing a classroom full of LAW STUDENTS. Zelda (then 
      22) sits in front, rapt.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    --- is the exact same one where 
                    Zelda met her first love. 

      The Professor is wheezy, sweaty and detached. But Zelda s not 
      looking at him. She s focused on the board, the concepts. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Her passion for the law has never 
                    been equalled in a relationship 
                    with a person. At least not yet.


      Andrew hasn t moved. Stu returns. 

                                  STU
                    Anything?

      The door suddenly OPENS. Dan exits, alone. No Zelda. Andrew 
      looks inside. Sees the other door.

                                  STU
                    The dog door!

                                  DAN
                    Thank God that s over.

                                  ANDREW
                    What happened?

                                  DAN
                    That lawyer ---

                                  ANDREW
                    Zelda?                                                                                    10.


                                  DAN
                    She scared the crap out of me. 
                    Turns out she s straight but the 
                    site screwed up and paired her with 
                    that other girl. She was pissed. 
                    She threatened to  have my badge . 
                    What does that mean?

                                  ANDREW
                    It means you need to give me her 
                    phone number. I ll work it out.

                                  DAN
                    I can t give out personal 
                      information.

                                  ANDREW
                    Dan. Danny Boy. Listen. You believe 
                    in The One, right?

                                  DAN
                    Like from the Matrix? Sure. 

                                  ANDREW
                    No, like a soul mate. 

                                  DAN
                    Oh. Then no.

                                  ANDREW
                    Well if you knew what happened to 
                    me at the Mayan Theater two years 
                    ago ---

                                  STU
                    Oh, GOD. This again? 

                                  ANDREW
                          (still talking to Dan)
                    --- you d believe and you d give me 
                    her number. Now listen. I was 
                    dragged there by ---

                                  STU
                          (to Dan, quickly)
                    He was dragged there by a friend to 
                    see a show. Wasn t his favorite 
                    band. And then he saw this girl 
                    across the room in a silver dress. 
                    He made eye contact and had a 
                       transcendent moment  and then he 
                    tried to go talk to her but he 
                    couldn t get to her because of the 
                    crowd and he never saw her again.                                                                                    11.


                                  ANDREW
                          (annoyed)
                    We ve been through this, Stu. You 
                    can t fast-forward conversations. 
                    Life is not a DVR.

                                  STU
                    You re the one that replays that 
                    moment over and over. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Because I don t want something like 
                    that to happen again! I don t want 
                    to lose my chance with this new 
                    girl the way I did with the girl in 
                    the silver dress.

                                  DAN
                    You sure it wasn t a red dress?

                                  STU
                    Dan, the Matrix is just a movie.

                                  DAN
                    I know it is.

      Andrew s phone rings. He answers.

                                  ANDREW (INTO PHONE)
                    Hello?

                                  ZELDA (OVER PHONE) 
                    Turn around.

      Andrew turns around. Outside the window, across the way, 
      Zelda stands in her office window. They work in the same 
      office park, in adjacent buildings! 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Zelda s firm moved into the same 
                    office park as Andrew s company 
                    over two months ago. But despite 
                    being within forty-five feet of 
                    each other on nineteen different 
                    occasions ---

      A SERIES OF MOMENTS OF ANDREW AND ZELDA WITHIN PROXIMITY TO 
      ONE ANOTHER IN THE OFFICE PARK BUT NEVER SEEING ONE ANOTHER.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    --- they had never once laid eyes 
                    on each other until today.                                                                                     12.


      WE SEE THEM MISS EACH OTHER ON ELEVATORS, ON OPPOSITE SIDES 
      OF A FOUNTAIN, PASSING INCHES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER IN A LOBBY 
      UNTIL CUTTING BACK TO ---

      --- Andrew and Zelda, at their office windows.

                                  ZELDA (OVER PHONE)
                    Is it totally weird that I tracked 
                    your number down?

      Andrew can t believe it. He smiles. NEEDLE DROP:  Is This 
      Love  by Bob Marley ---

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Andrew is stuck in a boring meeting. He stealthily TEXTS.


      Zelda sees a text come in. Carefully checks it. She smiles.


      Andrew and Zelda eat lunch, talk. At one point Zelda casually  
      puts her hand on his arm. Just for a moment. Andrew acts as 
      if it wasn t the greatest moment of his life.


      Andrew holds the elevator door for Zelda who runs on. She s 
      so happy to see him that she almost forgets to choose a 
      floor.


      A flurry of QUICK MOMENTS INTERCUT between Andrew and Zelda 
      as they FOLLOW, FRIEND, POKE and WINK at each other through 
      the social networking world via phone, desktop and laptop 
      from their respective offices, apartments and cars finally 
      climaxing with a TEXT, from Andrew to Zelda:  WANNA GO OUT?  


      Andrew and Zelda sit at the bar. They look giddy, happy.

                                  ZELDA
                    ...And since law school I ve been 
                    doing Pro Bono work at an otherwise 
                    sinister white collar firm. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Great. I m pro Pro Bono. 

                                  ZELDA
                    It sounds corny but I like making a 
                      difference in my client s lives.

      Andrew likes this, smiles. The bartender arrives with drinks.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Sixteen dollars. 

      Neither Andrew nor Zelda pay. The bartender is confused.

                                  BARTENDER
                    I ll come back.

      He leaves. A song starts playing on the restaurant s mix.

                                  ZELDA
                          (re: the music)
                    Oh, God.

                                  ANDREW
                    What? You don t like your drink?                                                                                    14.


      Zelda Shazams the air. 

                                  ANDREW
                    You could get another.
                          (eyes the drink menu)
                    What about the Martini Navratolova? 

                                  ZELDA
                          (gets the hit back)
                    Yep. I knew it. I got dragged to 
                    see this band by an old boyfriend 
                    couple years back.

      Andrew recognizes the song. His eyes narrow. 

                                  ZELDA
                    It was one of those groups with 
                    like fifty people on stage, dressed 
                    like they re from the Dust Bowl?

                                  ANDREW
                    Was that the show at the Mayan? Two 
                    thousand twelve?

                                  ZELDA
                      I offended you, didn t I? You re 
                    like a ginormous fan of these guys.

      Andrew suddenly flushes with recognition.

                                  ZELDA
                    I m sorry, but I mean, come on. Why 
                    do they feel the need to yell 
                     Hey!  in every song?  

                                  ANDREW
                    Okay, this is unreal.

                                  ZELDA
                    Are you okay?

                                  ANDREW
                    We had a moment at that show. We 
                    saw each other across the room. You 
                    wore a silver dress that night, 
                    remember? 

      Zelda thinks about this. Andrew is getting excited.

                                  ANDREW
                    I can t believe it. This is a sign!                                                                                    15.


                                  ZELDA
                          (worried)
                    Oh boy.

                                  ANDREW
                    You don t believe in signs?

                                  ZELDA
                    I believe you can find evidence 
                    that proves anything. I do it for a 
                    living.

                                  ANDREW
                    But this is different. I mean, the  
                    universe brought us back together.

                                  ZELDA
                    Wow, I was really not expecting to 
                    be reminded of my mother so much 
                    tonight.

                                  ANDREW
                    What?

      The music on the radio seems to grow LOUDER, getting under 
      Zelda s skin.  Hey! Ho!  

                                  ANDREW
                    This is the sort of story we could 
                    be telling our kids. Why aren t you 
                    as freaked out by this as I am? 

                                  ZELDA
                    Oh, I m getting freaked out all 
                    right.

      The bartender returns. Zelda reaches for her wallet.

                                  ANDREW
                    No, let me get that.

      Andrew tries to pay. She pushes his money away. There s a lot 
      of pushing money back and forth until her drink is 
        accidentally spilled all over her.  Hey!  

                                  ANDREW
                    I m sorry. I ---

      Zelda stands abruptly. 

                                  ZELDA
                    I should go.                                                                                    16.


                                  ANDREW
                    What? No... 

                                  ZELDA
                    This is why I usually only date 
                    other lawyers. There s none of this 
                       believing in unicorns  stuff. No 
                    offense. 

                                  ANDREW
                    None taken. Zelda, this was meant 
                    to be. 

                                  ZELDA
                    No it wasn t. 

                                  ANDREW
                    But ---

                                  ZELDA
                    Nothing is. I decide what I do. And 
                    right now I m deciding to go home 
                    and get some sleep.

                                  ANDREW
                    Zelda.

                                  ZELDA
                    And I don t remember this  moment  
                    we supposedly had. I don t even own 
                    a silver dress. 

      Andrew takes this in, thrown. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Oh. 

                                  ZELDA
                    I m sorry.

                                  ANDREW
                    Maybe it just looked silver in the 
                    lights...

                                  ZELDA
                    Goodbye, Andrew.

      She leaves. Andrew watches her go, shocked at how quickly 
      things deteriorated. 

                                  BARTENDER
                    So how long you guys been married?

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO


      Pete (Andrew s dad), attaches a home defibrillator to the 
      wall. Stu watches with a cup of coffee.

                                  PETE
                    So if I have a heart attack you 
                    just use this to shock me back to 
                    life. 

                                  STU
                    You re not moving out anytime soon, 
                    are you?

      Andrew enters pours himself a coffee. 

                                  PETE
                    You look God awful. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Thanks, dad.

                                  STU
                    Are you all right?

                                  ANDREW
                    I was up all night, playing it over 
                    and over in my head...

                                  STU
                    Don t beat yourself up. You re an 
                    idiot. Just accept it.

                                  ANDREW
                    No, I wasn t talking about last 
                    night. I meant the show at the 
                    Mayan. 

                                  STU
                    OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? 

                                  PETE
                          (flinches, to Stu)
                    Why are you yelling?

                                  ANDREW
                    It was her in the silver dress. I m 
                    sure of it. She just remembers 
                      incorrectly. 

      Stu and Pete eye each other, concerned.                                                                                    18.


                                  STU
                    Don t women usually know what they 
                    wore to things?

                                  PETE
                    This is just like the Hoverboard 
                    incident.

                                  ANDREW
                    No it isn t. 

                                  STU
                    What s the Hoverboard incident?

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    One night twenty years ago, in 
                    Burbank, California...


      Andrew (7) watches  Back to the Future 2  on LaserDisc.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    ...a seven year old Andrew was 
                    watching the  Making of  his fifth 
                    favorite movie when ---

      On the  Making of , Robert Zemeckis is interviewed.

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS (ON TV)
                      A hoverboard is a board that hovers 
                    on magnetic energy and it works 
                    just like a skateboard except it 
                    doesn t have any wheels. 

      Andrew is intrigued. Sits up straight.

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS (ON TV)
                    They ve been around for years it s 
                    just that parents groups have not 
                    let the manufacturers make them. 

      Andrew s eyes open wide.  

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS (ON TV)
                    But we got our hands on some and we 
                    put  em in the movie.

                                  ANDREW
                    What the fu ---                                                                                    19.



                                  PETE
                          (to Stu)
                    I tried to convince him that Mr. 
                    Spielberg was joking.

                                  ANDREW
                    It was Robert Zemeckis.

                                  STU
                     It was robbing the necklace? 

                                  PETE
                          (to Stu)
                    He s always been like this. He gets 
                    an idea in his head and there s no 
                    moving him off it, never mind 
                    there s no evidence to back it up. 

                                  ANDREW
                    I m right.

                                  STU
                    About Zelda s dress or hoverboards? 

                                  ANDREW
                    Both! And you know what? I ll prove 
                    it. 


      Zelda delicately lifts a contact lens to her eye when her 
      roommate STEPHIE (28) enters and blows a Vulvuzela soccer 
      horn which emits an EAR-SPLITTING WAIL. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Ahh!!

      Stephie drops the horn, shocked at how loud it was. FREEZE.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Stephie. Zelda s best friend. 

      - PHOTOS/VIDEO of Stephie and Zelda at USC Law.

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    They met at law school where 
                    Stephie had followed a now ex-
                    boyfriend even though she had no 
                    interest in being a lawyer. But 
                    that s Stephie.                                                                                     20.


      - VARIOUS MOMENTS of Stephie with boyfriends: She makes 
      teepees and home brews with a HIPSTER BOYFRIEND; She converts 
      to Christianity for a FILIPINO GUY; She becomes a champion 
      lumberjack (called a lumberjill) for her OUTDOORSY EX. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    This dedication to her various 
                      boyfriend s interests has yet to 
                    yield something permanent. But that 
                    hasn t stopped her from trying.


      Stephie and Zelda stand, surrounded by others.

                                    STEPHIE
                    Sorry about the horn. 

                                  ZELDA
                    So you met a soccer player last 
                    night?

                                    STEPHIE
                    How d you know?

                                  ZELDA
                    At least tell me he was cute so it 
                    was worth the loss of my hearing. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    Let s just say I wouldn t ---

                                  ZELDA
                            (interrupts)
                    Kick him out of bed. I get it. 
                    Soccer, kicking, and you ll get a 
                    penalty because you re gonna use 
                    your hands...                                                                                    21.


                                    STEPHIE
                    I was going to say that I wouldn t 
                    walk out on him if he told me that 
                    we were meant to be together.

      Zelda gives Stephie a look. DING! They step off the elevator, 
      walk down a hallway.

                                  ZELDA
                    It s not Andrew s fault. He doesn t 
                    know me. If he did he wouldn t have 
                    said what he did. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    But if you walk out before he can 
                    get to know you how can he get to 
                    know you? 

                                  ZELDA
                    I agree. It s a vicious circle. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    So then give him another chance!

                                  ZELDA
                    He s not my regular type anyway. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    Which is what? You with a Johnson?

                                  ZELDA
                    I love that you use the word 
                       Johnson . It s charming.

                                    STEPHIE
                    What if you re wrong? What if what 
                    you think you want isn t really 
                    what you need? 

      Zelda takes this in. They enter  Whalen & Kurtz  Law Firm. 
      Stephie takes her place at the reception desk.

                                    STEPHIE
                    Have a good day, Ms Vasco.

                                  ZELDA
                    Stop with that.

                                    STEPHIE
                    You re the one that finished law 
                    school. You earned it, Ms Vasco.                                                                                    22.



      Andrew and Stu warily approach the PROGRAMMING wing which has 
      a tiki bar, a large tree made of paper mache  and vintage 
      toys stacked everywhere. They pass under a sign that says: 
       Leave The Code Better Than You Found It .  

                                  STU
                          (to Andrew)
                    Stay close.


      Andrew and Stu talk with two programmers: MAK (24) and EMILY 
      (22). Mak is Japanese-American, wears a Hawaiian shirt with 
      smaller Hawaiian shirts on them. Emily dresses like  Emily 
      the Strange  and collects the memorabilia. 

                                  MAK
                    I don t understand what you re 
                    asking us. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Use your expertise, Mak. Dig into 
                    the long tail of the internet, find  
                    proof that Zelda was at that show 
                    in the silver dress. Then she ll 
                    have to admit we re meant to be 
                    together.  

                                  MAK
                    Don t women usually know what they 
                    wore to things?

                                  EMILY
                    I do.

      Stu gives Andrew a look.  See ?

                                  ANDREW
                    Listen, do you guys believe in The 
                    One?

                                  STU
                    Dude, these guys are programmers. 
                    They re all about logic and math. 
                    They re not gonna ---

                                  MAK
                    Oh, I totally believe in that. 

                                  EMILY
                    Me too.                                                                                    23.


      Now Andrew gives Stu a look.  See ?

                                  MAK
                    Of course if you believe in The One 
                    you must also accept that The 
                    Negative One exists. 

                                  ANDREW
                    The Negative One?

                                  EMILY
                    For every positive there is a 
                    negative. 

      Mak draws 1 and -1 on a window with a dry erase marker.

                                  EMILY
                    Think about it. You start dating 
                      someone... 

      Mak and Emily glance at each other while they talk. 

                                  MAK
                    For a while things are perfect. You 
                    go to ComicCon dressed as Nightwing 
                    and Starfire from Marv Wolfman s 
                    run on the New Teen Titans. 

                                  EMILY
                    You get their social security 
                    number tattooed in binary code on 
                    your inner thigh. 

      Stu raises an eyebrow.

                                  MAK
                    But then things change. Everything 
                    they do starts to drive you nuts. 

                                  EMILY
                    Like how they write on windows 
                    after they saw  The Social 
                    Network . It doesn t make you Mark 
                      Zuckerberg.

                                  MAK
                    Or how they point out ways that 
                    you re not Mark Zuckerberg. 

                                  EMILY
                    The person you thought was The One 
                    turns out to be the Negative One. 

      Andrew takes this in. Not sure what to think.                                                                                    24.

                          (to Andrew)
                    Dude, don t do this. You re 
                    tempting fate. It s gonna blow up 
                    in your face. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Mak? Emily? How long will it take?

                                  MAK
                    Well, we re pretty busy trying to 
                    fix this bug that sets up straight 
                    women together. 

                                  EMILY
                    Give us forty-eight hours.


      Zelda works at her desk. Her intercom BUZZES.  

                                    STEPHIE (OVER INTERCOM)
                    Some flowers just arrived for you.

      Zelda perks up. 


      Zelda enters, a spring in her step. Stephie hands her the 
      flowers - they re an edible arrangement. Zelda checks the 
      card, reacts with surprise.


      Toni (Zelda s  Crush  date) folds shirts while on the phone.

                                  TONI
                    You got the flowers. Aren t those 
                    cool? You can eat them!

      INTERCUT with Zelda at her office, on the phone.

                                  ZELDA
                    Who is this?

                                  TONI
                    Toni! 
                          (off Zelda s silence)
                    Your date from  Crush ?

                                  ZELDA
                    I don t understand. Why did you 
                    send these to me?                                                                                    25.


                                  TONI
                    Well, last night I was sitting 
                    alone at Big Wangs. I d been stood 
                    up by another internet date - this 
                    one scammed me into helping him buy 
                    work boots for his mining operation 
                    in Ghana -- when I suddenly 
                    realized: Zelda!     

                                  ZELDA
                    I still don t understand. 

                                  TONI
                    Two straight women accidentally 
                    paired by a dating site? And 
                      coincidentally neither one of them 
                    can find love? Does this sound like 
                    the plot of a Hollywood movie?

                                  ZELDA
                    No. 

                                  TONI
                    You and me! A couple!

                                  ZELDA
                    Toni, I m not attracted to women.

                                  TONI
                    Neither am I. But we don t need sex 
                    to be in a relationship. My parents 
                    pulled that off for years. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Toni, I m flattered. But ---

                                  TONI
                    Can t you see? This is destiny. 

      Zelda can t believe it. This shit again?

                                  TONI
                    We were paired up for a reason. 

                                  ZELDA
                    No we weren t! 

      Heads turn in Zelda s office. She lowers her voice.

                                  ZELDA
                    I m sorry, I didn t mean to yell. 
                    Toni, things just happen. They 
                    don t  mean  anything.                                                                                     26.


                                  TONI
                    Oh, so when Brad Pitt tore his 
                    Achilles playing Achilles in the 
                    movie Troy? That just  happened ? 
                    That was just a coincidence? 

                                  ZELDA
                    Yes. Wait, is that true?  

                                  TONI
                    It s that guy, isn t it? The one 
                    you ve been hanging around with?

                                  ZELDA
                    Andrew?

                                  TONI
                    You re in love with him. I could 
                    tell. 

                                  ZELDA
                    When did you see us together?

      Toni says nothing.

                                  ZELDA
                    Toni, were you following me? 

      - MEMORY HITS of many scenes we ve seen so far, except that 
      now we PAN, RACK FOCUS and READJUST our view to reveal Toni 
      spying on Zelda.  

                                  TONI
                    Uh, I gotta go. Something s on 
                    fire. Fire at Wet Seal! 

      Toni hangs up. 


      Zelda is in line at the cashier. Lost in thought. Andrew and 
      Stu enter the line behind them. Andrew notices Zelda first.

                                  ANDREW
                    Zelda. 

                                  ZELDA
                          (sees him)
                    Hi. How re --- How s it going?

                                  ANDREW
                    Fine. 

      An awkward beat.                                                                                    27.


                                  ZELDA
                    It s funny that we never saw each 
                    other before. And now ---

                                  ANDREW
                    Now we see each other all the time.

                                  ZELDA
                    Yeah. It s like Baader-Meinhoff.

                                  ANDREW
                    Exactly.

                                  STU
                    What s that?

                                  ANDREW
                    The phenomenon when you learn about 
                    something for the first time and 
                    then suddenly you hear about it 
                      everywhere.

      An even more awkward beat.

                                  ZELDA
                    So, uh... What are you working on?

      She refers to an OVERFLOWING FILE under Andrew s arm. 

                                  ANDREW
                    This? It s a proposal ---

      He opens the file. Inside are press clippings about  Crush  
      from its origins. We maybe see a glimpse of its founder, 
      JULIET MADDOX (who will turn out to be our NARRATOR).

                                  ANDREW
                    --- to revamp the matchmaking side 
                    of the company. None of these sites 
                    has the formula for love. The best 
                    we can promise now is  Not Hate . 
                    But what if we re just not there 
                    yet? I dunno. Nobody asked me to do 
                    this. It s probably a waste of 
                    time.

                                  ZELDA
                    No. It s sounds great. Keep going.

                                  ANDREW
                    You actually inspired me to do it. 

                                  ZELDA
                    I did?                                                                                    28.


                                  ANDREW
                    When we were on our date. You were 
                    so passionate about your job. I 
                    realized I didn t feel that way 
                    about what I did. It kind of made 
                    me rethink things. 

      Zelda takes this in, touched. 

                                  MAK (O.S.)
                    Andrew. 

      Mak and Emily walk up to Andrew.

                                  EMILY
                    We ve been looking for you. 

                                  MAK
                    We got it. 

                                  ANDREW
                          (excited)
                    You did? 

                                  ZELDA
                    Got what?

                                  MAK
                          (to Andrew)
                    It was easy. First we got a 
                    complete list of everyone who went 
                    to see that band. I have a friend 
                    at the NSA.

      Emily elbows Mak.

                                  MAK
                    I mean Ticketmaster. Then we just 
                    combed through their Instagram 
                    photos ---

                                  EMILY
                    --- Un-snapped some Snapchats ---

                                  MAK
                    --- And boom. There she was. Took 
                    us a while to find her but once we 
                    did we saw her all over. 

                                  EMILY
                    It was a Baader Meinhoff situation.

                                  STU
                    Hey, I just learned--- Whoa.                                                                                    29.


                                  ANDREW
                          (excited)
                    So you found pictures of her?

                                  ZELDA
                    Of who?

                                  EMILY
                          (to Zelda)
                    Hey. You re her.

      Emily produces a bunch of printed photos. Andrew grabs them, 
      eager.

                                  ZELDA
                          (to Andrew)
                    You had these lunatics dig around 
                    the internet for pictures of me?

                                  ANDREW
                    No, I... You told me that you can 
                    find evidence that proves anything. 
                    That s all I was doing. Finding 
                    proof that you were wearing the 
                    silver dress so that ---
                          (eyes the photo)
                    You re not wearing the dress. 

      His face falls.

                                  MAK
                          (to Andrew)
                    And it s the second night.

                                  ANDREW
                    What??

                                  MAK
                    There were two shows that weekend.
                    You went to the first. These are 
                    from the second show.

                                  ANDREW
                            (devastated)
                    We weren t even there the same 
                    night?

                                  ZELDA
                    What s with everyone violating my 
                      Constitutional right to privacy 
                    these days?

      Stephie arrives with her lunch tray.                                                                                     30.

                      Stephanie. 

                                  MAK
                     Jake? 

                                    STEPHIE
                    I thought you were in Montreal for 
                    Semis. What are you doing here?

      Andrew, Mak and Zelda eye Stu, expectantly.

      TIME CUT - Stu is covered in Diet Coke. Zelda and Stephie can  
      be seen walking away. 

                                  EMILY
                    You told her you were a pro soccer 
                    player?

                                  STU
                    Nobody knows what those guys look 
                    like. I can t believe it. I met her 
                    at a party in Manhattan Beach. What 
                    are the odds she d not only work 
                    here but be Zelda s best friend?

                                  MAK
                    Ten million to one. 

                                  STU
                    Boy this destiny stuff cuts both 
                    ways, huh? 

      Off Andrew ---

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    31.


                                      ACT THREE


      Andrew drives home.  My Heart Will Go On  comes on the radio. 
      He turns the radio off. Then he sees something outside --- 
      The Aero Theater. The marquee:  THE BACK TO THE FUTURE 
      TRILOGY - Q&A with Director Robert Zemeckis . 

      Andrew immediately pulls over.


      Andrew is in the standing room only section along the side. 
      ROBERT ZEMECKIS sits on stage next to a MODERATOR.

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS
                    ...and if you spell  Time Portal  
                    backwards phonetically it s  Emmett 
                    Lathrop  which are Doc Brown s 
                    first and middle names.

                                  MODERATOR
                      Fascinating. We have time for one 
                    more question... 
                          (to Andrew)
                    You.

                                  ANDREW
                    Yes, uh... Mr. Zemeckis. The 
                      hoverboards in Back to the Future 
                    Two. Those are real, right?

      The audience laughs, thinking he s joking. Andrew realizes 
      this, backpedals.

                                  MODERATOR
                    What s your actual question?

      LOBBY - AERO THEATER - LATER

      Andrew pushes through the crowd toward the door. Robert 
      Zemeckis appears behind him.

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS
                    Hey.

      Andrew looks around. Is he talking to him??

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS
                    I know you weren t kidding back 
                    there. I get that hoverboard 
                    question all the time. Thousands of 
                    kids fell for that.                                                                                     32.


                                  ANDREW
                    Oh. So then ---

                                  ROBERT ZEMECKIS
                    Yeah. Sorry.

      Andrew takes this in. He looks like he s going to cry. 
      Zemeckis backs away, uncomfortable.


      Zelda sits on the couch as Stephie crosses back and forth 
      behind her in a rage, trashing all her soccer stuff. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    We sure dodged a bullet with those 
                    two freaks. I should have known he 
                    was lying when I asked what his 
                    team was and he said  The One 
                    Beckham was on . 

      Stephie snaps the Vulvuzela horn in half. 

                                    STEPHIE
                    And Andrew? That bull about the 
                    dress? No way. He was looking for 
                    nude selfies of you. We ve all 
                    posted them.   

      Zelda suddenly jumps up and runs from the room.

                                    STEPHIE
                    Zel?


      Zelda opens the garage door, floods light onto neatly 
      organized and labeled CONTAINER STORE BOXES and Martha 
      Stewart canvas GARMENT BAGS. Zelda walks right to one of the 
      hanging bags - the third one from the right - unzips it and 
      pushes clothes aside to reveal ---

      --- a SILVER DRESS. Zelda eyes it. 


      Zelda is buried in work. She looks up, does a double take 
      when she sees Andrew working at his desk across the way. 
      Zelda picks up her phone, dials. She watches Andrew look at 
      his phone. He hesitates, then answers. We INTERCUT:                                                                                    33.


                                  ANDREW
                    Hello?

                                  ZELDA 
                    Working late?

      Andrew turns, sees her. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Me too. Getting ready for a 
                    hearing. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Oh.

                                  ZELDA
                    Yeah. Some developer is trying to 
                    force my eighty-five year old 
                    client out of her home so he can 
                    build a steakhouse. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Geez.

                                  ZELDA
                    Right? Sounds like the plot of a 
                    Muppet movie. Hey, look. Since 
                    we re both here, both working 
                    late... You wanna grab a drink?

                                  ANDREW
                    You want to get a drink with me? 

                                  ZELDA
                    Yeah. 

                                  ANDREW
                    Why?

                                  ZELDA
                    I don t know. I just thought ---

                                  ANDREW
                    You need to stay away from me. I ve 
                    got problems. Like crazy person 
                    problems. I must have wanted it to 
                    be you in the silver dress so badly 
                    that I actually created a false 
                    memory of it happening. 

                                  ZELDA
                    Don t be so hard on yourself. I 
                    mean, what if you didn t?                                                                                    34.


                                  ANDREW
                    What if I didn t what?

                                  ZELDA
                    Create a false memory. What if it, 
                    I don t know, was me in the dress?

                                  ANDREW
                    But it wasn t.

                                  ZELDA
                    But what if it was?

                                  ANDREW
                    What are you saying?

                                  ZELDA
                          (in one breath)
                    I m saying it was me in the dress 
                    I m so sorry for not telling you 
                    I m a terrible person.

      Andrew tries to process this, can t seem to.

                                  ANDREW
                    But you were at the second show.

                                  ZELDA
                    Because I went back hoping you d be 
                    there. I was at the first show too. 
                    When you mentioned it on our date I 
                      remembered it instantly.

      - A MEMORY HIT of the show two years ago. Andrew and Zelda, 
      through the darkness and stage lights, fog and crowd, seeing 
      each other. The song they both hate, which is undeniably 
      catchy, rises.  Hey! HEY! HEY!!  

                                  ANDREW
                          (realizes)
                    It was you? 

                                  ZELDA
                    Did I mention I m a terrible 
                    person?

                                  ANDREW
                    I don t understand. Why didn t you 
                    tell me?

                                  ZELDA
                    I was going to. But ---                                                                                    35.


                                  ANDREW
                    But then I scared you off. 

                                  ZELDA
                    No! I scared myself off. I didn t 
                    want to admit that it happened 
                    because then I d have to admit that 
                    I d been wrong about a lot of 
                    things in my life. But I don t 
                    know. Maybe I overreacted. Maybe I 
                    could use some  meant to be  in my 
                    life. Just a little. I want to try 
                    this again. Will you give me a 
                    chance?
                          (beat)
                    Andrew?

      ON ZELDA. She hears nothing on the line. She realizes he s 
      hung up. She turns to the window. His light is off. He s 
      gone. She puts her phone down. Not surprised but 
      disappointed. That s about right.

      MOMENTS LATER - Zelda slowly collects her things, pulls a 
      jacket on, leaves.


      Zelda stands alone. Wipes away a tear. The doors open to the 
      lobby, revealing Andrew. Zelda hesitates, then steps off. She 
      drops her bag. They kiss. Then, off balance, Zelda pulls him 
      back into the elevator. As the doors close:

                                  ANDREW
                    I knew you were ---

                                  ZELDA
                    Don t start.


      Andrew sits at the bar, in the same seat where he sat in his 
      initial date with Zelda. Speaking of, she enters the bar and 
      Andrew turns in time to see her take off a coat, revealing 
      the silver dress underneath. She approaches. He s speechless.

                                  ZELDA
                    I m glad you like it because I ve 
                    gone up a size since I last wore it 
                    and now I don t think I ll ever get 
                    it off.

                                  ANDREW
                    I could help with that.                                                                                    36.


                                  ZELDA
                    Easy now.

                                  TONI (O.S.)
                    Zelda.

      They turn, see Toni standing there holding a guitar.  

                                  ZELDA
                    Oh no.

                                  TONI 
                    This is for you. 

      Toni plays a song. Andrew and Zelda recognize it. It s the 
      same song that was playing the moment they locked eyes at the 
      concert and the same song at this bar before. The song they 
      both can t stand from the band neither of them likes. They 
      give each other a look, can t believe it. 

                                  TONI
                          (sings)
                     Hey!  

      People in the bar have stopped to watch. They like it. Clap 
      and sing along.

                                  GUY AT BAR
                    I love this song!


      A large kitchen. A WHIRRING sound O.S. Then Robert Zemeckis 
      enters on a hoverboard. He hovers over to the fridge, opens 
      it, grabs a Pepsi and hovers out of the room.
