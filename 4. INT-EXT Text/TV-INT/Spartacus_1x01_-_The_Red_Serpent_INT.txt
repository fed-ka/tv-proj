  heard over each other.

  EPTENOS,

  a hulking elder with piercing blue eyes and a great white 
  beard, shouts them down.

                        Hold your fucking tongues! Let the 
                        Roman have his say!

  The men reluctantly quiet down, turning their eyes towards 
  the front of the hall where

  CLAUDIUS GLABER

  stands with his TRIBUNE and a handful of ROMAN SOLDIERS. 
  Glaber, 40, handsome with the keen eyes of an ambitious man, 
  is the LEGATUS (regional commander) of the Roman Army.

                                        GLABER
                        Thrace and the Republic have known 
                        their differences. We have not 
                        always been as brothers. Let us put 
                        such matters aside, uniting in just 
                        cause.

                                          EPTENOS
                        You pushed your way into our lands, 
                        and now you stand asking for our 
                        help, your hand extended?

  The men bellow in agreement. The Thracian remains silent, 
  studying Glaber. Gauging the man.

                                        GLABER
                        I extend no hand. I am here merely 
                      to inform. Mithridates and his 
                        Greeks attack from the east, 
                        encroaching from the Black Sea --

                                          EPTENOS
                        Far removed from our villages.

                                        GLABER
                        True. But the Getae take advantage 
                      of the distraction. Their barbarian 
                        hordes amass to the north. Barely 
                        half a week's march from your 
                        villages.

  The Thracians grumble, exchanging concerned looks.

                                          EPTENOS
                        How many?

  An uproar. Glaber shouts over the din.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Align yourselves with Rome! Pledge 
                        your service to the auxiliary and 
                        join us in our campaign!

                                  heard)
                      TO WHAT END?!

  The men murmur, nodding at the question. Glaber surveys them 
    confidently.

                                        GLABER
                        Victory.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        And how is it to be measured? The 
                        Getae have raided our villages in 
                        the past. Killed our children. 
                        Raped our women. Each time we have 
                        pushed them back. Only to see them 
                        return.

                                          EPTENOS
                                to Glaber)(
                      He speaks out of turn. Yet the 
                        truth falls from his mouth.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      If we align ourselves with Rome, 
                        the purpose must be clear. The 
                        Getae dead. All of them.

  He locks eyes with Glaber. A tense beat. Glaber nods.

                                        GLABER
                        Dead. All of them.

  The men roar their approval. OFF The Thracian, standing 
  proud among his people...

  She nods, the news hitting her hard. She pushes aside her 
  concern, rises with the sword in her hand.

                        enemies.

  She hands it to him. He slips it into a sheath crisscrossed 
  with an ornate PURPLE BINDING.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Once the Getae are wiped from our 
                        lands, there will be no reason to 
                        ever pick it up again.

  Sura laughs at the thought.

  She slips out of her dress (nudity only hinted at here) and 
  smiles warmly. The Thracian returns it, his eyes shining 
  with love. OFF the moment...



  The command tent is richly appointed with expensive fabrics, 
  divans, pillows, and an intricately carved DESK littered 
  with maps and troop markers. GLABER ENTERS,

  tosses his cloak aside as he crosses to the desk. He eyes 
  the maps with concern, the campaign weighing on him.

  A CLOAKED FIGURE

  dusted with snow disengages from the shadows, creeping up 
  behind him. He senses it at the last moment, whirls as the 
  figure rushes forward -- and kisses him. The Figure laughs, 
  pulling down the hood to reveal

  ILITHYIA,

  Glaber's young wife. Early 20s, beautiful, with a body built 
  for mischief. Rich. Privileged. Spoiled. Glaber is less than 
  pleased.

                        period of mourning before I could 
                        remarry?

  She presses in close, kissing him. He can't help but 
  respond.

                        If.

  Glaber's eyes fall to the map, his mood darkening. Ilithyia 
  laughs, breaking the tension.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                      So serious! Bad for the humors. 
                        Come. You haven't tasted your gift 
                        yet.

  Glaber eyes his cup, confused. Ilithyia giggles.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        That isn't your gift...

  She opens her cloak, revealing her perfect, naked body 
  underneath. Glaber's pulse quickens at the sight. He kisses 
  her, slowly dropping to his knees OUT OF FRAME.

  ILITHYIA GASP-GIGGLES,

  her hand shooting out to the table to steady herself. TROOP 
  MARKERS tumble across

  THE MAP

  as we DIVE INTO IT, the two-dimensional terrain MORPHING 
  into an AERIAL SHOT of --



  Glaber eyes his war map in surprise.

                        West?

  He glances up across the table at The Thracian and Drenis, 
  the Tribune lurking in the background. The Thracian 
  indicates positions on the map.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        They break for the mountain pass, 
                        here. It will take them four days 
                      at the most to reach the villages 
                        below. Food. Supplies. Women... All 
                        unprotected.

  And his wife. Glaber considers the map.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        It's a simple thing to be turned in 
                        the mountains at night. Perhaps I 
                        should send a Roman to properly 
                        assess the situation.

                        Send the gods themselves. They'll

  Glaber locks eyes with him.

                        Dismissed.

                      If we march by midday we can easily

                        Dismissed.

  The Thracian clenches his jaw before a whipping offense 
  spills from his mouth. The Tribune escorts him and Drenis 
  out. A moment later

  ILITHYIA APPEARS

  from behind a partition.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The barbarians head west.

                                        GLABER
                      So it appears.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Further yet from Mithridates and 
                        the Greeks. And the glory you 
                        deserve.

  Glaber stares at the map, a man pressed by duty. Haunted by 
  ambition. He comes to a decision, begins sliding troop 
  markers on the map.

                                        GLABER
                        Return to Capua.

  She eyes him for a moment, not used to such abrupt 
  treatment.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        And my father? How will he measure 
                        the man he blessed with his 
                        daughter?

  Glaber pauses, turning the question.

                                        GLABER
                        A colossus, towering above the 
                        enemies of Rome.

  He slides a large CAVALRY MARKER east across the map, WIPING 
  US TO --



  Dark and dank. The wooden hull CREAKS as the ship pitches 
  along its course. The Thracian's eyes suddenly SNAP OPEN. He 
  blinks, his head swimming.

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                        Good of you to join us.

  The Thracian glances over to find DRENIS,

  battered and bloody, grinning at him. Byzo and three other 
  men from the THRACIAN AUXILIARY are with him, all in equal 
  condition. All crammed into a cage in the cargo hold.

                                        DRENIS
                        Thought you were dead there for a 
                        while.

                                        BYZO
                        Smells dead. Stupid fuck.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

  The Thracian tries to rise, groans, his head pounding.

                                        DRENIS
                        Easy. You've been out for days.

  Drenis helps him sit. The Thracian takes in his 
    surroundings.

                                        THE THRACIAN

                                        DRENIS
                        Upon the Adriatic. Bound for Capua.

                                        BYZO
                        And death. Because of you.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Sura...

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        The Romans took her.

  Drenis frowns, knowing what that will mean.

                                        DRENIS
                        Best to forget her then.

  The Thracian shakes him off, eyes blazing.

                                          DRENIS(cont'd)

                        You know what they'll do to her.

  The fire drains from The Thracian. He looks at the other 
  men, beaten and bloody, knowing the fate he's condemned his 
  wife to will be infinitely worse.

  The harsh sun scorches Ilithyia, Glaber's wife, as she 
  stands on the balcony, lost in thought. A breeze stirs her 
  hair. She closes her eyes, hoping it will cool the sweat 
  staining her face. A beat.

  A HAND APPEARS

  into FRAME, reaching out to touch her cheek. As it makes 
  contact she jolts back, her eyes crashing open to find

  GLABER

  now standing beside her. He smiles playfully.

                                        GLABER
                        What if I'd been an assassin?

  Ilithyia flings herself at him. She finds his mouth, devours 
  it.

                        Father's in town. He'll be back

                        How shortly?

  His hand slips down to explore just how excited she is to 
  see him. She giggles, slipping from his grasp.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        He's not very happy with you.

  Her face slips into concern. And disappointment.

                        crowd, and the senate will beg to

  A COMMOTION ERUPTS from inside the villa. The angry voice of 
  SENATOR ALBINIUS, barely discernible, rumbles like distant 
  thunder.
