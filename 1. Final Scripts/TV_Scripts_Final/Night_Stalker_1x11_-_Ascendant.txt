    THE NIGHT SKY (STOCK)

      STARS shine like jewels strewn across the blackness of space. 

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    For centuries, people looked up at
                    the night sky in awe. 

      CLOSE ON TELESCOPIC IMAGES OF THE PLANETS (STOCK)

      Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars.  Their names taken from ancient 
      gods.  Suggesting their power.  And mystery. 

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Believing the planets, stars and
                    moons were not merely distant
                    lights shining in the firmament... 

      CLOSE ON THE FULL MOON (STOCK)

    Its alien landscape glowing in the light of the night sun.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    ... but rather the eternal source 
                    of order in the universe.

    We DISSOLVE TO this same MOON HANGING OVER:

1 EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT (STOCK FROM PILOT) 1

    The towers of downtown glittering in the night. 

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    That if we could hear the music of 
                    the spheres, we could act in
                    accordance with that order.  Rather 
                    than struggle uselessly against it. 

2 EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 2

      We re LOW ANGLE on the deck of the parking lot, staring up at
    the modern store.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Nowadays, the lights of the city
                    outshine those in the heavens...

      SECURITY LIGHTS buzz overhead.  It s mostly empty at this
      late hour, only a dozen or so cars in the lot, as --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  2.

      A GRAY LUXURY SUV

      Breaks frame, coming to a stop near the front. 

      CLOSER - LEWIS PARKS

      Steps out of the vehicle.  In his 40s, balding and heavyset,
      he s dressed casually for a late-night errand.  He absently
      clicks his KEY FOB on his way in.

      HEADLIGHTS flash, LOCKS engage. Ka-chunk.

3 INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 3

    In CUTS:  TABLOID MAGAZINES (the Daily Star) neatly arrayed.
      Waxy VEGETABLES and FRUIT, set in perfect stacks.  Warholian 
      rows of CANNED GOODS.  The geometry of modern consumerism.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    ... and the only stars most of us
                    watch are the kind in magazines. 

      TRACKING WITH LEWIS, as he wheels his shopping cart, stopping
    to pick out ice cream in the freezer section.  We RACK TO:

      Another customer, STEVEN TEAGUE, pushing his cart in the
      other direction. 

      Steven and Lewis don t notice each other, and it s OK if we 
      don t notice they bear a STRIKING RESEMBLANCE:  Steven s also 
      40s, balding, heavyset, and casually dressed.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    But a silent truth remains... 

      ANGLE - THE CHECKOUT STAND

      Steven puts his few items on the conveyor, among them, an
      issue of the Daily Star.  The MANAGER rings him up, Steven
      standing idly by, glancing at... 

      A multi-colored DISPLAY of horoscope scrolls, rolled inside 
      little plastic tubes.  Steven studies the  Capricorn  tube,
      then tosses it on the conveyor, too.  An impulse buy.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    That we are connected to the 
                    infinite.  And that we ignore that
                      connection... at our danger.

    The Manager s done scanning his items.  To Steven:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  3.

                                  MANAGER
                    Club card?

      Steven forgot.

                                  STEVEN
                    Ah, right...

      Steven digs in his wallet, SLIDES it through the card reader. 

      CLOSE - REGISTER SCREEN:  Below the list of items, a NUMBER
      appears: 60118934.  Steven s savings toted for belonging to
    the market s  club. 

    And now we feature GEORGE CAWLEY, late 30s, who s been 
      bagging Steven s items up to now.

    We may sense he has the distant manner of an abled autistic.
      A person who lives inside his own head, rarely touching or
      looking at other people.

    But now George looks from the register to Steven, thinking.

                                  MANAGER
                          (to Steven)
                    That s $27.42.

      While Steven swipes his CREDIT CARD:

                                  GEORGE
                          (pointedly, to Steven)
                    Plastic.

                                  STEVEN
                          (not looking up)
                    Paper.

    But George isn t bagging his items anymore.  He s staring in
      Steven s direction.  Something disturbing him.  Repeating:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.

                                  STEVEN
                          (good natured)
                    No...  Paper.  Please.

      George still looks toward Steven.  The Manager taking notice.

                                  MANAGER
                    He said paper, George.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  4.

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.

      George has a deeply troubled look on his face.  The Manager
      hands Steven his receipt to sign, reaches for a paper bag
      himself. 

                                  MANAGER
                          (to Steven, apologetic)
                    He s a little... slow.

                                  GEORGE
                          (insistent)
                    Plastic...  Gray...  Whale.

      Steven looks uncomfortable.  Doesn t know what to say to this
      intense, but seemingly nonsensical, remark.  Then, repeating
      each word as a distinctly separate thought:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.  Gray.  Whale.

    The Manager finishes bagging Steven s purchase, which he
      takes with some relief. 

                                  STEVEN
                    Thanks.

    But before he can go, George stops him.  Speaking with deep,
      heart-rending meaning.

                                  GEORGE
                    You re... going to... die.

      George GRIPS Steven s shirt.  The Manager steps forward,
      pulling George away, shushing him as if he were a dog.

                                  MANAGER
                    George!
                          (to Steven)
                    He doesn t mean it, sir.  He 
                    doesn t know what he s saying.

      Steven, disturbed nonetheless, swallows.  Tries to rally an
      understanding attitude.

                                  STEVEN
                    Right.

    He takes his bag, heading off.  The Manager s eyes scold
      George, who looks down, terribly worried.       NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  5.



4 EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 4

      Steven walks outside, his mind still on this strange
      incident.  He pulls a KEY FOB from his pocket and aims it at
    the gray luxury SUV we saw before.

    We hear the familiar BEEP BEEP of an alarm disengaging, but
      when he tries the handle, the car is STILL LOCKED.  Confused, 
    he presses the fob again. 

    In the next row over, ANOTHER CAR FLASHES its HIGH BEAMS.  
      Steven looks over, realizing he s at the wrong car. 

    He sighs and shakes his head at his mistake, about to go to
    his own gray luxury SUV, when - 

      REFLECTED IN THE GLASS, a FIGURE rises over Steven s 
      shoulder, CLOSE BEHIND HIM.  He sees this, starts to turn, 
      when - 

      A PLASTIC BAG is LOOPED OVER HIS HEAD and PULLED TIGHT 
      AGAINST HIS NECK. 

    In TIGHTLY FRAMED CUTS, we see: Steven s HANDS go to his 
      throat, struggling.  His BAG falls to the ground, groceries 
      tumbling out.  Steven s FEET kick, as he fights for his life.  
      GLOVED HANDS pull tighter on the improvised garrote.

    We get WIDER GLIMPSES of the violence in reflective surfaces:
    the side view mirror, the shiny dark hood of the car.  Until:

      With one final spasm, Steven whacks the driver s side door.
    The CAR ALARM explodes in the night as...

    The Figure hurriedly exits, Steven s INERT BODY collapsing on 
    the ground. 

      CLOSE - THE LITTLE HOROSCOPE TUBE rolls to a stop big in 
      frame, unopened.

5 EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 5

    An n.d. FLEET SEDAN pulls to a stop outside the parking lot, 
      PERRI REED and JAIN McMANUS exiting, mid-conversation.  As 
      they walk:

                                  MCMANUS
                    And he didn t tell you what the
                    story was?

                                  REED
                    He said it was a homicide.  A man 
                    strangled here last night.

                                  MCMANUS
                    I know that s the story.  I m 
                    saying what s the story? 

      Reed smiles.

                                  REED
                    You mean Kolchak s story?

                                  MCMANUS
                    It can t just be simple homicide if
                    he s interested.  There s got to be
                    something... weird about it.

                                  REED
                    That s what makes life interesting,
                    isn t it?  The finding out.

    As they exit PAST CAMERA:

      ANGLE - CARL KOLCHAK 

      RISES into frame, studying last night s gray luxury SUV from 
      outside a line of yellow POLICE TAPE. 

    The crime scene has been thoroughly investigated, only a
      FORENSICS EXPERT, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER, and a couple
      UNIFORMED COPS left at this hour.  As Reed and McManus 
      approach from behind:

                                  REED
                    Good morning, Carl.

      Kolchak turns, pleasant, but his mind clearly working.
      Focused on the mystery that he s discovered here.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  7.

                    Morning.

                                  MCMANUS
                    What do you have?

      Kolchak s walking around the perimeter of the police tape,
      observing.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know.

                          (disappointed)
                    You don t know?

      Reed consults her reporter s note pad.

                                  REED
                    The police wire said this man,
                    Steven Teague, 42, was strangled
                    with a plastic grocery bag.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Outside another shopper s car.  No 
                    witnesses, no security camera, no
                    motive.  Not yet anyway.

                                  MCMANUS
                          (hopeful)
                    There s got to be something...
                    weird about it.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Oh, there s something weird
                    alright.   Plastic gray whale. 

      McManus looks to Reed.  Confused by this.

                                  REED
                    Plastic gray whale?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    According to the police, a bag boy,
                    George Cawley, told the victim he 
                    was going to die.  Only moments
                    later, he did.

                                  REED
                    He was threatening him...?

                    Those are words he said to the 
                    victim before he told him he d die.

                                  REED
                    What do they have to do with
                    anything?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m not sure.  But...

      McManus smiles to Reed, getting excited.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We know the victim was strangled
                    with a plastic bag.   Plastic. 
                          (indicates car)
                    And the car where he was attacked. 
                    Its color...

                                  MCMANUS
                          (with growing interest)
                    Gray...

      Reed smiles, enjoying the game, but not really convinced.

                                  REED
                    So where s the  whale? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Check out the license plate.

      Reed and McManus turn.  The plate bears the frame,  I got a
      WHALE of a deal at OCEAN WAY MOTORS,  with a WHALE logo. 

                                  MCMANUS
                          (impressed, excited)
                    Plastic... gray... whale. Weird.

      Kolchak looks to Reed.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  9.

                                  REED
                    Maybe you re right... But how could
                    this bag boy have known?  And why
                    give the victim such obscure clues? 

      Kolchak sees Detective STEVEN TAN exiting the store, walking
    to his squad car.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know. 
                          (to the Detective)
                    Detective Tan.

    Tan sighs.  His wariness suggesting he s familiar with
      Kolchak, his strange questions.  Doesn t like him.  At all. 
    He keeps walking, forcing them to follow.

                                  TAN
                    Mr. Kolchak... 
                          (nothing against her)
                    Perri.  Been awhile.

                                  REED
                    Detective.

                                  KOLCHAK 
                    Are you done questioning the bag
                    boy, George Cawley?

                                  TAN
                    You could say that, yes.

                                  REED
                    Do you consider him a suspect?

                                  TAN
                    No, I can t say we do.

      Tan s practically smiling to himself as he says this.  Some 
      kind of hidden meaning behind his few words.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How do you explain his telling the
                    victim he was going to die? 

                                  MCMANUS
                    And  plastic gray whale? 

    Tan stops, regards them.  A cat-swallowed-the-canary gleam in
    his eye.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  10.

                                  TAN
                    Why don t you go in and ask him
                    yourself? 

    Off Reed, wondering at the Detective s attitude:

6 CLOSE ON - NUMBERS 6

      Drawn in a perfect script inside the printed boxes of a TIME 
      CARD. Writing hours worked beside time stamps with precision
    and care, TOTALING HIS PAY for the week.  We are:

      INT. SUPERMARKET - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

      Kolchak, Reed and McManus enter to find George sitting at a
      table, filling out his time card. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George Cawley?

      George pointedly avoids eye contact.

                                  REED
                    I m Perri Reed, this is Carl 
                    Kolchak and Jain McManus.  We re 
                    from the Los Angeles Beacon.

                                  GEORGE
                    Punch out.

                                  REED
                    Excuse me?

    He rises, taking his time card to a PUNCH CLOCK.  Ka-chunk. 
      Still without making eye contact:

                                  GEORGE
                    Punch out.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We d like to ask you a few
                    questions, Mr. Cawley.

                                  GEORGE
                    OK.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You told the victim last night,
                    Steven Teague, he was going to die.

      George looks up, as though reading something imprinted on the
    air above their heads.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  11.

      Kolchak exchanges a look with Reed and McManus.  This is odd.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How did you know he was going to
                    die?

                                  MCMANUS
                    And  plastic gray whale ...?

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic gray whale.  60118934.

      Another beat.  It s become increasingly obvious to them what
      Detective Tan neglected to mention:  George is autistic. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (writing this down)
                    6, 0, 1, 1 - 

                                  GEORGE

                    whale. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                     Gray whale  meant the car, didn t
                    it, George? And  plastic  - 

                                  GEORGE
                    -- 60118934.  Plastic gray whale.

      George goes to his locker, takes out a windbreaker.  Getting
      ready to leave.  Reed looks to Kolchak, who s obviously
      getting nowhere.  She decides to try another tack.

    As she approaches George s locker, she notices a PHOTOGRAPH,
      circa 1970, of a loving COUPLE.  It s clipped inside the
      locker.  She speaks kindly but without condescension.

                                  REED
                    I like your picture, George.  Do 
                    you mind if I call you George? 

                                  GEORGE
                    George.  OK.

                                  REED
                    Who are they?

      George looks down, thinking for a beat.  Then:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  12.

                                  GEORGE
                    They re waiting.

    He says it with heartfelt simplicity, then tucks the photo
      inside his jacket.  Reed wonders at his meaning. 

                                  ERIK (O.S.)
                    Who are you?

      Kolchak, Reed and McManus turn to see ERIK CAWLEY, 30s.  
      Solidly built, Erik has a blue-collar toughness about him. A 
    man whose youth was spent burdened with responsibilities.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Carl Kolchak.  I m a reporter.  You 
                    are -- ?

                                  ERIK
                    Erik Cawley, George s brother.  
                    He s got nothing to say to you.
                          (to his brother)
                    C mon, George.

      George slams his locker shut, obeying.

                                  REED
                    You heard what happened here last
                    night?

                                  ERIK
                    I heard.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If we could just ask - 

      Erik lets the door close behind him and George before Kolchak
    can finish.  McManus looks to the others.

                                  MCMANUS
                    I saw that one coming.

7 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY 7

      CLOSE ON the back of a figure, walking.  We hear a CELL PHONE 
      RINGING.  A gloved hand reaches into a pocket, withdrawing
    the phone, bringing it to his ear.








                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  13.

                    Yeah.

8INT. PARKS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY 8

      CHERYL PARKS, late 30s, paces as she walks, talking in a low,
      insistent whisper.  Her eyes locked on something o.s. 

                                  CHERYL
                    You made a mistake. 

      WIDER to see LEWIS, the shopper from the Teaser.  He s 
      watching the game on TV.

                                  LEWIS
                          (shouting at TV)
                    Aw... Idiots!  Come on!

    The Gloved Man s eyes betray nothing. 

                                  CHERYL 
                          (through the phone)
                    Are you listening to me? 

    The Gloved Man s voice is even.  Impassive. 

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    You shouldn t be calling me.

      Lewis gets up, heading toward the kitchen.  Cheryl hurries to
      finish her call.

                                  CHERYL
                    Just meet me.  The same place.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    Yeah.

    He hangs up the phone, pockets it.

      Cheryl rings off as Lewis passes her on the way to the
      freezer, reaching for some of the ice cream he bought.

                                  LEWIS
                    Hey.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  14.

                                  CHERYL
                    Hey, honey.  I thought maybe I d go
                    to the supermarket.  See if the 
                    cops are done with your car.

                                  LEWIS
                    You re gonna do something for me?
                    You feelin  alright?

                                  CHERYL
                    Be nice, Lewis.  OK?

                                  LEWIS
                    Yeah.

      Lewis takes the carton and a spoon.  His wife looking after
    him with concealed hatred, biting her lip:

9 INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 9

      George enters, wearing the same windbreaker as before.  The 
      Manager, bundling cash at a register, spots him coming in.

                                  MANAGER
                    George.  I didn t expect you to

                    3 p.m. to 12 a.m. 

                                  MANAGER
                    I know when you work, George.  But 
                    the police kept you here all night.
                    You could use some rest.

                                  GEORGE
                    3 p.m. to 12 a.m. 

    The Manager nods slowly.  Realizes it s useless to argue.

                                  MANAGER
                    Right.  OK.  Go on.

      George heads off.  Cheryl enters, approaching.

                                  CHERYL
                    I m Mrs. Parks.  I m here for my
                    husband s car. 

      Cheryl indicates the luxury SUV outside, still parked where
    we last saw it (the yellow police tape now gone).




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  15.

                                  CHERYL
                    The police said they left the
                    keys...?

                                  MANAGER
                    Of course.  Right this way.

      ANGLE - THE MANAGER S KIOSK

    He takes KEYS from a drawer.  A CLUB CARD dangles. 

                                  MANAGER
                    Here you go, Mrs. Parks.

    As the Manager hands her the keys, we RACK FOCUS to...
      George, staring at the key chain.

                                  MANAGER
                    How is your husband?

                                  CHERYL
                    Fine, I guess.  Who knows?

      George approaches, never taking his eyes off the key chain.

                    60115317.

    Not again.  The Manager glances at George.

      Cheryl looks to the Manager, frowning.

                    George! -- I m so sorry, Mrs.

                    What does he want?

      George isn t meeting her eyes, but his intensity grows.

    He grabs Cheryl s sleeve, speaking low.

                                  GEORGE
                    You re going to die.

      Cheryl stares at him, not so much freaked for herself, as
      disturbed by his behavior.

                                  CHERYL
                    Get your hands off me!

                    Stop it, George!  Let go!

      Tears are shining in George s eyes.  The Manager pulls George 
      away.  George REACTS to the Manager s touch.

                                  MANAGER

                    Freak.

    She leaves.  The Manager shakes his head at George, who
      watches Cheryl go.  Off George, mouthing  red miller plastic

      CLOSE ON a COMPUTER SCREEN.  An article as it s typed...

      WIDER, Kolchak stops typing to search through stacks of NOTE
      PADS for his research.

      Kolchak quickly tabs up to the top of the story:

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It s true.  He has no idea who 
                    killed that man, or why.  You get
                    anything?

                                  REED
                    Just some human interest, for what 
                    it s worth. 

    She holds up a PHOTOCOPY of the victim s grocery receipt.

                                  REED
                    The police released the victim s
                    receipt.  He bought a tabloid, a
                    horoscope scroll, bread, a dozen
                    eggs and orange juice.

                                  KOLCHAK

                                  REED
                    A lot of good that would ve done.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It makes you think, though, doesn t
                    it?

                                  REED
                    What s that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Today could be your last day, and
                    you d never know it.

                    That s a happy thought.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m just saying, none of us knows
                    what the future holds.

                                  REED
                    True.  For instance, I never 
                    would ve guessed you d leave that
                    bagger out of your story.  Or the

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s because I m not sure what it 
                    means yet.  Or that number he 
                    repeated.

                                  REED
                    I don t think the number means 
                    much.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why not?

      Reed hands Kolchak the copy of the receipt.

                                  REED

                    That s the number George was
                    repeating.

      Kolchak thinks about this.  It doesn t make a lot of sense.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why would he do that?

                    There s a reason for everything.
                    We just need to find what it is.

11 INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 11

    The Manager finishes helping a CUSTOMER at the kiosk, looking

    The Manager sets off through the store, conducting business
    as he goes.  Kolchak and Reed keep pace behind him.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We have a few questions.

                                  MANAGER
                    I think we ve had enough publicity.

                    last month, I had him in the back, 
                    doing inventory.  He was better 
                    than any computer.  He could just
                    look and see the number.

                                  KOLCHAK

                    Can you tell us where she is?

                                  LEWIS
                    What s this about?

                                  REED
                    It s about something that happened
                    when she got your car this
                    afternoon --

                                  LEWIS
                    Did that dumb broad bang up my car
                    again?

                                  REED
                    No, Mr. Parks.  Your car is fine.

D14 INT. LUXURY SUV - DAY D14

    The car wash mechanism clicks ON.  An ARRAY OF NOZZLES SPRAY, 
      soaking the outside of the car.  As WATER RAINS DOWN ON THE 
      WINDSHIELD:

    The Gloved Man looks at the FAST-FOOD BAGS, NAPKINS AND 
      PLASTIC UTENSILS strewn inside the car.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    This car s a mess.

                                  CHERYL
                    Because my husband s a pig.  Do you
                    have any idea what you did last
                    night?

    The Gloved Man turns to her, impassive. 

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    I followed your instructions.

                                  CHERYL
                    You killed the wrong man!

      Cheryl is deeply upset, but the Gloved Man is unperturbed.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    You said overweight, 40s, balding,
                    drives a gray SUV.

                                  CHERYL
                    You think there s only one bald,
                    fat guy in L.A.?

      OUTSIDE, the CAR passes through the MITTER CURTAIN, long,
      soft strips of fabric swaying back and forth.

                    Well, I don t know where she went, 
                    so I can t help you.

      Lewis begins closing the door, Reed stops him.

                                  REED
                    You have no idea -- ?

      Reed looks to Kolchak.  This guy s an ass.

    The MITTER CURTAIN peels back off the windshield.

                    He was at your car, gimme a break.

    The VERTICAL SCRUBBERS begin SWIRLING AND BRUSHING against
    the car, LOUD.

                                  CHERYL
                    You need to fix it.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    Then you need to pay me.

                    One payment, one job.  You want 
                    another job, you pay me again.

                                  CHERYL

                    I can t live like this.  So, you re
                    gonna do what I paid you to do. 

    The Gloved Man stares at her.  Like he could give a shit.

                                  CHERYL 
                    Or maybe the cops will get an

                    guy, and believe me, I got nothing
                    to lose.

    The Gloved Man sets his jaw, his look becoming hard.  And 
      dangerous.  Cheryl swallows, slowly realizing she may have
      said the wrong thing, as we INTERCUT:

                                  LEWIS
                    Red...?

      CLOSE - A PROMINENT RED LIGHT begins to WHIRL, indicating the
      sealer wax application.

                                  LEWIS
                    Miller...?

                      Plastic...?

      CLOSE - The Gloved Man grabs a PLASTIC KNIFE, swinging it
      toward Cheryl s THROAT.

      OUTSIDE THE CAR - HER HEAD

    Is banged against the inside of the driver s window by the
      impact of the Gloved Man s blow, as - 

      Lewis shrugs.

                                  LEWIS
                    Sorry, Charlie.

      Cheryl s lifeless body slumps down out of view.  THE BLOW 
      DRYER BLASTS DOWN on the vehicle. The sound of the hot air, 
      tiny beads of water sheeting off the car hood:

I14 EXT. PARKS RESIDENCE - DAY I14

      Kolchak hands Lewis a business card.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If she calls, will you please have
                    her contact us?  It s urgent.

                    Yeah, right.

      Kolchak and Reed start off.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe not.

    Off Reed, wondering what Kolchak s thinking...

J14EXT. GAS STATION CAR WASH - DAY J14

    The SUV rolls out of the car wash, the cycle complete.  Still 
    in neutral, it DRIFTS a few yards, then stops. 

      A car wash ATTENDANT, seeing this, turns and goes to the car. 

      ANGLE - THE CAR

      Cheryl s head is still slumped against the driver s window.
      From outside, it looks like she s fallen asleep. 

    The Attendant TAPS on the glass.  Getting no answer, he OPENS
    THE DOOR. 

      Cheryl s LIFELESS BODY slumps out, her hand flopping toward 
    the door.  BLOOD DRIPS past her wedding ring down her
      fingers, MINGLING with the SOAP AND WATER on the ground. 

    The Gloved Man is long gone.

                    I have to admit, it seems too

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George knew both of these deaths

                    I realized it after we went to 
                    Parks  house looking for his wife.

                    We think we may have insight into
                    these murders at the supermarket
                    and the car wash.

                                  TAN
                    Is that right?

                                  REED
                    We think the first victim was 
                    killed by mistake.  That the 
                    intended target was Lewis Parks,
                    the husband of the woman killed at 
                    the car wash.

      Tan s eyes narrow, studying the both of them.  He doesn t 
      seem surprised.  Only surprised, perhaps, that they know it.

                                  TAN
                    You re right.

                                  REED
                    We are?

                                  TAN
                    Turns out Mrs. Parks had taken out 
                    $10,000 from her ATM over the past
                    8 weeks. 

                                  REED
                    What for?

                                  TAN
                    We think she paid someone to kill
                    her husband, Lewis. 

                                  REED
                    Have you established motive?

                                  TAN
                    She signed a pre-nup.  If she 
                    divorced him, she d be left high
                    and dry. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    So your suspect?  He s a hit man?

                    She wasn t too careful.  Called a 
                    lot of low-lifes the last few 
                    weeks.  We got a few names we re

                    So how did you know?

      Reed and Kolchak exchange a look.

                    George Cawley. The bagger from the
                    supermarket.  He predicted both
                    deaths.

                    You can t tell me you ve never used
                    a police psychic before?

                                  TAN
                    Yeah, but, c mon, Kolchak...

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You want to find the killer, 
                    Detective?  Isn t it worth at least 
                    asking for his help?

    Off Tan, reluctant:

17 CLOSE - GEORGE 17

      Sits into frame, a distant look in his eyes.  We re:

      INT. POLICE PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Detective Tan stands over George, who sits at a small metal
      table, a  SIX-PACK  of MUG SHOTS set in front of him.

                                  TAN
                    This is real easy, George.  We re 
                    going to show you a bunch of
                    pictures, OK?  These are all men 
                    who have been in prison before.
                    They may or may not have had
                    anything to do with these deaths.
                    But if you respond to any of them
                    for any reason, just point, OK?

      WIDER, we reveal Kolchak and Reed watching through the
      mirror.  As George studies the photos, Reed notices through
    the door...

      ERIK CAWLEY, George s brother, seated on a bench just 
      outside.  She leaves Kolchak, moving toward him.

      Looks to the floor, deep in his own thoughts. 

                                  REED
                    Mr. Cawley?

      Erik glances up, seeing Reed.  He remembers her from before.

                                  ERIK
                    Ms. Reed, right?

                    My brother can t tell you what s
                    going to happen.  He can t tell you
                    much of anything, really. 

                                  REED
                    We believe he may have said some
                    pretty extraordinary things the
                    last couple days.

                                  ERIK
                    Random words.  He says  em all the
                    time.  Nobody ever tried to read
                    anything into  em, that s all.

    We INTERCUT: George, looking at the various photos with
      interest.  Then, without looking up:

                    George lives with you?

                    It must be hard for you, taking
                    care of him.

                                  ERIK
                    That s not the hard part.  It s the 
                    not knowing.

                                  REED

                    They say George feels emotion, but you

                    I ve never even seen him smile.

    As Tan does, we go CLOSE ON THE SIX-PACK, featuring a
      familiar face.  A MUG SHOT of THE GLOVED MAN.  Kolchak 
      watches as George stares at the face, studying it:

      RESUME - ERIK AND REED

      Sitting in the hallway.

                                  REED
                    I think your brother s a pretty
                    remarkable person.  Whether he can 
                    see the future or not.

                                  ERIK
                    Yeah.  Still, I d like to believe 
                    you re right.  About George being
                    able to see things.

                                  REED
                    It would be an incredible gift.

                                  ERIK
                    It would be more than that.  It 
                    would mean there s a reason. A 
                    reason George was born this way.

      CLOSE - GEORGE

      Studying the face of the Gloved Man.  His eyes darting back
    and forth.  But whether there is a glimmer of recognition in
      those eyes, we can t say for sure.  SLIGHT TIME CUT TO:

      ANGLE - THE INTERROGATION ROOM

    The door is opened, Detective Tan stepping out.  Making way
    for George.  Reed and Erik look up, as Kolchak comes over
      from the observation room.

                                  TAN
                          (to Erik)

      Erik leads George down the hall, Reed looking after them.
      Knowing the disappointment Erik must be feeling.  Tan turns 
    to Kolchak.

18 INT. BEACON - NEWSROOM - NIGHT 18

      Kolchak is at his desk, working, as Reed approaches.

                                  REED
                    You still think George is some kind
                    of psychic, don t you?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know why George couldn t ID
                    those mug shots.  But his other 
                      predictions remain.

      Reed sits on his desk.

                                  REED
                    OK.  Here s the one thing that
                    doesn t make sense.

      Kolchak smiles.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The  one  thing...?

      Reed smiles back.

                                  REED
                    The main thing.  If George can
                    predict the future -- can see
                    details about what s going to
                    happen next -- that means the
                    future already exists, right? I 
                    mean, how else could he see it?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I ve been asking myself the same
                    question. 

      Kolchak picks up a book from his desk.ALBERT EINSTEIN s 
      face on the cover.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You ever read Einstein?

                                  REED
                          (smiles)
                    I m a little rusty.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  38.

18 CONTINUED: 18


                                  KOLCHAK
                    Me, too.  But Einstein said space
                    and time exist in a continuum, 
                    which means the future exists -- as 
                    does the present and the past -- on
                    a plane we can t perceive.

                                  REED
                    So that means everything that s
                    going to happen has already
                    happened...? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s one of way saying it.

                                  REED
                    So then George s gift can t really
                    be used to change anything?
                    Because the future already exists? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    In theory.  A little discouraging,
                    isn t it?

                                  REED
                    Yeah.

      Reed thinks a beat longer.  Then:

                                  REED
                    I guess we have to try to change
                    fate, anyway.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And why is that?

                                  REED
                    Because trying s what makes us
                    human.

      Kolchak looks at Reed, struck by the profundity of this.
      Smiling.

                                  REED
                          (not sure why)
                    What?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Just appreciating you, that s all.

      Reed smiles back, a moment shared between them, then broken 
    by the RINGING of his phone.

                    Erik Cawley s wife.  She wants to 
                    help us with our story.

    Off Reed, surprised by this:

19 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT 19

      George s sister-in-law, MARLA CAWLEY, 30s, trudges up the 
      stairs, Kolchak and Reed behind.

                                  REED
                    We were surprised to get your call,
                    Mrs. Cawley.

                                  MARLA
                    Yeah, well, Erik said you all
                    thought Georgie might have a gift - 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s right.

                                  MARLA
                    If he does, then we want to do our 
                    part.  For science and all.

    She doesn t sound terribly convincing.

20 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 20

      George sits in a straight back chair, staring out the window.
      Marla enters behind him with Kolchak and Reed.

                                  MARLA
                    Georgie.  The reporters are here.

      George doesn t answer.  Marla looks apologetic.

                                  MARLA
                    He doesn t have much in the way of 
                    manners - 

                                  REED
                    We understand.

    The room is spartan.  A twin bed, a bookshelf lined with 
      loose-leaf binders, a small desk. ASTRONOMICAL CHARTS are 
      neatly taped above it.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  40.

                                  MARLA
                    He s dumb as a brick in a lot of 
                    ways.  But when it comes to 
                    numbers, let me tell you - 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We understand he s good at math...

                                  MARLA
                    Oh yes... and not just that.
                          (to Reed)
                    Take a look around, Ms. Reed. 
                    Whatever you need.
                          (back to Kolchak)
                    Watch this.  Georgie... August 8,
                    2006.

                                  GEORGE
                    Tuesday. 

                                  MARLA
                    What d I tell you?  How about this 
                    one?  November 4, 2012.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sunday.  No work on Sunday.

                                  MARLA
                          (proudly)
                    See there.  Check it in a calendar. 
                    He s got it all right there in his
                    head.

      Reed kneels down beside George.  She follows his gaze out the
      window.  He s looking up at the night sky.

                                  REED
                    George, I m Perri.  We met before 
                    at the supermarket.  Do you
                    remember?

                                  GEORGE
                    Punch out.

                                  REED
                    Right.  Punch out...

      Reed notices the faded picture of the couple from George s
      locker.  Propped up on a table beside him.

                                  REED
                    There s that picture again.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  41.

                                  MARLA
                    Those were his parents.  They died
                    when Erik and George were young. 

                                  REED
                    May I ask what happened?

                                  MARLA
                    House fire.  The boys were away,
                    visiting their grandparents. 

                                  GEORGE
                    They re waiting.

    The way George says it -- blankly -- you can t tell what he s
      referring to.

                                  REED
                    George... you said that before.
                    What does it mean?

      George doesn t answer. 

                                  MARLA
                    Drive yourself crazy trying to make
                    sense of most of what he says. 

      Kolchak is staring at an astronomical chart on the wall.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George is interested in astronomy?

                                  MARLA
                    Like I say, anything to do with
                    numbers.  He writes  em all down in 
                    his notebooks. 

      Kolchak removes a notebook from the bookshelf, FLIPS through
    it.  It s filled with MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS and PLANETARY 
      SYMBOLS. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George, would you mind if I
                    borrowed this?

                                  MARLA
                    He doesn t mind, Mr. Kolchak. You 
                    go right ahead.

    Off Kolchak and Reed, feeling increasingly uncomfortable
      about all this:    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  42.



21 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT 21

      Marla leads Kolchak and Reed back downstairs, Kolchak holding
      George s notebook in hand.

                                  MARLA
                    Listen, I think you re onto
                    something with this prediction
                    stuff.  I do.  A few Sundays ago,
                    I m thinking to myself, I oughta
                    make pancakes.  Out of the blue, 
                    Georgie says  maple syrup.   And 
                    when I went to find the syrup, lo
                    and behold, we were out.  I had to 
                    make a trip to the store.

                                  KOLCHAK
                      Impressive...

                                  MARLA
                    Isn t it, though?

      Reaching the front door:

                                  MARLA
                    So when s the article going to
                    appear?

                                  REED
                    The article?

                                  MARLA
                    You re reporters.  You re going to
                    write an article about Georgie,
                    aren t you?  His gift?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m not sure we are, Mrs. Cawley.
                    Not just yet.

                                  MARLA
                    Well, heaven sake, why not?

                                  REED
                    We need some more facts first.

                                  MARLA
                    Facts, huh...

    She looks disappointed, thinking about this.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  43.

                                  REED
                    Mrs. Cawley, does your husband know 
                    we re here?

                                  MARLA
                    Erik wouldn t approve.  But I 
                    figure we ve done and done for
                    Georgie, it s time he did for us.

                                  REED
                    I m not sure I follow, Mrs. Cawley.

                                  MARLA
                    If Georgie has the gift you say he
                    does, it s gotta be worth
                    something, right?  People might
                    come, pay to hear what he says.
                    About the lottery and such.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Thank you for your help, Mrs.
                    Cawley.

    But Marla seems less friendly now.  Troubled they aren t
      writing a story.  At their insistence upon  facts. 

                                  MARLA
                    Yeah.

    As Kolchak and Reed exit, we HOLD ON Marla, thinking.

22 OMITTED 22

23 INT. BEACON - RESEARCH DESK - DAY 23

      Reed approaches Kolchak, who s got REFERENCE BOOKS spread out 
    on the table, as well as George s notebook.

                                  REED
                    I just spoke with Detective Tan.
                    He says they ve identified a
                    suspect Mrs. Parks contacted.
                    Someone George couldn t identify.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I think I may know why not. 

                                  REED
                    Why?

      Kolchak stands, indicating the notebook.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  44.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    This notebook, it s full of numeric 
                      calculations.  The alignment and
                    orbit of the planets, the stars,
                    the moons --

                                  REED
                    Yeah, he had astronomical charts 
                    all over his room.  He studies the 
                    stars.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s how he s doing it.  He s not 
                    psychic at all.  I think he s 
                    reading these people s horoscopes.

                                  REED
                    Kolchak, I read my horoscope every
                    morning.  It s never that specific. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It might be if George was the one
                    writing it.  Astrologers are
                    interpreters -- they take raw
                    numerical data about the stars and 
                    translate it into predictions.
                    What if George, because of his
                    unique mind, is able to translate
                    it more accurately than anyone
                    else?

                                  REED
                    OK.  But how does he even know 
                    these people s birth dates?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    They d given that information when
                    they applied for their club cards.
                    When he remembered their club card 
                    number, he remembered their birth 
                    date.  When he remembered their 
                    birth date, he saw their future - 

      McManus enters, carrying a folded tabloid in his hand. 

                                  MCMANUS
                    Hey.  I got some bad news.

                                  REED
                    What?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  45.

                    Your story about George telling the
                    future?  You got scooped.

      McManus sets down a copy of an Enquirer-type tabloid, the
      Daily Star, a picture of George splashed across the front
      page, along with the headline  THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  A 
      sub-head reads:  Sister-in-Law Confirms Bagger Foresaw Bloody
      Murders. 

    Off Kolchak, looking to Reed:

A24 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE S ROOM - DAY A24

      George sits at his window, the PHOTO of his parents in hand. 
      O.S., the sound of Marla and Erik arguing downstairs (see
      POCKET DIALOGUE).  His eyes are vacant -- we can t tell what,
    if any, emotion he feels about all this.

      After a moment, the arguing stops and George s door is opened
    by Erik.  He s still upset from his fight with his wife, and
      holds a copy of the tabloid in his hand.

                                  ERIK
                    I m sorry about this, George.  Marla 
                    shouldn t have done it.  You re not 
                    some kind of circus act -- you re my
                    brother.  But money s tight, you
                    know, and I guess she thought... I 
                    don t know what she thought.  It 
                    doesn t matter.

    His back s to his brother, but we see George s eyes go in his
      direction.  Erik takes a seat beside him, setting down the
      tabloid.  He notices the photo George holds.

                                  ERIK
                    You remember the day they had that
                    picture taken? 

                                  GEORGE
                    July 27, 1970.  Saturday.

                                  ERIK
                    No, George.  That s my birthday.
                    This was for their anniversary. 

                                  GEORGE
                    They re waiting. 

      Erik regards his brother.  The mystery of him.  He has no 
      idea why he keeps saying that phrase, but offers a guess.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  46.

                                  ERIK
                    I know you miss them.  I do, too.
                          (beat)
                    George, I want you to know you got
                    nothing to be afraid of.  I m 
                    always gonna be here for you, OK?
                    I ll always take care of you.  You 
                    know that, right?

      George lowers his head.  Erik raises a hand, wanting to touch
    his brother s shoulder.  But knowing he can t.  When, softly:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic... 

                                  ERIK
                    Plastic?  What s plastic, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.  Plastic.  Dark. 
                    Baseball.

                                  ERIK
                    I m sorry I don t understand you,
                    buddy - 

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic dark baseball.

      Erik stares at his brother, at a loss.  Wondering why he s
      saying this. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic dark baseball. You re 
                    going to die.

      Then George rises, going to his desk, leaving Erik staring
      after him, feeling like he s been punched in the stomach.
    Not knowing what to make of this disturbing warning, as:

24 EXT. STREET - DAY 24

      A NEWSSTAND filled with glossies.  The Gloved Man reads a 
      SPORTS BETTING MAGAZINE when he stops, noticing... The Daily
      Star tabloid featuring George on the cover.

    The Gloved Man picks it up, scans the headline --  The Man
    Who Knew Too Much  -- with growing unease, then opens it.
      WORDS, IMAGES in the story registering:

      CLOSE - THE PAPER.  Amazing gift to fight crime ...  helping 
      detectives identify a suspect.  PHOTOGRAPHS of GEORGE in his 
      room.

      CLOSE - THE GLOVED MAN

      Swallowing.  Silently unnerved. 

      ANGLE - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A MOVING SQUAD CAR

    We see the Gloved Man standing at the curb, racking focus
      to... a MUG PHOTO of the Gloved Man on a dashboard laptop.

      RESUME - THE GLOVED MAN

      Looking up from the tabloid to see a SQUAD CAR PULL to a stop
    at the curb.

    The Gloved Man turns away from the Squad Car, and begins to
      walk away with false, but determined, casualness.

    The lights of the Squad Car FLASH.  The Gloved Man picks up
    his pace.  The Cop exits the Squad Car.

                                  COP
                    Sir, stop right there. 

      But, the Gloved Man breaks into a sprint.  The cop
      successfully tackles him to the ground, making quick work of
      CUFFING his hands behind his back.  

                                  COP
                    You re under arrest.  Suspicion of
                    murder.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    How d you find me?  How d you find
                    me?

    The Cop pulls the Gloved Man to his feet, escorting him to
    the squad car. 

      CLOSE ON the Gloved Man s CUFFED WRISTS.  With his right hand,
    the Gloved Man -- slowly, impossibly -- TWISTS HIS LEFT HAND 
    360 DEGREES.  It completely DETACHES.  It s a prosthetic hand,
      PLASTIC. 

    On the unsuspecting cop, speaking into his car radio.

                    Unit two.  Suspect in custody.

      Behind him, the Gloved Man, makes a move for the cop s gun,
      ripping it from its holster.  The cop spins...

28 EXT. CAWLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 28

      Kolchak s Mustang pulls to a stop on the street.  Kolchak and 
      Reed crossing to find... Erik and George, unloading groceries
      from the car.

                                  REED
                    Mr. Cawley? May we have a word?
                          (beat)
                    Hey, George.

      George cocks his head, but it s hard to tell whether he s
      acknowledging Reed or not.  Erik turns to him.

                                  ERIK
                    George.  Go on inside.

      George does as he s told.  Erik turning back to face them.

                                  ERIK
                    What is it you want?

                                  REED
                    It s about the story your wife gave
                    to that tabloid - 

                                  ERIK
                    She shouldn t have done that. 
                    She knows that now.  We just want
                    to be left alone.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That may not be so easy.

                                  ERIK
                    Why not?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The police have identified a
                    suspect in these deaths George
                    predicted.

                                  REED
                    An ex-con by the name of Jonas
                    Weems.  Apparently, he scrapes out
                    a living killing people for hire.

                                  ERIK
                    If they know who he is, they can
                    arrest him.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    They tried.  He shot a police
                    officer and narrowly escaped.
                          (beat)
                    It s possible he could have seen
                    the story that identified George.

                                  ERIK
                    You think he d come after him?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If he believes George is helping
                    the police find him, he just might.

      Erik digests this, thinking about what George said to him
      before. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I know George wasn t able to pick
                    his face out of the mug book, but
                    George has a way of identifying
                    this man.

                                  REED
                    He said  plastic  when warning the
                    first two victims.  We ve learned 
                    the suspect has a prosthetic hand.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And wears a plastic sleeve over it.

    On Eric, newly concerned.

                                  ERIK
                    Last night, George said something
                    to me as we were leaving the police
                    station.   Dark baseball plastic. 
                          (beat)
                    He said I was going to die.

    In spite of himself, Erik s a little rattled by this.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Mr. Cawley, I think you should get 
                    your wife and brother out of here.

                                  ERIK
                    I m not going anywhere.  The police
                    would have contacted me if there 
                    were any real danger.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe I m scaring you for nothing,
                    but your brother successfully
                    predicted two deaths this week. I 
                    don t want you to be the third.

                                  ERIK
                    Those tabloids are full of crazy
                    stories, Mr. Kolchak.  I appreciate
                    your concern, but I think we re fine.

      Erik goes, leaving a troubled Kolchak and Reed looking after
      him:

29 EXT. CAWLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 29

      Kolchak and Reed head back to his Mustang. 

                                  REED
                    What do you think we should do?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Call Detective Tan.  See if he ll 
                    put a surveillance car on.

                                  REED
                    And if he won t?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George s other predictions came
                    true within 24 hours.  We may not
                    have long to wait to see if this
                    one does, too.

      Kolchak stares off toward the house.

                    Was that porch light just on a
                    second ago?

      From HIS POV, we see it has indeed gone DARK.

                                  REED
                    Maybe it s on a timer?

      They exchange a look.  Neither believes that in their gut. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe... or maybe this is what
                    George meant when he said  dark. 

      Reed looks to Kolchak.  She s not going to risk it.  They
      exit the car, Reed dialing her cell as Kolchak goes to the

      Beside his bed.  As he lifts it out of frame: 

42 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - SAME TIME 42 

      George stares at the ceiling.  Under his breath:

                                  GEORGE
                    Baseball.  Dark, baseball, plastic.
                    Plastic.

43INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER 43

      CLOSE ON THE GLOVED MAN s ARTIFICIAL HAND.  Plastic. 

    As soon as Marla is downstairs and out of sight, the Gloved
    Man ascends the staircase.

44 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - ENTRY 44

      Marla opens the front door to find Reed and Kolchak.

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (urgent)
                    You need to get out of the house - 

                                  MARLA
                    What are you talking about?

                                  REED
                    We think you re in danger --

44 CONTINUED: 44


                                  KOLCHAK
                    -- Your power s been cut - 

45 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE S ROOM 45

      Erik enters.  He motions to George to keep quiet.

                                  ERIK
                          (a whisper)
                    George, we re gonna play a game.
                    Hide and seek, OK?

                                  GEORGE
                    OK.

      Erik guides George into a CLOSET, the door of which is
      already OPEN.

                                  ERIK
                    You hide in here and I ll come find 
                    you.

                                  GEORGE
                    Dark.  Dark, baseball, plastic.

                                  ERIK
                    I know.  Now you go hide.  I ll 
                    start counting.  One... two... 
                    three...

      George closes his eyes and starts quietly continuing the 
      count.  Erik tightens his grip on the baseball bat, turning
    to the door, preparing to defend his brother s life, as
      George CLOSES the closet door.

      REVEAL THE GLOVED MAN.  He s already in the room, hiding.
    And now his sights are set on an unsuspecting Erik, his back
      turned to him.  As the Gloved Man grips the knife tightly:

46 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS 46

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Where s your husband?

                                  MARLA
                    Upstairs, why?

    As Kolchak and Reed push past her:    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  56.



47 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM 47

      Just behind Erik, the Gloved Man holds the knife aloft, 
      poised to strike, as - 

      George BURSTS from the closet, leaping onto the Gloved Man. 

      Erik turns at the fracas. 

                                  ERIK
                    George!

    He rushes forward with the bat. 

      ANGLE - THE DOOR TO GEORGE S ROOM

      Kolchak and Reed appear as --CRACK! Erik strikes the Gloved 
    Man hard with the bat, knocking him to the ground. 

    At the doorway, Reed and Marla are overwhelmed with relief,
    as Erik crosses to his brother, rousing him.

                                  ERIK
                    George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Erik.

                                  ERIK
                    It s OK, George.  You re OK.

      George rises stiffly, a strange look on his face. A smile.
      Erik looks confused, then shocked as... GEORGE EMBRACES HIM. 
      Erik stands there, too stunned to respond at first. 

      Reed and Kolchak moved, as Erik reciprocates his brother s
      embrace.  Putting his arms around him.  Swallowing back his
    own emotion. 

      Only now a look of horror and confusion spreads across his
      face.  He takes his hands away from George, seeing his
      fingers WET WITH BLOOD.

                                  ERIK
                    Oh my god.  No!

      Erik looks into George s eyes.  His brother s face is pale,
      drained of blood.  George collapses to the floor, revealing a
      BLOODY PATCH IN HIS BACK.  Only now realizing... he s been 
      stabbed.

      Erik falls to his knees, overcome with emotion.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  57.

47 CONTINUED: 47


                                  ERIK
                    No, God!  No...

    He holds his brother, but he s dying fast.  There s nothing
      anyone can do to change it.  We hear the sound of DISTANT 
      SIRENS, growing louder:

48 EXT. CAWLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 48

    Now a crime scene.  A SQUAD CAR departs, with the Gloved Man
    in custody.  GEORGE S BODY is wheeled away.  REVEAL Kolchak, 
      somber.  He exchanges a look with Detective Tan, as Tan joins
      Erik and Marla at the front door.

      ANGLE ON Reed leaning against the Mustang.Kolchak joins
      her.  They re both silent for a long time. Then:

                                  REED
                    You think we were wrong?  About 
                    George being able to read the
                    stars?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t.

                                  REED
                    Then why did he die?  Why not Erik?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George tried to change fate.  And I 
                    think, somehow... he did.

      Reed looks at Kolchak, then turns her head skyward, looking
    up at the night. From her POV, we see the infinite field of
      stars, shining brightly.

      OVER THIS:

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    TBW.

49 INT. CAWLEY HOUSE - GEORGE S ROOM - NIGHT 49

      HARD CUTS of George s possessions: his grocery store NAME
      TAG... his NOTEBOOK, opened to thousands of NUMERICAL
      NOTATIONS... and the PHOTO of his parents.  No longer waiting.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    TBW.

                                  POCKET DIALOGUE

      SCENE A24

                                  ERIK
                    You had no right, Marla.

                                  MARLA
                    Did you even see the check?  It s 
                    enough for three car payments.

                                  ERIK
                    I don t want their money.  They re
                    making a joke out of George.

                                  MARLA
                    We ve had the burden of your
                    brother our entire married life. 
                    It s time we get something back.

                                  ERIK
                    Not by selling a bunch of malarkey
                    to a magazine.
