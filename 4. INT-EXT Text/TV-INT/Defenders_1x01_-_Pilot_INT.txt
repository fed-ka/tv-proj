      PETE KACZMAREK, 36, bare chested, pulls his belt through the 
      loops of his suit pants as he looks out the window.   

                                    CHRISSY (O.S.)
                    What was that one? 

                                  PETE
                      Southwest. 

      CHRISSY, a pretty blonde in a Delta flight attendant s skirt 
      and blouse, comes out of the bathroom brushing her hair and 
      moving like she s late.

                                    CHRISSY
                          (cute southern drawl)
                    Look what you ve done to my face --

      -- She finds her flight attendant jacket among clothes strewn 
      at the foot of the bed --

                                    CHRISSY
                    -- It s like a brillo pad when you 
                    don t shave!

                                  PETE
                    I did shave.  I m Italian.    

                                    CHRISSY
                    Italian?  Kazmarek?!

                                  PETE
                    My mom s Sicilian.  

                                    CHRISSY
                    Well my face feels like raw 
                    hamburger meat.  

                                  PETE
                    How do your thighs feel?                                                                                       2.


                                    CHRISSY
                          (tossing a towel)
                    You re naughty.  

      Just then another low flying jet ROARS on its descent.  

                                    CHRISSY
                    Oh, Lord, I guarantee you that s my 
                    plane!  

      She finishes buttoning her jacket and gives him a kiss.    

                                    CHRISSY
                    See you in two weeks?  

                                  PETE
                    Sounds like a plan.    

                                    CHRISSY
                          (smiling brightly)
                    Thanks for flying Delta!

      She turns and rolls her bag out the hotel room door.   



      Pete strides through in his 4000 dollar suit -- just a little 
      rumpled from its night on the floor.  He barely stops as he 
      drops a token in a five dollar slot, pulls and walks away 
      with an ear peeled for the winning DINGS...that don t come.    



      Pete drives fast.  He smiles as he looks up through dark 
      shades... at that same damn unfinished BILLBOARD.    



      The courthouse lobby is a madhouse.  Pete takes Lisa s arm 
      and guides her through the deluge, into the METAL DETECTOR 
      reading  COUNSELOR ENTRY  --

      ELEVATORS -- The crowd is twenty deep.  

                                  PETE (CONT D)
                    We ll be here all week.  Come on.

      He drags her to a doorway marked  DO NOT ENTER  and enters --



      -- Pete leads Lisa down an empty hall, leaving the madness 
      behind.  Lisa has no idea where she is, but keeps the pace.

      He arrives at an ELEVATOR and punches the UP button.  Lisa 
      notes the sign:   JUDICIAL USE ONLY. 

                                  LISA (CONT D)
                    Is this okay?

                                  PETE
                    Not if we see a judge.



      Pete and Lisa dash from the elevator and run right into 
      MEREDITH CARTER, 33, attractive, a prosecutor.  Saccharine 
      sweet.  They walk quickly together.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (eyeing Pete s suit)
                    Deja vu.  Could have sworn I saw 
                    you in that suit and tie yesterday.                                                                                        4.


      Pete frowns as Meredith extends her hand across him to Lisa.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Hi!  Good morning, Meredith Carter. 

                                  LISA
                    Good morning --

                                  PETE
                    -- Sorry.  Meredith, this is our 
                    new associate Lisa Tyler.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Oh, the ex-dancer!

      Lisa s raises her eyes, startled.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Welcome!  Congrats on joining Mancini-
                      Kaczmarek.  No respectable firms 
                    hiring?  

                                  PETE
                    Crack up, isn t she?    
                          (then)
                    Lisa s working Ray McWhorter with me.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    Great!  Well, don t waste your time on 
                    the kidnapping -- those charges won t 
                    go away and remember...no lap dances 
                    for the jurors.  That d be contempt.      

      She winks and enters the courtroom.  Lisa is ready to 
      explode.  Pete grabs her arm --

                                  PETE
                    Ignore that.  You re gonna be 
                      negotiating with her -- and right 
                    now she holds all the cards.   



      The judge is not yet on the bench, but the gallery is packed 
      with lawyers, accused and family waiting for arraignments.

      Pete is at the clerk s rail, quickly SIGNING IN their case.  
      Lisa is angry and unnerved by all the rushing.  

                                  PETE (CONT D)
                    We re down the list.
                          (checks his watch)
                    Hold down the fort.                                                                                      5.


      Pete hands her the case folder, pats her arm and heads off.  

                                  LISA
                    Wait?  You re leaving?

                                  PETE
                    Yeah, yeah.  You re fine.  Just 
                    make sure he says,  Not guilty .  

                                  LISA
                    Hang on!  What s his name?  What 
                    are the charges?  What --   

                                  PETE
                          (points at the folder)
                    -- All in there.  Case number, 
                      everything. 
                          (then, reassuring her)
                    Just the arraignment.  Not guilty.    

      And Pete s off to the door.  Lisa is left in the deep end.



      Sinatra plays as musak in this mostly empty Italian 
      chophouse.  Pete sits with his partner NICK MANCINI, 40, in a 
      leather booth.  Nick is knee deep in a double Martini he s 
      decided to have for breakfast.  

      Pete flips through a series of fuzzy SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS:  a 
      pretty woman chatting with a man beside a motorcycle on a 
      rich, suburban street...  woman and man laughing...  woman 
      returns his motorcycle helmet -- 

                                  NICK
                          (chewing an olive)
                      S awful...  Twenty years...  It s 
                    what a guy gets...                                                                                      6.


      Pete flips more photos:  woman and man hugging...  woman 
      waving goodbye... Pete turns to Nick, incredulous --

                                  PETE
                    Are you out of your damned mind?

                                  NICK
                    Am I?

                                  PETE
                    You had your wife followed?  Are 
                    you nuts?  

                                  NICK
                    She s cheating on me, Pete.

                                  PETE
                    Cheating?  She s got a book bag.
                          (poking the photos)
                    Guy gave her a ride from school.

                                  NICK
                          (pokes photos back)
                    On a motorcycle!

                                  PETE
                    You re separated; she can do what 
                    she wants. 

                                  NICK
                    She can cheat?  She can t cheat!

                                  PETE
                          (poking the photos again)
                    You got a hug, Nick.  That s it, no 
                    kiss, a hug.  

      -- Nick frowns at Pete s subtext, then snatches the sleeve of 
      a passing WAITER, shoves the photograph in his face --

                                  NICK
                    Jay, what s that look like to you?

                                  PETE
                    Gimme that!

      Pete nods Jay off and sweeps up the photos, stuffing them 
      back into their manila ENVELOPE.  HE grabs Nick s hand before 
      he can lift the martini glass back to his lips.    

                                  PETE
                      Crissakes, it s ten thirty in the 
                    morning!   You missed Lisa s launch 
                    for this?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      7.

                                  PETE (cont'd)
                          (rising)
                    Let s get out of here, you big 
                    baby.   



      A county jail GUARD leads Nick and Pete into the iron bowels 
      of Clark County detention.  Nick carries a LARGE TAKE-OUT CUP 
      OF COFFEE --



      DONALD SHEPARD, 30, sits in his grey jail-stripes at a small 
      metal table.  Nick and Pete enter, concerned.   

                                  NICK
                    Hey, Don.  You okay?

      Don Shepard is worn and disheartened.  A clearly broken man.

                                  DON
                    I m sorry, guys.  I can t do it.

      Bad news.  Nick tries to talk Don down off the ledge --

                                  NICK
                    It s not an easy thing, Don.  The 
                    day before --

                                  DON
                    -- It was a mistake.  Just agree to 
                    go to prison.  I can t.

                                  PETE
                    Can t take the plea?  You want to 
                    go to trial?

      Nick glares at Pete who seems almost enthusiastic.    

                                  DON
                          (yes)
                    You said we were ready to go; the 
                    judge was ready --

                                  NICK
                    Don, we informed the court 
                    yesterday you d accepted the 
                    state s offer.                                                                                      9.


                                  DON
                    But they still got a jury?  Right?  
                    I stick with the not guilty and we 
                    just go ahead --

                                  NICK
                    We can, yeah.  But being willing to 
                    go to trial was to get a better 
                    deal.  And you out in three years 
                    is a good --

      Don s voice breaks --

                                  DON
                    -- Four guys get to beat my brother 
                    near to death, and I m the one goes 
                    to jail?  For trying to stop it?  

      Nick s eyes Pete, urging support -- 

                                  PETE
                    Look, Don, anyone could have done 
                    what you did.  I would have.  But 
                    once they charge you it s not about 
                    right anymore, it s who can win.       

      Nick nods in agreement, puts down his coffee -- 

                                  NICK
                    And they can win.  You know that.  
                    We explained --

                                  DON
                          (near tears)
                    -- So I changed my mind!  I been 
                      protecting that kid since he was 
                    eight years old!  I only did what I 
                    promised my mother I d do!  

                                  NICK
                    I know that.  I do.  But it s  
                    twenty to life if they convict.  A 
                    bunch of strangers...  You need to 
                    play the odds.  Three years gives 
                    you a chance to have a life.

      Don eyes Pete.  Here s the point:

                                  DON
                    What kind of life is that?  After 
                    three years in prison?  I m going 
                    to find a nice girl; settle down?  
                    Tell my grandkids the good deal I 
                    got?                                                                                      10.


      Nick can t argue with that.  One last admonition:    

                                  NICK
                    We got a bad judge, Don, that 
                    hasn t changed.  And we ve got a 
                    medical examiner who s going to say 
                    you shot the kid in the back --

                                  DON
                    -- That s not true!  

                                  NICK
                          (a hand on Don s arm)
                    I believe you. We believe you.  And 
                    tomorrow, if you want to tell them 
                    forget it... we ll tell them.
                          (then)
                    Just do my one favor.  Sleep on it 
                    tonight.  Okay?

      Don stares at his shaking hands, facing a decision few men 
      will ever face.  Finally, he meets Nick s eye --

                                  DON
                    I m sorry, Nick...  I won t sleep.  
                    No deal.

      Pete looks at Nick, excited.  Nick looks like his head is 
      starting to ache.



      Nick squeezes his eyes in pain -- like maybe he shouldn t 
      have had Martinis for breakfast.  

                                  PETE
                    I m just saying, be bold --

                                  NICK
                    -- Bold my ass.  He had a good 
                    deal, he s risking 40 years of his 
                    life, this is a bad decision.  

                                  PETE
                          (for the tenth time)
                    Not if we win.  

                                  NICK
                    You know how dumb that sounds coming 
                    from a Vegas defense attorney?  

                                  PETE
                    I m just saying --

                                  NICK
                    -- Yeah I heard you,  Be bold!  Bet 
                    the house on red!  If ya win, hey!  
                    Great decision!   Dumb.  

      Nick throws open the car door  --



      SOPHIE, young, attractive, answers phones at reception in a 
      very low cut blouse --

                                  SOPHIE
                    Mancini Kaczmarek?  May I have him 
                    return?  Thank you.  

      She hangs up as Pete and Nick enter.  Nick doesn t stop --                                                                                    13.

                    -- Coffee, advil, tylenol.  Hold 
                    all calls --  

      -- he closes his office door.  Sophie turns, quizzical.  But 
      Pete s focussed disapprovingly on her cleavage --

                                  SOPHIE
                    What?  Still not law officey 
                    enough?  My mom gave me this.

      She frowns then hands him his messages one by one.

                                  PETE
                    Gimme that.
                          (stuffs it in his pocket)
                    What about Junior?  Any luck? 

                                  SOPHIE
                    Tried everywhere.  It s impossible.  

                                  PETE
                    Wrong answer.  Keep trying. 



      The office is hung with boxing gloves, family photos, a 
      poster of Ali.  Pete s feet are up on the desk.  

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                    Two elements to go on contingency: 
                    gotta be a slam dunk and there s 
                    gotta be a pot of gold at the end 
                    of the rainbow.  You don t have 
                    either.  

      Lisa shows up in Pete s doorway looking steamed.  Pete waves 
      her in.  She doesn t move.  

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                    Any time.                                                                                      14.


      He hangs up and turns to Lisa.

                                  PETE
                    How d Ray plead?

                                  LISA
                    May I close this?
                          (off his nod, she slams it)
                    Not guilty.

                                  PETE
                          (ignoring her fury)
                    Great.  Nice work.  What s up?    

                                  LISA
                    One -- it s none of Meredith s or 
                    anyone else s damn business how I 
                    put myself through law school.  

                                  PETE
                    Agreed.  Didn t get it from me.  

                                  LISA
                    Two, I won t work like this.  I 
                    don t give a rat s ass you re the 
                    only firm offered me a job.  I ll 
                    go back to dancing.  Ray McWhorter 
                    is not a case number!  He s a 
                    sixteen year old boy whose life is 
                    hanging in the balance and you sent 
                    me in there completely unprepared --

                                  PETE
                    -- Not guilty.  You entered the 
                    right plea -- 

                                  LISA
                    -- It doesn t matter! I was 
                      representing that boy in court 
                    without knowing a damn thing  --   

                                  PETE
                          (interrupting)
                    -- What do you know now?  Take me 
                    through it.  

      Lisa wants to shout  Fuck off  but instead --

                                  LISA
                    He s a kid.  A mixed up teenager 
                    without a record who robbed his pot 
                    dealer.  Pointed a gun, that s a 
                    serious crime but the kidnapping 
                    charge is ridiculous.                                                                                      15.


                                  PETE
                    How so?  You got movement, risk --

                                  LISA
                    -- Telling the dealer to move ten 
                    feet into his own bedroom to get the 
                    pot was incidental to the robbery.  
                      Kidnapping would be dual liability.  

                                  PETE
                    So what would you do?  

                                  LISA
                    Fight the kidnapping, but --

                                  PETE
                    -- Look at that!  Perfect.  And all I 
                    had to do was show you the judge s 
                    elevator!  

                                  LISA
                    That s not my point!  I --

                                  PETE
                          (rising)
                    -- I know, I know --  
                          (comes around the desk)
                    Listen, when I started, Nick tossed 
                    me in the deep end.  End of the 
                    first day I was in his office 
                    screaming at him:   I could a made 
                      a mistake, these people are 
                    counting on us, you son of a -- !    
                    I look up, the bastard s shaking 
                    his head and smiling.  And before I 
                    can punch him, he says,  I ll be 
                    damned.  I thought I was the only 
                    one dumb enough to care so freakin  
                    much...    
                          (pause, then)
                    We need all hands.  Shepard s going 
                    to trial.  

      He looks her in the eye and extends his hand.  Lisa looks at 
      his hand for a moment, shakes it.  She s a part of the team.   



      In his office, Nick, Pete and Lisa consider strategy for 
      Don s upcoming murder trial.  Lisa reads discovery documents, 
      while Nick paces, worried --                                                                                     16.


                                  PETE
                    -- Come on, Nick.  Nobody?  

                                  NICK
                    Nope.  Their grandmother raised 
                    them when the parents died; she s 
                    gone too now...  His brother 
                    Scott s the only one Don has.

                                  PETE
                    No aunts or cousins or anybody?  
                    You can t defend a murder case with 
                    no family behind him.

                                  NICK
                    We got Scott.  

                                  PETE
                          (nods, then)
                    Where are we on witnesses?

                                  NICK
                    They ve got three -- all friends of 
                    the kid who died, including his 
                      girlfriend -- we ve got nada.  

      Lisa pulls a FORM her stack of discovery --

                                  LISA
                    Hey?  This PD interview of Don s 
                    neighbor Eunice Brown.  Says she 
                    witnessed the fight.

      The guys all think they know what Lisa s discovered --

                                  NICK
                    Forget it.  We ve been there.  
                    Eunice Brown is two hundred years 
                    old...  She s legally blind.

                     I could hear them yelling.  We 
                    went to the window but I couldn t 
                    see very much... 

                                  PETE

                                  LISA (cont'd)
                    --  We went to the window?   Unless 
                    they wrote it down wrong, who is we?

      The guys wake up.  Nick s intrigued.  He gives Lisa props:

                                  NICK
                    Go find out.



      Pete drives fast, plays his music loud.   He ducks his head 
      down for a better view as he passes his favorite mystery 
      BILLBOARD.  The old ad has been stripped off.  It s just a 
      big white blank...but it makes Pete smile.    

      A LOUD HONK pulls Pete s eyes to the rearview.   A large 
      truck rides his tail, headlights flashing on and off.   What 
      the hell?   Pete speeds up.  

      The truck HONKS AGAIN, swerves out to swing alongside of him.  
      Pete speeds up more.  The truck speeds up.  Until -- 

      -- Red light.  Pete looks over, nervous as the truck swings 
      alongside of him.

                                  MARCO
                    Mr. K!  Mr. K!

      Pete unrolls his window as the youthful 26 year old driver 
      leans out his window.

                                  MARCO
                    Mr. K!  It s Marco!  Marco Arria!

      Pete double takes --                                                                                    18.


                                  PETE
                    Marco?   Hey!  How the hell are  -- 
                          (suddenly suspicious)
                    -- What s in the truck, Marco?  

                                  MARCO
                          (putting up his hands)
                    No, no, no!  No more!  No, no!  

      Cars behind them HONK.  The light is GREEN.

                                  MARCO
                            (gesticulating)
                    Pull!  Pull over!   

      SMASH CUT: TRUCK TRAILER DOORS BEING SWUNG OPEN TO REVEAL 
      PETE AND MARCO LOOKING INTO THE TRUCK.  



      Pete, package of meat in hand, knocks on the door.  After a 
      beat, Meredith Carter opens, hair is down, she s wearing a 
      robe and holding a glass of wine.     

                                  MEREDITH
                    Anyone see you come in?

                                  PETE
                    No one I know.  

      She smiles, opens the door wider.  



      The apartment has glass walls overlooking the strip.  It s an 
      open concept living and dining space with a granite counter 
      top island between the kitchen and living room.  The light 
      inside is low.  The view of Vegas is spectacular.   

                                  PETE
                    Just saw a kid you stuck in a cage 
                    for six years.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Six years?  I hope they changed his 
                    litter and water bottle!

                                  PETE
                          (wincing)
                    Who s writing your material, 
                    Meredith?  Attila the Hun?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Bill O Reilly.  So who was it?    

      Meredith puts on music.  

                                  PETE
                    Remember Marco Arria?   Seventeen 
                    years old, got pulled over with a 
                    truck full of Mexican gold? 

                                  MEREDITH
                          (confused)
                    Gold?    

      Meredith goes to the counter to pour Pete a glass of wine.

                                  PETE
                    Weed.  He was running it up from 
                    the border.                                                                                      22.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Oh, right!  I remember Marco.   
                    Sleazy kid -- long, stringy hair, 
                    tattoos everywhere.
                          (smug)
                    What s he back in for?   

                                  PETE
                    Mexican beef.  

      Pete drops the steaks on the kitchen counter for punctuation.      

                                  PETE
                    Ran into him making deliveries.  
                    Still got the tats but the hair s 
                    short -- married, twin girls.  
                    Turned his life around.      

                                  MEREDITH
                    Well, good for him.  Glad I could 
                    help knock some sense into him.  

                                  PETE
                    Been up to you, he d still be in 
                    prison.    

      Meredith just sips her wine.

                                  PETE
                    Doesn t that bother you just a 
                    little bit?  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Just doing my job.

                                  PETE
                    Don t go so easy on yourself.  You 
                    throw the book at teenagers.     
                          (stares at her hard)
                    You re a win junkie.  

      He drains half his glass of wine.  Meredith steps closer, as 
      she loosens the tie on her robe.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    You really don t like me much, do 
                    you?

      Pete doesn t answer directly for a reason --

                                  PETE
                    Why?  You starting to like me?

      She puts her hand lightly on his chest.                                                                                      23.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Not really.

      He pulls her hand over his shoulder, pulls her in and kisses 
      her.   We push past them toward the windows...and Las Vegas.   



      As Pete rushes for the Shepard courtroom, he FINDS a worried 
      SCOTT SHEPARD, 22, pacing the hallway outside the courtroom.

                                  PETE
                    Scott?  You should be in --

                                  SCOTT
                    -- You got to stop this.  Please.

                                  PETE
                    Look, Scott, your brother s going 
                    to be okay, you --

                                  SCOTT
                    -- He won t be okay.  Nick said it 
                    wasn t smart to do this.  This is 
                    my fault.  

      Pete takes Scott s arm and looks him in the eye --

                                  PETE
                    It is not your fault.  Don stood up 
                    for you.  He had that right, and we 
                    will prove it.
                          (nods to courtroom doors)
                    Now, let s just get in there.  Time 
                    for us to stand up for him.



      The courtroom is jammed, JUDGE RODGERS on the bench.  Scott 
      Shepard is one of twelve accused men in blue jail jumpers 
      chained together in the jury box.  Only Scott STANDS.   

      Assistant DA COLE is the mirror opposite of Nick and Pete.  
      Ivy league blue blood, smug, uncaring.  He introduces himself 
      from the state s table, while Nick is across defense --

                                  ADA COLE
                    James Cole for the people, your honor.

                                  NICK
                    Nicolas Mancini for the defense, 
                    your honor.                                                                                    24.


      And just then, Pete HURRIES up the aisle and into the gate --

                                  PETE
                    Good morning, judge.  Pete 
                      Kaczmarek, for the defense. 

      Judge Rodgers doesn t bother to look up from his paperwork --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Morning, Gentlemen.  I m informed 
                    we have a disposition in this case?

                                  NICK
                    No, your honor.

      Now Judge Rodgers looks up.  What?  

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    No?  Not today?

                                  NICK
                    Not at all, judge.  Mr. Shepard 
                    maintains his innocence --  

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                          (cuts Nick off; to Don)
                    -- Mr. Shepard, you were offered a 
                    plea?  Voluntary manslaughter with 
                      a sentence of six years?

                                  DON
                    Yes, but I changed my mind, sir.

                                  NICK
                    Your honor, Mr. Shepard --

      -- the judge focusses hard eyes on Don --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Mr. Shepard.  I can tell you 
                    your lawyers are very good, at 
                    certain things, and the deal 
                    they ve made for you reflects that.  
                    But trial is an uncertain bet.
                          (what he could lose)
                      A conviction on the most serious 
                    charge against you may result in a 
                    sentence of forty years to life in 
                    prison.  Do you understand that?

                                  DON
                    Yes.                                                                                    25.


                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    And you reject the state s offer 
                    and maintain your original plea?

                                  DON
                    Yes, your honor.  Not guilty.

                                  NICK
                    Your honor, in light of the late 
                    changing circumstances we d request 
                      a continuance --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Denied.  We were scheduled for 
                    tomorrow eight a.m., I see no 
                    reason to delay Mr. Shepard s day 
                    in court --

                                  NICK
                    -- Your honor --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- convince your client, not me.
                          (glaring at Don)
                    Let him know he has no idea what 
                    he s about to get into.     

      Don looks scared.  Nick looks at Pete: Be careful what you 
      wish for.

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                          (barks down at clerk)
                    Call it!



                            END OF ACT I                                                                                    26.


                               ACT II



      An over-muscled EDWARD BENZ, 17, shifts in the WITNESS BOX --

                                  ADA COLE
                    ...Now the defendant, Don Shepard, 
                    is your next door neighbor, isn t 
                    that right Mr. Benz?

      Benz glares at a nervous-looking Don Shepard who sits with 
      Nick and Pete at the defense table.  Behind him the gallery 
      is empty except for his brother Scott and two reporters.  

      Across the aisle the benches are packed with HIGH SCHOOL KIDS 
      in their Sunday best.  

                                  BENZ
                    Yeah.                                                                                      27.


                                  ADA COLE
                    And you were a part of the 
                      altercation that preceded the fatal 
                    shooting of Jimmy Thompson?  

                                  BENZ
                    I don t even know why it happened. 
                    We didn t want any trouble.

                                  ADA COLE
                    But it found you, didn t it?

                                  NICK
                      Objection.  

                                  ADA COLE
                      Withdrawn.  Let s go back to the 
                    night before;  your party after the 
                    game...  You spoke with the police?

                                  BENZ
                    Yeah.  Somebody called them, said 
                    we were too noisy.  

                                  ADA COLE
                    And did the police tell who it was 
                    that made the complaint?

                                  BENZ
                    No.  Just said a neighbor.  I mean, 
                    I really didn t care, you know?  It 
                    ain t something to get killed over.

      He glares at Don Shepard, who looks pained.    

      LATER

      Now in the witness box is ROBERT CHURCH, 17, and overfed --

                                  CHURCH
                    -- a bunch of us stayed over after 
                    the party.  So, we went out for 
                      breakfast.  Me, Mike, Benz; Jimmy --

                                  ADA COLE
                    -- That would be Jimmy Thompson, 
                    the victim.
                          (then)
                    And when you got back to the Benz 
                    house after breakfast, did you find 
                    his neighbor, the defendant?                                                                                    28.


                                  CHURCH
                    Yeah.  He was out in the street 
                    with his brother, screaming how 
                    Benz slashed his tires, for calling 
                    the police on the party.

                                  ADA COLE
                    But Mr. Benz has testified he did 
                    not know who called the police 
                    about the party.  Did you?

                                  CHURCH
                    No.

                                  ADA COLE
                    But Shepard hit you?  Did he not?

                                  CHURCH
                    Yeah.  I got out of the car and he 
                    sucker punched me. That s when the 
                    fight started.  

                                  ADA COLE
                    Over car tires...
                          (then)
                    Did you slash his tires, Robert? 

                                  CHURCH
                    No.  Why would I?

                                  ADA COLE
                    Right.  Why would you?  Or Benz or 
                    Jimmy who lost his life --

                                  NICK
                      Objection.

                    -- over a stupid thing none of you 
                    had a motive for in the first --

                    -- Objection!

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                          (without muscle)
                      Sustained...  Mr. Cole, leave the 
                    editorial to the papers.

      Judge Rodgers thinks he s clever and the two local reporters 
      laugh quietly.  Nick shares a worried glance with Pete.                                                                                    29.



      Lisa sits in her Volvo, parked across the street from Eunice 
      Brown s house.  She juggles a take-out coffee and a lap full 
      of law books and legal documents; even on a stakeout a first 
      year associate has to get her work done.  Until she SEES --   

      -- a young Filipina woman exits the house with her maid s 
      bucket --



                                  ADA COLE
                    If this is too hard on you, Miss 
                    Novak, we can take a break. 

      In the box, KIMBERLY NOVAK, 16, dressed like a Mormon wife, 
      dabs her eyes and nods.  ADA Cole soldiers on, gently --

                                  ADA COLE
                    So, you were saying you were in the 
                    Benz house when you heard yelling 
                    and went to the window.  Did you 
                    see Jimmy out the window?

                                  NOVAK
                    No, that s why I went down there, 
                    to find him.  I got scared.  But by 
                    the time I got there the fight had 
                    moved, over around the other house.

                                  ADA COLE
                    The defendant s house?

                                  NOVAK
                    Yes.                                                                                    30.


      Novak steels herself for the horrible memory she is about to 
      relive --

                                  NOVAK
                    So I went over.  They were all 
                    fighting  by the back gate and I was 
                    like Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Stop!  Come on 
                    let s just go, okay?  And that s when 
                    it happened -- 
                          (points at Don Shepard)
                    -- he comes out of the house.  He 
                    had a gun.  I could see it and --
                          (turns to the jury box)
                    -- he shot Jimmy!  Just shot him!
                          (glares at Don Shepard)
                    You!  He was on his knees begging you 
                    and he turned away because he was 
                    scared then you shot him!  In the back! 

      She sobs.  Jurors reel.  Don shakes his head, near tears.  
      Nick and Pete keep their heads up.



      We re close up on Don.  Las Vegas Police Detective WEBB is 
      off screen. 

                                  DON
                    I got away and ran for the house.  
                    I thought Scott was behind me.  
                    But he didn t make it.    

                                  DET. WEBB (O.S. VIDEO)
                    And because you left him, you went 
                    for the gun?

                                  DON
                    He was in trouble.  I could see 
                    through the window, his head was 
                    hitting the pavement.  I just wanted 
                    to scare  em off -- but when I was 
                    coming out, the guy rushed me and I 
                      just...shot.  I thought I shot the 
                    ground but then I saw...Oh God --
                          (breaking down, sobs)
                    -- I didn t mean to kill anybody... 
                    but he s my only family.  What 
                    would you do? 

      THE IMAGE OF DON FREEZES.  Pull back to find --                                                                                    31.



      -- Nick and Pete looking at the frozen image on the TV screen 
      in Nick s office.  

                                  PETE 
                    I believe him.  

                                  NICK
                    Me too.  Every time I watch. 
                          (then)
                    Put Don on the stand or play the 
                    tape?

      Pete looks up at Don s frozen video image --

                                  PETE
                    -- Doesn t get more powerful than 
                    that.      



      On TV, a BASEBALL game:  the Red Sox batter SMACKS a double 
      down New York s third base line, as --

      -- On the sofa, nine year old Sammy CHEERS. Nick comes and 
      sits down next to his son --

                                  NICK
                    How d this happen?  You ending up a 
                    Red Sox fan?

                                  SAM
                    I am a Red Sox --

      -- Sam points to his little league ball cap logo:   E-Z 
      Checks Red Sox.    Nick pulls the cap down over his eyes.  
      Sam pulls it back up just in time to watch an errant pitch 
      smack the batter square in the back.   

                                  SAM
                    Ohh!  He could of killed him!

      Nick leans forward, brows furrowed thinking --                                                                                      32.


      Slow-motion instant replay:  Yankee pitcher throws a bad 
      pitch that comes right at the Boston batter; the batter turns 
      away madly and takes the ball, WHACK, in the back --

      On Nick:  a light bulb turns on.



      As Nick drives up outside an beat-up, overgrown suburban 
      house, with a FOR SALE sign crooked in the yard, he sees --

      Scott Shepard.  Sad.  Leaning on his car in the driveway. 



      CLOSE ON:  a crime scene photo recording the body of Jimmy 
      Thompson, crumpled face down on a concrete walk beside the 
      Shepard house.

      Nick stands at the kitchen sink at the Shepard house.  He 
      sips his coffee and looks out the kitchen window, matching 
      the photo of Thompson s body to a spot just outside...                                                                                     33.



      Nick takes a sip from a styrofoam coffee cup, then --  

                                  NICK
                    You a baseball fan, doctor Hicks?

      Clark County Medical Examiner, DR. HICKS, sits in the box --

                                  DR. HICKS
                    I watch a bit, yes.

                                  NICK
                    You ve seen batters hit by a pitch?
                    Before he s hit he ll turn away, so 
                    he won t get beaned?

                                  DR. HICKS
                    It s human nature, I suppose, yes.

                                  NICK
                    Yet it would not have been human 
                    nature for Jimmy Thompson, seeing 
                    the gun, to turn away, resulting in 
                    the shot to his upper back?  

      Nick moves toward Hicks, coffee cup in hand.  Will he? --  

                                  DR. HICKS
                    No, I -- well yes, that would be 
                    human nature but --  

      -- Not just yet.  Nick turns toward the jury.  He s clearly 
      scoring points.  

                                  NICK
                    -- So it would be human nature?  

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Yes --                                                                                    35.


      Nick is in front of the jury box now --

                                  NICK
                    -- To flinch  --
                          (he flinches and turns)
                    -- to turn our back suddenly?

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Yes, but it s not just the turning 
                    away that s important here.  It s 
                    the angle of fire.  The trajectory.  
                    The bullet entered here --
                          (points to shoulder blade)
                    -- and exited here.
                          (points to lower stomach)
                    The bullet s path is at a severe 
                    downward angle.  I conclude the 
                    shooter stood over the victim who 
                    I d say was on his knees.

      The court murmurs.  Even Nick seems struck --

                                  NICK
                    Wow.  The trajectory tells you all 
                    that...

      Pauses, takes a sip of coffee as if contemplating, then --

                                  NICK
                    Would it have made a difference if 
                    Mr. Shepard were seven feet tall?  
                    To the trajectory?

      What?  The ME looks at him perplexed.  

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Well, yes, it would but -- 

                                  NICK
                    -- How about if Mr. Thompson had 
                    been five feet tall?  

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Yes but obviously --  

      -- Gotcha.  Nick shows ADA Cole a PHOTO, offers as evidence --

                                  NICK
                    -- Defense exhibit four, your honor.  
                    You recognize this photo, doctor?

                                  DR. HICKS
                    It appears to be the crime scene.                                                                                    36.


                                  NICK
                    And there.  Between the door frame 
                    and the sidewalk; that look like a 
                    step to you?

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Where?  I don t...

      Nick takes the photo from Hicks and SHOWS it to the jury --

                                  NICK
                    A step just outside the back door; 
                    twelve inches above the side-walk, 
                    which would make Mr. Shepard... 
                    seven feet tall.  

      Nick turns and marches quickly back toward Hicks, coffee cup 
      in hand, as he pointedly hammers away --

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Doctor Hicks, if Don Shepard was 
                    one step above Jimmy Thompson when 
                    he shot, would that change the 
                    bullet s trajectory? 

                                  DR. HICKS
                    Ah...  I...  Yes, but --

      Nick  stumbles slightly  and launches his coffee cup toward 
      Hicks -- who instinctively turns his back. 

                                  ADA COLE
                      Objection!  These antics don t 
                    belong in a serious courtroom -- 

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Mr. Mancini, I m warning you --

                                  NICK
                    -- Sorry, your honor, Dr. Hicks.  
                    Didn t mean to get water --

      -- He makes a great display of brushing the doctor s back --

                                  NICK
                    -- all over your back.
                          (then, turning)
                    No more questions.

      MOMENTS LATER

                                  PETE
                    The defense calls Ana Macalug.                                                                                      37.


      He and Nick watch pleased as ADA Cole and his team swing 
      their heads around as Lisa enters the courtroom with witness 
      Ana Macalug (Eunice Brown s friend).  Cole jumps to his feet.

      MOMENTS LATER

      In a fiercely whispered sidebar, ADA COLE tells the judge --

                                  ADA COLE
                    -- She was added today, your honor.

                                  NICK
                    We only found her yesterday.

                                  PETE
                    Recess now and he ll have her in an 
                      immigration court by sun down.

                                  ADA COLE
                    I resent that.

                                  PETE
                    I don t care.

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    I want this trial over, gentlemen.  

      MOMENTS LATER

      Ana sits in the box.  He is nervous, but direct.  

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    -- We went to the window when we 
                    heard yells and the girl screaming --

                                  NICK
                    The girl?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    The girl watching them fight.

      Nick offers a PHOTO into evidence as he approaches --

                                  NICK
                    Defense exhibit five, your honor.  
                    Is this the girl?

      Nick shows the photo to Ana and the jury:  it is Thompson s 
      girlfriend, Kim Novak.  But in this shot she s less demure,

                    Yes.                                                                                    38.

                    And you heard her screaming at 
                    Jimmy Thompson?  Screaming for him 
                    to stop fighting and come with her, 
                    as she testified here in court?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    No.  She was screaming  kill him, 
                    kill him  to the ones kicking the 
                    man on the ground.

                                  NICK
                    Kill him?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                     Kill him; kick his head in!   She 
                    was cheering.

                                  NICK
                    Cheering?  Cheering who?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    The ones kicking the man, the four 
                    of them, kicking and pounding.  He 
                    was cornered like a dog.

                                  NICK
                    What happened next?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    A gun shot.  Then I saw a man come 
                    out of the door.  It was all fast. 

      Big moment for the defense.  Nick highlights it --

                                  NICK
                    Let me be sure I ve got it right, 
                    Ana.  You said you heard the  shot  
                    and you  saw a man come out,   Don 
                    Shepard.  That is exactly how you 
                    remember it?  First, a gun shot, 
                    and then Don steps out the door?   

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    Yes.  And then they all ran.  
                    Except for the one who didn t.

                                  NICK
                    One last thing.  Why not come 
                    forward before and tell the police 
                    what you saw?  

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    I was afraid.                                                                                    39.


                                  NICK
                    But when Ms. Tyler talked to you, 
                    you decided to take a big risk and 
                    testify today.  Why?

                                  ANA MACALUG
                    It s the right thing.   

      Nick nods his gratitude.  

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Mr. Cole?

      Cole thinks for a moment, then --

                                  ADA COLE
                    No questions.

      Nick turns to Pete and Don.  Don nods.  Nick stands and sets 
      his hand on Don s shoulder.

                                  NICK
                    The defense rests.

      Pete eyes the packed waiting room.  Normally he d be pleased, 
      not today.  He leans in over Sophie s reception counter.

      Don Shepard s brother Scott rises from a bench as he sees 
      Pete and Nick approaching quickly.

                          (putting an arm on Scott s back)

                          (Scott sighs)
                    Walk with us.  Here s what s next: 
                    Pete and I to talk to the judge 
                    about jury instructions.  Judge 
                    decides which charges the jury can 
                    choose from.

      Nick sells Scott hard on his approach --                                                                                    44.


                                  NICK
                    And just in case the jury thinks your 
                    brother made even one bad choice that 
                    day?  Even if they know he didn t 
                    want to kill anyone?  We make sure 
                    the judge instructs the jury on 
                      involuntary manslaughter --

                                  SCOTT
                          (exasperated, scared, loud)
                    --  Course he didn t!  He was 
                    defending me!  For God s sake --

      -- Pete steps in, argues for Nick now --

                                  PETE
                    -- And that s what Nick s gonna 
                    hammer hard in close.  We re going 
                    all in for  not guilty , Scott, trust 
                    me.  Just buying Don some insurance.

                    -- Novak lied and the ME 
                      embarrassed himself --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Enough.  Ample evidence was 
                    presented for first.  And I ll also 
                    instruct on two and manslaughter.                                                                                    45.

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Pulling a trigger is a voluntary

                    Judge?  That s not the standard --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- No evidence, no instruction, Mr.

                    You re wrong!  We deserve them to 
                    hear the lesser charge!  The jury 
                    should decide intent, not you.  I 
                    want a record --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    You re on record!  One more word 
                    you re in county!

      Nick and Pete are stunned, but can t argue further.  ADA Cole 
      can barely hide a smirk, as the judge snatches for his robe --                                                                                    46.


                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    I m bringing the jury in.  We ll 
                    finish this thing today.



      The jury box is full, every member listening diligently --

                                  ADA COLE
                          (ending summation)
                    When the defendant left that fight 
                    and returned to his home; he 
                    could ve called the police.  But he 
                    made a different choice; he chose 
                    to get his gun.  He chose to bring 
                    a gun to a fist fight that started 
                    over damaged car tires.  
                          (shakes his head)
                    What a reckless, horrible choice.  
                    Made why?  Because Donald Shepard 
                    wanted to, intended to confront the 
                    boys who humiliated him.   

      He pauses to let it sink in.  And from the looks of the jury, 
      it is sinking in.  

                                  ADA COLE
                      Premeditation doesn t have to be 
                    months, or weeks, or hours; just a 
                    few coldly considered choices.  The 
                    defendant stood over Jimmy Thompson 
                    and deliberately fired.  It was an 
                      execution.  Miss Novak told you 
                    that.  She witnessed that.  Their 
                    witness did not.  By his own 
                      admission, Mr. Stanton heard a shot 
                    but he did not see the shooting.  
                    Only Miss Novak saw it, and Dr. 
                    Hicks corroborated it:  Donald 
                    Shepard made a terrible choice...

                                  ADA COLE (cont'd)
                    And Jimmy Thompson paid the 
                    ultimate price.  Only you can make 
                    that right.

      ADA Cole holds eyes on the jury...  Nods...  And returns to 
      his seat, as if carrying the weight of Job.  Nick pays Cole 
      no mind as he begins his summation still sitting by Don --

                                  NICK
                    Mr. Cole is wrong.  He s wrong on 
                    the facts, and he is wrong on the 
                    law.  

      Nick glares at the judge as he stands to approach the jury 
      with a stack of PHOTOS --

                                  NICK
                          (lets it sink in)
                    Donald Shepard did choose to run 
                    into his house and did choose to 
                    get a gun... but he did it to keep 
                    four men from beating and kicking --
                          (pounds PHOTOS on jury rail)
                    -- and pounding his brother s head 
                    into a concrete sidewalk.    

      -- Nick holds the photos up before the jury:  Scott Shepard s 
      face and head after their beating; a BLOODY, SWOLLEN mess --  

                                  NICK
                    He did step outside onto a twelve 
                    inch step with a gun.  Yes.  He 
                    made that choice.      

      Nick meets the jury s eyes --

                                  NICK
                    But Don Shepard didn t go out to 
                    kill, he did not choose, he did not 
                    intend to hurt anybody; it wasn t 
                    his plan, it wasn t something he 
                    chose to do because he was 
                      humiliated, he did not voluntarily 
                    take Jimmy Thompson s life --  

      Judge Rodgers glares, realizing what Nick is doing --

                                  NICK
                    He just wanted to scare off the men 
                    attacking his brother.  You heard 
                      eyewitness testimony from the only  
                    unbiased, impartial witness,  I heard 
                    a shot, then saw him come out the 
                    door.   Shot then the door.

                                  NICK (cont'd)
                    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 
                    that puts Don on the step.  Up above.
                          (acting it out)
                    Jimmy Thompson rushes him; In fear, 
                    Don lifts the gun; Jimmy turns his 
                    back just like Dr. Hicks...then the 
                    shot -- all in an instant.  As you 
                    heard Don thought and hoped he shot 
                    into the ground.        
                          (lets it sink in)
                    Tragedy all around...but Don was 
                    right in his actions.  He was 
                    legally justified in using force to 
                    defend himself and Scott.
                          (he points at Scott)
                    His only family was being beaten in 
                    front of his eyes.  His only 
                    intention was to stop it.  
                          (he looks at the jury)
                    What would you have done if it was 
                    your brother, your sister, someone 
                    you loved?   And you were afraid 
                    you were about to lose them? 
                          (lets that sink in)
                    What?

      Nick walks to the defense table.  Pete puts his hand on 
      Nick s back, proud as hell to be his partner.  



      Sinatra plays quietly as Nick drives slowly into the suburban 
      desert.  There s a calm about him.  Like a matador who s just 
      left it all in the ring.  



      Pete drives fast.  Lights of Vegas flashing by.  Music 
      playing.  He s got that great day in court high going.  He s 
      also enjoying giving Sophie a hard time --  

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                    Why haven t you called Manny at the 
                    Hard Rock, Sophe?  He s connected.  
                    Tell him he doesn t get me Junior 
                    tickets, I double his bill.  
                          (then)
                    Yeah, I m serious!  Call him!  

      He hangs up, cranks up the music and -- looks up once more at 
      his favorite billboard.  Workers are hanging the new ad.  Up 
      so far: a partial photo of feet and legs.  Pete grins.                                                                                      49.



      Pete sits at a crowded blackjack table talking to DENISE 
      (29), red curls, flimsy cocktail dress, sitting to his right.    

                                  PETE
                    -- I m telling you, they re evil.  
                    They re out for blood.

                                  DENISE
                    Come on, prosecutors are the same 
                    as you guys.  You re two sides of 
                    the same coin.

                                  PETE
                    No.  Wrong.  They re different.  

      Pete scratches the felt for a card; the dealer deals --

                                  PETE
                          (as his card hits)
                    Bang!

      He glances at his card then --

                                  PETE
                    -- Seriously, what kind of person 
                    pops champagne to celebrate 
                    sticking someone in a cage for the 
                    rest of his life?

      Pull back to reveal Meredith, only half amused, sitting to 
      Pete s left.   

                                  DENISE
                          (glancing to Meredith)
                    I d pop champagne if I took a 
                    killer off the street.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Amen!  You go girl!                                                                                      50.


                                  PETE
                    But what if you got the wrong guy? 
                    If you weren t sure but still stuck 
                    him behind bars?    

                                  DENISE
                      I wouldn t do that.

      Pete smacks the table, looks to Meredith --

                                  PETE
                    Well they do!  All the time!  And 
                    they celebrate!
                          (raising his drink)
                    Woo-hoo!  Win s a win!

      Meredith rolls her eyes as Pete twists the knife --

                                  PETE
                    And their strategy for winning?  
                    Never go to trial.  Just pile on 
                    charges to scare people silly.  
                     Only two years if I plead the 
                      jaywalking?  Gee, thanks, Mr. 
                      Prosecutor, I ll take it! .  

      Pete glances at the dealer, passes his hand over his cards.  

                                  DENISE
                    They can t do that!

      Pete s PHONE RINGS.  He grabs it, but before answering  --  

                                  PETE
                    Oh yes they can!  They re the 
                    State!  They can do whatever they 
                    want!  They ll throw the book at 
                    teenagers to get a win.  Win s a 
                    win! 
                          (turning)
                    Tell her Meredith!  Tell her about 
                    our  justice  system.  

      Denise is dealt an ace to go with her king --

                                  DENISE
                      Blackjack!

      She squeals and turns to her girlfriends at the table.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    You re starting to get really 
                    annoying.                                                                                    51.


      Pete leans toward her, lowers his voice --

                                  PETE
                    Just once, as an experiment -- how 
                    about charging that kid Ray McWhorter 
                    for the actual crime?   See if he s 
                    another Marco Arria waiting to turn 
                    his life around.  

      Pete s phone RINGS.

                                  PETE
                    I m not asking you to give a crap -- 
                    just charge him for what he did. 

      Pete raises his eyebrows --  will you think about it?  -- 
      then grabs the phone and steps away from the table.  

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                          (covering one ear)
                    Hey Sophie?  What are you still 
                    doing --
                          (glances at his watch)
                    What?  I can t hear...Did you say 
                     the Shepard jury ?  Hang on!

      Pete darts off the NOISY Casino floor --



      -- shelters in the entryway --

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                    Sophe, is the verdict in?    

      He listens, then repeats to make sure he has understood --

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                     The jury has a question.   No 
                    verdict, a question?!    
                          (then)
                    What the hell s the question?  
    
       


                           END ACT III


                                                                                                          52.


                              ACT IV



      Sophie stands beside Nick s desk, READING off a message slip:

                                  SOPHIE
                    What do we do if we think Shepard 
                    did something wrong, but we don t 
                    think he intended to kill Thompson?

                                  PETE
                    You sure you got that right?

                                  SOPHIE
                    It s a jury question!  I had the 
                    bailiff read it twice; you think 
                    I m an idiot?

      Nick remains poker-faced, but Pete is obviously thrilled with 
      the question.  

                                  LISA
                    It s basically the definition of 
                      involuntary manslaughter.  

                                  PETE
                    -- And Nick is basically a freakin  
                    genius.  

      He jumps to his feet excited, recounting for Lisa and Sophie --

                                  PETE
                    His argument for acquittal was in 
                    your face, spot on, perfect!   But 
                    just in case the jury had any 
                    doubts --
                          (grabbing the slip from Sophie)
                    -- he guided them right here.  Genius.    

      He turns toward Nick.

                                  PETE
                    We get the judge to revisit?  Force 
                    the instruction?

                                  LISA
                    Unless he wants to get reversed, 
                    does he even have a choice?  

                                  SOPHIE
                    This is all good, right?                                                                                    53.


                                  NICK
                          (circumspect)
                    The jury is pretty much telling us 
                    they d convict Don on involuntary 
                    if they had that charge.
                          (unsettled)
                    But they don t have it; they don t 
                    even know it exists.  

                                  LISA
                    So, Don does a year -- after the  
                    judge corrects himself.  That s a 
                    win.   

                                  PETE
                    A big win.  

                                  NICK
                          (mostly to himself)
                    Yeah.  That would be a big win...

      Seeing Nick s wheels turn, Pete looks at him,  what?  --

                                  NICK
                    But we got information we didn t 
                    have before.  The jury is telling 
                    us they won t convict on the 
                    charges they ve got.  I m don t 
                    feel like just handing them a new 
                    one.  I want him out.

                                  PETE
                    Wait, are you saying now we don t 
                    want the involuntary?

      Nick nods.  

                                  LISA
                    But you just asked him for it 
                      yesterday; how do you tell him you 
                    don t want it today?  

      It dawns on Pete what Nick has in mind. 

                                  PETE
                    Oh man!  Wow, Nick --

      -- Nick sits poker-faced.  Lisa looks perplexed.    

                                  LISA
                    What?

                                  PETE
                    Bold.                                                                                    54.


      Pete nods at Nick.   

                                  PETE
                    Very, very bold.  



      It s that traditional PLEXIGLASS and black  TELEPHONE set up, 
      Nick on with Don.  Pete is behind Nick.

                                  DON
                    And if the judge doesn t give the 
                      instruction it could be not guilty?

                                  NICK
                    Or the jury settles for voluntary 
                    and you get the ten; out in five.

      It s a hell of a choice and Don is clearly confused and torn.

                                  DON
                    And you know from their question?

                                  NICK
                    No Don, I don t know.  I think a 
                    solid number of jurors are saying 
                    they don t buy the charges.  They 
                    want something else...  If we get 
                    the judge to reconsider and offer 
                    that  something else  I can just 
                    about guarantee you --

                                  DON
                    -- they ll convict.  Involuntary.  
                    I do another year?

                                  NICK
                    Which is good, Don.  Considering.  
                    But if you want to go all in one 
                    more time...it s up to you.       

      Don is near the breaking point.  These are not the kinds of 
      choices an incarcerated man should be asked to make.  Still --  

                                  DON
                    I want out of here, okay?  I just 
                    want out.  If you can do that, do 
                    it.  If you can t... 

      Don just shrugs, worn to a nub.                                                                                      55.



      Judge Rodgers, ADA Cole, Pete and Nick meet to consider the 
      jury s question.  Uncharacteristically and unprofessionally, 
      Nick slouches in his seat before Rodgers.  He nearly smirks.

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Mr. Cole?  The state s position?

                                  ADA COLE
                    I don t know, judge; there doesn t 
                    seem to be a lot of ambiguity here.  
                    They re asking for a lesser charge.

      Judge Rodgers seems inclined to agree, but it clearly grates.  
      Nick s insolent slump doesn t go unnoticed as --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                          (to Cole)
                    And you d yield to a supplemental 
                      instruction?

                                  ADA COLE
                    If your honor is so disposed, the 
                    state withdraws it s objection -- 

                                  NICK
                    -- Aw jeez...  Could you guys get 
                    over yourselves?

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Pardon?

                                  NICK
                    If the court is so disposed, we ll 
                    yield to a supplemental.  It makes 
                    you feel better to hide behind the 
                    shoptalk knock yourselves out, but 
                    I ve got a client to defend -- 

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Are you mocking me, Mr. Mancini?

                                  NICK
                    Me?  No, jury s mocking you, judge.  
                    Couple of grade school teachers, a 
                    dealer from the Tropicana --  
                          (glances back at Pete)
                    -- there s a realtor in there too, 
                    isn t there; cripes, a real estate 
                    agent.  And they all know the law 
                    better than you.

      Rodgers is stunned, glaring at Nick, slumped and disheveled.                                                                                    56.


                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                      Counselor, are you drunk?

                                  NICK
                    Quit wasting my time, judge, just 
                    give the jury the new instruction 
                    like I told you --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- One more word, you re fined --

                                  NICK
                    -- Fine me.  It won t make you a 
                    better judge --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- One thousand dollars.  Pay the 
                    clerk by the end of the day --

      Nick nods.  Whatever.  He pulls himself to his feet and moves 
      for the door, turning his back to the judge --

                                  NICK
                    Let s get this over with.  Just 
                    offer the damn instruction.

      Judge Rodgers stands, veins bulging --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    I will not!  I will reread what 
                    they have and advise them it is 
                      sufficient!

                                  NICK
                    Don t be stupid --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Two thousand, counselor!  Now get 
                    the hell out or go to jail!

      Pete takes Nick s arm and moves him for the door.  ADA Cole 
      looks on, gaping, not liking the outcome of this meeting --

                                  ADA COLE
                    Judge --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    Get out!                                                                                    57.



      The jury box is full, but the courtroom is empty, save the 
      lawyers, Don Shepard, and the judge.  Judge Rodgers, still 
      shaky from chambers, is responding to the jury question -- 

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- unfortunately I m unable to 
                    answer your question directly.  All 
                    I can do is reread the instructions 
                    you ve already received and ask you 
                    to align your concern to those --

      At the defense table, Pete leans back from behind Nick and 
      Don and looks over at ADA Cole across the well.  And, when 
      ADA Cole notices Pete staring...  Pete winks.



      Pete rounds a corner and runs right into Meredith and Lisa.      

                                  PETE
                    Hey!

                                  LISA
                    Hey --

      -- Lisa gives Pete an odd look as --

                                  MEREDITH
                          (curt and formal)
                    -- Good timing.  I was just letting 
                    Ms. Tyler know we re going to 
                    stipulate to dismiss the kidnapping 
                    charges against Ray McWhorter. 

                                  PETE
                    Yeah?  Great.

                                  LISA
                    Thank  --

                                  MEREDITH
                          (to Pete)
                    -- Call me to discuss a plea?

                                  PETE
                    Will do.

      Meredith smirks at Pete and turns on her heels.  (It s a 
      smirk that tells Pete this isn t kindness -- just a desire to 
      prove him wrong).                                                                                      58.


                                  LISA
                          (watching her walk)
                    What just happened?

                                  PETE
                    You won... Ray won...  We won.    

                                  LISA
                    How?

                                  PETE
                          (shrugs)
                    What d you say to her?  

                                  LISA
                      Absolutely nothing.  You?

                                  PETE
                    Nothing.    

      He starts to walk.  

                                  LISA
                    What was that look?  
                          (off his quizzical look)
                    She gave you a look now.    

                                  PETE
                    Didn t notice.  Come on.  Congrats!  
                    Win s a win!  We ll take it.     

      He puts his hand on a suspicious Lisa s back. 



      In Mancini & Kaczmarek tradition, Nick and Pete drink at the 
      bar while they wait for a verdict.  Nick is tense.  

                                  NICK
                    Heard Meredith kicked the 
                      kidnapping.  She growing a heart?

                                  PETE
                          (shrugs)
                    I read they re growing oranges in 
                    Alaska.    

      They smile, drink -

                                  PETE
                    How you feeling?                                                                                    59.


                                  NICK
                    Like I ve gone all in on a pair of 
                    tens.   

                                  PETE
                    Hey.  Pair of tens ain t bad.    

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, well.  Jacks are better.

      Pete nods.  

                                  PETE
                    So what about --

      -- their BLACKBERRIES BUZZ simultaneously.  They grab their 
      machines from the bar and check new TEXTS.  Nick slaps a $20 
      on the bar and CALLS the bartender, turning to go --

                                  NICK
                    Jackie.  We got a verdict.



      The courtroom is pin drop quiet.  Don stands with Nick and 
      Pete at the defense table.  ADA Cole stands alone at state.  
      Judge Rodgers wonders of the jury --

                                  JUDGE RODGERS
                    -- Mr. forperson, could you hand 
                    the bailiff your verdict?

      The bailiff carries the form to the judge who reads, and 
      giving no hint of the verdict, he lowers it to the clerk --

                                  CLERK
                    In the matter of Donald Shepard; 
                    case number 47387, in the Clark 
                    County District court:
                          (the counts:)
                    As to the charge of murder in the 
                    first degree:  Not guilty.

      Don, Nick and Pete, are stoic.  The scary counts are next --

                                  CLERK
                    As to the charge of murder in the 
                    second degree:  Not guilty.

      Pete nods at Lisa.  Two s off the table.  The money count --                                                                                    60.


                                  CLERK
                    ... As to the charge of voluntary 
                      manslaughter:  Not guilty. 

      Nick and Pete grasp Don s rising shoulders, share a smile.  
      Don turns and hugs Scott over the rail.  Today was just.  


      The Congo Room buzzes, sold out.  Nick is a lonely figure, 
      sitting at a table for two with a Martini in this old school 
      casino theater.  But his loneliness goes as he sees...  Pete 
      squeezing through the crowd with a glass of Scotch.                                                                                     62.


                                  NICK
                    Hey.  Thanks for coming.

                                  PETE
                    What, you crazy?  Junior? 

      He slaps his partner on the back and takes a seat, raising 
      his scotch just as a tuxedoed MC steps to a microphone on the 
      theater stage --

                                  MC
                    Ladies and gentlemen, the Congo 
                    Room is proud to present a man who 
                    needs no introduction; whose vocal 
                    cords are inherited from the 
                    Almighty.  Join me in welcome:
