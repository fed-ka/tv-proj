circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.
SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.
A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the
street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's
and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick
telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.
Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees
gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine
closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,
we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows
indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.
She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.
She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,
announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among
them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.
CHRISTINE
Hey, sport.
WALTER
Hey, mom.
CHRISTINE
So how was school?
WALTER
Okay. We learned about dinosaurs,
and I got in a fight with Billy
Mankowski.
CHRISTINE
What happened?
WALTER
He hit me.
CHRISTINE
Did you hit him back?
(he nods)
Good. Rule number one: Never start
a fight, but always finish it. So
why did he hit you?
WALTER
Because I hit him.
She stops, looks at him.
CHRISTINE
Wait...you hit him first?
(he nods)
Why?

WALTER
He said my dad ran off because he
didn't like me.
CHRISTINE
Your dad never even had a chance to
meet you...so how could he not like
you?
WALTER
Then why did he leave?
Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.
CHRISTINE
Well, the same day you were born,
something else arrived. It came in
the mail, in a box just slightly
bigger than you. You know what was
in that box?
(he shakes head)
Something called responsibility.
Now, to some people, responsibility
is fun, it's what you live your
whole life for. Other people think
it's the scariest thing in the world.
WALTER
So he ran away because he was scared
of what was in the box?
CHRISTINE
Yup.
WALTER
That's dumb.
CHRISTINE
That's what I thought.
She turns and crouches down in front of him.
CHRISTINE
Walter, I decided a long time ago
that I would always tell you the
truth, that I would treat you like
a grown-up. I can't expect you to
respect me unless I respect you.

I've never lied to you. Your father
leaving had nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with what was
in the responsibility box.

She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug.
He smiles.
CHRISTINE

He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him
stay ahead of her the whole way.
Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which
is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine
enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.
WALTER
Did I miss Amos and Andy?
CHRISTINE
I'm afraid so, sport.
Come on now,
time for bed.
She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.
WALTER
Are we still going to the movies
tomorrow?
CHRISTINE
Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie
Chaplin playing down at Grauman's,
and a new serial called The
Mysterious Airman.
WALTER
Who's that?
CHRISTINE
I don't know. Nobody does. That's

Oh.

Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly.
She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and
continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street.
We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner,
radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming.
Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house --

Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic,

She goes to the front door.
It's unlocked.

Looks up and down the street.

Honey? Time to come in.
A little GIRL on a tricycle rolls past.

if Walter was here.
MRS. RILEY
No, I'm afraid not.

Do you know if Jamie was able to

and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She
hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace,

She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of

walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few
houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing.
DR. TARR
Hello, children, my name is Dr.
Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you
some questions.
1ST KID
My mom says we're not supposed to
talk to strangers.
DR. TARR
Good boy. Quite right. But as you
see I'm with the police, so it's
all right. Now, I'm sure you know
Mrs. Collins here, and her son,
Walter. How many of you recognize
this young boy as Walter Collins?
He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply.
Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
DR. TARR
Now, now, no need to be afraid.
Surely you knew Walter, and played
with him? So which of you can
identify Walter for me, for his
mother, and for the police? This
officer would want you to do the
right thing as good young citizens.
The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize
the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and
the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands.
Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.

2ND KID
Walter was as tall as me....
DR. TARR
Yes, precisely. He was as tall as
you. Now he's not. He's lost a
little height, you see. It's a
thing called trauma. With luck,
none of you will ever have to find
out about it yourselves. So other
than that, do you recognize this as
your friend, Walter Collins?
2ND KID

Dr. Tarr --
DR. TARR
Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins;
children can be intimidated. But
not adults. Shall we try a neighbor?

down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids,
then heads off to follow.
Tarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand
on the porch.
DR. TARR

could make a positive identification
for us.

I'd be happy to. I saw the boy
often. Come closer, son.
She stoops down, studies "Walter's" face, turns it from side

she's not wearing glasses. Finally:

still steaming. He drives off as fast as he can.
A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a
large open area cluttered with junked cars. At the far end
of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long.

tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.

They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going
over the edge.
With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the
punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the
Mountie backs off just a bit --
MOUNTIE
Screw this...I'm too old for this
fightin' shit....
-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the
two-story roof and DOWN into --
-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers
and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned
by Gordon.
As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers
to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise
intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose.
MOUNTIE
YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST!
And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.
One by one, the Code Twelve patients are brought out of the
hospital and into the light. One of the last to emerge is
Carol Dexter, who blinks against the light, and sees Christine.
She runs to her, embraces her, sobbing.
CAROL DEXTER
I knew you'd come...I knew you'd
come back...I knew you'd come....
CHRISTINE
It's all right...everything's going
to be all right now....
And in Christine's face, we see a flicker of pride and one
simple truth: if she could not save her son, she could at
least save these women. As they move toward her, Hahn and
Briegleb, we HEAR a TRAIN WHISTLE that segues us into
Gordon Northcott, handcuffed, is led out of a train by several
officers. The waiting PRESS rush toward him. He seems to
enjoy the attention. Among the shouted questions we hear:
REPORTER
Mr. Northcott, any comment on your
arrest?
GORDON
I'm feeling fine.

GORDON (Cont'd)
I've been on a little vacation, as
some of you know. It was a pleasant
vacation, and the police have
certainly provided me with a lot of
amusement.
REPORTER
How did you avoid capture?
GORDON
Well, I didn't, did I? Didn't know
anyone wanted me until just recently.
Didn't even try. My luggage still
has my initials on it.
ANOTHER REPORTER
Did you know why the police were
after you?
GORDON
No, but I figured it would be best
if I stayed out of it.
REPORTER
Anything to say to the parents of
the children you murdered?
GORDON
No comment.
And on that the police hustle Gordon away.
Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather
noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium.
MAYOR CRYER
Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As
Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty
to preserve the peace in our city,
which has been disrupted by recent
events in the case of Christine
Collins. As a result, we have
decided that Captain J. J. Jones of
the Lincoln Heights Division is to
be suspended from active duty,
effective immediately.
REPORTER
What's the charge, Chief?
CHIEF DAVIS
The charge is conduct unbecoming an
officer, and using improper and
abusive language toward Mrs. Collins.
It further charges that he exceeded
his authority as a police officer
by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on
the alleged charge of insanity
without sufficient cause.
REPORTER
Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the
City Council has said it plans to
open its own investigation into the
Collins case?
MAYOR CRYER
I've heard this, yes. But since
one of the main purposes of such a
hearing by the City Council would
be to suspend Captain Jones, and
since that action has now been taken,
the question is moot.
REPORTER
Which makes it look like the only
reason Jones is being suspended is
to head off the City Council

investigation. Are you concerned
that an outside investigation might
go uncomfortably high up the food
chain?
CHIEF DAVIS
I won't even dignify that question
with a response. Good day.
The two head back into
The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car
with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get
into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls
away from the curb, following both cars.
He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear
view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine,
smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.
BRIEGLEB
Traffic's getting heavy.
We'll go
up Spring.
He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here
is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear
view mirror to see --
-- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting
off the car with Christine's bodyguards.
CHANGELING A True Story
106.
Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's
too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police
car glide into position two cars behind them.
Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the
very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is
lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then
there's a momentary break in traffic.
BRIEGLEB
Hold on.
He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts
off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine,
who gets out.
BRIEGLEB
Start walking. Quickly.
They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside
start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being
right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the
other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too
late as --
-- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot,
Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is
very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance,
something that could be the sound of lots of people.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Almost there. Just a few more
blocks.
CHRISTINE
Where is all this traffic's coming
from...?
Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors,
and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine
stops a man passing in the opposite direction.
CHRISTINE
Excuse me, can you tell me what the
problem is up ahead?
MAN
Didn't you hear? It's the biggest
protest I've ever seen.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Protest?
OFFICER
Yeah...over that Collins broad, if
you can believe that.

He moves on. Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look
somewhere between disbelief and "oh shit."
CHRISTINE
He didn't mean...he couldn't mean --
REV. BRIEGLEB
I don't know...all I know is that I
think I just stopped breathing....
They walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the
police following on foot...moving toward the SOUND of voices,
drums, and cars honking... until they turn onto Spring Street --
-- and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest
march ever recorded in the history of Los Angeles to this
date. Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming
the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices
heard.
The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society
for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary
citizens carrying placards and signs that read WE SUPPORT
CHRISTINE COLLINS and JUSTICE FOR MRS. COLLINS and THE LAPD:
A CITY'S SHAME...it just goes on and on and on. Christine
looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr.
Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. He sees her,
smiles, tips his hat and continues marching.
Christine is stunned...Briegleb even moreso.
CHRISTINE
Oh...my....
REV. BRIEGLEB
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
Mrs. Collins.
He looks behind them, to where the police have stopped.
There's no way in hell they can make a move in the face of
something as big as t his. Briegleb smiles.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Boy howdy, does He ever.
Come on.
They continue up the street toward City Hall.
THORPE (V.O.)
Ladies and Gentlemen...can I have
your attention, please....
Speakers are lowered from the window into the parking lot
where hundreds of others are gathered to listen.
THORPE
(on pa)
I therefore ask you to refrain from
demonstrations of any kind. We're
all here because we want to find
out the real facts in this case,
and everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.
BACK TO SCENE
As Thorpe looks to the other members of the Council, and the
area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon.
A number of seats are empty.
SECOND COUNCILMAN
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any other
members of the Police Commission.
THORPE
That's odd...we specifically
stipulated that we would begin our
hearings with testimony from the
police department. Are there any
representatives of the Police
Commission in the room?
(no answer)
Is Chief Davis here?
(no reply)
Is Captain Jones here? Is there
anyone here representing the police?
A REPORTER raises his hand, then stands.
REPORTER
Mr. Chairman...Richard Thomas, The
Evening Herald. Both the Police
Chief and Captain Jones are in San
Pedro for a police inspection at a
station there.

REPORTER (Cont'd)
Only reason I know is we have a
couple of our boys out covering the
thing.
THORPE
Are you telling me they directly
violated the wishes of the City
Council? That they refused to attend
a vital hearing so they could conduct
a routine inspection in San Pedro?
And what the hell is Jones doing at
an inspection after being suspended?
(beat)
I hate to call a recess before we've
even started, but I think a few
phone calls are in order. So we'll
take a half hour break, then continue
with the witnesses who have appeared
here today. But let it be known
that Captain Jones and Police Chief
Davis will be subpoenaed and required
to appear here tomorrow morning.
There's APPLAUSE from the crowd which breaks up into pockets
of discussion as a BAILIFF approaches Hahn and whispers into
his ear. Hahn nods, looks to Christine.
HAHN
Mrs. Collins, could you come across
the street with me for just a moment?
CHRISTINE
But...shouldn't we --
HAHN
I think there's something you should
see.
Puzzled, curious, Christine gets up and exits with Hahn.
A small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where
Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a
train pulls up before them.
CHIEF DAVIS
-- so after much effort, we were
able to identify this boy, who was
has been responsible for so much
recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between
this, and the arrest of the man
suspected of murdering the real
Walter Collins, we have cleared up
two of the biggest mysteries in the
history of Los Angeles.
(beat)
I hope that you gentlemen of the
press will give as much space to
the good things we do as the mistakes
that are made on rare occasions.
Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with JANET
HUTCHINS, middle thirties, the boy's mother.
CHIEF DAVIS
Ladies and gentlemen, let me
introduce you to the boy's real
mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.
She goes to him and hugs him. "Walter" looks like he wishes
he were somewhere on Mars. Davis moves closer to them to be
in frame while the FLASHBULBS pop. She's in the same pose as
they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.
MOTHER
I hope he hasn't been too much
trouble for you.
CHIEF DAVIS
Oh, no, not at all....
He towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off. Then
he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes.
WRIGHT
Mrs. Hutchins...Mrs. Collins, the
woman he was staying with, wanted
him to have these. They're the
clothes she let him wear.

Well, thank you. Isn't that nice,

DAVIS
Precocious little fellow, isn't he?
"WALTER"
It's not my fault! It was the
police! They said I was Walter
Collins, not me! It wasn't my idea!
She yanks him away.
Davis smiles gamely at the reporters.

Why not? Three boys made a run for

Afraid to come home or identify

Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford
Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for
Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned
home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.
Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by
Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and
fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never
paid.
One year after the City Council recommended the removal of
the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from
office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.
CHANGELING A True Story

Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red
Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,
but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police
corruption.
In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal
justice system in California was revised to prevent women
from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of
disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical
procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.
In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted
out of office after three terms. He was later found to have
been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,
which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern
California.
For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used
his radio show to expose police misconduct and political
corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of
Daniel."
The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became
synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order
to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name
to Mira Loma.
Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.
The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able
to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.
