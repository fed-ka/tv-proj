        ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN AND AN OFFICE CART, LOADED WITH 
          BOTTLES/GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE, ROLLS INTO A VERY SLICK, 
        OPULENT FOYER LOBBY FULL OF SMARTLY-DRESSED LAWYERS. THEY 
        EAGERLY HELP THEMSELVES FOR WHAT WE PRESUME WILL BE A 
        TOAST. OTHERS ARE FILING IN FROM THEIR OFFICES.  

        PETER ALEXANDER, 50 S, THE HEAD OF THE FIRM, STROLLS IN, 
        LOOSENING HIS TIE. 

                                        ALEXANDER
                      Hey, we re still on the clock. So 
                      everybody drink two glasses. 

        EVERYONE CHUCKLES. 

                                        ALEXANDER (CONT D)
                      Is everybody here? Where s Nina? Probably 
                      on the phone with three countries at 
                      once, having her way with them. (yelling) 
                      Take it easy, NINA! Get in here!



        NINA, FOREHEAD ON DESK, PHONE PINNED TO HER EAR, IS DOING 
        A POOR JOB OF STIFLING HUGE SOBS. SHE S A PRETTY, RAVEN-
        HAIRED WOMAN IN HER 30 S--BUT JUST NOW LOOKS LIKE A TRAIN 
        WRECK. ALTHOUGH A FANTASTIC LAWYER, THE REST OF HER LIFE 
        DOESN T COME AS EASILY. HER PERFECTIONISM AND DRIVE IN 
        HER WORK SERVE AS A SHIELD FOR HER SHORTCOMINGS IN THE 
        OTHER AREAS OF HER LIFE.

                                        TRENT (PHONE V.O.)
                      I m sorry if this upsets you. I just 
                      wanted you to hear it from me. 

        HER SECRETARY BLYTHE ENTERS HANDING NINA A GLASS OF 
        CHAMPAGNE. 

                                        BLYTHE
                                  (super-excited)
                      You ready to make partner or what?!

      NINA LIFTS HER HEAD. BLYTHE SEES THE MASCARA TEAR TRACKS.  
        TRENT CAN STILL BE HEARD TALKING ON THE OTHER END. 

                                        NINA
                                (mouths)
                      Trent.                                                                                      2.



                                        BLYTHE
                                (mouthing a scream)
                      Oh my God!

      NINA POINTS TO HER RING FINGER.

                                        NINA
                                (mouths)
                      Engaged.

      NINA SLAMS THE CHAMPAGNE THEN PANTOMIMES TAKING HER 
        BEATING HEART OUT OF HER BODY, CRUSHING IT AND THROWING 
      IT AWAY.

                                        BLYTHE
                                (mouths)
                      No no no!

        BLYTHE PANTOMIMES PUTTING HER HEART BACK TOGETHER.  IT S 
         STRONG  LIKE HER BICEP. SHE PANTOMIMES SOMETHING ELSE, 
        BUT IT GETS CONVOLUTED.

                                        NINA
                                (mouths)
                      Huh?

                                        BLYTHE
                              (out loud)
                      I m not a mime. Come on!

                                        NINA
                      Trent, can I just ask--did you think I 
                      didn t want to get married? Because I 
                      did...want that.

                                        BLYTHE
                      Don t you dare apologize to that stain!

                                        TRENT (PHONE V.O.)
                      Nina, everyone is where they should be. 
                      Your career is very important to you--

                                        NINA
                      Yes, but I thought our plan was climb 
                      Career Mountain, then get married on the 
                      summit and conceive a baby made out of 
                      love, happiness and stock options...

                                        TRENT (PHONE V.O.)
                      Nina...

                                        NINA
                      Maybe it was worded differently?                                                                                      3.



                                        BLYTHE
                      Come on!

                                        NINA
                              (into phone)
                      Trent, I have to go. They re announcing 
                      who made partner. Your timing, as usual, 
                      is impeccable. And by impeccable, I mean 
                      colossally shitty. 

        SHE HANGS UP, HEAD BACK DOWN ON DESK, SOBS. 

        A WORKMAN ENTERS HOLDING A LARGE GOLD PLAQUE.

                                        WORKMAN
                      Your  Corporate Litigators Woman of the 
                      Year  Award just came. Where should I 
                      hang it?

                                        NINA
                      Just nail it into a major artery. 

                                        WORKMAN
                                (without missing a beat)
                      I ll come back later.

                                        BLYTHE
                      Just put it with the others.

        BLYTHE TAKES THE PLAQUE AND PUTS IT NEXT TO SEVERAL OTHER 
        AWARDS LEANED UP AGAINST THE WALL OR USED AS 
          PAPERWEIGHTS. 



      NINA AND BLYTHE WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY.

                                        BLYTHE
                      Three months after he dumps you and he s 
                      already engaged?! 

                                        NINA
                      I haven t even tossed his Right Guard 
                      from my medicine cabinet.

                                        BLYTHE
                      Is that why you smell like a UPS driver?

                                        NINA
                      I m outta lady stick. Be nice.                                                                                      4.



                                        BLYTHE
                                  (cheerleading)
                      Well you get a pass--you re only working 
                      on the biggest acquisition in the firm s 
                      history. And that s why you re about to 
                      be made El Partner-ino.

      NINA THROWS A LOOK AT BLYTHE.

                                        BLYTHE (CONT D)
                      Oh shut up. Of course you are. And you 
                      know what we re gonna do after you get 
                      knighted? Bask in the glory of your 
                      jealous peers, then head down to the 
                      Golden Gopher to wade our way through 
                      STACKS of new Trents. By midnight, you re 
                      gonna be rolling with Trent 2.0.

                                        NINA
                      And right now that Adonis sitting at the 
                      bar saying to his buddy  You know what 
                      I m horny for? A newly-minted full 
                      partner of a transactional law firm. 
                      THAT S who I want to see naked. 

                                        BLYTHE
                      Word.



      NINA ENTERS, QUICKLY POCKETING THE TISSUE SHE USED TO 
      SWAB HER EYES. SOMEONE HANDS HER ANOTHER CHAMPAGNE GLASS 
        AND SHE POUNDS IT LIKE A SAILOR.

                                        ALEXANDER
                      There s Nina. Let s do this. I want to 
                      take a minute to talk about what sets 
                      this person apart from everyone. It s 
                      more than just a work ethic...

        DEBBIE, A YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE BLONDE, SIDLES UP TO NINA. 

                                        DEBBIE
                                (whispers)
                      Are you just bursting at the seams?

      NINA MANAGES A SMILE, THEN SWITCHES GLASSES WITH DEBBIE--
        HER EMPTY FOR DEBBIE S FULL ONE. SHE TAKES A GULP. 

                                        ALEXANDER
                      Oh, screw it. The newest partner of 
                        Schuster-Alexander is...Debbie 
                      Mathersons!                                                                                      5.



        EVERYONE TOASTS AND CLAPS. NINA & DEBBIE STAND SHOCKED.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Me?

                                        NINA
                      No.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Wow--Me?

        DEBBIE TIMIDLY LOOKS TO NINA, WHO S UNDERSTANDABLY 
          SHELLSHOCKED. 

                                        NINA
                                (attempting graciousness)
                      Wow, Debbie. Uh, congratulations. I m... 
                      happy for you.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Really, Nina? Because this probably feels 
                      like a surprise, huh?

                                        NINA
                      It is a surprise. I mean, I don t think 
                      I m the only one that s surprised. Keith, 
                      are you surprised?

                                        KEITH
                      Oh, um...sure. A pleasant surprise. 

                                        NINA
                      Very diplomatic, Keith. A pleasant 
                      surprise. Debbie, we are so pleasantly 
                      surprised for you. Congratulations.  

                                        DEBBIE
                      Thank you, Nina. 
                              (to the others)
                      I just want to say--

                                        NINA
                      I mean Debbie s a good lawyer, right? 
                      She s not a bad lawyer. She s a good 
                      lawyer. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Thank you.

        EVERYONE REACTS, TRIES TO LAUGH AWKWARDLY.                                                                                      6.



                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Whereas with me, you would just go ahead 
                      and flip that. My breasts aren t gonna 
                      win any awards...that was my lawyering. 
                      Lots of awards. 
                                (then)
                      Sorry! I m making this about me, it s not 
                      about me, this is your moment. Woo hoo! 
                      Yea, Debbie! Up top!

      NINA GIVES DEBBIE AN AWKWARD HIGH FIVE.

                                        DEBBIE
                      So anyway, I just want to say--

                                        NINA
                              (to MR. ALEXANDER)
                      SERIOUSLY, though? I haven t slept more 
                      than 2 hours a night for the last 5 
                      years, and you pass me over to make 
                      DEBBIE partner? 

        EVERYONE IS STUNNED, AWKWARD. NINA WALKS AMONG THE 
        LAWYERS.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      I can see why it s not Nancy, she failed 
                      the bar twice. Rick has yet to win a 
                      case, plus he steals toner and sells it 
                      on eBay. But DEBBIE?! I kick Debbie s 
                      ASS. I KICK ALL YOUR ASSES!

      NINA REACHES THE RECEPTION DESK AND STARTS KNOCKING OFF 
        OBJECTS AS SHE RANTS.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      I...had...a BOYFRIEND. But I gave my best 
                      years to this place instead of him. And 
                      now I have NO boyfriend. I am NOT 
                      partner. I gave you EVERYTHING for 
                      NOTHING.

      WITH THAT, SHE REACHES THE END OF THE DESK, WHERE A 
        BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CHIHULY GLASS IS MOUNTED ON A STAND. 
        CROWD GASPS.

                                        ALEXANDER
                      Nina---

        TOO LATE---SHE FLINGS IT OFF THE DESK, THE MULTI-COLORED 
        GLASS SHATTERING HORRIBLY ON THE MARBLE FLOOR.                                                                                      7.

                      Do you realize what you just did?! That 
                      was a Chihuly! A gift from Elton John!

        BUT SHE S ALREADY GRABBED A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND IS 
        HEADED FOR THE ELEVATOR.

                                        NINA
                      SHUT THE FUCK UP, PETER! You with your 
                      halitosis and your obvious affection for 
                      Debbie s tits.  

      NINA WALKS BY DEBBIE AND FLICKS HER TITS, DEBBIE RECOILS.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Enjoy them. Don t think I don t know you 
                      haven t already.

      NINA ENTERS ELEVATOR, PRESSES BUTTON.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Cuz me and my tiny little tits are going 
                      to the bar to get toilet-huggin  drunk. 
                      So fuuuuuuck you.

        SHE CLEARLY EXPECTS THE DOORS TO CLOSE. BUT THEY DON T. 
        BEAT. SHE PUSHES BUTTON AGAIN. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      It s after 5, you have to use your pass 
                      card. 

                                        NINA
                      Oh, right. Thanks. 

      NINA FISHES OUT HER PASS CARD, SWIPES IT. PRESSES BUTTON.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      SAYONARA, BUTTHOLES! 

        NOTHING. NO ONE MOVES. NOT EVEN THE STUPID ELEVATOR 
        DOORS. OH GOD.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                              (a new calm)
                      Wow. I was so angry earlier. Remember 
                      that? So maaaaad. I m sorry. I got upset. 
                      C mon guys, haven t any of you gotten 
                      upset before? Nancy? John, I saw you 
                      crying in your car.

                                        NINA
                      Okay.

        SHE SWIPES CARD SEVERAL TIMES AND FURIOUSLY PUSHES THE 
        BUTTON. DOORS START TO CLOSE RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. STARES.

                                        ALEXANDER
                      You realize you ll never work in 
                      corporate law again.

        THE DOORS ARE NEARLY SHUT.

                                        NINA
                      Is that right? Watch me! The next job I 
                      get will be TEN TIMES better than this 
                      ass carnival! FUCK ALL OF YOU!

      WITH THAT, SHE GIVES A DOUBLE BIRD SALUTE AND HER MIDDLE 
        FINGERS TRIGGER THE DOOR OPEN. NINA HOLDS BACK A SOB.

                                                                              CUT TO:

        CHYRON:  Six Months Later 

        IMPECCABLY DRESSED, NINA STANDS IN A DINGY HALLWAY IN 
        FRONT OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER S OFFICE. SHE TAKES A DEEP 
        BREATH AND OPENS THE DOOR. 



        A LOUD, DINGY OLD OFFICE THAT S CAVERNOUS YET 
        SIMULTANEOUSLY CRAMPED WITH TOO MANY DESKS, CLIENTS AND 
        LAWYERS SCURRYING ABOUT. IT S THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF HER 
        OLD FIRM: HERE THE ONLY SEPARATION BETWEEN DESKS ARE 
        STAGGERING STACKS OF FILES. A LATINO DEFENDER NAMED 
        CARLOS IS TRYING TO KEEP A COUPLE OF CLIENTS---TWO SHAVED-
        DOWN, TATTED-UP CHOLOS---FROM GETTING INTO A FIGHT. THEY 
        ARE SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER IN SPANISH. NINA SEES THE 
        BOSS  OFFICE THROUGH THE BEDLAM AND HEADS TOWARDS IT.



      BURT PLASCHKE, A FIFTY-ISH ROCK OF A BALD MAN WITH A 
        THICK MUSTACHE TALKS HURRIEDLY ON THE PHONE. NINA ENTERS 
        TENTATIVELY AND TRIES TO GET HIS ATTENTION.

                      Hi there...                                                                                      9.

                        I understand that, Henry, but she s a 
                      public defender, not a corrections 
                      officer---

                      You should be in here explaining to the 
                      warden how you lost his prisoner!

                                        CHERYL
                      My explanation is apparently when you 
                      leave your prisoner to go pee pee, you 
                      have to tell the guard or they won t 
                      guard, which I thought they do 
                        automatically, but apparently not.

      BURT POINTS TO A MASSIVE STACK OF FILES ON THE CORNER OF

        THERE IS A HUGE OUTBURST OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: THE CHOLO 
        FIGHT HAS ESCALATED INTO A BRAWL, SEVERAL LAWYERS, FAMILY

      NINA BOLTS IN THE LARGE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE COURTROOM, 
        HER FILES STARTING TO SLIP OUT OF HER HAND, LOOKING 
        AROUND, GETTING HER BEARINGS. THEN THE SMELL HITS HER.

                      Date? I m sorry, is that all it was? Just 
                      dating? 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Well, Trent? Is that all it was?

        TRENT LOOKS CAUGHT, STARTS TO SPEAK...

                                        JUDGE NELSON (CONT D)
                      I m kidding, I don t give a shit. We re 
                      in court, people, not on Maury Povich. 
                      Defense, how do you plea?

                                        NINA
                      Your Honor, short recess? I just need to 
                      go resign. 



                                        END ACT I                                                                                    14.



                                            ACT II



      NINA STANDS AT THE SINK WITH MICAH, SPLASHING WATER ON 
        HER FACE. THREE BURLY MAINTENANCE MEN ARE IN A STALL 
        BEHIND HER, SNAKING THE TOILET AND PERIODICALLY GLANCING 
      BACK AT THE WOMEN. 

                                        MICAH
                      So what s the deal? Can you function?

                                        NINA
                      I m quitting, that s my deal. If this is 
                      the bottom of the ladder, I need to find 
                      another ladder. 
                              (to MAINTENANCE MEN)
                      Excuse me, large men? This is the women s 
                      bathroom. 

                                          MAINTENANCE MAN #1
                      We re trying to find the poopy smell. 

                                        MICAH
                              (to NINA)
                      Look, I don t know you, I ve only heard 
                      of you. People say you re a good lawyer, 
                      I don t care if you smashed Michael 
                      Bolton with a lamp--

                                        NINA
                      ELTON JOHN, and I didn t--I m sorry, who 
                      are you?

                                        MICAH
                      Micah. 

                                        NINA
                      And you are--? 

                                        MICAH
                      The Secretary of the Interior. 

      NINA STARES BLANKLY. 

                                        MICAH (CONT D)
                      I m an intern, second year law student 
                      and the only one besides you in that 
                      court room who doesn t want to convict 
                      your client.                                                                                     15.



                                        NINA
                      That s nice. Quick question: is Trent 
                      here every day? 

                                        MICAH
                      Yup. He s the new Deputy DA. Came in six 
                      months ago and started crushing every 
                      case. Charms all the judges  panties off.

                                        NINA
                      That is in his skill set. 
                                (then)
                      I can t believe this. I knock over one 
                      little $800,000 vase, and now I m living 
                      in some parallel universe with sewage, my 
                      ex and the girl from Some Kind of 
                      Wonderful riding my ass--I m sure you re 
                      nice--   
                                (turning towards WORKMEN)
                      I mean is this SOME KIND OF COSMIC JOKE?! 

                                        WORKMAN #2
                      ...we re just trying to find the doo doo 
                      smell.

                                        MICAH
                      Look, you re a Stanford law grad from a 
                      top firm---that s like this place getting 
                      a number one draft pick. Someone who can 
                      shake things up. Barry Bonds took 
                      steroids till his balls fell off, but 
                      nobody cared because he kept hitting home 
                      runs. Feel me?  

                                        NINA
                      I don t know this Barry fellow, but let s 
                      get back to that quitting thing. So, can 
                      I just tell you, or...?

                                        MICAH
                      Really? You re rolling over that easy? 
                      Where I come from, when you get wronged, 
                      you don t give up like some priss, you  
                      get revenge. You fight back. Do some 
                      damage. Trash the place. BE MEMORABLE.  

                                        NINA
                      Well, I do like being memorable. For good 
                      things.

                                        MICAH
                      Then get back in there. Have your way 
                      with that court. Make it your bitch, 
                      Bitch.                                                                                       16.



        BEAT. NINA TAKES THIS IN. 

                                        NINA
                      You are one spirited little lesbian. 

                                        MICAH
                      Who said I m a lesbian?

                                        NINA
                      Nobody. Me. I mean not me...I like your 
                      eye ring. Oh look, we re back.  

        SHE WALKS PAST MICAH AND EXITS. MICAH FOLLOWS HER OUT.



        COURT IS BACK IN SESSION. NINA AND MICAH ENTER. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Are we still on the payroll here? 

                                        NINA
                      Yes, thank you Your Honor. 

        SHE QUICKLY TURNS TO THE GROUP OF (MOSTLY MINORITY) 
        DEFENDANTS BEHIND HER FOR A FRANTIC POW-WOW. 

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Hector?

                                        HECTOR
                      Yes?

                                        NINA
                                (reading file)
                      Charged with...ohhh, you stuffed your 
                      wife in the chimney?

                                        HECTOR
                      I don t have a chimney.

                                        NINA
                      Did you stuff your wife in someone else s 
                      chimney?

                                        HECTOR
                      I don t have a wife.

                                        NINA
                      Is that because she s dead in a chimney?

                                        HECTOR
                      No. I am drunk driving. Hector Vasquez.                                                                                    17.



        MICAH QUICKLY HANDS NINA ANOTHER FILE.

                                        MICAH
                      Here, the file s mislabeled. 

                                        NINA
                      Sure, why wouldn t it be?

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                                (bellowing)
                      Let s boogie! How does the defendant 
                      plead?

                                        NINA
                      Not guilty, Your Honor. 

        THE JUDGE STOPS WRITING AND LOOKS UP AT NINA. SO DO TRENT 
        AND MICAH. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Really.

                                        NINA
                      What? Maybe he s not guilty. It happens.

                                        TRENT
                      The People request Mr. Vasquez be held 
                      without bail, this is his 3rd DUI 
                      offense.

                                        NINA
                      Defense requests minimal bail, as this 
                      man poses no serious threat. 

                                        TRENT
                      Except for the part where he drives 
                      drunk, nearly killing people. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      So ordered, bail is revoked. Next!

                                        NINA
                      Whoa, whoah. That s it? What about 
                      treatment options for his drinking?

        TRENT SCOFFS.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Eh, you re scoffing. I used to hate that. 
                      It s so condescending. And why should 
                      Hector go to jail? You didn t do time 
                      after the Sullivan wedding when you drove 
                      the car onto the lawn and declared 
                      yourself the  King of Awesome .                                                                                    18.



        TRENT S EYES WIDEN. NINA STARES RIGHT BACK.

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Ooo, it s like Hart to Hart:  ...and when 
                      they met, it was moyder!  Next case...

      SLOW CROSS-FADE OF THE 17 DEFENDANTS WHO VE BEEN DENIED 
      BAIL AND LEAD BACK TO JAIL...JUST ONE REMAINING. 

      NINA SITS AT THE DEFENSE TABLE, EXASPERATED. PISSED. 

                                        NINA
                              (to MICAH)
                      What is the deal with this judge? Does 
                      bail even exist in his mind as a legal 
                      concept?

                                        MICAH
                      Welcome to the machine. You got one more. 
                      Hey...

      NINA TURNS TO MICAH, WHO GIVES HER A LITTLE FIST SIGN, 
         FIGHT FOR THIS GUY .

                                        NINA
                      All right, this one s going home. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Okay, People vs. Hector Solanzo. Murder 
                      in the 1st degree. 

                                        NINA
                      Oh, fuck me.  

                                        TRENT
                      Request bail be revoked due to the 
                      heinous nature of this crime. 

                                        NINA
                      Well, being that I ve been able to review 
                      the case for all of 45 seconds, is there 
                      any actionable evidence against my 
                      client?

                                        TRENT
                      Mr. Solanzo s wife was found stuffed in 
                      the chimney of the residence they shared. 

                                        NINA
                      She could have put herself there. 

                                        TRENT
                      She had been stabbed repeatedly with a 
                      screwdriver belonging to Mr. Solanzo.                                                                                     19.

                      Good to know. 

                                        JUDGE
                      Bail is revoked, defendant is remanded, 
                      I m going to get some oxygen. Court 
                      reconvenes at 2 p.m.

                      Well. I batted a thousand. They all just 
                      went right back to jail. Did I even need 
                      to be here?

                      If there s anything what? I don t have 
                      anything. For you. From me. Anymore. 
                      Maybe your fiance does. Is that what you 
                      meant? Okay. Good talk.  

      NINA TRIES TO LOOK ASSERTIVE AS SHE WALKS AWAY. 



      NINA IS STRUGGLING TO FEED A DOLLAR BILL INTO A VENDING 
        MACHINE. SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON. NOTHING COMES OUT.  

                                        NINA
                      Oh, of course. OF COURSE.

        SHE REARRANGES THE STUFF IN HER ARMS SO SHE CAN PUSH 
        AGAINST THE MACHINE. PHIL QUINLAN ENTERS, A LEISURELY

                      You know what might help? Free corn nuts.  

      PHIL STEPS IN, THUMPS THE MACHINE. NOTHING. HE FAKE SPITS 
      INTO HIS HANDS, SMILING AT NINA PLAYFULLY. HE THUMPS IT 
        AGAIN. NOTHING.

                      Ahhh, my Fonzie s not working...

      PHIL THEN LOOKS OFF, BEHIND NINA, AS IF HE SEES 
        SOMETHING.

                      Whoa. Don t look, there s a man 
                      defecating against the wall.

      NINA LOOKS BEHIND HER. PHIL QUICKLY FEEDS A BUCK INTO THE 
        MACHINE.

      NINA SMILES AT HIM, IN SPITE OF HERSELF.                                                                                    21.

      PHIL THUMPS THE KEYPAD, WHICH IS LOADED WITH HIS DOLLAR, 
        AND A SNICKERS FALLS FROM ITS PERCH. NINA S MILDLY 
        IMPRESSED.

        SUDDENLY NINA UNLEASHES A FURIOUS PUNCH RIGHT INTO THE 
        PLEXIGLASS, WHICH FRACTURES INTO SEVERAL PIECES. A LOW-
        PITCHED BUZZER STARTS TO PULSATE LOUDLY. THEY FREEZE.

                      Ma am, you do not run this place, I run 
                      this place. And I decide who you see and 
                      whom you do not see. 

      NINA SOFTENS, SMILES SHEEPISHLY.

                                        NINA
                      Listen, I m sorry. I m not trying to be 
                        confrontational. This has been the worst 
                      day of my life. I mean just...surreal.

        BAILIFF JUST STARES AT HER.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                       Really, Nina? How can I help?  Okay, 
                      I ll tell you how. Do you know what 
                       habeus corpus  means? It means  show me 
                      the body . It means show me Juanita 
                      Cordona, whether she s in a cell or a 
                      closet or the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, or 
                      I ll have a federal judge break his leg 
                      off in your ass, and you can try getting 
                      another job in law enforcement with a 
                      civil rights violation on your resume.

      PHIL AND CHERYL ENTER THE COURTROOM AND SEE NINA.

                                        CHERYL
                              (to PHIL)
                      Aww, did we miss the crazy show?

                                        MORRIS
                              (to NINA)
                      That was a very compelling argument. Do 
                      you know what the word  bailiff  means? 
                      It s Latin for  every time you set foot 
                      in here, it would behoove you to make me 
                      feel very, very pretty . Or you will not 
                      enjoy this job on a plethora of levels. 
                                (then, suddenly)
                      ALL RISE!                                                                                    26.



      NINA JUMPS, STARTLED. CHAMBER DOORS FLING OPEN AND JUDGE 
        NELSON GOES TO THE BENCH. NINA STORMS UP TO THE BENCH. 

                                        NINA
                      Judge, I need to see my client and---

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      IF YOU EVER approach my bench again 
                      without permission, I will ship you to 
                      Pelican Bay in a Hefty bag. Get out of my 
                      face. 

        NINA, STUNNED, SLINKS BACK TO DEFENSE TABLE.  

                                        CHERYL
                              (to PHIL)
                      Nope. Crazy show s just starting.



                                        END ACT II                                                                                    27.



                                          ACT III


        COURT IS IN SESSION. SEVERAL PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE SEATED 
        BEHIND THE DEFENSE TABLE AS CHERYL MAKES AN OPENING 
        STATEMENT TO THE COURT, AN ORNATE SILK SCARF TIED AROUND 
        HER MOUTH AND NOSE LIKE A BANDIT. 

        A GROUP OF MAINTENENCE MEN IN COVERALLS AND POLLEN MASKS 
        ARE IN THE GALLERY, USING A LONG WOODEN POLE TO TAP THE 
        CEILING, OSTENSIBLY TO SEARCH FOR DEAD ANIMALS IN THE 
        CRAWLSPACE. THEIR LOUD TAPPING CAN BE HEARD THROUGHOUT 
        THE PROCEEDINGS. 

        TRENT, SITTING COOLLY AT THE DA S TABLE, STEALS A GLANCE 
      AT NINA AS SHE SITS DOWN IN BETWEEN PHIL AND MICAH. 

                                        CHERYL
                      So...the prosecutor s argument that my 
                      client, Mr...

        SHE TURNS BACK AND READS THE NAME OUT OF THE FILE.

                                        CHERYL (CONT D)
                      Gardner? Garnier? was deliberately trying 
                      to run over...the other guy...is a lie.

                                        Trent 
                      Objection. Bias. 

                                        JUDGE
                      Sustained. Continue.

        TAP-TAP-TAP...

                                        PHIL
                              (to NINA, re: Trent)
                      Let me ask you something. Why him? Why 
                      that? He s got about as much empathy as a 
                      mako shark. What made you say  that s who 
                      I want ?

                                        NINA
                      Look at him. He s a Trent. When a Trent 
                      likes you, you just like him back. You 
                      don t ask why. It s like a reflex.

                                        PHIL
                      Like gagging.

                                        NINA
                      I can t do this. This is gonna kill me.                                                                                    28.



                                        PHIL
                      Stop wallowing. 

                                        NINA
                      Who s wallowing? Clearly the universe is 
                      giving me every conceivable sign to get 
                      out of here. It s like  The Shining . 

                                        PHIL
                      Look, I get it. You didn t make partner. 
                      I know you liked the glass and marble and 
                      the money and the country club lifestyle, 
                      who the hell wouldn t? But I don t think 
                      that s you. 

                                        NINA
                      Oh, I could make it me. 

        CHERYL LIFTS HER SCARF, TAKES OUT GUM, PUTS IT ON A FILE.

                                        CHERYL
                      We will prove, Your Honor, that my client 
                      not only did not commit this crime, but 
                      is owed a huge apology. For real. 

                                        TRENT
                      Objection. That s just stupid. 

                                        JUDGE
                      Overruled. Agreed, but overruled. 

        TAP-TAP-TAP...

                                        PHIL
                      What I m saying is: what if this is what 
                      you re supposed to be doing? You re a 
                      fighter. 

                                        NINA
                      All lawyers are fighters.

                      These jackwagons? No. At one time Phil 
                      actually was. Talented, passionate. But 
                      he let the tide take him under. Now he s 
                      on autopilot, permanently mediocre.

                                        PHIL
                      I m sitting right here. What Micah s so 
                      tactfully trying to say is--That meltdown 
                      you had at your old job? It s legendary. 
                      Know why?                                                                                     29.

                      --because everybody in this place wishes 
                      they had the BALLS to take a stand like 
                      that. And I don t know if you noticed, 
                      but this operation is FUBAR. It needs 
                      balls. 

                                        NINA
                      Look, I appreciate your faith in my 
                      testicles, but you don t get it...

                                        PHIL
                      Oh, I get it. You d go back to corporate 
                      law in a second if anyone d hire you. You 
                      wanna practice the law you re good at, in 
                      a place that doesn t smell like a 
                      dumpster full of bad clams. And I want to  
                      race in the Indy 500. But I lost my car 
                      in a parlay wager over the Yankees/Reds 
                      series--

                                        NINA
                      I m sure there s a point here...

                      You wanna win so bad? Go win. Win here. 
                      Wipe that smirk of Trent s face.

                                        NINA
                      It s not a smirk. He s just handsome. 

                                        PHIL
                      Whatever. Go knock his ass out of the 
                      box. Beat the system.

                      I m not a crusader--

                      --then win for yourself.

        BEAT.

                      So on my first day of my new job I ve 
                      failed every client, gotten a pep talk 
                      about winning from a guy who gambled away 
                      his car and a sermon on testes from The 
                      Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. This day 
                      officially could not get more surrea--

          CRAAACK-CRASSHHHHHHHH.                                                                                     30.



        THE CEILING ABOVE THE WORKERS EXPLODES AND A MASSIVE 
        CLOUD OF DEBRIS SHOWERS DOWN INTO THE BENCHES OF THE 
        GALLERY.  GASPS AND SCREAMS FROM AROUND THE COURTROOM. 
      THEN SILENCE. 

        THROUGH THE DUST, WE REVEAL WHAT HAS FALLEN THROUGH THE 
        CEILING---A DEAD GUY IN AN ORANGE JAIL JUMPSUIT. 

                                        CHERYL
                      THERE HE IS! 
                                (mouths to Defenders  table)
                      Pay up, motha-suckas!



      NINA SITS AT THE DEFENSE TABLE WHICH IS STACKED WITH 
        FILES. THE GIANT HOLE IN THE CEILING LOOMS ABOVE. THE 
        GALLERY BEHIND HER IS A WEB OF YELLOW TAPE AND ORANGE 
        CONES. 

                                        Judge Nelson
                      Okay, people. Almost martini time. People 
                        vs...Juanita Cordona. Shoplifting. Plea? 

        JUANITA, A LATINA WOMAN IN HANDCUFFS, IS LED UP TO THE 
        DEFENSE TABLE. NINA LOOKS AT HER FILE.

                                        NINA
                              (to JUANITA)
                      Shoplifting diapers? So you have kids. 

        JUANITA NODS.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Who s watching them right now, husband?

                                        JUANITA
                      No, he left...he say I work too much. 

                                        NINA
                      I know that song.

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Miss Ward, what s the plea?

        SHE LOOKS OVER TO TRENT, WHO COOLLY GOES ABOUT HIS 
        PAPERWORK. SHE LOOKS TO JUANITA, THEN BACK TO THE JUDGE.

                                        NINA
                      You know what? From the looks of 
                      her...she s probably guilty.                                                                                     31.

                      Como?!

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Very well. Bail? 

                                        TRENT
                      Request bail of five hundred--

        TRENT LOOKS AT NINA, BACKS OFF A BIT.

                                        TRENT (CONT D)
                      People defer to counsel. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Really? That s sweet of you, Trent. 
                              (to NINA)
                      Counsel, where should I put bail?

                                        NINA
                      Seventy. Million. Dollars. 

        JUANITA LOOKS AGHAST. PHIL LOOKS AT MICAH. OH SHIT.

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                                (looking down at file)
                      For a shoplifting charge? 

                                        NINA
                      C mon. She s Mexican. We all know she did 
                      it. Seventy million bucks.  

        EVERYONE STARES AT NINA. TRENT RISES SLIGHTLY.

                                        TRENT
                      The People have no problem with that. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Shut up, Trent. Miss Ward, you re not 
                      about to have one of your little episodes 
                      are you? Should I duct tape the windows? 

                                        NINA
                      Oh right!  Cause I m crazy. Not at all. 
                      Hell, this job is easy-peasy, lemon 
                      squeezy. I don t need to actually TALK to 
                      these people before I help decide their 
                      fate. 
                              (to JUANITA)
                      I mean, you re guilty, right?

                                        JUANITA
                      Ummm, excuse me, can I talk to a 
                      different lawyer?!                                                                                     32.



                                        NINA
                      Your Honor, we can throw this one back in 
                      the pokey. Plenty of room. It s not like 
                      people are dying to get out of there---

      AT THAT MOMENT SHE LOOKS UP AT THE HOLE IN THE CEILING.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                                (pretend grimace)
                      Whoops. Too soon?

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                              (no longer amused)
                      Miss Ward, it s your first day here. But 
                      I will hold you in contempt.

                                        NINA
                      I m already in contempt...of a system 
                      that looks at a mom who allegedly stole 
                      diapers as a violent menace to society 
                      and wants to keep her in jail. Call me 
                      crazy, but at least where I came from we 
                      were practicing LAW. This is like a slow 
                      motion hate crime. 

                                        PHIL
                              (to MICAH)
                      Man, she really knows how to quit a job.   
                      Blaze of fuckin  glory. 

                                        NINA
                      She didn t steal liquor or jewelry or 
                      drugs. She stole diapers. So please: get 
                      this violent nutjob off the street. 
                      Juanita, can you afford 70 mil?

                                        JUANITA
                      No.

                                        NINA
                      Can you afford 70 dollars?

                                        JUANITA
                      No. If I had 70 dollars I d buy diapers. 

                                        NINA
                              (to JUDGE)
                      Then what s the diff? 

        JUDGE STARES KNIVES INTO NINA. SHE STARES RIGHT BACK AT 
      HIM. EVERYONE HOLDS THEIR BREATH. A MEXICAN STANDOFF. 
        (SORRY.)  A PIN DROPS.                                                                                    33.



                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Gimme a number.

                                        NINA
                      One. 

                                        TRENT 
                      Million? People concur.

                                        NINA
                      One dollar. 

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      One dollar. For bail. 

                                        NINA
                      Yep. 17 dollars less than the diapers she 
                      allegedly stole.

        JUDGE NELSON LOOKS AT HER.  

                                        JUDGE NELSON
                      Okay, Ms. Ward. Considering a dead man 
                      fell out of my ceiling today, I m feeling 
                      generous. We ll do it your way. But when 
                      Consuela winds up back here in three 
                      weeks for doing the same thing, we re 
                      gonna do it my way. Got that, Braveheart? 
                      Bail set at one dollar. 

                                        NINA
                      YES!!!

      NINA QUICKLY FISHES INTO HER POCKET, PULLS OUT A CRUMPLED 
        DOLLAR BILL AND SLAPS IT DOWN ON THE TABLE--POP! IT 
        STARTLES EVERYONE IN THE ROOM. 

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Bail is PROFFERED. BOOYA KASHAAA! I won a 
                      case! 
                              (to MORRIS)
                      Unhitch her!

        MORRIS LUMBERS OVER TO JUANITA AND UNCUFFS HER. 

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      You are going HOME tonight, muchacha! 
                      VAMOS A CASA! Yesss! In your FACE, 
                      justice system! Slipped one past the 
                      goalie, Trent-o.

        SHE REACHES OVER AND MUSSES TRENT S HAIR. TRENT RECOILS. 
      PHIL CAN T HIDE HIS SHIT-EATING GRIN.                                                                                     34.



        MICAH GUFFAWS, A LITTLE TOO LOUDLY. BURT BURIES HIS HEAD 
      IN HIS HANDS. JUDGE NELSON IS EXITING TO HIS CHAMBERS.

                                        JUDGE
                              (to TRENT)
                      Looks like your job just got very 
                        interesting, Trent-o. 

        TRENT TRIES TO SMILE, BUT IS CLEARLY PISSED. 



      NINA IS ON THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN. IT STOPS ON THE FIRST 
        FLOOR, DOORS OPEN...THERE STANDS TRENT, BRIEFCASE IN 
        HAND, JACKET OVER HIS ARM. THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR A 
        BEAT. TRENT THEN COMES ABOARD. 

        DOORS CLOSE. THEY RIDE IN AWKWARD SILENCE. ELEVATOR 
        STOPS. DOORS OPEN AND HE STEPS THROUGH, BUT HOLDS THE 
        DOORS OPEN. 

                                        TRENT
                      Look, I m sorry it s been a difficult---

                                        NINA
                      No no no, you do not get to pity me. If 
                      you re uncomfortable with me around, 
                      tough titty. 

                                        TRENT
                      I m fine with it. 

                                        NINA
                      Oh, you re not fine, Trent. You lost 
                      today. A dinky little shoplifting charge, 
                      but I KNOW you: it burns your ass. You 
                      want control. Over everything.  I wasn t 
                      malleable enough, so you found someone 
                      who is. Congratulations. But you re not 
                      going to have control here, Trent, 
                      because I like winning.  

        SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON. TRENT REMOVES HIS HAND FROM DOOR.

                                        NINA (CONT D)
                              (re: courtroom)
                      So you LOSE...
                              (re: herself)
                       ...and you LOSE. 

        A BEAT AS THEY BOTH STAND THERE. SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON 
        AGAIN. BEAT. NOTHING.                                                                                     35.



                                        NINA (CONT D)
                      Jesus, I hate these things. 

        TRENT CALMLY TAKES OUT HIS KEY CARD, LEANS IN---COMING 
          UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO NINA---AND SWIPES IT ACROSS THE 
      CODE AREA. THAT SCENT OF HIS. ELEVATOR BEEPS. HE STEPS 
      BACK OUT. 

                                        TRENT
                      Nina, you are a beautiful, brilliant 
                      woman. It s not that you weren t enough. 
                      It s that you re too much. I don t want 
                      someone I can control. I want someone who 
                      can control themselves. And I don t think 
                      I m alone on that one. 

      HE WALKS OFF. NINA IS FROZEN. ELEVATOR DOORS START TO 
        SLOWLY CLOSE. JUST AS THE DOORS SHUT, SHE SAYS QUICKLY...

                                        NINA
                      Stupid idiot says  what ---

                      THOUSAND BUCKS, BUDDY! And you can make a

                      We shouldn t be celebrating. Somebody 
                      died today. 
                                (then, to NINA)
                      And you, there s a thin line between 
                      gutsy and reckless. Service your clients

        ANGLE ON THE CLINKING GLASSES PARTING TO REVEAL--

      PHIL SITTING AT THE END OF THE BAR. HE S SMILING AT NINA.  
        SHE GRABS HER WINE AND HEADS OVER TO HIM. 

                                        NINA
                      You sulking  cause you bet on Burt?

                                        PHIL
                      No, I won.

                                        NINA
                      How s that?

                                        PHIL
                      I did a parlay--a little thing we 
                      degenerate gamblers do. I doubled down 
                      that you d get one over on Trent today. I 
                      had a hunch about you.

                                        NINA
                      A hunch, eh?

                                        PHIL
                      Sure. I gotta say, watching you up there 
                      gave me something to believe in again. 
                      Reminded me why we re all here. To fight 
                      for people who need us. Thank you.   

      HE SMILES. SHE CAN T HELP BUT RETURN IT.

                                        NINA
                      Well, I was just doing what I was trained 
                      to--
                                (realizing)
                      --wait, are you fucking with me?

      PHIL LETS OUT A CHUCKLE. 

                                        PHIL
                      Oh, yeah. Boy are you starved for 
                      validation. You should have seen your 
                      face!  Oh, I inspired you? Oh, oh...  
                      That was fantastic. I ve got your number. 
                      Could make a lot off a mark like you.

      NINA SHAKES HER HEAD, SMILING AS SHE WALKS AWAY.                                                                                    37.

                      I don t see that gambling problem going 
                      away anytime soon.

                                        PHIL
                      It s not a problem when you win.

      NINA DOWNS HER DRINK. 

                                        NINA
                      It definitely helps.

      PHIL SMILES AS NINA JOINS THE REST OF THE PD S DRINKING, 
        LAUGHING, UNWINDING... 

        BLACKOUT. END OF SHOW.*
