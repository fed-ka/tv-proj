To pop everything into place...    

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at
the end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because
it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on Cast, Locations and
Chronology pages) designate.

Notes: 

Cover:  "Tempus, Anyone?", Written by John McNamara [and]
Directed by Winrich Kolbe are all in large bolt print. The
remainder of the text is in Courier 10 (10 characters per inch)

   1  EXT. METROPOLIS STREET - DAY #1                           1   

      LOIS and CLARK walk, each awkwardly burdened with reams of
      wedding-related documents.

                                    LOIS
                    I can't believe it's next week.

                                    CLARK
                    I know.

                                    LOIS
                    The caterer needs a final head 
                    count, the band doesn't have a 
                    final song list... Clark, we're way 
                    behind.

                                    CLARK
                    We'd be way ahead if people'd just
                    stop trying to kill us.

                                    LOIS
                    Let's keep our fingers crossed
                    things stay quiet this week.

      They pass a police station where several WANTED POSTERS are
      pinned up.  One catches Lois' eye -- a bank camera photo of 
      a familiar face (minus the familiar beard): _Tempus_.  She
      pauses for just a second, as if recognizing it, then moves 
      on with Clark.


   2  EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY                              2   

      Lois and Clark walk.  She consults an actively-revised sheet 
      of names.

                                    LOIS
                    Is this the absolute, total and
                    final guest count?

                                    CLARK
                    Funny you should mention that.  I
                    ran into an old friend last night.

                                    LOIS
                    Ah, an old _girl_friend.

                                    CLARK
                    Lois, you're getting that sound in
                    your voice.

                                    LOIS
                    What sound?

                                    CLARK
                    Like any minute claws are gonna pop
                    out of your paws and I'll be
                    getting you a saucer of milk.
                    She's not worth it.  We dated in 
                    high school.

                                    LOIS
                    Smallville girl.  Here in the big

                                    CLARK
                    I told her I was getting married

                                    LOIS
                    Smart.  And she was...?

                                    CLARK
                    Really happy for me.

                                    LOIS
                    So happy she'd like to come to the
                    wedding.

                                    CLARK
                    How'd you know?

                                    LOIS
                    And how'd she take it?

                                    CLARK
                    She's kind of... insistent; just

                    not like I actually said she could

                                    LOIS
                    Let me get this straight.  You're
                    Superman. And your high school
                    girlfriend can push you around.

                    office.
                          (he starts off, she

                    Be careful.

      They kiss.  He ducks away.

      Riddled with bullet holes. Broken windows. Smoke pouring
      out, PEOPLE GAGGING as they exit.  SUPERMAN appears, moves
      to a BANK GUARD.

   4  EXT. STREET NEAR ALLEY - DAY                              4   

      Lois walks by and hears a 'Psssst' from the alley.  She
      stops, turns and a large GUN is aimed at her.  A finger
      appears and crooks her to come in.  She does.


   5  EXT. ALLEY - DAY                                          5   

      Lois is led in by TEMPUS.  Much as we remember him:
      arrogant, superior and armed to the teeth.  Only now wearing
      20th Century clothes.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Hi, Lois.  Remember me?

                                    LOIS
                    No, I --
                          (stops)
                    -- wait, the wanted poster.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Come.  I know I lost the beard but
                    I'm in politics now and Joe Average
                    doesn't trust facial hair.  Oh,
                    Lois, after all we meant to each
                    other, I'm not ringing any bells?
                    Then again, I suppose time
                    travel...

      And now he pivots, revealing H.G. Wells' time machine at the
      far end of the alley.  On it, his bag of jewels and gold
      from the bank.

                                    TEMPUS (CONT'D)
                    ... can be a real brain drain.  You
                    want to drop your things and step
                    onto the sled here?
                          (she hesitates)
                    Step on or be carried.  Makes no
                    difference to me.

      Frightened and annoyed, she sets her wedding plans down.

                                    LOIS

                    and work on my manners.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Really.  Why?

      Superman lands fast and reaches out to grab the gun from
      Tempus.  But Lois and Tempus are already DISSOLVING.
      Superman's hands pass right through Tempus.  Tempus laughs.
      He and Lois disappear in a BLAST OF LIGHT.                 (X)

      She and Tempus and the machine are gone.  He's alone.

      A FLASH OF O.S. LIGHT again and Lois, dazed, stumbles into 
      sight.  She's alone.  Barren trees, grey sky.  Wind.  Lois 
      looks around, trying to get her bearings.  Then sees 
      something that makes her go ice cold.

      A gravestone.  And chiselled on it:  LOIS LANE, 1967 - 1993.
      Tempus' LAUGHTER ECHOES through the cemetery.

      Tempus' LAUGHTER fades.  Lois stares at her own grave, numb.
      Then a man appears: sixtyish, mustachioed, bespectacled;

                    Please.  Sit.

                    Now, I'm going to tell you 
                    something.  And as I do, you'll 
                    begin to remember, like a dream 
                    recalled.  So close your eyes and

                    We met on an extraordinary

      Wells and Lois emerge.  She looks around.  People, cars, and
      store fronts all identify it as Metropolis.

                                    LOIS
                    It's Metropolis.

                                    WELLS
                    Look carefully.

      She does.  It is different.  Not Our Metropolis.  Garbage

                    A second Metropolis; a sibling

                    hidden from us by a curtain of 
                    space, now parted.

                           discovery)
                    A thousand details exactly alike --
                    and a thousand as startlingly

                    and I'm getting married next week.
                    Why does this keep happening?

      A GANG walks by, all wearing bolstered pistols.  Then across 
      the street she sees a MAN in a business suit with a shotgun 
      slung over his shoulder.

      Then up the street an OLD LADY, purse in one hand, machine 
      gun in another.  (General Rule: about a third of every extra

                                    TEMPUS (CONT'D)
                    The power to hold the world in your
                    fist.  Which is just what I'm going 
                    to do after I'm elected Mayor.

                                    MAJOR DOMO
                    Whoa, is this guy deep or what?              (X)

      Tempus' cell phone rings.  He flips it open.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Yes?

                                                    INTERCUT:


  16  EXT. METROPOLIS STREET - DAY                             16   

      A SPY who works for Tempus follows along behind Wells and 
      Lois, murmuring into his cell phone:

                                    SPY
                    Wells and Lane have linked up.
                    Looking very buddy-buddy.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Where are they going?

                                    SPY
                    Looks like the Daily Planet.

                                    TEMPUS
                    No doubt in search of a super-hero.
                    I love predictable behavior.

      TEMPUS OUT.  The Spy melts into the Crowd.  We pick up Wells 
      and Lois in mid-conversation:

                                    LOIS
                    Clark must be going out of his
                    mind.

      They pass a MAN who pulls a gun and is handed a wallet by 
      ANOTHER MAN as if it were the most natural thing in the 
      world.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    We've got to get back...

                                    WELLS
                    Our only hope is to get Tempus' 
                    machine.  To that end, I've begun 
                    piecing something together out of 
                    odds and ends...

      He extracts what looks like bits of a walkman jury-rigged to 
      a radio.

                                    WELLS (CONT'D)
                    It's not finished but if I can get 
                    it to work, it _should_ home in on 
                    the flux capacitator in Tempus' 
                    dimensional transport, assuming it 
                    has one.


  17  EXT. DAILY PLANET - DAY                                  17   

      Lois and Wells come around the corner.  She sees the Planet 
      and heaves a sigh of relief.

                                    LOIS
                    Well, at least this world isn't
                    _completely_ nuts.

      A banner has just been unfurled-over the face of a nearby
      building.  It has a huge picture of Perry and says: PERRY 
      WHITE FOR MAYOR.

                                    WELLS
                    In fact, there even may be some
                    hope.

                                    LOIS
                          (looking off)
      More than hope.

      She points across the crowded street.  Clark is walking 
      toward them.  Different glasses, a more subdued style of 
      dress -- but it's Clark.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    Clark!

      He hears his name called and looks out at the sea of faces.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    Clark, it's me!  Over --

      She's cut off by a rapid report of GUNFIRE from down the 
      street.  Everyone drops low.  MANY pull guns.  A car SQUEALS 
      into view, the DRIVER shooting at a storefront, the MAN in 
      the store FIRING back.  The car then peels out of sight.

      Lois looks over at Clark and sees him in motion.  He ducks 
      behind a building -- then she hears a familiar O.S. WHOOSH.

                    Things can't be all bad.  Come on.
                    If he's anything like my Clark 
                    he'll be back inside mumbling some 
                    lame excuse.


  18  INT. PLANET - DAY                                        18   

      We start TIGHT ON 'Perry White, Editor,' etched on Perry's 
      office door, then REVEAL several new WHITE FOR MAYOR posters
      stacked nearby-- then PERRY WHITE himself steps right up to 
      a poster to give it the once-over.

      This Perry is a bit less dapper, more rumpled and denim-ed,
      like a 60's college professor.  But the poster has him in a 
      sharp suit and tie, hair artificially thickened.  Perry    (X)
      grimaces.

                                    PERRY
                    Now who did this?  That's not my
                    tie, not my coat... and that hair;
                    I look like Malvolean Dan Rather.            (X)
                    All right now, who in the Sam Hill 
                    messed with my poster?  Come on 
                    now, speak up!

      Lois and Wells step off the elevator and Lois smiles at 
      Perry's tirade.

                                    LOIS
                    Well, it seems like the closer we 
                    get to the bullpen, the more things 
                    get familiar.

                                    PERRY.
                    Who turned me into a pretty boy!

                    I did.

      Perry turns.  The room goes silent.  Jimmy steps out of the
      conference room.  Wearing a suit, tie... and mustache.

                                    PERRY
                    Mr. Olsen...

      Lois's jaw drops as she watches the following Bizarro World
      exchange:

                    Polls have shown you're skewing a
                    little old, White.  I talked to 
                    your campaign manager and we 
                    decided to run some new posters.  I 
                    like them.

      Lois moves toward the two, amused and amazed.  Wells trails.

                                    LOIS

                    Mr. Olsen, sir, I like Tarzan's 
                    hair and George Hamilton's duds 
                    much as the next fella but I'm just 
                    a Memphis word stringer... this 
                    ain't me.

                    It's a better you.  A younger you.  
                    Ever since you jumped into this 
                    race you've been way ahead and I

                    put a lot on the line for you,

      He drops his coffee cup.  It SHATTERS.

      Perry laughs and pulls her into a fierce embrace.

                    Coma.  Totally incapacitated.  Just 
                    came out of it yesterday and said, 
                    'Herb, get me to the Planet.' I 
                    naturally wondered _what_ planet 
                    and then she explained to me --

      She can't help herself.  As he moves toward the stairs, she 
      runs to him and practically flies into his arms.

                    You and Superman.

      Before he can respond, she kisses him on the lips.  His eyes
      go wide.  Then he gently but firmly pushes her off.

                    Superman?

      She looks at him, dumbfounded.  At that moment, a striking 
      woman of twenty-nine steps off the elevator.  Looks at Lois
      with a sharp territorial anger.  This is LANA LANG.        (X)

                    Lois Lane.  And still a bit

                    Obviously the Lois of this
                    dimension died before Clark arrived
                    in Metropolis.

                    And there's no Superman.  He didn't
                    even know who that was.

                    Well, your Mom made them...

                                    CLARK
                    But the Kents died when I was ten.

      They stop.

                                    LOIS
                    Oh, Clark, I'm sorry... Who raised you?

                                    CLARK
                    I kind of bounced around.
                          (off her look)
                    It's okay, it was a long time ago,
                    I'm fine.

                                    LOIS
                    Are you?

      A moment.  They look at each other.

                                    CLARK
                    This is the weirdest feeling.  I 
                    know I shouldn't talk to you, I 
                    _know_ I should just walk away 
                    but...

                                    LOIS
                    What?

                          (studying her)
                    ... I can't.

      Then a HARSH BEEPING from Wells' tracking device and he 
      steps up to them, elated.

                                    WELLS
                    It works!  The tracking device,
                    it's locked onto Tempus' transport.

                    It's good TV!  Fun for the whole

                                    LOIS
                    It's not a ski suit -- I mean, it
                    _is_ but it's more than that --
                    it's a symbol, you're making 
                    yourself into a beacon.

                                    CLARK
                    Are you always like this?

                                    LOIS
                    Sorry, I'm a little high-strung.

                                    CLARK
                    Lady, you're a Stradivarius.

                    Maybe this'll help.

      She hands him the bag.  He takes it.  She pulls her wallet 
      out of her purse and shows him a picture of Superman.

                                    CLARK
                    That's... what I'm afraid of.

      He flips to another photo:  Lois and Clark.

                    I guess so.  It was a long time
                    ago.

                    Car wreck.  I saw it happen.  I was
                    pretty fast, even then, but... not
                    fast enough.  Lana said I                    (X)
                    shouldn't blame myself.  One man 
                    can't really make a difference... 
                    no matter what kind of powers he 
                    has.

                                    LOIS
                    I know things are different here.
                    I know _you're_ different.  But 
                    trust me... powers or no powers... 
                    one man can change any world.

      He flips back to the picture of Superman.

  54  INT. CLARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           54   

      Lois on the phone, at the dining room table, surrounded by 
      bolts of red and yellow cloth, a sewing machine.  Littered 
      at her feet, a half dozen red-and-yellow S's -- crooked, 
      mis-sewn or otherwise botched and discarded.  In the kitchen
      behind her, a huge kettle is bubbling and steaming.

                                    LOIS
                    Look, Jimmy -- sorry, Mr. Olsen --
                    I think it's a bad idea for Perry 
                    to debate Tempus tomorrow..

      She gets up and moves to the boiling pot.  Grabs a pair of tongs.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    No, I certainly don't want him to 
                    look like a coward but Tempus said 
                    he was going to kill Perry...  No, 
                    he didn't say where or when.

      With the tongs she fishes a boot out of the caldron -- it's
      soaking wet and dyed bright red.  She lets it drop back in.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    But if there's anybody in the

      She hangs up and glimpses a photo of Lana and Clark, arms  (X)
      around each other.  She turns away from it and sees another 
      one.  She shakes her head.

                    I've gotta get out of here.

      She hears the sounds of Clark struggling O.S.

      She moves so she can see him.  He straightens up.  All we
      see is his head.  Bit of cape and shoulders.

                    I just remembered something; from
                    that picture.  It's in that trunk
                    over there.

      She moves to a trunk.  Kneels and opens it.

                    My Mom gave it to me when I was

      She takes out the S.  Smiles.  Looks back at her aborted
      sewing attempts.

      Lois is waiting out here alone.  Then she hears him come
      through the door.  She turns.  He stands there, backlit:
      Superman.  He takes her breath away.  She just stares.

                                    SUPERMAN

      Tempus drops the rock and bolts for the door.  A CROWD of 
      PEOPLE do the same.  He fights his way through.

      In the melee, Domo and the Thugs are distracted.  Lois 
      stomps on-Domo's foot and belts him.  Perry slugs one 
      gun-toting Thug, Jimmy the other.  Lois runs onto the stage 
      past Superman and picks up the fallen Kryptonite, hurling it 
      away from him.

      Meanwhile, the cameras all focus on Tempus and Wells in the 
      throng trying to escape.

      Weak, Superman gets to his feet and picks up the bomb.  He

                                    WELLS
                    Well, Tempus is taken care of and 
                    all is right again in both 
                    universes.
                          (to Lois)
                    Except for you, my dear.  Are you
                    ready?

      After the briefest hesitation, looking at Superman --

                                    LOIS
                    Yes.

                                    WELLS
                    We're in the alley across the
                    street.
                          (holds the door for her)
                    Right this way.

      A last look between Lois and Superman.  Then she moves off.
      Wells looks at Superman.

                                    WELLS (CONT'D)
                    I must say, my boy, I envy you.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Me?  Why?

                                    WELLS
                          (gestures to the crowd
                           outside)
                    With every eye upon you, every 
                    breath held in anticipation, you 
                    hold in your hands a world waiting 
                    to be shaped.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    So why am I so scared?

                                    WELLS
                    What do you think Shakespeare meant
                    when he wrote, 'In apprehension how 
                    like a god'?  Have your
                    apprehensions, Clark, but know that
                    you've found your true destiny.
                    And in you, a once-hopeless world
                    has found its future. Good luck to
                    you.

      Wells claps his shoulder and moves off.


  81  EXT. PLANET - DAY                                        81   

      Wells moves through the crowd.  Then, a moment later,
      Superman steps out and is greeted by CHEERS and CRIES.
      Swarmed.  As Perry, Jimmy and The Former President wave    (X)
      from the podium and give him the thumbs up.


  82  EXT. ALLEY - DAY                                         82   

      Across the street from the Planet.  Lois is near the
      dimension machine, watching.  Wells comes through the crowd
      surging around Superman.  They take a moment to regard him.

                                    WELLS
                    He's quite a man, the Clark Kent of
                    this world.

      She nods.  Across the sea of people, Superman and Lois lock
      eyes.  Wells sees the tears Lois is fighting.

                                    LOIS
                    I just wish he didn't have to be
                    alone...

                                    WELLS
                    The hardest lesson of all is that
                    love can be so fair to some, so
                    cruel to others.
                          (looking at Superman)
                    Even those who would be gods.

      Then Wells and Lois move onto the machine together.  WE PAN
      AWAY, see a FLASH of lights O.S.                           (X)

      The Superman of Our World is just exiting the alley Lois
      disappeared from in the Tease.  He looks utterly defeated.
      Then -- Lois, Wells and the machine materialize.  He       (X)
      whirls.  She jumps off.                                    (X)

      They run to each other and embrace.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Oh, my God, are you all right?

                                    LOIS
                    I'm fine, I'm fine...

                                    SUPERMAN
                    What happened?  You were gone for
                    almost ten seconds.

                                    LOIS
                    Ten seconds?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    The weirdest ten seconds of my 
                    life.  I didn't know where you 
                    were, what to do and then.,..

                                    LOIS
                    What?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    ... I just got this feeling.  Of 
                    what my life would be like if I 
                    lost you.  Surrounded by people,
                    mobbing me, telling me they loved 
                    me but... without you it was... so 
                    lonely.

      They embrace, tight.

                                    SUPERMAN (CONT'D)
                    What happened to you?


  84  EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ALLEY - DAY                          84   

      Lois comes out with her wedding papers.  Clark is one step 
      behind, straightening his tie.

                                    LOIS
                    A long story.  I'm just glad to be
                    back.

      A cop car pulls to a stop.  COPS get out and Tempus is 
      pulled from the back in handcuffs.

                                    TEMPUS
                    You bone-headed backward

                    _this_ dimension, anyway.

      Lois gives Tempus a wave.  He glares.

                                    TEMPUS
                    I won't forget this!

                    Let's go ahead and invite her.  I
                    think I have a pretty good idea why 
                    it didn't work out between you two...
                          (looks at him tenderly)
                    ... and why it'll _always_ work 
                    with us, no matter how crazy the 
                    world gets.

      They kiss and exit frame.  REVEAL Wells in the crowd,
      observing, a paper cup of tea in his hand.  He checks his 
      watch, smiles and moves off.
