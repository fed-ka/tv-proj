      Kids milling on campus before the bell signals the end of 
      freedom.  The usual scene   jocks and cheerleaders holding 
      court...and on the outer edges   the nerds.   We focus on one 
        unfortunate-looking FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL.  She sits alone, 
      watching the popular kids play hacky sack, laugh, flirt.  As 
      we SLOWLY PUSH IN, we hear voice-over: 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    I wasn t one of those kids who 
                    thrived in high school.  I was kind 
                    of geeky.  Alright, I was very 
                    geeky.  Plus, I had the unfortunate 
                    nickname of  Pits  due to the severe 
                    case of flop sweats I got during 
                    debate club finals, the one and only 
                    time I was on stage in front of the 
                    whole school.  So yeah,  high school 
                    was rough.  But you know what got me 
                    through?  The knowledge that I would 
                    outgrow all those feelings of 
                      insecurity, and inadequacy and at 
                    some point, I d blossom into the 
                    secure, confident, kick-ass person I 
                    was always meant to be.

      And suddenly the Frizzy-haired Girl looks up, through the 
      chain link fence, and stares at the camera. 

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    What are you looking at, loser?

      And now we re outside the chain link fence, with our 25-year old 
      heroine, EMILY BARNES...the source of the voice-over, our P.O.V.  
      Emily used to be frizzy, now she straightens.  She used to be 
      chubby, now she diets.  She used to be uncool, now she s...well, 
      she has straighter hair and she s slimmer.   Emily s wearing a 
      jacket over hospital scrubs.  On her feet, clogs. 

                                  EMILY
                    I m not a loser.  I was just 
                    thinking about high school and --

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    You look like a loser.

                                  EMILY
                    No, I don t! 
                          (then, insecure)
                    Is it the shoes?  Because these are 
                    just work shoes.

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    It s not the shoes --                                                                                      2.


                                  EMILY
                          (a little desperate)
                    Then what?

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    It s just...you.

                                  EMILY
                    What does that mean?

      The Teenager rolls her eyes as the bell rings.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Don t roll your eyes!  Why do I 
                    look like a loser?

      The Teenager starts walking towards the school.  Emily 
      follows after her (outside the fence), quite worked up:  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Hey!  Stop!  You can t just say 
                    that to someone! Come back here!  
                    You come back here right now!


      An upset School Official is pointing away from the school.  
      Emily hurries off, embarrassed:

                                  EMILY
                    I m really sorry.  I m just a 
                    little on edge...

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    So, yeah.  I m still kind of 
                    waiting for that confident, kick-
                    ass thing to happen.


      Emily walks up to the imposing hospital, going over the ACLS 
      ( Advanced Cardiac Life Support ) Code under her breath...

                                  EMILY
                    Airway, breathing, circulation, 
                    look for pulse, Compressions, IV, 
                    O2, monitor, Stable V-tach: 
                      Amiodarone 150mg IV, Compressions--

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Stop.  You know it.  You can do this.

      And she s at the entrance.  She stares at the smooth, white 
      fa ade, daunted.                                                                                         3.


      She glances back at the high school across the street.  Then, 
      she looks back at the hospital... her future.  One deep 
      breath and she enters...


      DR. IMELDA ANDAYA (a tiny little Asian girl whose short 
      stature and sweet face mask the fact that she s a thrill 
      seeking badass -- in and out of the ER) is waiting with a 
      team of two ER interns and Will.  Emily approaches, 
      breathless.  Dr. Andaya looks at her.  

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry, I couldn t find my pager--

                                  DR. ANDAYA
                    What would Mount McKinley say if I 
                     couldn t find  my crampons?
                          (off Emily s confusion)
                    I don t care!  That s what the 
                    mountain would say!

      Before Emily can respond, an ambulance pulls up, a police car 
      close behind.  The ambulance doors swing open and two men 
      (early 20 s, brothers) are unloaded. One of them is more 
      seriously injured (DAN, 25,  clean cut, wearing a thick down 
      jacket); the other has superficial injuries (LEO, full sleeve 
      tattoos, piercings, 27).                                                                                        19.


      An EMT TECH (30 s, burly) starts talking as he wheels Dan 
      into the building.  

                                  EMT TECH
                    Motor vehicle accident. Multiple 
                      fractures, possible c spine trauma.  
                    Car was smoking, brother got him 
                    out.  BP stable, oxygen 92, blood 
                    alcohol level .13--  

      Dr. Andaya motions to her Interns, barking out commands: 

                                  DR. ANDAYA
                    Trauma 2, order a CT, get neuro 
                    down here STAT.  And be careful! 
                    Move that neck a millimeter, he 
                    doesn t walk.

       Almost as an afterthought she turns to Will and Emily: 

                                  DR. ANDAYA (CONT D)
                    Babysit the other guy until ortho 
                    shows up.

      The second EMT wheels Leo over to Will and Emily.  The right 
      side of Leo s face is bloody and swollen and his right arm is 
      hanging at an angle.  Leo is distraught.  

                                  LEO
                    My brother, is he going to be okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Just try to relax.  We won t know 
                    anything for a little while --

                                  LEO
                    It was last night.  We were 
                    drinking last night. We woke up 
                    early to get back into town, we 
                    didn t feel drunk--

      Leo sees a COP (30 s, tough) approaching.  

                                  LEO (CONT D)
                    I did that to him.  I was driving.  
                    Oh god, if he dies --

                                  WILL
                    You should stop talking...

                                  LEO
                    No.  It s my fault.  

      The Cop slaps a handcuff on Leo, attaching him to the gurney.                                                                                    20.



      Emily and Will are waiting in the darkened room, behind 
      glass, as the Radiologist takes a CT of Leo s shoulder.  
      Light shadows flicker across their faces from the imaging 
      computers.  It s strangely intimate.  Emily glances at Will. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Just do it.  Just tell him.                                                                                    26.


      A beat, as she tries to get up the nerve.  But she can t.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Okay, I m going to move over a few 
                    inches so our shoulders are  
                    touching.  If he doesn t move, then 
                    he likes me.

      She gathers her courage.  And we watch as she moves, ever so 
      slightly over.  A little more... A little more... Until 
      finally their shoulders are touching.  A beat. Will doesn t 
      move!  Emily looks elated.  Then:

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Wait, maybe he doesn t feel it.  If 
                    he looks at me.  If he looks at me, 
                    I ll know he likes me.

      Will feels her eyes on him.  Looks over, smiles.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Say it, say it, say it --

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Will?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah?

                                  EMILY
                          (losing courage)
                    Nothing.

      Meanwhile, Ike enters from behind.  He looks at the monitor:

                                  IKE
                    Multiple fractures.  Sweet.

      And... the moment is officially broken.


      To reveal Cassandra and Emily watching this interaction from 
      behind the window.  Emily looks at Cassandra, moved.  Beat.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Okay, that look on your face?  
                    That s the reason I didn t tell 
                    anyone in high school.  I don t 
                    need your pity.  And just because I 
                    had a sick brother doesn t mean I m 
                    not a bitch. 

                                  EMILY
                    Trust me, I know.  You re a huge 
                    bitch.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Thank you, I appreciate that.

      Despite themselves, the girls share a smile.  Then:

                                  EMILY
                    But why are you?  Such a bitch to 
                    me?  What did I ever do to you?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Oh come on.  You really need me to 
                    say it?
                          (off Emily)
                      Everything always came so easy to 
                    you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    I mean, not the looks thing or the 
                      popularity thing, but the school 
                    thing --

                                  EMILY
                          (disbelief)
                    You were... jealous?

                                  CASSANDRA
                      I wouldn t say jealous.

                                  EMILY
                          (absorbing this)
                    You were.  You were jealous.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    If you ever repeat that, I ll deny 
                    it.  And I ll probably spread a 
                    nasty rumor about you.

      Emily laughs.  The moment is interrupted by Emily s pager.  
      She checks it.  Her expression changes:

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  EMILY
                    My patient... she s still insisting 
                    I m in on her surgery.
                          (realizing, elated)
                    I m gonna be in on a surgery...

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Good luck.
                          (Emily smiles, then)
                    Don t freeze up the way you froze 
                    up during the debate club finals.  

                                  EMILY
                    I knew you stole those cards!

                                  CASSANDRA
                    You know, you really need to get 
                    over high school already.

      Emily takes this in. 

                                  EMILY
                    That s true.  I do. 
                          (then)
                    But just admit it.  Please.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Eh, it s been so long, who can 
                    remember?                                                                                    55.


      Emily shakes her head.  And off the small d tente...


      Emily scrubs in next to Gina.  Gina is cold.  Still angry.  

                                  GINA
                    You watch.  You don t talk, you 
                    don t touch.

      And with that, she strides into the O.R.


      Emily is taking off her blood spattered surgical gown.  Gina 
      is scrubbing down.  A beat, then:

                                  GINA
                    So you didn t completely embarrass 
                    me in there.

      Emily turns, surprised by the compliment.  Gina puts out her 
      fist for a fist bump and Emily, thinking she s trying to 
      shake her hand, ends up shaking Gina s fist.  It couldn t be 
      more awkward.   Gina shakes her head and walks off.  Emily is 
      mortified once again.  But in the scheme of things, an 
      awkward fist-bump/handshake just isn t that bad.  She smiles.


      Emily heads outside.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Well, you know what?  I m done 
                    feeling stupid and insecure about 
                    feeling stupid and insecure.  

      She crosses the street, heading towards her car.  A voice 
      from behind:

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL (O.S.)
                    Hey.  You re a doctor?

      Emily turns.  It s the Frizzy-Haired Teenager from the 
      opening scene.                                                                                      63.


                                  EMILY
                    Yes, I am.

                                  FRIZZY HAIRED GIRL
                    Huh.  That s pretty cool...

        Vindication!  Emily grins, watching as the Frizzy-haired girl 
      heads off.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The truth is, I think part of being 
                    an adult is that you stop waiting 
                    for yourself to change and you 
                    start to accept who you are.

      And then she sees them.  Standing by the fence, in front of 
      the school.  Will and Cassandra.  They are talking, laughing, 
      their heads close together.   Flirting.  They clearly have 
      chemistry.  A knife in Emily s heart.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Oh, who am I kidding.  It s got to 
                    get better than this.  Right?

      And we... SMASH TO BLACK.
