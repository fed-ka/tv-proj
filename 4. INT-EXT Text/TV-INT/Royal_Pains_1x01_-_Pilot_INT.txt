Tucker, I m gonna start the Factor 
VIII, which I hope will get you 
clotting.  OK?  

But Hank gets no response.

HANK (CONT D)
Tucker?

Hank shakes him and gets nothing.  He checks his pulse again.

LIBBY
 What s  God! my Ohhappening to 
him?!  

Hank ignores her and starts talking it out with himself.  
Thinking.  Processing.

LIBBY
(at a total loss)
Beck s?  

HANK
He probably contused his heart and 
bled into the pericardial sac.

LIBBY
What?  What are you talking about?!

HANK
His heart is being squeezed and not 
circulating blood to his brain.  He 
needs the fluid drained, but 
because of his hemophilia, I could 
kill him trying to save him.

And Libby realizes she knows nothing about medicine.  Beat.  
But she trusts this guy.  

LIBBY
Please, Hank.  You have to save 
 It s  him.Tucker.

Hank knows what that means.  He is her world.

HANK
I need:  A bottle of vodka.  A very 
sharp, pointed knife.  A bic pen, a 
sandwich baggie, and duct tape.
(Libby processes the list)
Hurry, Libby.

Libby rushes off.  Hank cannulates a vein with the needle and 
tubing, and starts the clotting factor.  Libby races over 
with AN X-ACTO KNIFE, a bottle of 42 Below, and the rest.

Hank pours the vodka ALL OVER TUCKER S CHEST.

Hank gives Libby a look, then takes the knife and CUTS Tucker 
just under the breast bone.  There is A LOT OF BLEEDING, but 
work. to goes Hank  stirs. hardly Tucker  manageable. it s

LIBBY
What are you doing in there?

HANK

Libby goes white.  She looks at Hank in holy-shit disbelief.ROYAL PAINS - PILOT - GOLDENROD REVISED - 9/19/08 57 


HANK (CONT D)
there. I m OK,

Hank dissects the soft tissue away from the pericardium with 
HIS FINGERS.  Libby gags.  

HANK (CONT D)
Let s pray he s started clotting.  

Hank sees that Libby was already praying.  He takes the knife 
and cuts the pericardium.  CLOTS and BLOOD start POURING OUT.

LIBBY
(losing it)
OH NO, he s bleeding!  We re 
killing him!

HANK
WAIT.

Hank scoops the last of the clot out with his finger, feeling 
a now-vigorous heartbeat.  He takes the barrel of the BIC pen 
and places one end in the pericardium.  

He uses duct tape to seal the incision site and secure the 
pen.  He opens the baggie and tapes it over the cut and pen, 
against the skin.  A trickle of blood drains into the bag.

And then Tucker starts to stir...and his eyes suddenly open. 
He tries to get up, but he can t.

HANK (CONT D)
Just take it easy, pal.

TUCKER
(re: his chest)
Oww.  What the hell just--

LIBBY
Tucker!

She starts kissing him again, not letting go for anything.  
Hank slumps and reclines on the floor, completely spent.  
alert. he s but out, freaked bit a and pain in is Tucker

HANK
Libby helped out big-time.  And 
braved through it pretty well, for 
a cyberchondriac.  

Libby beams at Hank.

TUCKER
Glad you two bonded while I was 
unconscious.

Did you cap it off with martinis?

Libby smiles big -- her Tucker s back.

HANK
Libby, now call 911.

TUCKER

LIBBY

TUCKER

Hank and Divya walk towards the RECEPTION NURSE, who has her

MS. NEWBERG
No, a flat tire.

She opens her fur coat, revealing ONE GIANT PROTRUSION on the 
left side of her chest.  The right side is...flat.

Oh.

Post-op.  Newberg sits in front of her triple-panel vanity
