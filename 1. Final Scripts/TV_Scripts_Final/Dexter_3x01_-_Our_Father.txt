                        This is going to sting a little.  

    He inserts the syringe into Dexter s mouth.  Dexter doesn t 
    even wince.

                        Well, I managed to keep busy...

    The following will be INTERCUT with Dexter talking to the 
    Dentist.

22EXT. CARNIVAL - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 1 

    A man, CAL ROONEY (50s), runs through the dark and eerie 
      silhouettes of this shut-down attraction.

                                        DEXTER S VOICE
                        I went to the carnival a couple of 
                        weeks ago.

    Rooney s cell rings.  He hears Dexter on the line.

                        Turn right.

    Rooney, smart guy that he is, turns left.  Dexter emerges 
    from the liquid shadows and pierces his neck with the 
    syringe.  Rooney collapses, dropping his cell phone.

                        Even won a prize.

    He drags Rooney away.  

    On the cell phone lying in the dirt.  Dexter s gloved hand 
    comes into FRAME and picks it up.

    Rooney on the table, bathed in soft blue light.  PAN from 
    his cell phone, attached by a cord, to a FLAT SCREEN TV. 
    It s maybe a foot above his face.  Rooney awakens.  Orients.

    THE TV SCREEN plays images - shot by Rooney s cell phone - 
    of carnival patrons.

                        You run the sideshow at the carnival, 
                        guessing people s age and weight. 

    Rooney, under the guise of checking their I.D.s, records 
    their driver s licenses on his phone.  There s Dexter in the 
    b.g.  Eating cotton candy, watching him.

                        Then you confirm your  guess  by 
                        checking their I.D.s.  And soon enough 
                        you re breaking into their homes.

                        One dies of a heart attack.  Another 
                        you kill outright.  And the carnival 
                        just moves on.  Perfect... Until it s 
                        not.

    Dexter slices his cheek.  Makes a bloodslide.

                        So, you re what?  Fifty-two years old,

44EXT. CARNIVAL - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 1  

    Dexter carries ominously laden trash bags from a building 
    with the sign:  Family Fun House.  

    He approaches the open hatch of his SUV and drops the bags 
    in.

                        Not a problem.

    Dexter makes breakfast for the kids.  He plunks pancakes in 
    front of CODY.  Turns to ASTOR.

    Dexter s moved by the innocence of this request (and the

    bedroom.  The living room is arrayed with all the toys the 
    dope game provides:  jumbo flat screen, a sectional 
    Barcalounger, state-of-the-art sound system, framed posters.  
    Freebo looks up from bowling on his X-BOX 360; gives Dexter 
    the up-and-down.

    Dexter looks to the back door, making a mental note.  Then - DEXTER 301      "Our Father"    Final Collated      6/23/08          13.

    He mashes the buttons on his controller; releasing the 
    virtual bowling ball.

    ON SCREEN:  the ball hits the pins, leaving a 7-10 split.

    Just then, TEEGAN, 21, a once chipper Coed who s let blow 
    steal her beauty, emerges from the bedroom.  Her look is not 
    so dissimilar from that of the two murdered Coeds, save a 
    streak of purple in her hair.

    Dexter looks through the large front window, watching 
    Teegan.

    As Dexter emerges, Teegan gets in her VW and tears away.  
    Dexter nods to Wendell, climbs into his car and goes.

    INT. ABANDONED CRACK HOUSE - EVENING - NIGHT 21616

    Dexter ducks under police tape and enters this shit-hole 
    where hopes, dreams and junkies go to die.  It s a far cry 
    from the faux-cool of Freebo s place.  The floor is littered 
    with dingy mattresses, drug vials and trash.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

                        ... do what I have to do.

    HIGH ANGLE TIME LAPSE as Dexter creates his kill room.  He 
    wrangles a large work light into place, turns it on and we 
    see the kill table.  Prepped and waiting.  Then he pivots 
    the light, briefly illuminating the photos of the two 
    murdered Coeds.  This is their shrine.

    Bathed in neon, Deb stands at the counter sugaring up her

    EXT. FREEBO S STREET - NIGHT 21818

    A reprise of our shot from earlier.  PULL BACK to include 
    Dexter in his car.  He takes a deep settling breath and the 
    car moves forward.  POUNDING MUSIC UP.

    INT. FREEBO S HOUSE - NIGHT 21919

    ON THE WINDOW INSET of the back door.  The glass vibrates 
    with the music.  Dexter s face appears.  He picks the lock 
    and enters.  Checking the syringe in his cargo pants, the 
    MUSIC still blaring, he peeks into the bedroom.  Then he 
    turns into the living room, and stops. 

    FREEBO IS ENGAGED IN A VICIOUS KNIFE FIGHT WITH A STRANGER 
    (Latino, mid 20s).  

    DEXTER WATCHES IN FASCINATION as this lethal pas de deux 
    takes place in front of the wall-to-wall wide screen TV.    
    A Music Video fills the room with MUSIC and EERIE LIGHT.

    THE STRANGER SPOTS DEXTER S REFLECTION in the large front 
    window and hesitates long enough for Freebo (never seeing 
    Dexter s face) to flee.  

    THE STRANGER ATTACKS DEXTER.  It s a violent, life-and-death 
    struggle.

    THE STRANGER WHIPS DEXTER against the front window; Dexter 
    banging his head so hard that his new temporary crown is 
    jarred out of his mouth.  He s stunned for just a moment. 

    THE STRANGER HURLS DEXTER INTO THE WINDOW AGAIN, this time 
    cracking (but not breaking) it.  Finally, in this desperate 
    face-to-face battle, Dexter gets the upper hand and expertly 
    PLUNGES THE STRANGER S OWN KNIFE INTO HIS CHEST.  

    With seconds to live, the Stranger hisses:DEXTER 301      "Our Father"    Final Collated      6/23/08          17.

    He lets the Stranger drop, already dead.  Then, as he 
      desperately searches for his lost crown, the door buzzes.

    Dexter grabs the knife, scans the floor one last time, and 
    bolts out the back door.  THE MUSIC STILL POUNDING.

    Dexter enters; in a state somewhere between confusion and 
      wonderment.  He begins disassembling the kill room.

    MUSIC STILL ROARING from inside the house.  Wendell 
    approaches from down the block, swigging on a brown-bagged 
    forty ouncer.  Dexter s car cruises into the shot.  He looks 
    to the house.

    He turns her over.  Now he s on top.  And we sense an 
      abandonment in his love-making.  It s simple, intimate and 
    beautiful... but beneath it all lies an urgency born of what 
    Dexter s been through this night.

    As they finish, Rita kisses him warmly.  But Dexter glances

    of Freebo s house on the board; a silhouette of the victim 
    by the front window.

                        Prelim has the victim, Oscar Prado, 
                          twenty-six, dead...

    He hesitates.  LaGuerta nods for him to continue.

                                        BATISTA
                        ... dead from a single stab wound to 
                        the chest.  The deceased s brother, 
                        A.D.A. Miguel Prado informed me at the 
                        scene that Oscar went to confront one 
                        Fred Bowman, street name Freebo, about 
                        selling drugs to some Youth Club kids.  
                        Morgan?

    Deb rises to her feet.

                                        DEBRA
                        This Freebo is the same punk who 
                        killed those two coeds in the 
                        Everglades and got away with it.  Way 
                        it looks, Oscar Prado died a hero.

    Dexter reacts.  Deb checks her notes.

                                        DEBRA
                        Our team found a shitload... er, 
                          substantial amount... of drugs in the 
                        house.

    She sits back down; pleased with herself.

                        That part of town isn t exactly police

                        It s not on or near the premises.  We 
                        checked the roofs, sewers and trash 
                        bins in a five block radius.  Our 
                          conclusion:  the assailant took it 
                        with him.

    LaGuerta takes this in.  Looks to Dexter.

    ON A TELEVISION - LATER - DAY 3A30A30

    CLOSE ON MIGUEL PRADO in front of a bouquet of microphones

                        My parents brought my brother Ramon 
                        and me to this wonderful country when 
                        we were young boys.  We left Cuba and 
                        Castro for the American Dream.  My 
                        youngest brother, Oscar, was born here 
                        in Miami... and he died here.  With 
                        his death, it s tempting to say the 
                        American Dream has turned into a 
                        nightmare.

                        But I don t think of Oscar s death as 
                        a nightmare.  I think of it as a wake-
                        up call.  An alarm ringing loud and 
                        clear that we have to come together.  
                        That we must break the cycle of 
                          violence...  That we will do better.

    EXT. TAQUERIA - DAY 33333

    A simple but popular outdoor restaurant.  FAMILIES.  TEENS. 
    OLD-TIMERS slapping down dominoes.  A BLACK GUY (ANTON, 
    early 30s) plays guitar nearby. 

    Deb approaches with a drink.  Sits beside Anton.

                          information on my dead brother?

    Busted, Dexter takes his time in answering.

                                        DEXTER
                        Like you, sir, I wanted to understand 
                        what happened here.  I thought knowing 
                        the details of your brother s life 
                        would help me make sense of his death.

                                        MIGUEL
                        In your line of work, Mr. Morgan, is 
                        it usual for you to get so involved?

    Miguel catches himself, smiles.

                                        MIGUEL
                        Sorry.  I sounded like a prosecutor 
                        just then, didn t I?

                                        DEXTER
                        Not a problem, sir.  And no, I don t 
                        usually get so involved.  This one, 
                        this death... got to me.  

    Miguel takes a reflective beat.

                                        MIGUEL
                        It all seems so unreal that he s 
                        just... gone.

                                        DEXTER
                        Yes, I m sure it does.

                        So, Mr. Morgan, a man dies and what s 
                        left?  A soul?  Which is what exactly?

                                        DEXTER
                        I really couldn t tell you.

                                        MIGUEL
                        Some say the soul lives on forever.

                                        DEXTER

    Dexter chews on this.  Sorting it all out.  

                                        DEXTER
                        My father died when I was in my

                        Somehow living inside you?

    Before Dexter can answer, Miguel s gaze is drawn back to the 
    blood-dark stain where his brother died.

                                        MIGUEL
                        I should have been there for him.

                                        DEXTER
                        You can t blame yourself, sir.

                        Easier said than done.

    Dexter privately registers curiosity at this.

                        Do me a favor, Mr. Morgan?  If you 
                        want to get to know my brother like 
                        you say, come to his wake tonight.  
                        Come see how much and how fully he was 
                        loved.

    Dexter nods his acceptance.  Miguel smiles and shakes 
    Dexter s hand.

                        He touched so many people, so many 
                        hearts.

    The Mayor, the D.A. and others surround him.  As they do, he 
    spots Dexter and nods.  After the dignitaries pay their 
    respects, an Old Woman in a wheelchair approaches.  Dexter 
    watches as Miguel has time and humility for her.  Truly a 
    man of all the people.

    INT. THE BLUE ROOM - EVENING - NIGHT 34242

    An old-time cop tavern.  Deb at the bar, looks up.

    HER POV:  dozens of photographs of cops who have passed on.  
    In front of each frame is a tiny shelf with shot glasses on 
    each one.  Deb s gaze lands on the photo of Harry.  

    Deb is lost in thought as the Bartender comes by. 

                                        DEBRA
                         Nother cranberry juice.

                        No, Jeez.  I like the fucking taste, 
                        okay?

    The Bartender fills her shot glass with cranberry juice.  
    Deb looks to the clock.  It s almost eight.  Then to the 
    door.  Finally, she toasts her father and downs her drink.

                                        DEBRA

    Wow.  Dexter holds his gaze for a long beat.  Then his cell 
    phone vibrates.  He checks the readout:  Deb.  Dexter 
    presses  ignore .  He looks back to Miguel.

                        It s okay.  My brother was a good man.  
                        But I can t say he suffered from the 
                        tragedy of perfection.

                        Who indeed?

    He moves off to talk with Ramon.  Dexter watches as the 
    brothers hug.  Then he finds himself drawn to the coffin.

    HIS POV:  Oscar Prado in his forever silent repose.

    So tired of it all, his shoulders sag.  Miguel notices 
    Dexter s emotional reaction from the other side of the hall 
    and, affected, starts toward him.  Just then, his arm is 
    grabbed by LaGuerta, who s just arrived.

    Dexter turns and sees Miguel talking with LaGuerta.  His 
    phone buzzes again.  Deb again.   Ignore  again.  Dexter 
    slips out a side door.  DEXTER 301      "Our Father"    Final Collated      6/23/08          46.

    The door opens.  Deb looks up expectantly.  It s Batista.  A 
    frolic of laughter and music floats in from the Salsa Club 
    across the way.  Batista takes the stool next to her and 
    orders.

    The Bartender pours him a drink.  He toasts Harry s photo 
    and slugs back the shot.  Then he looks to Deb s glass.

    Deb hovers as Masuka gestures to the girl s neck.

                                        MASUKA
                        Strangled.

                        Ergo, no blood.  I m the blood guy.  
                        Why call me in?

    Masuka turns the body over.

                                        MASUKA
                        Because of this.

                        Looks like the evil-doer had an 
                        agenda.

                                        DEBRA
                        Maybe it was a tattoo or something.

                                        BATISTA
                        Whatever.  Dex, we need to know if 
                        this was ante or post-mortem.

    Deb, still annoyed with Batista, moves away.  As she does, 
    Dexter s gaze shifts from the mutilated shoulder to the 
    girl s face.  He draws a quick breath of recognition.

    The victim is Teegan, Freebo s coked-out Coed girlfriend, 
    complete with the purple streak in her blonde hair.

    ON DEXTER.  Intrigued, excitement growing.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Freebo s still in Miami.

    A slight grin creases his lips.  He raises his camera to 
    hide his face, and clicks off a few shots.

    INT. POLICE STATION - DEXTER S INNER LAB - DAY 44848

    Dexter studies Teegan s crime scene photos on his laptop.   
    He taps a few keys and Freebo s image comes up.

    ON DEXTER.  Back in his comfort zone.

    He looks through the blinds, sees LaGuerta leave her office.

    INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 44949

    LaGuerta crosses to Batista at his desk.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        You talk to Morgan?

                        There were curse words involved.

    She drapes his gold shield around his neck.  Batista proudly 
    examines his new badge, as others come up to congratulate 
    him.  Deb, still pissed at Batista, hangs back as Dexter 
    pats Angel on the shoulder and leaves.

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON - DAY 45050

    Rita sways to the romantic song she s listening to.  She s 
    making a fresh batch of chocolate pudding, while leafing 
    through her Hotel Management brochures.  A dollop of pudding 
    spills onto the counter.  She scoops it up with her finger 
    and, still moving to the music, sucks it clean.  

    INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - LATE DAY - DAY 45151

    Dexter in the chair as the Dentist finishes implanting that 
    pesky crown.  Dexter smiles broadly.  Whole again.  

    INT. POLICE STATION - LAGUERTA S OFFICE - EVENING - NIGHT 45252

    LaGuerta at her desk.  Paperwork.  She looks up as her squad 
    finishes for the day.  Deb gets in the elevator.  

    INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/ELEVATOR - EVENING - NIGHT 45353

    Deb jabs the  down  button.  Batista calls out.

                                        BATISTA
                        Hold the elevator.

    Deb does and Batista enters.  An awkward beat.  Then -

                        Asshole.

    She eyes the new gold shield, allows a smile.

                                        DEBRA
                        Oh, sorry... Sergeant Asshole.

    Batista grins, then leans out of the elevator.

                                        BATISTA
                        Masuka, Ramos, Quinn.  Vamonos!  We

    The others join them.  Festive and ready.  

    INT. POLICE STATION - LAGUERTA S OFFICE - EVENING - NIGHT 45454

    LaGuerta still at her desk.  She looks up as the elevator 
    doors close.  Neither Batista nor any of the others even 
    thought to invite her.

    EXT. THE BLUE ROOM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 45555

    Deb pulls up.  There s Yuki, perky and bright.

                                        DEBRA
                        You so have the wrong person.

                                        YUKI

                        interest to I.A.

                                        DEBRA
                        When I said you had the wrong person?  
                        I meant me.  These people aren t just 
                        badge numbers to me.  They re my 
                        friends; my family.

    And just like that, Yuki s lightness evaporates.

                        Ssh, you hear that?  That s the sound 
                        of your shield calling for help.

    She goes.  Deb looks after her, then heads for the bar.

    Dexter sits in his car, thinking.

                        Harry said that what was inside me

    He steps out of the car, breathes in the night air.

    Rita s at the counter, scooping whipped cream onto the 
    pudding, still grooving to the song.

    Rita looks at the pudding and draws a sharp breath, 
    realizing something.
