      INT. LIBRARY - CROWN DISPLAY - RESUME SCENE FROM PART 1

      Flynn's bleeding out.  The Assassins approach.  He tries to
      rise but he's slipping in his own blood.  

      DROP into FLYNN'S POV.  Everything's blurry.  The approaching
      killers are more shapes than men -- 

      -- and then another SHAPE arrives and TAKES THEM DOWN. 
      Through Flynn's POV we can't see much, but it's brutal. 
      Bones break, bodies fly.

                                      FLYNN
                    ... Baird ... ?

      Flynn's vision CLEARS.  Judson stands above the two Assassins,
      mild as ever.  He adjusts his tie, pulls Flynn up.

                                      JUDSON
                    I'm flattered, but no.

                                      FLYNN
                    How did you do that?

                                      JUDSON
                    I'm sure I have no idea what you're
                    talking about.  Now come along, let's
                    find the others.
                          (beat)
                    It's time to go.

      INT. LIBRARY - STACKS - MOMENTS LATER

      Stone and Ezekiel haul-ass as they're chased through the
      maze of books.  Stone's cut off by an Assassin, drops the
      man but another Assassin steps in.  They're pinned.  

      Baird appears anddrives an elbow into the man's temple.  

                                      STONE
                    Where you been, Mary Poppins?

                                      BAIRD
                    We need to regroup!

      They rush back through the stacks.

      INT. LIBRARY - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS

      Lamia surveys the sprawl of the endless Library.  Cassandra,
      beside her, is unhappy.  An Assassin whispers an update.                                                                                        2.

                                      LAMIA
                    Good news.  We found the others.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Did you really have to ... do that?

      Lamia brandishes Excalibur.

                                      LAMIA
                    You've seen the power the Librarians
                    have been hiding down here.  How
                    much knowledge is locked away, far
                    from the people it can help the most?  

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You're saying, you're the good guys?

                                      LAMIA
                    Who sometimes have to do bad things. 
                    But now, with your marvelous gift,
                    we're use the Library's wonders to
                    change the world.

      Lamia puts her arm around Cassandra.  Utterly genuine.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    But first, we're going to cure you. 
                    Like we promised.

        Overwhelmed, Cassandra fights back tears.  Lamia looks down
      at Excalibur. She's plainly deciding if it's time to kill
      Cassandra yet.

      INT. FLYNN'S WORKSPACE - THE CARD CATALOG - MOMENTS LATER

      Baird, Stone and Ezekiel arrive as Judson examines Flynn's
      wound.

                                      FLYNN
                    Lamia got the crown.   She used it
                    to control Excalibur.

                                      BAIRD
                    You should be dead.  

                                      FLYNN
                    I keep bleeding like this, I will be
                    dead soon.  Human body contains 8
                    pints of blood, I've lost -- oh,
                    sometimes knowing everything really
                    sucks.

                                      STONE
                    We gotta find Cassie.                                                                                        3.

                                      FLYNN
                    She let them in.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    The kid?  No.

                                      JUDSON
                    No time for this.  You have to run. 
                    The Serpent Brotherhood cannot have
                    this Library.

      Stone moves up on Judson.

                                      STONE
                    You knew about the prophecy.  
                          (off Flynn)
                    The prophecy on the crown predicted
                    when it came to the Library, you'd
                    die.

                                      FLYNN
                    You knew -- Why didn't you warn me?

                                      JUDSON
                    You know I can't tell you everything.

                                      FLYNN
                    Well this time your little white lie
                    got me stabbed!  'Cal's gone, the
                    Library's overrun!

      Baird eases Flynn up, Stone and Ezekiel supporting him.

                                      JUDSON
                    Go.  Deeper into the Library than
                    you've ever been.  Find the doors.  

                                      FLYNN
                    We're not leaving the Library to
                    them.

                                      JUDSON
                    Trust me --
                          (Flynn snorts)
                    -- trust me to make arrangements. 
                    Now go. 

      Flynn leads them  out, leaning on the others when necessary. 
      Judson waits until they're gone.  He takes out his old-style
      pocket watch.  He checks the time.

      He places the watch on a desk and SMASHES it.  As DEEP BELLS
      TOLL throughout the Library, Judson takes a seat.  Waits.                                                                                        4.

      INT. LIBRARY - DEEP STACKS

      Flynn and the others are in impossibly high, narrow BOOK
      STACKS.  The ones Ezekiel and Stone were running through
      earlier, those were big but normal.  These are too damn high. 
      The intersections go on forever.  

      Ezekiel spots a title, double-takes. He pulls an old
      MANUSCRIPT off the shelf even as they hurry forward.

                                      EZEKIEL
                      Shakespeare's play "Cardenio."   
                    This is an unpublished Shakespeare
                    play.
                          (looking around)
                    How big is this Library?

                                      FLYNN
                    As big as we need it to be.

      He's cut off by the sound of the BELL. 

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    The fail-safe countdown.  No.

      ASSASSINS spot them.  Baird leads the others down another
      winding set of stacks, losing their opponents in the maze.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Stone, what did the prophecy say,
                    exactly?

                                      STONE
                    When the Crown of Arthur came to the
                    Library, the Librarian would fall.

      Flynn realizes, tries to turn back

                                      FLYNN
                    Not me.  I wasn't Librarian when
                    that prophecy was made!

                                      BAIRD
                    That prophecy's a thousand years
                    old.  Whoever that Librarian was,
                    he's long dead.

                                      FLYNN
                    I don't think he is!  JUDSON!

      The ASSASSINS swing back into view.  They run off again.

                                      BAIRD
                    Flynn, what happens when the countdown
                    hits zero?  Flynn?                                                                                        5.

      INT. LIBRARY - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS

      Lamia is freaked right out.  She's shouting to her men. 

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What do you mean "the Library is cut
                    off from the outside world?"

                                      LAMIA
                    Get out!  Grab what you can and get
                    out!

      LAMIA grabs Cassandra, drags her away.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You mean locked doors or --

                                      LAMIA
                    Look around you, girl!  Can anything
                    this big really lie just underneath
                    the streets of New York City?  No,
                    the Library exists in its own pocket
                      dimension, anchored to our reality
                    here at this single physical place.

      As they run off:

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    And the First Librarian just cut the
                    anchor chain.  

      INT. THE CORRIDOR OF DOORS - CONTINUOUS

      Flynn and the team stumble into a truly ancient-looking dark
      corridor.  The walls are, improbably, lined with DOORS.  Old
      doors, new doors, iron and wood, stretching off for an
      eternity.  Some of them are too high in the wall to even
      reach.  Above them, other corridors CRISSCROSS the open space
      above this corridor.  They have to shout to be heard over
      the BELLS.

                                      BAIRD
                    What now?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Four bells!

                                      FLYNN
                    I don't know, I've never been this
                    deep in the Library --

                                      STONE
                    Three bells.                                                                                        6.

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson will know!

                                      BAIRD
                    He's not coming!

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson's always here --

                                      BAIRD
                    He's not coming!

      She's cut off as ASSASSINS appears behind them.  They run as
      a ROAR builds up, like a WATERFALL getting closer.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Two bells! Pick a door!

      The Assassins are on them, Baird kicks one, they lurch
      forward, the Corridor seeming to almost SPIN --

      Flynn grabs a door and THROWS it open.  Nothing but BLACKNESS
      beyond but Ezekiel LEAPS without hesitation. Flynn grabs
      Stone and Baird, PULLS them through the door as the last
      Bell TOLLS, the last ring hanging in the air, building instead
      of fading, rising with the ROAR --

      EXT. FOREST - DAY

      A DOOR sits in the woods.

      It's not in a wall, or even the remnants of a wall.  The
      doorframe stands in the woods, alone.  The frame is sturdy,
      maybe a little more hand-made than one might expect.  The
      door, however, is perfectly ordinary.   

      There's a growing ROAR.  It builds, builds --

      The door FLIES open.  Flynn, Baird, Ezekiel and Stone tumble
      through it from ... nowhere.

      As soon as they hit the ground, the Door SLAMS shut.

      They stumble to their feet.  Flynn grabs the door handle.

                                      BAIRD
                    What.  The.   Hell?

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson!  Judson!

      He throws the door open.  Nothing on the other side.  Not a
      void, just the forest.  He can walk through the empty frame.                                                                                        7.

                                      STONE
                    Where are we?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    When are we?
                          (off Stone)
                    It's day.  We time-travelled. 

                                      FLYNN
                      Time-travel, ugh, time travel's not
                    all it's cracked up to be. 
                          (looks down)
                    Hey, that is a lot of blood.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Let's not panic.  There's a logical
                    way to approach being trapped in the
                    past.  

                                      STONE
                    Okay.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    We find the local king.  Tell him we
                    have powerful magics, invent a steam
                    engine, and he gives us a duchy. 
                      Eventually we use our superior
                      technology to take over the land.

                                      STONE
                    ... you have put a lot of thought
                    into that.

      Baird's looking at her cell.

                                      BAIRD
                    I hate to break it to you, King Jones
                    the First, but I've got cell
                      reception.  American carrier.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course, we didn't travel through
                    time, just space.  We came west --
                    it's night in New York, but the sun's
                    still up on the West Coast.

                                      BAIRD
                    GPS coming online.

      Flynn does the latitude trick with his fingers.

                                      FLYNN / BAIRD
                    Latitude puts us in Oregon. / Oregon.                                                                                        8.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hah, still got iiiiiit --

      Flynn stumbles, semi-conscious.  Stone and Ezekiel grab him.

                                      BAIRD
                    He needs a hospital, now.  
                          (off cell)
                    Road's that way, but I don't see a
                    hospital.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    He's bleeding real bad.

                                      BAIRD
                    So we'd better move then.

      Baird sets off ahead to trailblaze.  Ezekiel looks at Stone.
      Stone shakes his head.  Flynn's not going to make it.

      EXT. OREGON HIGHWAY - DAY - LATER

      They break through the treeline.  Damn well in the middle of
      nowhere.  Baird looks at the empty highway.

                                      BAIRD
                    C'mon, c'mon, a little luck.

                                      JENKINS  (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      JENKINS stands by a CLASSIC TRUCK parked by the side of the
      road.  He's in his 50's, oddly formally attired.  A suit, a
      waistcoat, just ... odd.

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    Your friend does not look well.  You'd
                    be needing a ride, then?

                                      BAIRD
                    Yes, I'm Colonel Eve Baird, this is
                    Flynn Carsen.  Stone and Jones, look,
                    can we talk on the road?

                                      JENKINS
                    No need to talk.  I hate to pry into
                    people's business. 

      As they load into the truck:

                                      BAIRD
                    What were you doing out here?

                                      JENKINS
                    Waiting.  I do that.                                                                                        9.

      EXT. OREGON HIGHWAY - DAY - LATER

      The truck makes its way into the main highway artery bisecting
      the city of Portland.  But instead of heading into the center
      of the city and a hospital ...

      EXT. OLD NEIGHBORHOOD - PORTLAND - CONTINUOUS

      The truck picks its way through the old original waterfront
      area of Portland.  Trains still move through here, the
      buildings date back to the bad old Shanghai Tunnels days.

      IN THE TRUCK Flynn struggles to stay awake.

                                      FLYNN
                    Where are we?

                                      BAIRD
                    Almost to the hospital.

                                      JENKINS
                    The hospital?  No, no, why on earth
                    would we bring him to a hospital?
                    Ah, here we are.

      EXT. ANNEX - LATER

      The truck stops outside a century-old ramshackle BRICK
      BUILDING.  Jenkins hops out, fishes out HEAVY KEYS.  Baird's
      already on him as Stone and Ezekiel ease Flynn from the truck.

                                      BAIRD
                    We need a hospital because he's been
                    stabbed!  He's bleeding out!

      Jenkins unlocks the door and enters the building.

                                      JENKINS
                      A hospital won't do him any good. 
                    Wounds caused by Excalibur don't
                    heal.  Magic.

      Flynn pulls himself awake.  He lurches out of Stone and
      Ezekiel's grasp, stumbles after Jenkins.

      INT. ANNEX - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      Jenkins leads them through an old-style formal foyer.  Heavy
      desks, shelves with old FILES, a cross between an accounting
      firm and newspaper office from the early 20th century. 

                                      JENKINS
                    Sorry for the dust, hasn't been used
                    in ages, of course.                                                                                        10.

                                      FLYNN
                    How do you know about Excalibur?

                                      JENKINS
                    I know all about you, Flynn Carsen.

                                      FLYNN
                    Who are you?!  What is this place?!

      Jenkins unlocks the interior door.  He steps inside. Flynn
      leads the rest, his anger fueling him for the last few steps.

                                      JENKINS
                    Who am I?  I'm Jenkins, of course.

      INT. FLYNN'S WORKSPACE - "THE CARD CATALOG" - CONTINUOUS

      Jenkins flips the lights on as they walk into the room.  The
      team reels. 

                                      JENKINS
                    And this place, well ...

      They're in a double of Flynn's room back at the New York
      Public Library.  An EXACT duplicate, down to the stacks of
      misplaced files. 

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    ... you're in the Library.

      Flynn passes out.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        11.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT.  THE CARD CATALOG - LATER

      CLOSE ON FLYNN, unconscious.  A FINGER pokes him quite rudely.

                                      CHARLENE  (O.S.)
                    We're not paying you to sleep, Flynn.

      Flynn sits up and winces.  Baird's checking a FIELD DRESSING
      on his abdominal wound.  Charlene hovers.  Stone and Ezekiel
      explore the multiple levels of the Card Catalog.

                                      BAIRD
                    Don't move too much. 

                                      CHARLENE
                    I had a full DVR of DOWNTON ABBEY, a
                    half-full bottle of cabernet, and do
                    I get a nice night off?  No, I hop
                    on a red-eye to Oregon because some
                    weirdo calls to tels me the Librarian
                    is bleeding all over his good china.

                                      FLYNN 
                    What'd you cram in this dressing,
                    duct tape and glue?

                                      BAIRD
                    Yes, actually.  The bleeding won't
                    stop.  

                                      FLYNN 
                    Magic wound, from Excalibur.  It
                    won't heal.  Ever.

      Jenkins enters with a tray of tea.

                                      JENKINS
                    Hot tea for everyone.

                                      STONE
                    Don't suppose you got a beer?

                                      JENKINS
                    No, as this is the Library, not a
                    rodeo or hobo camp.  Or wherever
                    people like you might gather in
                    crowds.

                                      FLYNN
                    The Library -- we're back in the
                    Library.                                                                                        12.

      Flynn leaps up and rushes for a DOOR in the wall.  He flings
      it open to find ... a broom closet.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Where's the Library?  Where's Judson?

      Flynn almost collapses from the pain.  Baird tries to ease
      him down but he insists on standing, pacing angrily.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    This is the same room.  I swear it's
                    the exact same room.

                                      JENKINS
                    Of course it is.  The Library can
                    only ever be physically entered at
                    one place in the world.  What was a
                    Librarian to do if he needed access
                    to the knowledge of the Library, but
                    he was far from the door?

      Flynn gets it.

                                      FLYNN
                    It's an interface.  I mean, it's a
                    room, but like your phone screen
                    doesn't change depending on where
                    you connect to the internet, this
                      connection to the Library's shelves
                    always looks the same.

      Jenkins crosses to the Card Catalog itself.

                                      JENKINS
                      Precisely.  Name a book.  Something
                    you know is only in the Library.

                                      FLYNN
                    Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica,
                    the unedited edition.

      Jenkins riffles through cards. 

                                      JENKINS
                    Section F Row 9 Shelf AA2, right by
                    the shifty looking fellow.

      A GLOW on the shelf by Ezekiel, and suddenly an ANCIENT
      MANUSCRIPT materializes.  Ezekiel reads the title.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Isaac Newton, "The Mathematical
                      Principles of Natural Philosophy ... 
                    as Derived by the Wondrous Thinking
                    Machines of Atlantis"?!                                                                                        13.

                                      FLYNN
                    Like I said.  The unedited version. 

                                      JENKINS
                    I'm afraid, as Judson cut the
                    Library's connection to the physical
                    world, this is all we have.  Access
                    to information, but no way in or out
                    of the Library itself.  Tch.  Typical
                    Judson.  So rash.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Use that tone of voice about Judson
                    again and you'll be picking your
                    teeth out of that china set.

                                      JENKINS
                    I'm sorry, but Judson and I never
                    agreed on anything.  I understand
                    the Library is best used for research,
                    not gallivanting about fighting
                    monsters and seducing princesses.
                          (to Stone)
                    That Judson.  Had quite a way with
                    the Princesses in his day.

                                      FLYNN
                    I'm guessing that attitude is why
                    you're out here at this "Annex"
                    instead of the home office.

      Jenkins's plainly uncomfortable with this line of questioning.

                                      JENKINS
                    Perfectly happy here.  It's quiet, I
                    can focus on my work.  None of the
                    bother of ... the greatest collection
                    of magic in the world.

      An awkward beat.  Jenkins clears his tea set and storms off.

                                      CHARLENE
                    How did they get in?

                                      FLYNN
                      Cassandra.  They have leverage on
                    her.  I should've seen it earlier. 
                    Should've seen everything earlier. 
                    Why didn't Judson warn me?

                                      CHARLENE
                    Judson just trusted you to figure it
                    out on your own --                                                                                        14.

                                      FLYNN
                    Why did I not see somebody was killing
                    off the Librarian Candidates?  More
                    people dead because I just wasn't
                    good enough.

                                      BAIRD
                    You're opening your wound.

                                      FLYNN
                    It doesn't matter.  It won't stop
                    bleeding.  I'm going to die.
                          (over Baird)
                    Tell them.  

                                      BAIRD
                    I can pump you full of fluids, but
                    if it keeps bleeding, twenty-four
                    hours.  You're dead in twenty-four
                    hours.

      Flynn climbs the stairs, getting some space.  Charlene, Baird,
      Ezekiel and Stone exchange looks.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Isn't he in charge now?

                                      CHARLENE
                    Yes.

                                      STONE
                    This ain't good.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

        ESTABLISHING a high-end PRIVATE JET over the Atlantic Ocean.

      INT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

      Lamia pushes Cassandra forward into Galeas' workspace.  He
      comes around from behind his desk, delighted.

                                      GALEAS
                      Cassandra!  So glad you survived the
                    insane suicide plan of the Librarians.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Do we know if the others got out?

                                      GALEAS
                    Ezekiel and Stone?  I dearly hope
                    so.                                                                                         15.

      He sits by her, a trusted mentor.

                                      GALEAS (CONT'D)
                    You see the lengths the Librarians
                    will go to to hide the gift of magic
                    from the world.  Destroy anything,
                    anyone to keep their secrets.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    If you cure me ...

                                      GALEAS
                    When the key is joined to the lock
                    and magic returns to the world, we
                    can absolutely cure you.   

      ON LAMIA, a DAGGER dropping from her sleeve.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    ... you have to share it.  You have
                    to cure others, everyone who science
                    can't help.

      Galeas throws a look to Lamia.  When Cassandra glances,
      Lamia's dagger is already hidden again. 

                                      GALEAS
                      Cassandra, that's why you're here. 
                    To help us bring magic back to the
                    world, and help those who cannot be
                    helped by other means.   

      He stands, shakes her hand.

                                      GALEAS (CONT'D)
                    We're going to change the world. 
                    Now you'd best get some rest.

      Cassandra exits.  

                                      LAMIA
                    Why'd you stop me?

                                      GALEAS
                    New rug.  And, even with Excalibur
                    there are bound to be impediments
                    accessing the lock.  Having a
                      Librarian, even half a Librarian,
                    may prove useful.
                          (beat)
                    But mostly the rug.                                                                                        16.

      EXT. LIBRARY ANNEX - LATER

      Charlene finds Baird outside, keeping an eye on Stone and
      Ezekiel.

                                      BAIRD
                    They need Flynn to pull it together. 
                    They're too new to this world.

                                      CHARLENE
                    What about you?

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm a soldier.  Flynn's my assignment.

                                      CHARLENE
                    No, you're his Guardian.  That means
                    more than keeping him alive.  It
                    means keeping him in one piece,
                    mentally and physically.

                                      BAIRD
                    Didn't do a great job of that.

                                      CHARLENE
                    So he's been stabbed.  He's been
                    stabbed or shot or bitten or cursed
                    so many times in ten years I've lost
                    count.

                                      BAIRD
                    Charlene.  He's going to die.  Soon.

                                      CHARLENE
                    We're all going to die soon if you
                    don't get in there.  Look, action
                    hero, if you were out in Madagascar
                    or India or wherever and he fell
                    into a river, you'd reach in and
                    pull him out, right?  Before he could
                    drown.

      Baird nods.  Charlene's facade cracks for just a second.

                                      CHARLENE (CONT'D)
                    Judson was everything to Flynn.  To
                    both of us.  If he feels what I'm
                    feeling right now, he is drowning. 
                    Right now.  
                          (beat)
                    Go save him.

      Baird considers Charlene a moment.  Nods her curt soldier's
      nod, enters the Annex.                                                                                         17.

      INT. THE CARD CATALOG - MOMENTS LATER

      Baird enters, looks around.

                                      BAIRD
                    Flynn?

      She hears a noise from the upper level.  

      INT. THE CARD CATALOG - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

      Baird climbs the stairs to find Flynn sitting on the floor,
      his back against a bookcase, using it to keep himself upright. 
      He's already surrounded by a pile of books. (NOTE: This is a
      callback to the shot from the first movie, when he gets the
      envelope)

                                      BAIRD
                          (reading)
                    "Higher Dimensional Quantum
                      Translocation Theory, by Albert
                      Einstein".

                                      FLYNN
                    Unedited edition.

      Flynn notices he's smeared BLOOD on the book he's reading.  

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    I can get us back to the Library.

                                      BAIRD
                    Is that really where we should be
                    going?

                                      FLYNN
                    We have resources there, tools,
                      equipment, artifacts we need to fight
                    the Serpent Brotherhood.

      Baird slides down next to him.

                                      BAIRD
                    In the few days we've known each
                    other, I haven't seen you use any
                    tools, or magic equipment, no
                      artifacts.  Just your brain.
                          (beat)
                    That's why Judson chose you, right? 
                    Your brain's a weapon and a tool and
                    a Library all wrapped up in one. 
                    Judson chose you because in the end,
                    you don't need anything.                                                                                        18.

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson may still be alive.  The right
                    thing it do is find the Library.  

                                      BAIRD
                    If that were the right thing to do,
                    Flynn Carsen, you'd already be doing
                    it, not reading about it.  No, this
                    is your way of hiding.

      She considers the stacks.  Leans in close to him, almost
      cheek to cheek.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    I bet that's what you were like,
                    before all this.  You hid in books. 
                    That's the life from which Judson
                    pulled you.  That's what you were. 
                    Judson made you what you are.

      Flynn's silent.

                                      FLYNN
                    I am ... going to be dead in a day.

                                      BAIRD
                    Would Judson want you to waste one
                    second of your last day trying to
                    save him?

                                      FLYNN
                    He'd want me to save the world.
                          (winces)
                    One last time.

                                      BAIRD
                    So tell me, Librarian, how are you
                    going to do that?

      Another pause, this time they're so close --

                                      FLYNN
                    You are ... "KEY!"

      He struggles to his feet, rushes down the stairs.

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm "henge" and "key".  You charmer.

      INT. CARD CATALOG - MAIN LEVEL - CONTINUOS

                                      FLYNN
                    Key!  Key!  She called Excalibur a
                    key!                                                                                        19.

      Stone and Ezekiel enter at the shouting.  Baird descends
      behind Flynn.  

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Not "sword" or "weapon" but "key!" 
                    I mean think about it.  The Serpent
                      Brotherhood wants to bring magic
                    back to the world.  How are they
                    going to do that with one sword?

                                      BAIRD
                      Excalibur's pretty powerful.

                                      STONE
                    Still just a sword.  Excalibur versus
                    a tank or an F-15, I'm still betting
                    on the US Military.

                                      FLYNN
                    Right, so it's not the end goal,
                    it's a key.  And what does a key do?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Goes in a lock.

      Flynn throws the GLOBE back into the air.  The HOLOGRAM
      returns.  He studies it eagerly.

                                      FLYNN
                    And we all know the legend.  Excalibur
                    has been locked once before.  We
                    know it was pulled free -- 

                                      BAIRD
                    You must be feeling better.  You're
                    not making sense.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    The Stone.  The legend is, Arthur
                    pulled Excalibur from the Stone.

                                      FLYNN
                    After it'd been charged up with magic. 
                    Oh, of course -- The Sword in the
                    Stone and where is that Stone, Stone?

                                      STONE
                    If Arthur was Roman, in the largest
                    Empire settlement in Britain. 
                      Londinium.  Modern London.

      Flynn checks the Globe.                                                                                        20.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course and there's a ley line,
                    right under -- Come on, let's go.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Us too?

      Flynn looks to Baird.

                                      FLYNN
                    They have the most powerful weapon
                    in the world, Judson's gone, the
                    Library's gone, and I'm bleeding to
                    death.  Maybe working alone, just
                    this once, isn't the best idea.

      Flynn exits, passing Jenkins and Charlene as they enter. 
      Flynn kisses Charlene on the cheek.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Charlene, probably going to die, I'm
                    very sorry, I love you.  But in the
                    meantime please book us tickets to
                    London.

      And he's gone.  Stone and Ezekiel are already following Flynn. 
      Charlene looks to Baird as Baird passes.

                          (proud)
                    Look at him run.

      Charlene and Jenkins are left in Card Catalog. 

                                      JENKINS
                    There's a big glowy globe in my card
                    catalog.

      He waves at it.

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    Hello!  Turn off your giant globe!

                                      CHARLENE
                    ... look at him run.

      ON THE HOLOGRAM GLOBE, we focus on London and then ZOOM TO:

      EXT. LONDON - DAY - ESTABLISHING

      CHYRON: "LONDON"

        ESTABLISHING the city, the landmarks.  Ending on (STOCK) of
      the TOWER OF LONDON.                                                                                        21.

      EXT. LONDON - TOWER OF LONDON - CONTINUOUS

      Flynn, Baird, Stone and Ezekiel cross to the RAMPARTS, look
      out over the city.

                                      FLYNN
                    Right.  Magic Stone hidden somewhere
                    out there.  About 12 hours left before
                    I die, end of the world probably
                    coming sooner than that.  Full day
                    ahead.

                                      BAIRD
                    How do we find the Stone?

                                      FLYNN
                    We need a compass.

      He starts walking, they follow. 

      INT. TOWER OF LONDON - DISPLAY AREA - CONTINUOUS

                                      FLYNN
                    The Stone Excalibur was pulled from
                    is big magic, it'll attract every
                    other magic item in the city.

                                      STONE
                    So we just find another magic
                    artifact, rig it into a compass. 
                    Piece o'cake.

                                      FLYNN
                    Actually it is.  I happen to know of
                    another artifact.

      They stop at a GIANT GLASS CASE.  Behind which are:

                                      EZEKIEL
                    The Crown Jewels.

                                      BAIRD
                    We are not --
                          (lowers voice)
                    -- we are not stealing the Crown
                    Jewels.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course not.

      He points to another GEM in a nearby case.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    We need that one, Star of Marakesh.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        22.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    John Dee used it to protect Elizabeth
                    the First from magic assassination. 
                    Heh.  That's a story.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    So we're not stealing the Crown
                    Jewels.  We're just stealing a
                    priceless artifact from right next
                    to the Crown Jewels.

      Flynn slaps Ezekiel's shoulder.

                                      FLYNN
                    Not we.  You.  I finally understand
                    why you got your envelope.

      Ezekiel glares for a moment, then considers the Gem.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Vibration detectors on the glass,
                    and it's got a pressure plate, can
                    tell if the weight changes.  It's
                    actually not too difficult.

                                      BAIRD
                    Please, just, please do not make
                    this something too awful.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Not at all.  We just need to steal a
                      wheelchair.

      Ezekiel leads them off.

                                      BAIRD
                    God help me. 

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        23.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. LONDON - DAY - ESTABLISHING

        Re-establish the city.  

      INT. TOWER OF LONDON - CONTINUOUS

      At the display, Ezekiel is eating from a pack of jelly beans. 
      He does something odd: looks at the Gem, weighs the jelly
      beans in his hand.  

      Baird walks in, wheeling Stone in a wheelchair.

                                      BAIRD
                    I can't believe I'm doing this.

                                      STONE
                    Why not, Princess Di?  You been
                    pushing me around since we met.

      They approach the case.  Stone leans in to take a picture. 
      Baird pushes him forward ...

      ... the wheelchair SLAMS into the glass of the main display. 
      ALARMS SOUND.  Guards approach, but not too freaked out. 
      They can see what happened and Baird and Stone are apologizing
      wildly.  

      But as one Guard WIPES across Ezekiel, he disappears.  And
      all that's left in the Gem case is a bag of jelly beans.

      EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Flynn waits by the exit, chewing gum.  Ezekiel arrives with
      the Gem.  Flynn takes the Gem and presses his GUM onto it.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Yes, put your gum on a stone with
                    seven million euros.

      Flynn attaches a STRING to the Gem.  He lets it hang.

                                      FLYNN
                    Omnius arcunum directio.

      The Gem RISES, like a free-hanging pendulum, pointing off.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    That's pretty amazing.

      Baird and Stone RUN out.  Flynn and Ezekiel watch them pass.                                                                                        24.

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    He ... should not be running.

      They pile into a car.  Baird fires it up as more ALARMS SOUND.

                                      BAIRD
                    Where to?

                                      FLYNN
                    Follow the gem!

      They PEEL OFF as Guards exit the Tower.

      INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Baird looks in the rearview.

                                      BAIRD
                    About five minutes before the police
                    cars are on us.

                                      FLYNN
                    I can find the Stone in three.

                                      BAIRD
                    Then?

                                      FLYNN
                    Then we keep them from putting
                    Excalibur back into the Stone.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Why would they do that?

      BANG OUTSIDE THE CAR at that question, then drop DOWN THROUGH
      THE PAVEMENT ...

      INT. LONDON TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

      We're in very,very old tunnels.  Worked stone, not industrial. 
      Galeas leads Cassandra as if he's showing off his new house. 
      Lamia follows.

                                      GALEAS
                    It would be like a jump start.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Like jump starting a car.

                                      GALEAS
                    Exactly.  Excalibur is one of the
                    few great items of magic remaining. 
                    It contains unbelievable power.

      Lamia draws Excalibur.  It GLOWS in the darkness.                                                                                        25.

                                      GALEAS (CONT'D)
                    Power that was siphoned from the ley
                    lines of magic centuries ago.  Now,
                    those ley lines are dormant.  But if
                    we suddenly to shock them by returning
                      Excalibur's power back to the Earth,
                    it would begin a chain reaction. 
                    The energy would build on itself. 
                    Magic would spread back out through
                    the ley lines.  Magic would return
                    to the entire world.

      He pauses.

                                      GALEAS (CONT'D)
                    This was a river, you know.  The
                    Tyburn.  I remember when it ran
                      aboveground.  Through meadows.

      He sighs, leads them into a SECONDARY TUNNEL that's plainly
      being DUG OUT.  ASSASSINS work with construction equipment.

      INT. SIDE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

      They pass WORKLIGHTS and GENERATORS.

                                      GALEAS
                    We found the chamber holding the
                    Stone by using sonar.  Decided coming
                    in from the side was the best bet. 
                    Required drilling, air recycling,
                    but it's still better than coming in
                    from the top. 

      They reach a final WALL being prepped for drilling.

                                      GALEAS (CONT'D)
                    There are magical traps at the proper
                    entrance, plus the human security.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Human security?

                                      GALEAS
                    You didn't think the location of the
                    Stone was a complete secret, did
                    you?  No, the Royal Family's been
                    hiding it for centuries.  Eventually
                    Victoria decided it would be good
                    luck to live above the Stone, maybe
                    some of its magic would rub off on
                    her Empire.

      And we ZOOM BACK UP --                                                                                        26.

      EXT. LONDON STREET - CONTINUOUS

      ON THE GEM at the end of the string, pointing straight ...

      ... at Buckingham Palace.

      Flynn and the others stare.

                                      BAIRD
                    That's Buckingham Palace.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes.

      Ezekiel checks his cell.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Good news.  There's a Charity event
                    tonight.  I bet I can forge us some
                    invites.

                                      BAIRD
                    We've just robbed the Tower of London,
                    and now you want me to break into
                      Buckingham Palace.

                                      STONE
                    It's more fraud than breaking and
                    entering.
                          (to Ezekiel)
                    Could you make me, like, a Duke?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Sure.

      Baird just walks off.

                                      FLYNN
                    She'll be back.  Possibly.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT.  BUCKINGHAM PALACE - THAT NIGHT

      THE RECEPTION.  Flashbulbs flash, Limos come and go.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - RECEPTION FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      A charity fundraiser, more suits and dresses than tuxes and
      gowns.  The sort of event where you shake Kate Middleton's
      hand and then sign the check.   

      FIND Flynn, flanked by Ezekiel and Stone.  They hand their
      invitations to a SECURITY SCREENER and enter.  Flynn, looking
      good in his suit, still carries one spare invite.                                                                                          27.

      Ezekiel also wears his suit well, but Stone keeps tugging
      his collar.  

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Not a suit person?

                                      STONE
                    Ties are for funerals.

                                      FLYNN
                    Where's Baird?  She can't get in
                    without her invitation.

      The Screener steps up with their invites.

                                      SCREENER
                    Pardon, you gentlemen just gave me
                    these?  Could you wait here?

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course.

                                      SCREENER
                    Please don't try to leave.

      He calls into a walkie-talkie, walks off.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    You know what I'm thinking?

                                      FLYNN
                    Your forgeries didn't hold up?

      A group of GUARDS roll up on them.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    No, I'm thinking I can run faster
                    than you, because you're stabbed.

      The Guards part, REVEALING Baird.  She's in an upscale
      cocktail dress.  It looks better on her than the designer
      gowns on the duchesses surrounding them.

                                      BAIRD
                    These three are with me.  

      She hands the Guards her papers.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    Orders from the Director of counter-
                      terrorism.  Stay sharp.

      The Guards salute her, move off.  Flynn salutes her, caught
      up in the moment.  Baird almost, almost, smiles.                                                                                         28.

                                      STONE
                    Damn, Maggie Thatcher, don't you
                    clean up nice.

                                      BAIRD
                    A posh dress isn't going to help me
                    if they call HQ and discover I'm on
                    leave from counter-terrorism.  But
                    it'll buy us a bit of time.

      Flynn winces, stumbles.  Baird takes him by the arm. 
      Bystanders notice him wobble.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                      Undercover, Librarian.  Can't hold
                    you up all night.

      Music starts up.  Flynn pulls Baird onto the dance floor.   

                                      FLYNN
                    How about the next five minutes?

      He whispers commands back to Stone and Ezekiel.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Find any passages into the basement.
                    I'm sure the Royal Family created
                    some way to access the Stone.

      They move off, leaving Flynn and Baird to move amongst the
      dancers.  It's a slow song.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Baird?

                                      BAIRD
                    Yes?

                                      FLYNN
                    You're, um, you're leading.

                                      BAIRD
                    Oh, sorry.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - PAINTINGS - MOMENTS LATER

      Stone's searching intently around. Passes a PROFESSOR
      explaining a painting to three very attractive SOCIALITES.

                                      PROFESSOR
                      Profoundly influenced by the landscape
                    artist Robert Bevens --

      Stone clears frame.  Crosses back in.                                                                                        29.

                                      STONE
                    I'm sorry.  Hi y'all.  Did you just
                    imply Turner was influenced by Bevins
                    rather than Robert Wilson?

                                      PROFESSOR
                    I did not imply, I mean Wilson was a
                    bit of an influence.

                                      STONE
                    "A bit of an influence", surely you've
                    read Turner's correspondence with
                    John Ruskin, the pre-eminent art
                    critic of the mid 1700's.

      He grabs a DRINK from a passing tray.

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    He's part of an unbroken line of
                    influence from Wilson through Turner
                    to the Impressionists. 
                          (to Waiter)
                    Do you have a beer?
                          (back to Professor)
                    Let me take you through Turner's
                      evolution, do try to keep up, Lord
                      Fauntleroy ...

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - JEWELRY DISPLAY - CONTINUOUS

      Ezekiel passes GLASS DISPLAYS of royal jewelry.  He double-
      takes, returns.  Stares at them. Nods to the Guard.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Lovely display.

                                      GUARD
                    It is, sir.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    You know, the shrimp appetizer
                      is delicious.  You should really go
                    get some.
                          (beat)
                    Now.
                          (beat)
                    Before they run out.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - RECEPTION FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Flynn and Baird are gliding around the dance floor.

                                      BAIRD
                    This is nice.                                                                                        30.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes.  Yes, I suppose it is.

                                      BAIRD
                    We can move completely around the
                    room, check the corridors without
                    seeming suspicious.

                                      FLYNN
                    Exactly that.  Do you think Stone
                    and Ezekiel are --

                                      BAIRD
                    Not doing what they're supposed to
                    do?  Probably not.  We've dropping
                    them into a ridiculous situation
                      with absolutely no training.

                                      FLYNN
                    That's what happened to me.

                                      BAIRD
                    They don't train the Librarian? 
                    Well, how did you do, your first
                    mission?

                                      FLYNN
                      I got completely distracted and nearly
                    died about nine times.

                                      BAIRD
                    For what it's worth, I'm glad you
                    didn't die.  I found out there's
                    magic in the world.  I owe you that.
                          (beat)
                    We should really schedule a dance
                    some time when you're not slowly
                    bleeding to death.

                                      FLYNN
                    Let's save the world first.

                                      BAIRD
                    You get used to saving the world?

                                      FLYNN
                    I don't even bother to put it on the
                    to-do list anymore.

      And for the first time, Baird grins a bit.

      ON THEM as they dance past a scrum of DIPLOMATS and
      CELEBRITIES ... and landing on Galeas, blending in among the
      rich and powerful.  Galeas sees them, keeps an eye on them
      as he continues his conversation.                                                                                        31.

                                      DIPLOMAT
                    Mr. Galeas, we cannot thank you enough
                    for your donation.

                                      GALEAS
                      Ambassador, I've always said if you
                    want to change the world, you can't
                    wait around for other people to do
                    it for you.

      Galeas steps away from the Diplomat.  Texts on his phone.

      INT. SIDE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

      ON LAMIA as she checks her phone.  Perturbed, she stows it.

                                      LAMIA
                    We're running out of time!  Get me
                    through that wall!

      Lamia, Cassandra and the Assassins react as there's a CRACK,
      and the stone wall gives way.  Assassins pulls stones away
      as Lamia impatiently leads Cassandra into the chamber beyond.

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      They enter the chamber.

                                      LAMIA
                    Bring some lights in here.  Run in
                    the air hoses.

      Assassins scurry to prepare the space.  The first LAMP strobes
      into the room ... and finds THE STONE.  

      The ANCIENT BLACK STONE rises waist high from the floor of
      the chamber.  But around it is a CAGE.  The cage is black
      iron, the crosspieces curving across each other as if it
      woven rather than cast.  

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    Cut through that.

      An Assassin strides forward with cutting equipment. But as
      he touches the cage, there's a FLASH -- he's nothing but ASH
      drifting in the torchlight.  Cassandra lets out a little
      scream.  Lamia frowns.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    All right.  New plan.

      Lamia examines a COPPER PANEL on the front of the cage, with
      BLACK GLYPHS set into the metal.                                                                                          32.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    What's this?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    High Enochian.  A mathematical
                    language derived from ancient Greek.

      Cassandra reaches out to touch the plate.  Lamia is about to
      stop her, waits.  When Cassandra's finger hits the metal the
        GLYPHS suddenly GLOW and RISE above the copper plate.  She
      touches one Glyph, slides it over to replace another.   The
      Glyphs slide around as if puzzle pieces.

                                      LAMIA
                    You can crack it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Given time.

      Lamia attempts a weak smile.

                                      LAMIA
                    Take all the time you want.

      As Cassandra works the Glyphs, Lamia gestures. An Assassin
      presents a carrying case. He opens it to reveal EXCALIBUR.  

      Lamia gestures and the Sword rises to her hand.  There's a
      quick FLASH of blue from the Crown, to Excalibur, and then
      an echoing SPARK in the Stone.

      EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT - LATER

        Re-establishing the palace.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - RECEPTION FLOOR

      Flynn and Baird walk and talk, Baird's eyes scanning
      constantly.  He stumbles a bit, she holds him up.

                                      BAIRD
                    They're running standard counter-
                    terrorism on the perimeter and soft
                    threat assessment inside.  That means
                    their attention's on the VIPs, and
                    the interior guards are rotating. 

      She points to an interior passageway.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    We'll need Jones to hack the alarm
                    panel, but I'd say we have a three-
                    minute window to get through that
                    door to the chambers beneath the
                    palace.                                                                                          33.

      Flynn runs his had over his brow.  He's sweating.  Baird
      pull his jacket back.  Blood seeps on the white shirt.

                                      FLYNN
                    Maybe fading a little faster than I
                    thought.

      They round a corner to find Stone, attended by DUCHESSES and
      sundry young Royals, still chewing out the Oxford Professor.

                                      PROFESSOR
                    Certainly you can't argue that John
                    Turner simply changed styles --

                                      STONE
                    No, I'm not arguing, I'm telling
                    you, in the plates of Liber Studorium
                    you can see a reflection --

                                      BAIRD
                    Stone, we have to go.

      He holds up a finger.

                                      STONE
                    -- of the volcanic ash in the
                      atmosphere in 1816, where his hues
                    shift to the red end of the spectrum,
                    leading also to a proto-impressionist --

                                      BAIRD
                    Stone.

      Baird guides him away.  Stone grabs two drinks off a tray,
      downs both.

                                      STONE
                    You little ladies have a lovely night.  
                    And remember, all that matters is
                    that art touches your heart.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DISPLAY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

      They find Ezekiel staring at GLASS DISPLAY CASES.

                                      FLYNN
                    We need you.  Wait, what are you
                    doing here?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Looking a these royal jewels.  Secured
                    in these completely inadequate
                    security cases.
                          (off them)
                    I'm just looking.                                                                                         34.

      They walk OUT OF FRAME.  A beat later, Baird steps back into
      frame, tests the LOCK on one of the cases.  A GUARD steps
      forward, she waves him off.

                                      BAIRD
                    Just checking.

      She steps out.  Another beat, then back in, as she counts
      the pieces quickly.  Satisfied, back out again.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHAMBER PASSAGE

      They reach the SIDE PASSAGE, one of the various service doors
      one finds in a palace.  As one does.  

      They wait for a SECURITY MAN in a suit to move off, then
      slide to the ALARM PANEL.  Ezekiel begins to work.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Tch, a Glenn-Rieder 250?  That's
                    three years out of date. I expect
                      Buckingham Palace to do better.

                                      BAIRD
                    I'll write a strongly worded memo.
                    Two minutes thirty seconds.

      Flynn reaches in, touches his wound.

                                      STONE
                    You ain't looking so hot.

                                      FLYNN
                    No matter what happens to me, you
                    get that Crown. 

                                      STONE
                    You drop, we'll leave you and move
                    on.

                                      FLYNN
                    What?  No, why would you just jump
                    to that?  That's horrible.

                                      BAIRD
                    Two minutes.

      The door pops.  Ezekiel eases it open, slides inside.  They
      close the door neatly behind them.

      The Security Guard comes back.  Bored, he looks around. 
      Pauses.  There's a BLOODSTAIN on the doorjamb.                                                                                        35.

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      Cassandra SLIDES the last of the GLYPHS into place.  AN
      ANCIENT WORD echoes through the chamber, fades.  Then with a
      CREAK, the IRON CAGE begins to UNWEAVE.  A reverse time-lapse
      as iron bars, bending like reeds, retreat back into the earth.

                                      LAMIA
                    Nice work, little Librarian.  But
                    I'm afraid it's about to get messy,
                    and I can't have you about.  

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You said you're going to help people.

                                      LAMIA
                    We are.  We're bringing magic back
                    to the world.  The whole world, all
                    at once.

      EXCALIBUR GLOWS with unearthly blue light.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                      Technology ends, Magic returns, and
                    we control it.  We are the Kings and
                    Queens of the New Magic Age.
                          (to Assassin)
                    Palaces have dungeons, right?  Find
                    a cell, stick her in it.  

      The Assassins drag Cassandra out.  Lamia steps forward, raises
      Excalibur above her head.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    Come back to us, oh ancient world of
                    wonders.  Return, and be ours.

      She DRIVES Excalibur into the Stone.  There's a BLAST, one
      of those flat shock waves that takes everyone off their feet.

      Excalibur PULSES with power.  Once, twice, and on the third
      time we see that BLUE GLOW spread like spierwebs veins down
      through the obsidian rock.  Feeding power like blood into
      the vast arteries.  With each PULSE more of Excalibur's energy
      drives into the Stone. 

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - WINE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

      Dark, old stone, cramped.  Flynn and the others hunt for
      clues, mini-flashlights cutting the darkness.

                                      STONE
                    Old section.  From George the Third's
                    time.                                                                                        36.

      The WAVE of BLUE passes over them.  Flynn cries out, slumps
      against a RACK of WINE.   Baird checks his wound.  It's openly
      bleeding now.

                                      FLYNN
                    The Sword's rejoined with the Stone. 
                    Magic's coming back.

                                      BAIRD
                    And that's a magic wound.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Hello, darling.

      They turn.  Ezekiel's pulled a BOTTLE of wine from a rack. 

                                      STONE
                      Seriously?

                                      EZEKIEL
                      Seriously, a 1811 Chateau d'Yquem. 
                    Stole one of these once, it's worth
                    a hundred thousand dollars.  No way
                    it's just sitting around in a wine
                    cellar, don't care whose wine cellar
                    it is.

      He cracks it open, drinks it, spits it out.

                                      EZEKIEL 
                    Water.  

      They search the wine rack.  Baird's the one who finds the
      latch.  She tugs, and the rack SLIDES AWAY.  A STONE door in
      the wall behind weirdly, magically IRISES OPEN.  There's a
      descending tunnel beyond.  They hurry down the steps.

      INT. STATUE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Flynn, Baird, Stone and Ezekiel enter a ROOM filled with
      STATUES.  The statues are reminiscent of the TERRA COTTA
      WARRIORS of China, but instead they're of ROMAN LEGIONNAIRES.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    I was expecting knights, you know,
                    armor.

                                      STONE
                    Roman.  So it's true, Camelot happened
                    in the time of the last Legionnaires.

      There's an opening in the wall opposite.  But as they advance,
      a door SLAMS shut -- as does the one BEHIND them.  Flynn
      leads them to the opposite door.  There's WRITING on it.                                                                                        37.

                                      FLYNN
                    "Only he who is worthy to wield the
                    power of Excalibur may pass."  

                                      BAIRD
                    Only King Arthur?  The Royal Family?

                                      FLYNN
                    Arthur said no one's worthy of
                      Excalibur, that's why he never passed
                    it on.  No one was ever meant to use
                    Excalibur again.

      Another PULSE of MAGIC.  Flynn buckles. 

                                      BAIRD
                    Excalibur again.

                                      FLYNN
                    No, stronger.  The ley lines are
                    waking up.  Magic's coming back to
                    the world.

      His near-collapse almost makes them miss the CREAK of turning
      heads.  The team looks up.

      The LEGIONNAIRE STATUES are all looking a them.  Then, dust
      falling from ancient joints, the statues DRAW their swords.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        38.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINOUS

      Excalibur PULSES, but then the Stone, like a an old engine
      turning over, PULSES back, out of phase.  Then again, a little
      faster.  Lamia laughs, manic.

      INT.  BUCKINGHAM PALACE - RECEPTION FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Everyone REACTS as the LIGHTS flicker, strange
        RUMBLINGS travel through the room.  Galeas steps aside to
      avoid some Guards, glimpses in a mirror.  Stops and stares.  

      The lights are flickering, it's hard to see ... but Galeas
      is younger.

                                      GALEAS
                    Welcome back.

      INT. STATUE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Flynn and the others duck and weave.  The Legionnaires are
      slow, but there's not a lot of room to move.  Flynn comes
      nose to nose with one as it grabs him with its free hand.

                                      LEGIONNAIRE
                    Qui estis?

                                      FLYNN
                    "Who are you?"

      Baird SHATTERS the thing's arm, pulling Flynn back. Stone
      dodges a sword, grabs another statue's sword and pulls,
      crossing the statues against each other.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    They'll let the one who's worthy of
                    wielding Excalibur pass!

                                      STONE
                    Arthur!  I'm Arthur!

      No good.  Ezekiel ducks, tries:

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Merlin!  I'm all-powerful Merlin.
                          (nothing)
                    Harry Potter!  Statuist Falldownicus!

                                      BAIRD
                    The Queen!  I'm the Queen!                                                                                        39.

      Nope.  She rolls, picks up a sword form a shattered arm and
      BLOCKS a sword blow.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    Oh, I suppose Queens aren't allowed to
                      use swords.  Typical.

      They're being forced back against them wall.

                                      FLYNN
                    Volo NEMO!  

      The Statues freeze.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    VOLO NEMO!

      The Statues CRUMBLE, falling into SHATTERED SHARDS.  Both
      doors open.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    "Volo Nemo". "I am No one."  Arthur
                    said no one was worthy, so ...

                                      STONE
                    Kind of literal.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    They are statues.

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

      This tunnel intersects with the DRILLING TUNNEL.  Flynn leads
      them past old DUNGEON DOORS, past the DRILLING EQUIPMENT
      and generators and hoses.

                                      FLYNN
                    They came in sideways.  Oh, that's
                    much smarter than what we did.

      They reach the end of the Tunnel, peek past.  They can see:

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      Both Excalibur and the Stone glow BLUE, in perfect synch. 
      Lamia, wearing the Crown, paces with a team of Assassins. 

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

      They lean back against the dungeon doors.

                                      FLYNN
                    Trained killers, magic crown giving
                    her control of the deadliest weapon
                    on earth.  Ideas?                                                                                        40.

                                      CASSANDRA  (O.S.)
                    I have some ideas.

      Cassandra's in the CELL they're hiding beside.

                                      STONE
                    Hey kid.  

                                      EZEKIEL
                    And no thanks, you sold us out once
                    before.

                                      FLYNN
                    She had her reasons.  Ezekiel, get
                    her out of there.

      Ezekiel hesitates.  Flynn glares.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    You people hounded me to do this
                    together, so now we do it together,
                    all together.  Get her out.

      The door opens.  Cassandra eases out.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                      So what's your idea?

      Cassandra points to the equipment.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    That's the drill they cool with ice-
                    water pipes.  That's the air recycler. 
                      Electrical wires off the generator
                    and --

                                      FLYNN
                    -- metal support pipes.  Distraction,
                      then action.  Good idea, but it'll
                    take all of us.   Together.

      He looks to them.  They nod. 

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    This is what we need.  Stone, your
                    knowledge of mechanics.  Reroute
                    that ice water coolant into the warm
                    air recycler, that'll give us cover. 

      (NOTE: the following sequence hops over the timeline)                                                                                        41.

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - MOMENTS LATER

      Stone REROUTS the ICE WATER COOLING the drill into the AIR
      RECYCLER. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

      Lamia and her Guards react as THICK FOG pours into the chamber
      from the air recycling tubes. 

                                                                                BACK TO:

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - MOMENTS AGO

                                      FLYNN
                    Eve, keep them distracted to I can
                    get close to Lamia.

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      The Assassins are spread out.  Baird comes out of the fog,
      brings down two, then fades back.  

      Lamia strides forward.  She reaches for Excalibur, then
      hesitates.  No, it's not done.  She pulls her own katana.

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - MOMENTS AGO

                                      FLYNN
                    Ezekiel's hacking.  Go rewire that
                      generator panel.   I'm going to need
                      alternating current when I yell,
                    very strong.  Cassandra will give
                    you the frequency.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. STONE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

      Ezekiel and Cassandra are REWIRING the generator panel.  A
      SPARK flies up.  Ezekiel sucks his thumb and keeps working.

      INT. STONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      Lamia finds Baird in the thick fog.  She strikes, Baird rolls
      out of the way, into the path of two Assassins.  Stone is
      with her, though, and they take on the killers.  Lamia moves
      up on their flank, pauses.

                                      LAMIA
                    I hear you, Librarian.                                                                                        42.

      Flynn steps into view, holding a METAL PIPE.  He's wrapped
      it it in WIRING, with TAPE around the base for a better grip.

                                      FLYNN
                    Give me Excalibur.  Stop this.

      They exchange blows.

                                      LAMIA
                    Stop this?  Magic is returning to
                    the world!  It's flowing out through
                    the ley lines, creeping back
                      into every corner of this planet.

                                      FLYNN
                    Magic you control.  Power no one can
                    stop.

      Another flurry of blows.  Flynn stumbles back, his side soaked
      with blood.  Lamia toys with him.

                                      LAMIA
                    And how are you going to stop us? 
                    With your little knock-off Librarians? 
                    One doomed by her gift, one who fled
                    his gift, one who abuses it?

      On Baird and Stone, being forced back.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    With your little soldier girl?

                                      FLYNN
                    No.  I'm the Librarian.  The
                      Librarians win with knowledge.  The
                      Librarians win with science.

      He stands, holding the pipe cleanly upright.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                      Electromagnets. 

      Lamia looks at the pipe.  With her gaze we --

      -- ZOOM down along the wire trailing from the pipe, out of
      the Chamber, and to the Generator.  Ezekiel throws a switch,
      Cassandra twists a dial  --

      The pipe in Flynn's hand HUMS.  Suddenly, the Crown of Arthur
      FLIES off Lamia's head and CLANGS onto the pipe.  SPARKS
      fly, the magnet SHORTS OUT. 

      But Flynn now holds the Crown.                                                                                        43.

      Lamia screams and RUNS forward.  Flynn dons the Crown, reaches
      out.  Excalibur TEARS from the Stone.  The blue light
      suffusing the Chamber FADES and discharges with THUNDER.  

      Excalibur BLOCKS Lamia's blow, floating between Flynn and
      Lamia.  Lamia strikes again and again, but Excalibur parries
      every strike.  It disarms Lamia and places its blade across
      her throat.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Cal, no.
                          (beat)
                      Excalibur, we are better than them.

      ON THE SWORD as it drifts away, hesitating.  

      Lamia's hand FLASHES for a knife, she THROWS it --

      Excalibur STRIKES her down, but the dagger's heading straight
      for Flynn --

      Baird CATCHES it in mid-air.  Blood oozes from her fist
      clenched around the blade, but she doesn't seem to notice.

                                      BAIRD
                    You really do need a Guardian.

                                      FLYNN
                    Better late than never.

      The fog is fading from the Chamber.  The Candidates gather
      as Excalibur drifts toward Flynn.  It dips, as if stumbling,
      and he catches it.  He falls to one knee at the same time.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    It's okay, old friend.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What's wrong with it?

                                      FLYNN
                    Most of its magic was discharged back
                    into the earth. It ... he's dying. 
                    We're both dying.

      Excalibur glows BLUE for a second.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    What little power's left is almost
                    all raw magic.  With the Crown, I
                    can manipulate it.
                          (to Cassandra)
                    I can heal you.   I can save you.                                                                                         44.

                                      BAIRD
                    Flynn.

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson, gone, Excalibur's dying, the
                    Library's gone.  It's time.

      Flynn takes Cassandra by the shoulder.  Excalibur glows, he
      brings it toward her forehead.

      She GRABS his wrist.  With surprising strength she DRIVES it
      down, presses it against his side.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    No!

      Flynn SCREAMS as the energy courses through him.  He falls
      back, blue energy pulsing into him.  Cassandra's locked in,
      eye to eye with him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (whispered)
                    You already saved me.

      The energy fades.  Flynn lifts his shirt.  The wound is
      closed, a SWORD-SHAPED SCAR marking the wound.

                                      STONE
                    Hey.

      Flynn looks back up.  Excalibur, now dull, is beginning to
      DISSOLVE.  As if it were made of sand.

                                      FLYNN
                    Goodbye, Cal.  Thank you.

      Excalibur POURS OUT, a fine grain of metal particles, onto
      the ground.  They watch as the particles TRACK across the
      floor and REJOIN the Stone.

      INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - WINE CELLAR - MINUTES LATER

      Flynn leads them from the secret tunnel.

                                      FLYNN
                    Magic, once again defeated by
                      knowledge.  This just proves that
                    there is nothing, no situation you
                    can't think your way out of. 

      KA-CHAK.  A full ASSAULT TEAM of soldiers is waiting for
      them, guns up.  Flynn and the others slowly raise their hands.

                                      STONE
                    So ...                                                                                        45.

                                      FLYNN
                    Thinking.

      One of the Soldiers raises his visor.  It's the Soldier who
      as with Baird during the assault in Paris.

                                      SOLDIER
                    Colonel Baird?

      Baird looks to Flynn.

                                      BAIRD
                    Hate to interrupt your thinking.

                                      FLYNN
                    No, no you got this one, definitely
                      a Guardian-type situation.

      Baird drops her hands, steps in front of the rest of them.

                                      BAIRD
                      Gentlemen.  Funny story, this.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        46.

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ANNEX - TWO DAYS LATER

      Stone, Ezekiel and Cassandra sit outside the Annex.  Stone
      and Ezekiel are close by, chatting. Cassandra has self-
      segregated, sitting miserably on a large suitcase.  

      They look up as Jenkins ENTERS with WHITE ENVELOPES,
      accompanied by Charlene. As he hands them out:

                                      JENKINS
                    I've completed your airplane tickets --

                                      CHARLENE
                    We completed.

                                      JENKINS
                    We did, that's right, and I have to
                    say, Charlene did a magnificent job
                    aligning your flight schedules and
                    payment process with the airline
                    mileage system for maximum savings
                      and mileage credits.

                                      CHARLENE
                    All the air miles the Librarian racks
                    up every year, you could trade those
                    in to fly to the moon!

                                      JENKINS
                    Oh, so you've flown on the --

                                      CHARLENE
                    Shh. No, they don't know about that.

                                      JENKINS.
                    Ah.
                          (beat)
                    Ah-hah!  "Fly to the moon", what a
                    colorful ... metaphor.  For a thing
                    that does not happen.  Well, I'd say
                    thank you for visiting, but I loathed
                    having you here.

                                      STONE
                    So that's it.

      Flynn and Baird cross in.

                                      FLYNN
                    For you, yes.  We've transferred
                    some pretty generous --                                                                                        47.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Not too generous.

                                      FLYNN
                    -- consulting fees into your bank
                    accounts, and arranged travel home. 
                    Thank you.  For everything.  But
                    it's not fair, or safe, I think, for
                    you to stay involved in this life.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    A life that would've been our life,
                    if luck had broken just a little
                      differently.

                                      STONE
                    Now we go back to our lives, knowing
                    the magic is real, knowing the world
                    is --

                                      CASSANDRA
                    -- so big, knowing the world is so
                    big.  What if we can't move on?

      She's suddenly embarrassed she spoke.  Looks down.  Flynn
        sympathizes, but he's made his choice.

                                      FLYNN
                    It's for the best.

      Flynn gestures for Jenkins to step aside with him. Baird
      comes forward, puts on her soldier voice.

                                      BAIRD
                    You've also all signed non-disclosure
                    forms so you will not tell anyone of
                    the events which occurred, the
                    existence of the Library or the
                      Librarian, of magic and secret
                      conspiracies and, well, anything. 
                    At all.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Or?

                                      BAIRD
                    Please, tell people all about the
                    magic Library, and Excalibur, and
                    how you broke into Buckingham Palace
                    because King Arthur is really Roman. 
                    I'll come visit you and make sure
                    the straight jacket's not too tight.

      ON FLYNN AND JENKINS                                                                                         48.

                                      FLYNN
                    Have you tried Temporal resonance,
                    how about if we find a Crystal Skull -

                                      JENKINS
                    Sir, I have tried everything. 
                      Everything.  The Card Catalogue is
                    still anchored to this reality.  It
                    can still access the records of the
                    Library, the books and manuscripts. 
                    That much of a connection still
                    exists.  But the Library itself,
                    with all it artifacts --

                                      FLYNN
                    And Judson.

                                      JENKINS
                    -- is cut loose from this world. 
                    The Library is adrift in time and
                    space.  The Library is lost.

      Flynn fights his emotions.  He heads inside.

      INT. THE CARD CATALOGUE - MOMENTS LATER

      Flynn crosses to the table where he's left his traveling bag
      and coat.  Tossing a few mementos (from previous LIBRARIAN
      movies) into the bag, he shrugs into the coat. 

      Walks out past the MIRROR, gives it the first few knocks of
      "shave and haircut".

      ON FLYNN when, from the mirror, comes the answering knock of
      "two bits".  He freezes.  Hope in his eyes, he spins.

      Judson stands IN THE MIRROR, with the LARGE ITEMS ANNEX behind
      him.  Flynn rushes the mirror.

                                      JUDSON
                    Hello Flynn.

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson! 

                                      JUDSON
                    Reports of my death have been greatly
                      exaggerated.

                                      FLYNN
                    Come on out of there!

      Flynn reaches for Judson, frowns when his hand hits glass.                                                                                        49.

                                      JUDSON
                    I'm afraid that's not going to happen,
                    Flynn.  The physics is a little
                      complicated.  Information can pass
                    back and forth across the dimensional
                    void --

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes, due to quantum entanglement,
                    did you actually just tell me the
                    physics is complicated?

                                      JUDSON
                    -- but not solid materials.  The
                    Library and I are too far away.

                                      FLYNN
                    Where?

                                      JUDSON
                    It's impossible to say.  The Library,
                    me, we're gone.  You need to move
                    on. 

                                      FLYNN
                    What if I can't move on?

                                      JUDSON
                    It's for the best.

      Flynn touches the mirror.

                                      FLYNN
                    I never really knew ... I never really
                    had a father.

                                      JUDSON
                    And I never had a son.

      Judson places his hand opposite Flynn's on the glass.

                                      JUDSON (CONT'D)
                    Well, now we're both liars.

                                      FLYNN
                    I will find the Library Judson.  I'm
                    the Librarian.  Nothing's impossible. 

                                      JUDSON
                    The Serpent Brotherhood failed, but
                    they released an enormous amount of
                    magic into the world.  Things are
                    going to go a little mad out there.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        50.

                                      JUDSON (CONT'D)
                    You're in charge now, and you're not
                    going to have time to search for the
                    Library.

      Flynn realizes, turns away.

                                      FLYNN
                    ... no, I won't.  Not if I try to do
                    it alone.

                                      JUDSON
                    Flynn, I'll always be  --

      Judson's cut off.  Flynn turns, finds the mirror empty.

                                      BAIRD  (O.S.)
                    Flynn?

      Baird's a little confused to find Flynn staring at himself
      in the mirror.

                                      FLYNN
                    I'm the Librarian.  I'm in charge
                    now.

                                      BAIRD
                    ... yes?

      Flynn walks past her, fishing in his pocket for something. 
      Pauses, pulls out Judson's POCKET WATCH.  He grins.

                                      FLYNN
                    It's time I started making the rules. 

      Flynn walks out.  Baird glances back a the mirror.  Just a
      FLASH of Judson tossing her brief salute -- nope, too fast. 
      Must've imagined it.  She hesitates, then follows Flynn.

      EXT. ANNEX - MOMENTS LATER

      The same seating arrangement, with Jenkins and Charlene in
      the BG chatting.  

                                      EZEKIEL
                          (to Stone)
                    Come on.  Paris to Moscow to Tokyo,
                    all these great works of art you've
                    only seen in books are hanging on
                    museum walls.

                                      STONE
                    Until we take them off those walls,
                    that's what you're saying'.                                                                                        51.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    You are wasting your talents.

                                      STONE
                    I'd say the same.  How about you
                    consider going straight?  You got a
                    good man in there.  Deep, deep in
                    there under the jerk, but a good
                    man.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Being good's easy.  Being good at
                    what I do's hard.

                                      STONE
                    Brother, being a good man, just a
                    good man -- that's the hardest damn
                    thing in the world.  Sorry you don't
                    feel like you're up to the challenge.

      Flynn and Baird burst out.

                                      FLYNN
                    New plan!  Although I have the feeling
                    it's the old plan, and I just realized
                    it.  Please open your envelopes.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Our plane tickets?

      Flynn gestures impatiently.  They open the envelopes ... and
      REACT as GOLDEN LIGHT shines on their faces, and WORDS appear
      on BLANK PAPER:

      "YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO INTERVIEW ..."

      ON EZEKIEL as he realizes, despite himself, that perhaps
      redemption is at hand.

      "... FOR A PRESTIGIOUS POSITION ..."

      ON STONE as he sees a new chance at a life he gave up, a
      life the world told him isn't possible for men like him.

      "... AT THE METROPOLITAN LIBRARY ..."

      ON CASSANDRA as she sees a chance to finally, finally belong
      to something.  Where her curse is a blessing.

      ON FLYNN as he turns to Baird.

                                      FLYNN
                    Open yours.                                                                                        52.

                                      BAIRD
                    I lost mine back --

      She pulls a NEW ENVELOPE out of her jacket. Her eyes reflect
      GOLDEN LIGHT as she unfolds the paper within.  Jenkins and
      Charlene exchange looks, Flynn positively BOUNCING with glee. 
      He leads them all inside.

                                      FLYNN
                    Come on, come on.  We've got work to
                    do. 

      INT. THE CARD CATALOG - MOMENTS LATER

      Flynn circles the room, his mind racing.  The others are all
      left a little stunned.

                                      FLYNN
                    I think this will be a perfect base
                    of operations.  You have access to
                    the archives, if not the artifacts,
                    Charlene and Jenkins can teach you
                    how to research and supervise your
                    training --

                                      JENKINS
                    Now hold on, we don't train anyone
                    to be Librarian!

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes, and isn't that stupid?  Grab
                    some highly intelligent but
                      unsuspecting victim and toss him
                    into a world of magic and hope he
                    doesn't die before he learns where
                    the restrooms are?

                                      CHARLENE
                    That's how it's always been done.

                                      FLYNN
                    Well I'm the Librarian now, and I
                    say no, that's not how it's done.
                    Not anymore.

      We sweeps his arm across the others.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Meet the Librarians.   In training.

                                      BAIRD
                    They're not qualified.                                                                                         53.

                                      FLYNN
                    Then we'll make them qualified.  I'll
                    still handle the big stuff, the world-
                    ending artifacts, they'll handle the
                    ... slightly less apocalyptic cases. 
                    This will free up time for me to
                    hunt down the Library and bring it
                    back.

                                      JENKINS
                    That's impossible.

                                      FLYNN
                    People keep saying that like we don't
                    eat the impossible for breakfast
                    every day.
                          (he turns to them)
                    I offer a life of mystery and misery,
                    of loneliness and adventure. But
                    most of all, a chance to make a
                      difference. A chance to save the
                    world every week twice before Friday. 
                    Are you in?

      They look to each other.  Stone nods to Cassandra.

                                      STONE
                    Even her?

                                      BAIRS
                    She sacrificed her own life to save
                    Flynn's.  More than you've done,
                    Oklahoma.

      Stone reacts to Baird tossing a nickname back at him. 

                                      STONE
                    I reckon I can give it a shot, if
                    we're helping people.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    It will provide an opportunity to
                    steal new and exciting things.  I'm
                    in.

      Cassandra just nods.  She rushes forward and HUGS Flynn.  He
      squeezes her and sets her back.

                                      FLYNN
                    It's your Library now, or at least
                    this little piece of it.  I'll check
                    in in a few weeks.  Try not to die.                                                                                        54.

      Flynn heads out with Baird, leaving the Librarians to take
      in their new surroundings, with a very distressed Charlene
      and Jenkins.

      EXT. LIBRARY ANNEX - MOMENTS LATER

      Flynn and Baird cross to Flynn's car.

                                      BAIRD
                    We'll have to find a Guardian for
                    them.  Only Stone can handle himself
                    in a bar fight, and I don't know how
                    many magical artifacts you're going
                    to find in dive bars.

                                      FLYNN
                    Actually, no.  I've found their
                    Guardian.

      Baird stares at him.

                                      BAIRD
                    Flynn, no.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hear me out.

                                      BAIRD
                    With Judson gone, who else can you
                    trust?

                                      FLYNN
                    No one, and that's the point. 
                    Judson's gone, the Library's gone,
                    if something happens to me -- they're
                    the future.  You're the first person
                    I've met in five years I trust.  So
                    you're the one I trust to watch them
                    and keep them safe.

                                      BAIRD
                    I thought you needed ... a Guardian.

                                      FLYNN
                    I need the Librarians protected more
                    than I need, want to be traveling
                    the world with you.  

      A beat.  She squares her shoulders, the old soldier back.

                                      BAIRD
                    Librarian and Guardian.  The job's
                    more important --                                                                                        55.

                                      FLYNN
                    No.  Don't say that, that's the old
                    way.  But for now, we need to work
                      separately.

                                      BAIRD
                    And who'll keep you alive?

                                      CHARLENE
                    Hold on, hold on!

      Charlene hustles out, pulling together her coat and luggage.

                                      CHARLENE (CONT'D)
                    I've arranged the plane tickets
                    online, we need to get to Madagascar,
                    there's an outbreak of the undead.
                          (off their look)
                    You don't think he'd actually last
                    five minutes without me, do you?

                                      FLYNN
                    I think --

      Charlene affectionately slaps his cheek, moves on.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Don't think too hard, Flynn, bad
                    things happen.  Come on, plane to
                    catch, zombies to fight.

      Flynn turns to Baird.  In one smooth move she grabs him and
      sweeps him in for the long hero kiss.  (The chemistry here
      makes it a little hard to tell exactly who thew hero's
      supposed to be.)  They separate.  She drops to parade rest.

                                      BAIRD
                    Come back alive, Librarian.

                                      FLYNN
                    I will.   Call.  Next time.  Be ...
                    wow.

      Flynn crosses to Charlene.  They get into the car and drive
      off.  There's just a beat of regret on Baird's face, then
      the professional is back.  

      INT. THE WORKSPACE - MOMENTS LATER

      The "Librarians" investigate what is now their workspace.
      Eager, but not sure how to begin, they turn to Jenkins.

                                      JENKINS
                    Ah.  Ah.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        56.

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    Now, I know that Flynn is technically
                    the Librarian.  And I technically
                    work for the Library, and vis a vis
                    etcetera etcetera the Librarian. 
                    But I don't --

                                      BAIRD
                          (entering)
                    Really have a choice.  These three
                    will be using this as a base of
                      operations, and I will be supervising
                    their security.  So make yourself
                    useful or make yourself gone.

                                      JENKINS
                    You're bluffing.

      The Librarians wince as one.

                                      STONE
                    She don't bluff --

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Not so much "threats" as "promises" --

                                      CASSANDRA
                    She can and will kick your ass.

      Jenkins tries to outstare Baird.  Finally relents.

                                      JENKINS
                    There is, I suppose, the Clipping
                    Book.

      He pulls a GIANT LEDGER down off a shelf.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What's a clipping book?

                                      JENKINS
                    Ahhh, child of the annoying digital
                    age, it's how we used to gather
                      information about news stories. 
                    Each page has clippings from
                      difference sources detailing a
                    specific bizarre mystery.

                                      STONE
                    Don't really need a book of old
                    clippings --                                                                                        57.

                                      JENKINS
                    Silly midwestern person, this Clipping
                    Book is the Library's clipping book. 
                    Every night, there's a new page. 
                    New information, of a new mystery
                    happening that very day.
                          (pause)
                    Shall we begin?

      They fumble over the book for a moment, then fall into a non-
      verbal agreement.  

      Stone riffles the pages of the book.  Cassandra, eyes closed,
      JAMES her finger down on one of the passing pages.  Jenkins
      looks at the case detailed within.

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    Oh.  Oh.  Fascinating.  You'll never
                    solve this one.

      The Librarians all lean forward to read the page ...

                                                                                FADE OUT:
