          The starfield is an animated image on a computer screen. 
          A woman in her late twenties -- the ASTRONOMER -- clicks
          a mouse and a graphic circle appears over the moving star --
            highlighting it.

                        chunk of the countryside.

                        Are you sure?

                        pretty sure.

          She clicks the mouse and the starfield disappears, replaced
          by the SCREENSAVER of a housecat in a funny pose.

                        will hit at the foot of a mountain. 
                        A mountain that looks like a
                          crouching animal of some kind.

          The woman bristles slightly.

                        I'll be finished with my doctorate

                        come back and see me then.

          Johnny knows he can't get any further.  He stands.  The
          Astronomer extends her hand.  Johnny takes her hand -- she
          freezes as he HEARS THE ROAR OF THE METEOR FLASHING BY...          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/3/02 - GREEN       7.

          She suddenly wavers like a flickering candle flame, and
          then vanishes -- exactly like the old man at the gas
          station.


  99RESUME

          Johnny lets go of her hand.

                        If I can find this mountain, give
                        you an exact location and the
                          meteor's angle of impact...

                                guy out of here)
                        You bring me the declination and

                        the telescope together...

          She ushers him out.



          Johnny appears at the opening, shoving himself with the
          cane into the cleft.  Larger than he anticipated, not
          quite a cave, but definitely better than the open elements.

          He drags himself over toward the wall, reaches down to
          check his leg -- the torn pants above his knee are soaked
          in blood.  Johnny takes off his belt (or uses a piece of
          his ripped trousers), loops it inside the torn fabric,
          along his upper thigh, and pulls it into a rough tourniquet
          to stop the bleeding. 

          Johnny leans back against the wall to catch his breath,
          his hand reaches out to the rock face for support, and on
            contact--


    2424MULTIPLE HANDS - VISION

          Move across the rock, dissolving to replace one another. 
            Scrawling with marker, pen, knife, bright clay, burnt
          stick.  Leaving graffiti, initials, dates, symbols,
            Palaeolithic drawings.


  2525RESUME

          As Johnny feels a sudden chill he kicks something in the
          dark.  He casually picks it up - and it's an old crushed
          beer can... as he touches the can, he hears the SOUND of
          the roaring meteor in the distance, and the rock face in
          front of him is lit with sudden brightness.  He turns to
          find, not a meteor but --


2626A CAMPFIRE - VISION

          The roar becomes only the popping of the green wood, the
          brightness merely from the flames.*

          And just beyond the flames are the ghostly images of four
          1980s vintage college kids drinking beer.

          One of the college kids lights a cigar, then tosses the
          lighter.

          Johnny watches as it falls behind a rock -- the vision
          ends.


  2727RESUME JOHNNY

          Who immediately hauls himself over to the rock -- sure
          enough, the lighter is still there.  He tries it, and
          even if the fuel is long gone, the flint still sparks.

          Johnny puts the lighter in his pocket, starts to gather
          pieces of loose wood strewn around, piling them together.

          Then he picks up what looks to be an old piece of broken
          antler, but flat and smooth.  Just as he is about to toss
          it over with the other kindling, his eye is caught by
            something on its surface--


          CLOSE ON: THE ANTLER FRAGMENT

          upon which two faint lines can be seen, as Johnny traces
          them with his fingertip -- a double-curve, intersecting.

          The SOUND of a low drum beating, somewhere nearby.


          RESUME JOHNNY

          who slowly turns toward the source --


  2828INCLUDE THE SHAMAN

          Native American, about Johnny's age, dressed completely
          in deerskin clothing, sitting by his own small fire,
          beating on a flat drum hoop with a drumstick, eyes closed,
          in concentration or even semi-trance.

          The man is wearing feathers and dried plants woven into
          his long black hair.  Two narrow green vertical lines
          rise above his nosebridge onto his forehead.

          This is a vision from a time long before Europeans landed
          on this continent. 

          Johnny sees an knife carved from antler held in a sheath
          against the Shaman's chest -- Johnny then glances down at
          the antler shard in his own hand.  Clearly it is the same
          object -- now worn smooth by the centuries.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 6/25/02 - PINK      14.


    28CONTINUED:28

          And this is what's causing the vision.

          Johnny watches as the man starts to speak a single word,
          eyes still closed.

                                        SHAMAN
                                  (welcoming)
                        Kwai... Kwai... Kwai...

          Johnny stares, fascinated -- when a sudden sharp pain in
          his leg makes him cry out.  He turns away, and as he does
          so --


          NEW ANGLE - THE SHAMAN

          Opens his eyes and turns toward the SOUND of Johnny's
          voice -- and sees Johnny!

          The Shaman reacts with amazement -- he is both frightened
          and excited.  As if he both expected and feared the arrival
          of this apparition.  He stops beating the drum and stays
          completely still.  Is Johnny a Demon?  A Spirit Guide? 
          How to tell the difference? 

          He stares at the antler shard in Johnny's hand, then
          glances down at the antler knife in his sheath.  Just as
          Johnny did, he concludes that they are somehow connected.

          As he watches, Johnny -- still facing away from him --
          drops the antler fragment.  And instantly disappears from
          the Shaman's vision.

                                        SHAMAN
                                (puzzled)
                        Toni odosaan?

          And anytime we're alone with the Shaman we're in the
          ANCIENT CAVE (i.e., no graffiti but with a small pool of
          water that doesn't exist in Johnny's era.)

          The Shaman thinks for a moment.  He puts down the drum
          and drumstick.  He stands, takes out the antler knife and
          waves it in the air.  He shakes it once or twice, then
          points it at the place where Johnny was standing before
          he disappeared.

                                        SHAMAN
                              (a command)
                        Pion n'wigomnok!

          Nothing happens.  Clearly, he is trying to make Johnny
            reappear, but doesn't know exactly how.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 6/25/02 - PINK      15.


    28CONTINUED: (2)28

          He walks over to exactly where Johnny was standing and
          tosses the knife down just as Johnny dropped the shard,
          and cries out in mock pain, imitating the same cry Johnny
          gave.  He looks around expectantly -- but no Johnny. 

          The Shaman thinks hard about this problem.  And seems to
          have an idea.  He picks the antler knife up off the ground,
          goes and sits back down next to his fire, taking the drum
          in hand.

          Then he starts to slowly beat on the drum with the antler
          knife, using it as drumstick.  As he closes his eyes in
            concentration--


  2929CLOSE ON: THE DRUM

          Drawn across its surface is the simple but elegant
            Palaeolithic image of a man with a cane. 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          Johnny is lying on his side, straining to light the small
          pile of wood he has collected with the old lighter he
          found.  The lighter sends out a spark with each try --
          but nothing catches. 

            Suddenly, he grits his teeth at a shooting pain in his
          leg.  He rolls over onto his back and pulls himself
            backwards and up against the rock wall to look at the
          leg.  Blood is dried and caked onto the torn up trousers,
          it's a real mess.

          The near subliminal SOUND of drumming.  So faint it might
          be the wind against the rocks outside.  Johnny glances
          down and spots the shard of antler nearby.  He considers
          for a moment -- it has a good sharp edge along one side --
          then picks it up.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Striking his drum quietly but insistently with his antler
          knife.


          INCLUDE JOHNNY

          who suddenly APPEARS out of thin air.  The Shaman reacts --
          it worked!  But Johnny is facing slightly away from him,
          using the antler shard he has just picked up to cut the
          torn trousers from his injured leg.  Johnny does not yet
          know anyone else is there.

          The Shaman stops beating the drum, sets it aside, but
          keeps hold of his knife.

          Johnny suddenly feels as though he's being watched.  He
          slowly turns -- the Shaman looks quickly away the moment
          Johnny's gaze finds him.

          Johnny stares at the man for a moment, then at the antler
          objects in both their hands.

          The Shaman pretends to busy himself by tossing another
          piece of wood onto his fire, but Johnny isn't buying it.

          Johnny grabs his cane, struggles to his feet and takes a
          few halting steps closer, getting a better look at him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 6/25/02 - PINK      17.


    31CONTINUED:31

          He leans way over, stares right into the Shaman's face --
          it's a comic moment as the Shaman avoids his eyes, still
          feigning ignorance of Johnny's presence.  Then Johnny
          leans up and turns away.

          The Shaman glances up at him as Johnny whips back around
          and their eyes lock.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (amazed)
                        You can see me.

            Intimidated, the Shaman instantly throws down the antler
          knife in his hand -- and disappears!

          Johnny considers this strange development for a several
          seconds, trying to process what he has just experienced. 
          He looks closely at the antler shard in his hand.  Then: 


          THE SHAMAN

          suddenly appears again, moving toward Johnny with antler
          knife in one hand, a gourd in the other.  His voice is
            challenging.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Awani gia?!

          Johnny reacts to this next development -- trying not to
          freak out at the sight of the knife raised toward him.

                                (cautious)
                        Hey.  How you doin?

          Johnny shifts his own shard of the same knife into a ready
            defensive position, held up near his chest.  The two stand
            face-to-face staring at each other.

          The Shaman suddenly points with the knife and shakes the
          gourd -- it is filled with tiny pebbles that make it rattle
          loudly.  He shouts.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Kadgwi achiwaldaman?!

          He circles Johnny only inches away from him.  And Johnny
          turns his head to follow, eyes wide, keeping his shard
          ready.  The Shaman circles him entirely, facing him the
          entire time, shaking the gourd.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry if I'm trespassing--


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 6/25/02 - PINK      18.


    31CONTINUED: (2)31

          The Shaman suddenly HOWLS in his face -- as if to scare
          him away.  Johnny pulls back slightly but doesn't flee.

          The Shaman stops, intimidated again.  He takes a step
          back.  He seems almost ready to bolt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't know what's happening
                        here any more than you do.  But
                        I'm guessing from the deerskin
                        pants that you lived a long time
                        ago. 

          The Shaman obviously doesn't understand a word.  But Johnny
          is saying it aloud for his own benefit, trying to puzzle
          things out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So maybe I'm having a vision of
                        the past and you're having a vision
                        of the future and this knife of
                          yours...

          He waves the antler shard in his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...is the link between us.

          The Shaman just stares at him for a moment, then suddenly
          howls again, and shakes the gourd right in his face--

            Instinctively, Johnny reaches out and grabs hold of it. 
          And on contact-- 

          The sudden SOUND of a distant rushing ROAR outside, and
          the light in the cleft brightens.  Johnny turns toward
          it, reacts.

          In a panic at the roaring sound that he too can hear, the
          Shaman yanks the gourd out of Johnny's hand, steps back
          and throws down his knife -- vanishing as he does so.

          But Johnny has been galvanized into action, he drops the
          antler shard and bolts toward the entrance, covers a short
          distance then falls, losing the cane!  He cries out,
            clutching his leg.  Despite severe pain and the immobile
          leg, he drags himself forward, as the rushing ROAR grows
          and the light gets brighter.

          He makes it to the outer edge of the cleft, and stares
          into the sky--          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 7/9/02 - GOLD       19.


    3232JOHNNY'S POV - THE METEOR - VISION

          Plummets down through the blue sky, a rocky fireball that
          arcs past with a deafening roar and smashes into the side
          of the small distinctive mountain Johnny saw in his vision,
            exploding in fire and debris.


  3333RESUME

          The vision ends and everything is still and quiet once
          more.  Johnny looks out and sees the exact same mountain
          that was just hit, now sitting placidly across the small
          valley in front of the cleft.  Then he glances up toward
          the clear blue sky in the direction he saw the meteor
          first appear.  Johnny is completely energized, despite
          the pain -- this is exactly what he wanted to see.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (voice shaking)
                          Origin... southwest... forty-degree
                        angle from the horizon... maybe
                          forty-five...

          He drags himself back inside the cleft to where the cane
          came to a rest and grabs it, using it to help shove him
          along until he can reach his daypack.

          Johnny pulls out his topographical map and opens it up--


          CLOSE ON: THE TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP

          As Johnny's finger traces his path into the wilderness
          and to the cleft, and from there to the mountain, which
          he stabs at with his finger.

          RESUME

          Johnny excitedly keeps tracing on the map.

          Johnny fights the dizziness, fights to stay conscious but
          can't, he shudders in the cold night and as he starts to
          pass out, he reaches for the antler shard nearby, grasping
          it in his hand -- the one lifeline he has to another human
          being.  And he's out.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 7/9/02 - GOLD       20.

          He hangs up the phone, moves to a road map on the wall

                        see how he's doin'.



          Johnny's eyes flicker open... he's in bad shape, terribly
          cold... whatever internal injuries he has in his leg are
          taking a serious toll... he sees his hand still resting
          on the antler shard, then reacts with a start as he finds --


          ANGLE - THE SHAMAN

          Looking down at him... the Shaman takes a cautious step

    35CONTINUED:35

          back when he sees Johnny move... he seems to realize the
          serious distress that Johnny's in... Johnny is weak but
          company is a good thing right now... it keeps him focused
          and awake... he's raises himself up a bit.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you probably think I'm
                        some kind of spirit or demon. 
                                (re: his leg)
                        Can a spirit bleed? 

          The Shaman doesn't understand the words, but the calm,
          reassuring tone of Johnny's voice calms and reassures.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds crazy, but I need your
                        help.  I'm hurt, I'm stuck out
                        here.
                                (re: Shaman's fire)
                        And I need a fire or I'm gonna
                        freeze tonight -- I was a lousy
                        eagle scout... can you help me?

                                        SHAMAN
                                (cautious)
                        Kagwi k'didam?   

          The Shaman considers this, his mind working, processing
          this bizarre experience.  Johnny suddenly starts to shiver. 
          He holds up a stick of the cold wood.  His voice falters.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need a fire.  I know you
                          understand.

          A long beat.  The Shaman suddenly grabs a burning branch
          from his own fire, moves over to Johnny's pile of wood
          and touches it with his own flame.  Nothing happens.  The
          flame passes through it in a ghostly fashion.  Johnny is
            disappointed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was afraid of that.  Technically,
                        this fire of yours went out
                          centuries ago.

          The Shaman tosses the branch back into his own fire, then
          reaches high up the wall of his side of the cleft, and
          locates a piece of dried vine.  He yanks it off, then
          offers it to Johnny.  But Johnny is now impatient --
          they've just seen the process fail, after all.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not getting it--

    35CONTINUED: (2)35

                                        SHAMAN
                        Wzomi tka!

          There is impatience in his voice as he shoves it toward
          his own fire -- it ignites instantly.

          Johnny stares at it, understanding completely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have the wrong kindling.

          Energized, Johnny shoves the antler shard into his pocket,
          freeing his hands as he then moves toward the rock wall
          nearby, starts searching high along its surface for the
          same vine, finally locating a small patch hidden in the
          shadows.  He breaks off a few handfuls, puts them onto
          his pile of wood, then pulls out the old lighter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bet you've never seen one of
                        these.

          The Shaman watches wide-eyed as Johnny flicks the mechanism
          and the sparks catch against the vine, which flames up! 
          Johnny carefully works the burning vine among the other
            branches, and in a matter of seconds has a roaring fire.

          Johnny laughs with the success.  The Shaman can't resist
          a small smile as well.  Johnny warms his hands against
          the flames.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny indicates the rock nearby.

                        Pull up a chair.

          But the Shaman suddenly turns and reaches for a huge
          Medicine Bag -- the size of a large pillowcase -- then
          turns it over, upending the contents onto the ground.


  3636SLOW MOTION: THE MEDICINE OBJECTS

          Spill out onto the ground, bouncing, catching the firelight --
          they sparkle and shine, almost seem to breathe and move
          of their own accord.  Then the illusion is shattered:


  3737RESUME NORMAL SPEED

          And Johnny sees that this is very much a mixed bag --odds

          and ends of stones and bones and dried plants and pieces
          of wood, including but not limited to a clump of hair and
          a dead fish.

          Johnny nods, trying to look appreciative.

          The Shaman quickly locates a small bundle of animal fur
          and picks it up, untying the leather strap that holds it
            together.  He opens it gently as he moves toward Johnny,
          then places the contents onto Johnny's open hand--


          A TINY BLUE EGG

          The brightest blue there is.  Like a jewel.  The egg in
          Johnny's hand takes him to--

          The egg is now sitting in a bird's nest in the crook of a
          slender branch.  A small hand is reaching for it.  WIDEN

                        The club is over here.

          He moves toward her and she helps him climb into her lap,
          where she holds him as he buries his head against her. 

          But they both keep their eyes open.



          Johnny stares at the contents of the medicine bag strewn
          across the rock floor, trying to put his most recent vision
          into perspective.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The stuff from your bag -- there's
                        no copper, no bronze, no iron.

                        Which you would've gotten from
                        any European trader.  Which means
                        you lived before they got here. 
                        Maybe four, five hundred years
                        ago?  At least.

          He turns away from the objects.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So five hundred years ago, you
                        fall on your head and have a vision
                        of Johnny Smith.  Why?

          The Shaman can read the puzzled tone in Johnny's voice.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Awani gia?

          He too, is puzzled.  He's been puzzled his entire life. 
          And finally, he wants an answer.  The Shaman moves to the
          objects and finds a broken arrow...

          The Shaman turns and extends it toward Johnny.  Johnny
          stares at it for a moment.  Then puts out his hand and
          makes contact, ramp to his face --



          Johnny reacts as he drops the broken arrow...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Again.  I've appeared to you more
                        than once.

                                        SHAMAN
                                (calm)
                        Awani gia?

          And the Shaman holds out a small fetish object... a wooden
          stick to which has been tied a few bright feathers and
          tiny seashells.  Johnny takes it in hand --



          Johnny reacts to this vision, letting go of the fetish.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I understand how you felt.  More
                        than you know.

          Johnny can guess the meaning...

                        "Who are you?"  "What do you want?" 
                        "Why don't you just leave me the
                        hell alone?"

          The Shaman studies him, not comprehending.  A beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've been waiting for me to
                        answer that your whole life. 
                        You've had visions of the future
                        just as I've had.  We're not so
                          different you and I, are we...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why you can see me... that
                        knock on your head... maybe we're
                        both operating out of our dead
                          zones... huh?  

          Johnny considers this for a moment... picks up his cane
          and holds it out for the Shaman... in essence returning
          the favor of the medicine bag offerings...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I don't know if it will work
                        for you like it worked for me. 
                        But you want to know who am I? 
                        Take it.  Maybe it'll help us
                        figure out why our powers have
                        brought us together.

          The Shaman tentatively reaches out for the cane and as he
          touches it, ramp to his face as we usually ramp to Johnny's
          and he finds himself in...



          --and into the passenger seat of Johnny's old convertible! 
          Johnny at the wheel.  The Shaman may have experienced
          strange visions, but he's never been in a car before --
          his hands are fiercely gripping the seat and door, his
          eyes are wide.  Then suddenly a huge truck looms up in
          front of them.  The Shaman puts his hands out to stop it --
          shouting loudly.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT THREE - 6/25/02 - PINK    31.



          The Shaman throws down the cane in panic.

                                        SHAMAN
                          Kwe-yoh!

          Johnny smiles...

                        I guess it worked, huh.

          The Shaman stands, heart pounding, scared but driven to
          know the answers he seeks... he walks away a few steps
          but then gathers his courage and returns and sits again...
          stares at the cane...

                        Yes, I'd want to know what it
                        means too if I were you...   

          His voice has taken on just a hint of a drift.  His eyes
          get distant.  His head lolls, the Shaman's voice is
          suddenly sharp as he indicates Johnny's injured leg.

                                        SHAMAN
                          Kwe-yoh!

          Johnny glances down -- a pool of blood is forming beneath
          his leg.  He is stunned back to full consciousness.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoa.

          He grabs down at his leg, turns aside the fabric of his
          trouser leg -- the wound is open and bleeding freely.

                                        JOHNNY

                        My little stroll must've made it

          Johnny tries to adjust the strip of fabric he tied above
          the wound, and thinks aloud.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't go any tighter on the
                          tourniquet, that would cut the

          The Shaman suddenly turns to him holding a lit firebrand
          from his own fire, offering it.  Johnny is confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Didn't we already go through this?

          But then the Shaman waves the flame with intent toward
          Johnny's open wound.  Johnny suddenly understands -- and
          shudders at the prospect.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stone age medicine?  No thanks. 
                        I'll shake that rattle and say a
                        prayer to the Great Spirit.  But
                        I'll be damned if...

          He stares at the pool of blood.  He struggles to keep his
          wits and keep from panicking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lose any more blood and I lose
                          consciousness.  That happens it's
                        all over.

          Almost without thinking about what he is doing -- as if
          to think about it is to change his mind -- Johnny pulls
          himself a couple of feet over to grab a burning brand
          from his own fire.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have to stay alive till the sun
                        comes up.  Keep the fire going. 
                        They'll see the smoke.  Just stop
                        the bleeding.  A little heat to
                          cauterize the veins.  That's all.

          He pulls himself back into position, leg wound exposed,
          fiery brand in position.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem--

          --He suddenly stabs the flaming branch into his open wound --
          and cries out in agony as the SOUND of flesh searing and
          blood vessels cauterizing sizzles off the walls.  Then he
          drops the branch and faints from the pain.

          The Shaman takes a step closer and inspects the wound
          with a "Stone Age" expertise that pronounces the procedure
          a success.

          The Astronomer Johnny met with earlier is directing Bruce
          to a computer monitor.  She's drinking from a can of
          Mountain Dew.

                        Sorry to drag you out of bed.

                          astronomer.  Vampire schedule.   

          The Astronomer goes to the computer, moves the mouse and
          gives a click.  The housecat screensaver is replaced by a
            satellite view of southern Maine.

                                        ASTRONOMER (CONT'D)
                        You said he took the Picture Rock

          The Astronomer clicks on a smaller section of the image
          and it suddenly fills the screen -- it's the same region
          covered by Johnny's topographical map.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's still got some ambulatory
                        issues from a previous accident. 
                        I'd say the furthest he could
                        handle in a day is about fifteen
                        miles.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                                (mental calculation)
                        That's about a hundred and eighty
                        square miles of ground to search.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which is why we want to narrow it
                        down.  Did he give any indication
                        of where he was headed?

          She makes another click, which replaces the map with a
          readout of pure numbers.  Her eyes are very curious
            indeed...



          Johnny's eyes open, dazed with pain post "operation."

          He looks over to the Shaman who is concerned for him...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (strained)
                        There's still time.

          A beat.  The Shaman reacts.  It's a great struggle for
          Johnny to speak.  He raises himself up as far as he can.

          Johnny extends his hand toward the Shaman.  The Shaman
          stares at it.  Everything that went before -- the visions
          that altered his life, this encounter in the cleft, the
          mistrust and misunderstanding -- have all led to this
          moment.  He grasps Johnny's hand--



          Their hands unclasp, ending the terrible vision.  The
          Shaman has been shaken to the core; Johnny has been
            energized with hope.  He drags himself toward the
            topographical map and the Shaman rushes to help him along.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The old man, the astronomer, the
                        cop... I saw them disappear because
                        they're descendants... of your
                          people...

          He grabs the map, pulls it into position.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (almost raving)
                        Must be hundreds of them... maybe
                          thousands... they'd be wiped out
                        if you were destroyed... don't
                        you get it?  That's why you saw
                        me in your visions... that's why
                        I ended up here... to warn you...
                        because there's still time...

          Johnny stabs his hand out at the map.

                        see that?

          The Shaman is amazed at the level of detail, but a map is
          not a foreign concept.  He nods his understanding.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Chowi.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The meteor hits here.

          He points to the mountain on the map.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You saw it -- boom.

                                        SHAMAN
                                (accent)
                        "Boom."

          But he understands.  Johnny grabs a branch from his fire
          and waves it over the map.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all going to burn.  You've
                        got to get them out.  You have to
                        make them believe you.  They won't
                        want to believe you.

          The visions and context have been enough -- the Shaman
          understands the implications completely.  He points to
          the spot on the map below the mountain where the encampment
          is -- then traces a line down the valley and across a
          river.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.  Get them across the river.

          Johnny tosses the branch into the fire.  He falls back
          onto the ground as the Shaman stands over him, unsure of
          whether he should go now or stay and help Johnny.  Johnny's
          voice is strained, closer to delirium.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did what I had to do... now
                        it's your turn... that's the
                          trick... with our little gift...
                        you do what you have to do... and
                        you never know why... until the
                        end...

          His mind clears for just a moment and he points at the
            entrance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go.

          The Shaman takes off, moving quickly toward the opening. 
          Then he pauses and looks back -- Johnny has passed out
          completely.  He stares at him for a moment.  Then he takes
          the antler knife from the sheath, lets it fall from his
          hand -- and disappears from this world.

          OFF Johnny, still as death.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:



          Johnny is unconscious, possibly dead.  


          THE SHAMAN

          is standing at the entry to the cleft, having just arrived,
          his antler knife is back in its sheath.  His face is more
          calm and collected than we have ever seen.  He moves toward
          Johnny and crouches next to him, studying his face.

          Johnny is out completely.  His breathing is barely
            perceptible.

          The Shaman glances at the fire, sees that it's burning
          very low, almost out -- generating no smoke at all.

          He puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder.  We are in a
          vision.



          Johnny and the Shaman climb into view.  They move into
          the space, and Johnny pauses at the small pool of water. 
          He crouches down, takes a handful of water and drinks it.

          lying unconscious on the ground, barely breathing.

          The SOUND of a helicopter in the distance.

          He tosses the antler away.  The vision ends.



          Johnny rouses to consciousness.

          He opens his eyes.  The SOUND of the helicopter is louder. 
          It's approaching and will pass by.  Johnny looks at the
          low fire, and knows he has one chance.  He pulls himself
          together long enough to grab a handful of dried vines
          piled nearby, and shove them onto the fire.  It flares up
          instantly, and smoke quickly ascends toward the sky.

          Johnny falls back down, and as his eyes start to close,
          he pulls the antler fragment from his pocket, clutches it
          in his hand.  The SOUND of a growing ROAR from outside. 
          Johnny's gaze moves toward the source --

          His animal skin garment billows momentarily like a peacoat,
          he is holding a wooden branch like a cane -- his silhouette
            mimicking the image that haunted him his entire life. 
          It's as if he has become a final homage to the demon who
          turned out to be a spirit guide -- and his own destiny.

          The ROAR of burning atmosphere grows, the light outside
          gets brighter and brighter, fiery red, yellow, then finally
          a dazzling white that washes out the screen.  And the
          ROAR becomes the chopping whirl of helicopter blades. 
          And the SOUND of a radio.
