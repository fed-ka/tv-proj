          FADE IN:

  11EXT. ICE POND - DAY

          A New England postcard scene.  Children of all ages
          skating.  Some older boys, wearing team jerseys, play
          hockey.  Super: Cleaves Mills, Maine 1976.


          ANGLE - CLOSER TO FIND A SIX YEAR OLD BOY

          not at all a bad skater for his age but something of a
          clown too... this is JOHNNY SMITH... and he's trying to
          skate backwards, showing off for SARAH BRACKNELL (6) a
          pretty little girl who pretends not to notice as she skates
          more unsteadily, giggling with a couple of girlfriends...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sarah... watch this...

          But as he blindly skates backwards, he heads on a collision
          course toward...


          THE GANG OF HOCKEY PLAYERS

          chasing the puck in his direction...

                                        PLAYER#1
                        Hey!  Get out of the way!

          Johnny doesn't even hear the warning above the wind and
          kids' chatter... and never sees...


          THE 12-YEAR-OLD BOY (PLAYER#2)

          who collides with him at full speed...


          JOHNNY - SLOW MOTION

          goes sprawling through the air as Sarah watches in
            horror...


          ICE - SLOW MOTION

          as Johnny's head comes into frame, smacks hard against
          the ice... HIS SHORT BREATHS the only sound we hear...

                                                                                INTERCUT:

          SUBLIMINAL FLASH - LOOKING UP AT SOLID BLACK ICE FROM
          UNDER WATER - SLOW MOTION - HIGH CONTRAST B&W

          The sound of HIS SHORT BREATHS continuing from reality...


          JOHNNY - FACE UP - ON THE ICE - SLOW MOTION

            Unconscious... eyelids fluttering...more SHORT BREATHS...


          SUBLIMINAL FLASH - LOOKING UP AT SOLID BLACK ICE FROM
          UNDER WATER - SLOW MOTION - HIGH CONTRAST B&W

          as hands reach up into frame, desperately try to break
          through the ice... SHORT BREATHS...


          JOHNNY - NORMAL SPEED

          As the HOCKEY COACH, 32, and kids, including Sarah, gather
          around him...

                          SARAHHOCKEY COACH
              Johnny...?Give him room... give him
                                                          room...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mumbling)
                        No.


          SUBLIMINAL FLASH - LOOKING UP AT SOLID BLACK ICE FROM
          UNDER WATER - SLOW MOTION - HIGH CONTRAST B&W

          The boy continues to desperately try to break through the
          ice to escape the dark watery tomb... although we can't
          see his face, we can see now that he's wearing a hockey
          uniform...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                          ...leave it...


          JOHNNY - EXTREME CLOSE-UP

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...just leave it there.

          His eyes open and he catches his breath as though waking
          from a nightmare...





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE - TEASER - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS      3.


  1CONTINUED: (2)1

          THE COACH

          smiles down at him...

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                                (gently joking)
                        Leave what where, fella?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... happened?

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        You hit your head.  We oughta get
                        you home.  Your folks might want
                        to take you in for an X-ray.

          As he helps Johnny to his feet, Johnny exchanges a glance
          with Sarah who's happy he's okay... Johnny's embarrassed.

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Okay, you guys.  Let's pack it in
                        for today.  Getting slick out
                        here anyhow.

          Everyone starts to move off the ice... Player#2, who
          collided with Johnny, looks back...


          LONG SHOT - HIS HOCKEY STICK

          is on the ice where it fell... nobody around it... and as
          the wind whistles ominously across the field, we know, we
          just know that he shouldn't go back for it... but no one
          is even thinking about what Johnny said...


          PLAYER#2

          casually skates over to his stick...


          ON JOHNNY

          as he's walking away... he stops, reacts and turns before
          he hears the sound...


          JOHNNY'S POV - LONG SHOT - PLAYER#2

          is bending down to pick up the stick as the ice CRACKS
          loudly and gives way... the boy disappears into the
          water...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE - TEASER - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS      4.

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Holy Mother of God...

          He sprints across the field back to the pond... as kids
            scream...


          LOOKING UP AT SOLID BLACK ICE FROM UNDER WATER - NORMAL
          SPEED AND COLOR

          Matching the subliminal shot we saw just moments ago, the
          boy can't find the opening he fell through, disoriented,
          his hands encounter solid ice... he flails, pounds, trying
          to get out...


          JOHNNY

          moves toward the pond but his headache intensifies...


          THE HOCKEY COACH

          on his belly, sliding across the ice to the hole...

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Hold my legs!  Hold my legs! 
                        Where the hell is he?  


          ANGLE - PLAYER#1'S FACE ON THE ICE

          as he lays on his belly grabbing the coach's legs in a
          chain with the others... inches away from his face, under
          the ice in the water, suddenly the obscured ghostly blue
          face of Player#2 appears in a silent scream for help...
          Player#1 yells with shock...

                                        PLAYER#1
                        He's here.  He's under here!


          LOOKING UP AT SOLID ICE FROM UNDER WATER

          The boy continues to desperately try to break through the
          ice to escape the dark watery tomb... we can see obscured
          figures moving frantically above the ice... and now we
          stay for beats... and it seems forever... forever... and
          the boy's efforts begin to slow and then stop... until,
          finally, light breaks through from above... and we see
          the coach has used a skate to hammer through the ice...
          his arms reach down and grab the motionless body of the
          boy...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE - TEASER - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS      5.

          ON THE SURFACE

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Pull!

          The chain of kids pulls the coach and the boy in his arms
          to stronger ice... and the boy is now coughing out water,
          shuddering from cold, but alive...

                                        HOCKEY COACH
                        Help me get him to the car!

          They carry him in a hurry toward the car... the others
          walk away from the pond still in shock... 

                                        SARAH'S VOICE
                        'Just leave it there...'

            Revealing Sarah standing beside Johnny who looks at her
            curiously...

                                        SARAH
                                  (thoughtfully)
                        He should have listened to you.

          As Johnny reacts...

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

22A MAPLE LEAF - CLOSE-UP - DAY #1

          After the cold of the tease, we can almost feel the warmth
          of spring through the TV screen.  Green and lovely and
          perfect... Super: 1995... our shot rotates around the
          leaf like a kaleidoscope as it pulls back revealing a
          second and third leaf on branches of a tree and then dozens
          of leaves until we realize we're looking down from the
          tree top...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        ...when we look at a tree from
                        below, we see bunches of leaves,
                        without composition or
                          organization, randomly spread all
                        over the branches... but nothing
                        in nature is random... from above,
                        we can see how each leaf has chosen
                        the absolute perfect position on
                        the tree to gain exposure to
                          sunlight...

          Our shot continues back to find Johnny Smith, now 26,
          lying on his stomach on a branch looking down at the
            leaves...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        This is nature's tapestry,
                          people... and it never ever fails
                        to astonish.

                                        PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Smith...

          And as Johnny reacts to the voice from below, we continue
          our move to reveal as many as sixteen high school
          sophomores in the tree around Johnny... Johnny grins
          down...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good morning, Mr. Pelson.  We're
                          learning about photosynthesis
                          today...

          We move down the tree to find, Dave Pelson, 40, to whom
          we'll refer here as PRINCIPAL -- 

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        We're also going to learn about
                          insurance today if you don't get
                        down from there right now!

                          I wanted them to see a tree from
                        the sun's point of view...


  33INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A music room with a girls' choir singing the old chestnut,
          MISTER SANDMAN under the direction of Sarah who's also 26
          now... she plays an electronic keyboard as accompanist...

                                        CHOIR
                          'Bum-bum-bum-bum... Mister Sandman,
                        bring me a dream... make him the
                        cutest that I've ever seen...'

          The girl closest to the window just sees what's going
          on...

                                        GIRL STUDENT#1
                        Omigod, Ms. Bracknell... you gotta
                        see this...

          Sarah moves to the window and looks out to see --


          LONG SHOT - THROUGH WINDOW - JOHNNY

          hanging from a branch of the tree swinging back and forth
          like a monkey as the other kids drop down...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is where we all started,
                        right up here in the trees.

          He makes the sound of an orangutan... Sarah watches with
            a controlled smile, her eyes seem to light up at the sight
          of him... the girls watch her watch him and grin... a
          couple of girls giggle and whisper to one another.


  44INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          As students move between classes, Johnny enters with the
            principal who isn't as upset as he'd like to pretend to
          be... he's an admirer of Johnny's...

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        It would just make me feel better
                        about paying the electric bill if
                        you used the classroom once in a
                          while...

          Johnny pauses just outside a door marked JANITORS, puts

          his arm around the principal's shoulder, making nice --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dave, they'll never look at a
                        tree the same way again.

          The principal throws Johnny a dubious but affectionate
          look and moves away... Johnny takes a beat to glance in
          both directions...


          HIS POV - THE STUDENTS

          are into their own things, paying no attention to him...


          RESUME JOHNNY

          as he casually backs up and opens the door... slips
            inside...


  55INT. JANITOR'S STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DARK

          Johnny's eyes aren't accustomed to the dark yet...  


            A WOMAN'S LIPS COME OUT OF THE DARK

          presses against his... he's surprised but responds...
          it's a lovely kiss...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I sure hope you're not Lars the
                          janitor.

                                        SARAH
                        Lars was just here.  He doesn't
                        kiss nearly as well as you do. 
                        Open your mouth.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                        Open your mouth.

          He opens his mouth and she drops in a slice of orange...
          as he tastes it, reacts with pleasure...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh... that's... what is that...
                          tangerine...?

                        Satsuma mandarin.  Your taste of
                        the day.  Everybody should
                        experience a new taste every day.

          And with the juice of the orange still filling his mouth,
          she moves to kiss him again and they share the sweet
          taste...

                                        SARAH
                          Tomorrow...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't tell.  Surprise me.  Just
                        keep surprising me, Sarah.


  66INT. HALLWAY - CLOSE ON THE CLOSET DOOR

          as they come out and pulling back to reveal that a dozen
          or so of their students are outside - waiting to razz
          them as they come out... they smile embarrassed...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not really trying to
                                fool anyone)
                        Yes, very impressive, Miss
                          Bracknell... and be sure to pass

                        janitorial staff for their well-
                        stocked inventory...

          ...and walk away in separate directions...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  77EXT. UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Johnny drives a vintage Cadillac convertible, top down,
          into the driveway of a lovely home... hops out without
          opening the door... glances at a town car on the street,
          a driver waiting for a client...


  88INT. SMITH HOME - DAY

          As the front door opens and Johnny enters to hear the
          voice of an evangelist (GENE PURDY, 55) preaching the
          gospel on television... Johnny frowns at the sound...





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT ONE - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS    10.

                        ...the great architects of society
                        have been righteous men motivated
                        by their faith in God to make
                        this a better world...


          INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

          Finding a strange sight - the man on the TV, speaking
          from a modest studio set, is being watched by the same
          man sitting on the couch, holding a remote control... the
          Reverend Purdy, dressed here in street clothes, is
          transfixed by his own performance...

                                        PURDY (TV)
                        Today's self-anointed architects,
                        the conglomerates and 
                          moneychangers who worship gold,
                        exploit our fine work even as
                        they tear down every holy
                        tradition, infiltrating our
                          governments, our universities,
                        the media.  Listen to what founding
                        father and our second President,
                        John Adams, wrote: "Our
                          Constitution was made only for a
                        moral and religious people.  It
                        is wholly inadequate to the
                        government of any other."  The
                          Declaration of Independence, the
                          Constitution, the Bill of Rights -
                        read any of them and you'll agree
                        there is no question that the
                        authors of our most cherished
                          documents built this nation upon
                        foundation of faith and a belief
                        in God's law.  They demanded that
                        people like you and me, people
                        who live our lives according to
                        the principles set forth in the
                        Bible, take an active role in the
                          political future of America.  We
                        are citizens of a great nation
                        and it is our responsibility to
                        stop the spread of godless
                        leadership that has corrupted
                        every aspect of this society.

          Johnny enters... reacts to the scene... Purdy looks up,
          embarrassed at being caught... but he's a man who never
          loses control and is extremely charming... he laughs at
          himself as he mutes the sound...

          The boy's look tells him, no.

          Johnny reaches into his pocket and pulls out a quarter...

          THE BOY'S HAND

          starts to put the quarter down on a square marked 1-10...
          but Johnny's reaches over and guides him to 11-20...

          The boy looks at him and then back to the barker, nods

            intercutting between the wheel and the boy's growing

          the pile growing bigger and bigger... the crowd growing
          bigger and bigger, too... and the barker sweating now...
          on one spin, Johnny pulls the money off the board and the
          wheel stops at "OO, NO WINNERS", the barker reacts
          incredulous and spins again as Johnny points the boy to a
          new box, the boy pushes the money forward into the game...
          finally ending with...

          The barker looks at Johnny, a broken man, shakes his head
          in disbelief... as he starts to leave...

          The barker moves off... and as the others congratulate
          the boy, Johnny picks a quarter off the pile, repaying
          himself his stake, and sticks it in his pocket... looks

                        your newly developed breasts.  

          She laughs, looks into the eyes of this man and imagines
          for a moment how it might be to spend the rest of her
          life with him - and she likes what she sees.  She kisses

  1717INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY #2

          Dark... finding a nurse, ELAINE MACGOWAN (30s), entering
          the room; she opens the drapes, letting sunlight in... 
          There are two beds, an unconscious old man in one, hooked
          up to an I-V...

                                        ELAINE
                                (to the old man)
                          Morning, Mister Cavis.  And how're
                        we doing today...   

          ...she checks to make sure it's dripping... and then to
          the other bed where we find Johnny lying still on his
          back, unshaven, no sign of any injuries he might have
            sustained in the accident.  A basin of water has already
          been placed on his bedstand.

                                        ELAINE
                        Are we ready for our sponge bath,
                        Mister Smith?

          She's obviously used to talking to comatose patients. 
          One odd sign: the old man has flowers and get well cards. 
          Johnny has none.  She sits gently on the bed beside the
          motionless patient, dips the sponge in the water and she
          touches his face with the sponge...

                          shave...

            Suddenly, his eyes still closed, his arm comes up like a
          snake and grabs her hard by the wrist... she yelps with
          shock and knocks the basin of water clanging to the
          floor... his body shudders like an electric current is
          going through it... pulling away, she breaks out of his
          grip... and now his eyes open... he gasps for air...

          He looks around disoriented...

          She runs out to the hallway, yells --

                        Dr. Tran, room fourteen, stat!   

          Johnny holds up his hands and inspects them slowly...
          touches them to his face as she returns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... bandages?

                                        ELAINE
                        You look fine...

                        Can't believe it...


          ANGLE ON THE DOOR

          ...the arrival of DR. TRAN CHI DUC, 31, Vietnamese, enters,
          reacts with surprise...

                                        ELAINE
                        Look who's here, Doctor...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        It's very good to meet you, Johnny. 
                        I'm Dr. Tran.

                        Am I... okay?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        You're in a long-term hospital
                        care facility.  You sustained
                        serious brain damage.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (evenly, fear humor)
                        As opposed to unserious brain
                        damage...?

          Tran picks up the medical chart at the foot of Johnny's
          bed...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (rising panic)
                        I... I can't stretch out my legs...
                        my... legs...

          As Johnny struggles, Dr. Tran moves closer to the bed to
          calm him...

                        With physical therapy, your legs
                        will be fine.  The muscles have
                        atrophied.

                          Atrophied...

          He grabs the chart out of the doctor's hands... 


          THE CHART

          starting with his name... seeing and general overview of
          his condition that begins with the words: ADMITTED: JUNE
          6, 1995... moving down to the latest entry that indicates
          his condition is stable... dated SEPTEMBER 1, 2001.

                        You've been in a coma for six
                        years, Johnny.  We had very little
                        hope that you'd ever awaken, let
                        alone retain any sort of cognitive
                        abilities.

                                        DR. TRAN
                                (off the chart)
                        Your condition was complicated by
                        scar tissue from an earlier
                          injury... perhaps suffered in
                        childhood?  Do you recall...

          Johnny doesn't answer, overwhelmed.  Tran understands,
          backs off.

                                        DR. TRAN
                        Well, there'll be plenty of time
                        for questions later.  We need to
                        run tests as soon as possible. 
                        Elaine, why don't you clean him
                        up and we'll get started.

          She goes back to the bathroom to fill up her pan again. 
          He smiles.

          He exits and Elaine moves over...

                        Now, don't go feeling embarrassed. 
                        I've been washing you from head
                        to toe for years now...

          She pulls his bedclothes back and wets the towel and moves
          it to his neck...

  2525INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER

          Tran is moving down the corridor, his mind trying to
          unravel this mystery... a young attractive nurse, ALLISON
          CONNOVER (21), is coming out of Johnny's room as he's
          about to go in...

                        The patient is asking about his

                        His mother's dead; I'd rather not
                        tell him right away.  Check his

                        name... we should try to find

          She acknowledges and moves away...


  2626INT. JOHNNY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny, still shaken by what happened, looks up from his
          bed as Dr. Tran enters... his eyes ask the question...  

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The little girl is safe.  The
                        next door neighbor looked out the
                        window when Elaine called... smoke
                        was coming out the window...

                        What... is happening to me... 

          Tran studies Johnny... a long beat... then because he is
          a man of science taught to be skeptical, he works to fill
          in a rational explanation...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The house is only a mile away...
                        perhaps you heard a fire engine
                        that had already been dispatched...

                        Elaine talks about Maggie to all

                        I was in the little girl's bedroom.

          Tran takes a beat... thoughtful... 

                                        DR. TRAN
                        Johnny, your brain is still trying
                        to cope with severe trauma...
                          there'll be consequences and this
                        may have been one - a startlingly
                        real hallucination.

                                        JOHNNY
                        An hallucination that just happened
                        to be true.

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The mind is not really
                          precognitive.  It just plays tricks
                        on us occasionally to make us
                        think so.

          He moves beside Johnny's bed... pulls out a small doctor's
            flashlight...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        We know less about how the brain
                        works than any other organ in the
                        body.  What seems clear is that
                        your brain has found a new way to
                        work.  It's taking a detour around
                        the damage and tapping into a
                        region of the brain that humans
                        don't normally use to handle
                        sensory perception. 

          Tran moves closer and begins to examine Johnny's eyes...

                        In anyone else, this part of the
                        brain might be considered a dead
                        zone.  In your brain, the dead
                        zone is suddenly very much alive.

          A six year old boy, we'll just call him SON for now, comes
          in wearing a backpack that's so big it looks like it's
          threatening to tilt him over...

                        I trade it with other kids at
                        school.  But its value goes down
                        when it's the same thing every

          Sarah is all dressed up... too dressed up... too studied,
          unnatural.  She's been sitting there for awhile trying to
          get the courage to go inside.  She looks at the wedding
          band on her finger, thinks about it and then slowly slips
          it off and puts it in her handbag.  She takes a deep
          breath, turns...


          THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

          to check her make-up once more.  It's already perfect,
          too perfect.  But she brushes her hair again, puts on
          lipstick again.  And then as she studies her face in the
          mirror, tears form and run down her face, sending mascara
          streaking, destroying all the hard work.

          His arms carry his own weight with great difficulty as he
          turns and takes one stiff step and then another...

                                (I'm being ribbed)
                        Right.  I just had brain damage. 
                        I'm not stupid.

          Johnny is physically spent and almost falls... Bruce puts
          the water bottle on the ground as he jumps out and catches
          Johnny in his arms...


          SCENE FREEZES ON HIS TOUCH THEN CONTINUES

          as Bruce guides him to the wheelchair... Johnny sighs and
          we don't see what he sees but he sees something --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't worry about the water.

                                        BRUCE
                        Water, what water?

          As he turns, his foot knocks over the water bottle,
            splashing Johnny's bare feet...

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn...

          He grabs a towel and wipes Johnny's feet... then realizes
          what just happened, does a take and looks curiously up at
          Johnny as the door opens and Allison enters with a medical
            technician...

          Purdy walking with Dr. Tran...

                                        DR. TRAN
                                  (mid-conversation)
                        ....he has been having some
                        delusional episodes...

                                        PURDY
                        The poor boy's brains were all
                        over the side of the road.  What
                        else could we expect?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        I think you'll be surprised how
                        well he's doing...

                                (overlapping)
                        I want him to have the best therapy
                        available, Doctor.  The Faith
                          Heritage Alliance is prepared to
                          continue his support even if he
                        has to stay here the rest of his
                        life.  It's the least we can do
                        after everything Vera Smith did
                        for us.

                                        DR. TRAN
                        A week ago, I would have said
                        that was likely.  Today, I'm not
                        so sure.

          None of this is good news but Purdy covers well, showing
          only his concern for Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                        But if he's delusional...

                        We don't know how serious it is
                        yet.  We may be able to treat his
                          condition through drugs or
                            psychotherapy...

          LONG SHOT - DOWN THE CORRIDOR

          Purdy looks down to see Allison and the technician move
          Johnny in his wheelchair across the corridor into an
          examination room... Johnny never looks this way...

                                        DR. TRAN (CONT'D)
                        ...as a matter of fact, we're
                        just about to run an experiment
                        with him...

                                        PURDY
                          Experiment?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        To see if we can observe how his
                        brain processes these delusions...

                                        PURDY
                        You mind if I watch?

          Tran is not comfortable with that idea...

                                        DR. TRAN
                          Actually, it might be better if...

                                        PURDY
                                  (interrupting, charming)
                        I am the boy's legal guardian
                        after all... and I guess it would
                        be accurate to say I'm paying for
                        this experiment. 

          During the above, Allison moves up the corridor to Tran.

                                        ALLISON
                        We're ready, Doctor.

                                        PURDY
                          Afterwards, maybe Johnny and I
                        can sit down, begin to make some
                        plans for his future...

          Tran has to make a quick decision and doesn't want to
          pick a fight with Purdy.

                                        TRAN
                          Allison, Reverend Purdy will be
                        joining you in the observation
                        room.  Will you show him the way?          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT THREE - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS  38.


  4141INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

          Allison escorts Purdy in... he reacts as he looks through
            a two-way mirror into the examination room where the
          technician is attaching sensors to Johnny, still seated
          in his wheelchair... revealing the small room that has
          several medical monitors that measure various brain waves,
          heart rate, and so forth...

                                        PURDY
                          Goodness, what are all those wires
                        for...

          Allison sits at a computer console that coordinates all
          of the readings...

                                        ALLISON
                        We're going to monitor his brain
                          activity.

          She begins to turn on switches...

                                        PURDY
                        After what the boy's been through,
                        it's amazing there's any activity
                        left to measure.  It's a bonafide
                        miracle right before our eyes. *

          Through the window, the technician leaves when Dr. Tran
          enters the examination room with an elderly Vietnamese
          man (UNCLE TRAN, 66)...  Allison initiates the sensors
          which begin to pulse and record data... Purdy pulls his
          chair up beside her, one of the "team"...


  4242*INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny looks up at the elderly Vietnamese man... Dr. Tran
          remains emotionally detached...

                                        DR. TRAN (CONT'D)
                        Johnny, I'd like you to meet my
                        uncle, my mother's brother. 
                        Yesterday, you told me she was
                        alive, do you remember?
                                (Johnny acknowledges)
                        My uncle was with her in Saigon
                        when she died.  

          The doctor looks to Uncle Tran who nods sadly and
            remembers... he speaks softly with stumbling English...

                                        UNCLE TRAN
                        Many were killed that day.  I saw
                        my sister die.

                        In front of my eyes.

          His eyes fill with tears.  Johnny is as confused as anyone
          else about all this... he studies the old man...

                                        DR. TRAN (O.S.)
                        What you saw was not real, Johnny.
                        Your brain is struggling to
                          distinguish real sensory input
                        from these fantasies or dream
                          images...

          During Tran's speech, Johnny looks at his hand and, knowing
          the frightening consequences of what he's about to do,
          reaches out and touches the old man's hand... as he does --


          SCENE FREEZES AND THEN CONTINUES

          Pushing to Johnny as he studies the older man... 

                                        DR. TRAN (O.S.)
                                  (continuing)
                        ...This is probably the result of
                          a reduced blood flow... 

          But his voice grows fainter and is over-lapped by the
          SOUND OF EXPLOSIONS... as we cut from a close-up of Uncle
          Tran looking curiously at the strange patient...

          mobbed with terrified refugees pushing and shoving to try

          UNCLE TRAN

          holds on desperately to his sister, the Doctor's mother

          Uncle Tran reacts with shock... tries to get his hand
          back... but Johnny won't release it...

          as Purdy watches Johnny holding Uncle Tran's hand,
          continuing to yell in the strange language... the monitors
          show radical spikes in the sensor readings...

          Suddenly the scene FREEZES except for Johnny who walks
          through the frozen figures toward the man's sister... the
          CAMERA ANGLE PIVOTS around the frozen crowd... until Johnny
          moves to a new position where he can see the woman's body. 
          As he kneels --

          to see the dead woman is clearly not Mother Tran, but a
          woman dressed like her...

          around, THE SCENE UNFREEZES... and he finds the real Mother
          Tran injured but alive, crawling slowly to the side of
          the road with some help from another refugee... as Johnny
            reacts...

          Incredibly she MORPHS as she limps, growing older and the

                        barely got six hours of sleep

          wearing sunglasses, is standing by the front desk
            uncomfortably asking the receptionist for directions...

          who catches his approach in her peripheral vision,
          interrupts her conversation with the receptionist and
          turns... and after a beat, she takes off her sunglasses...
          and she smiles uncomfortably... but is it love or pity we

          A beautiful setting in back as Sarah wheels Johnny out...
          the conversation is painfully awkward...

                        As you can see, I put on my tux.

                        You look fine.

          Silence.

                                        SARAH
                          I didn't know if I should come. 
                        But I really wanted to.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm glad you did.

          She sits in an outdoor chair... silence... as they look
          at the grounds...

                        do something with my music.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good for you.

          And it's important to note that although they are
          interacting in this scene, her dialogue is still being
            delivered from the hospital.  The consequence of this
          plays out like this on film: she will visually interact
          with the fantasy environment but audibly interact only
          with Johnny. 

          Johnny reacts to the new environment...

                        They told me you didn't know;
                        they were afraid to upset you so

          back and we go to a...

          He moves to a collection of family pictures... he sighs,
            broken-hearted, as he sees the happy faces...

                        Does he know?

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Walt and I... we...we decided
                        to raise him as our child but...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...You must be worried that I'll...

                        ...I'll tell him now, of course...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...No.
                              (a beat)
                        You've made a life, Sarah.  I
                        love you.  The greatest gift I
                        can give you is your freedom...

                                        SARAH
                        We've been friends all our lives,
                        Johnny.  That isn't going to
                        change.

          He studies her silently, loving her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It has to.  Because I don't think
                        I could bear it now, Sarah.

          Sarah, tears flowing uncontrollably now, holds his face
          and kisses him tenderly, holds him close once more...

                                        SARAH
                        I'm so, so sorry.

          She runs off, sobbing... slow push to Johnny and we begin
          an appropriate music cue TBD (possibly a reprise of the
          song we used in Act One) as we begin a montage --


  5555JOHNNY BACK ON THE PARALLEL BARS

          This time, he's driven by the emotion of the last scene,
          an intensity in his eyes we haven't seen before... and as
          Johnny rebuilds his body --


  5656EXT. ELAINE MACGOWAN'S HOUSE - DAY

          is also being rebuilt... much progress has been made...
          new wood frames have been installed around the damaged
            window...  Elaine, Maggie in her arms holding a slightly
          charred teddy bear, smiles as the workmen put the last
          wood plank into place...  


  5757BACK TO THE PARALLEL BARS - DAY #4

          Johnny pushing himself harder and harder... and Bruce is
            impressed...


  5858INT. TRAN'S OFFICE - DAY

          Tran stares at a faded photograph of his mother in Vietnam,
          his mind wondering if any of this can really be true...
          move to his computer to find a web site with the banner,
          "Ho Chi Minh City"...          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   50.


  5959BACK TO THE PARALLEL BARS - DAY #5

          Johnny clearly making progress now...


  6060INT. CHAPEL OFFICES - DAY

          As Purdy dressed in his colorful preaching robe enters
          the packed chapel holding the Bible under one arm we pan
          up over the door where simple lettering identifies this
          as "The Vera Smith Chapel"...


  6161INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY #6

          Johnny emerges from his room walking, with great
          difficulty, with two canes... Elaine and Bruce watch with
          admiration at the end of the hall... as he looks up with
          pride at them, he stumbles and falls... Bruce and Elaine
          rush to help him up but before they touch him, he waves
          them off...


  6262INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          Sarah stares out the window, thinking about Johnny...
          slow push to her face... in the background, her son, I
          guess we'll call him Johnny Jr, comes home from school...
          she puts on a smile for him...


  6363EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY #7 - LONG SHOT

          The figures of two men walking -- Bruce and Johnny using
          both canes...


  6464EXT. HO CHI MINH CITY STREET - DAY - CLOSE ON DR. TRAN

          who just got out of a taxi, moving back to reveal the
          same street Johnny saw in his vision, now rebuilt and
          modern.  Tran, dressed in a suit and carrying a small
            suitcase, looks around at a world he barely remembers, a
          tourist in his own homeland...


  6565EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON OF DAY #8

          At a junky compact car, Johnny stands, now using one cane,
          with Bruce as Elaine, Allison, the Medical Technician and
          a small group of other hospital workers say good-bye...
          Allison is holding a homemade cake that says "Good Luck,
          Johnny" in handwritten icing... Johnny nods his
            appreciation as Allison hands it to Bruce who puts it in
          the trunk near a single suitcase...          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   51.


  6666EXT. HO CHI MINH CITY STREET - DAY

          Same day as prior scene.  Tran approaches a Vietnamese
          police officer to ask directions to an address on a piece
          of paper... he's also showing the cop the photo of his
            mother... the officer points him toward --


  6767ANGLE - AN ALLEYWAY

          and we've seen it before -- in Johnny's vision.  Tran
          moves into the alleyway, chickens, as we saw before,
          skitter around his feet...


          THE OTHER END OF THE ALLEYWAY

          delivers Tran to a magical open air marketplace... the
          only man in a dark suit, Tran moves among farmers selling
          their wares... fruits and vegetables are everywhere...
          but no potatoes yet...


          MOVING WITH HIM

          passing fresh fish... a rice vendor... then he pauses as
          he sees --


          ANGLE - A POTATO STAND

          several yards away, an old woman vendor, the only one
          around dressed in red, has her back to us...


          TRAN - SLOW PUSH TO HIS FACE


          VERY WIDE

          as the figure of the only man in a dark suit carrying a
          suitcase moves through the crowd toward the figure of the
          only woman in red... we can see no features from here... 
          Dr. Tran reaches the elderly woman, places his bag on the
            ground... she turns... for a beat they just stand there...
          and then he embraces her and their bodies shudder and
          they sink to their knees in each other's arms... surrounded
          by farmers and shoppers who pay no attention to them.

          The MUSIC CUE ENDS as we --

  6868INT. BRUCE'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON - MOVING

          Shooting through the window to see the moving trees (note:
          the hospital was several hours drive away from the
            neighborhood)... moving down to see Bruce behind the wheel,
          Johnny next to him...  Johnny stares at the window, taking
          in the familiar setting...

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm only saying...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...a few days at the shore would
                        do you good...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...I am not going to Atlantic
                        City with you, Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay, okay, that Indian casino in
                          Connecticut is closer...just one

                        ...a few hours...

          Silence from Johnny.  Pounding the steering wheel, laughing --

                                        BRUCE
                        Dammit Johnny Boy, with your
                        talents and my twenty bucks...

                        My talents.  I'd just as soon
                        forget about my new talents. 
                        What I really want to do is go
                        back to my old talents and be a

                        don't blame you...

                        on the Bruce Diet... red meat, no

                        Don't even think about it.  You're
                        not driving my car.

                        Got to get back on the horse,

                        Not my horse.  I don't like your
                        driving record.

          Johnny smiles.


          RESUME SIDE ANGLE ALREADY SHOT

          as Bruce reaches behind his seat with one hand as he

          He opens the box to reveal two very cool leather racing
            gloves...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Gloves?

                                        BRUCE
                        DKNY leather gloves.  Figure if
                        you don't want to touch anyone,
                        you might as well look cool not
                          touching them.

          Johnny smiles ruefully...

          LONG SHOT - THE BOY IN THE TREE

          hanging down like a monkey now...

                        I want him to know you, Johnny. 

          Johnny turns, sees Sarah moving up behind him...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        We don't have to tell him
                          everything.  But I want him to
                        know you.  

          They lock eyes for a long moment.

                        Johnny, come here, there's someone
                        I want you to meet...

          The boy jumps down from the tree runs to them.  Johnny
          finds himself getting terribly nervous; he glances over
          at Bruce who is by the front door who grins, clearly part
          of a conspiracy.  Johnny Jr stops short in front of them
          out of breath...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.  I'm Johnny too.  We've got
                        the same name.

          Johnny Jr. looks up at him and smiles shyly, tongue-tied
          as kids are with new people... he moves into the protection
          of his mothers' leg...

                        Can we go now, mom?  

          Johnny smiles at her... in effect telling her it's enough
          for one day...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  You can go now.  It's good
                        to meet you, Johnny.

          The boy acknowledges but is already on his way to her
          station wagon parked on the street.  Sarah looks at Johnny
          with love...

                                        SARAH
                        We'll be back. 
                                (beat)
                        Welcome home.

          Johnny nods, pleased that she's forced the issue.  Sarah
          moves to the wagon... Bruce rejoins him...

                                        BRUCE
                        Nice family.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ironic, not dour)
                        Yeah.  Somebody else's.

          Sarah drives away.  Bruce opens the back of the wagon,
            revealing the cake...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I should have offered him some
                        cake...  

          And he reaches in to pick it up, but as he touches it...


          THE SCENE FREEZES


          SUBLIMINAL FLASH - ALLISON HOLDING THE CAKE OUTSIDE THE
          HOSPITAL AS THEY SAID GOOD-BYE


          RESUME JOHNNY - SCENE CONTINUES

          as Johnny is struck with some sort of violent attack...
          his face goes pale, he gasps for air...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man, not this again... come
                        on, do your biofeedback thing
                        like I taught you...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...can't... I...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yes, you can.  Nice slow breaths. 
                        Visualize.  You're at the beach,
                        nice sunny day...

          But Johnny's eyeballs roll into the back of his head and --          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT FOUR - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS   57.


  7070EXT. FIELD - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A SHOVEL

          as it breaks ground for a hole... it's raining, thunder
          and lightning... we see a pair of distinctive shoes worn
          by the man digging the hole...


  7171EXT. SMITH HOME - JOHNNY

          sinks to his knees...

                                        BRUCE
                        ... gentle waves rolling onto the
                          shore... breathe...

          But Johnny whips his head...


  7272EXT. FIELD - NIGHT - THE HOLE

          is finished... the distinctive shoes move out of view and
          we stay a beat on the dirt as the pace of the rain picks
          up until wham a body falls into frame and the face stares
          at us in the shock of death... and it is the face of
          Allison...


  7373RESUME JOHNNY - TRYING NOT TO PASS OUT

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...Allison... Call Allison...
                        warn her... hurry...

          Bruce abandons the biofeedback, knows enough to take him
          seriously, takes out his cell phone, starts to dial... 
          we can hear thunder rolling in the distance...


  7474EXT. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - DUSK 

          An isolated and narrow old town street lined with four-
            plexes... thunder rolls overhead as Allison gets out of a
          Volkswagon Passat that she just parked.  She looks up at
          the darkening skies that bring on a premature feeling of
          night, moves around back to open the trunk to take out
          some medical books when she hears the phone ringing inside
          her apartment... she hesitates a beat... but the phone
          won't stop ringing... and finally she runs up the walk
          and unlocks the door and runs inside...


          ANGLE - THROUGH THE WINDOW

          Just as she gets to the phone, it stops ringing.  She
          picks up the handle...

                          Hello...?

          She reacts as she gets no reply, sighs, hangs up and as
          she walks out of view, the camera moves to the sidewalk
          to find the distinctive shoes from Johnny's vision standing
          there... and as the first drops of rain begin to fall on
          the pavement...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
