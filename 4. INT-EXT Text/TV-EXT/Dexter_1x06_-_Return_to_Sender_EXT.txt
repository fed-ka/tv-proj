Dexter pulls up and stops.  STAY on him.  He s anxious like 
we ve never seen him before. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Some crave control over a random, 
                    chaotic world.  Some give up control 
                    to avoid taking responsibility.   

REVEAL the reason for his concern...

THE GUTTED AIR-STREAM TRAILER

where he murdered Jorge and Valerie Castillo.  It s been 
  cordoned off, swarming with UNIFORMS and TECHS.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    For me, control means survival.  
                    And I just lost control. 

  Reluctantly, Dexter gets out of his car.  In SLO-MO, he watches 
as officers comb through the salvage yard in an ever-expanding 
search.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    The crime scene.  My crime scene.                                                                                           4.



  QUICKFLASH.  Dexter has Jorge and Valerie naked and bound to 
their respective tables facing each other.  

BACK TO SCENE.  MASUKA passes in front of Dexter with his kit.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      I shouldn t have killed them both.  I 
                    didn t have enough time.  You take 
                    risks ordering sushi, not when you 
                    murder people.       

  QUICKFLASH.  Finished dismembering Jorge, Dexter realizes 
the sun is coming up and Valerie s body is still intact. 

BACK TO SCENE.  Dexter looks up to see DOAKES and DEBRA in 
the doorway of the Air Stream, then they disappear inside. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      A footprint.  A microscopic drop of 
                    blood.  What did I leave behind?  

  Steeling himself, Dexter slips under the yellow police tape.


  LaGUERTA has arrived on site.  She speaks with Doakes.  

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Please tell me this wasn t the Ice 
                    Truck Killer.  The press is already 
                    sniffing around.                                                                                              8.



                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Ain t his M.O.   

Debra crosses to them. 

                                    DEBRA
                    We got an ID.  Valerie Castillo.  And 
                    get this, her husband, Jorge, owns the 
                    salvage yard. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Try and track him down.  

Doakes  walkie-talkie crackles.

                                    MAN S VOICE
                    Sir, we ve found something. 


Guns drawn, three UNIFORMS are on point near the remains of a 
rusting Buick.  Forbes whispers to Doakes as he approaches...

                                    FORBES
                    We heard movement in the trunk. 

Drawing their weapons, Doakes, Debra and LaGuerta take lead. 
  Checking to make sure everyone is in position, Doakes steps in 
front of Debra to protect her, but she s not having any of 
that.  Stepping back around him, Debra gets on the other side 
of the vehicle.  

Now close enough to grab the lip of the trunk with one hand, 
Doakes nods to his team, then yanks it open.  But what they 
find inside shocks them...

A CUBAN BOY (OSCAR, 7) 

is curled up into a ball.  Fervently reciting the Lord s 
Prayer in Spanish.  

                                    OSCAR
                            (the faintest whisper)
                    Padre nuestro que estas en los cielos.  
                      Santificado sea tu nombre.  Venga tu 
                    reino.  Hagase tu voluntad.  En la 
                    tierra como en el cielo...

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Kid, you alright?

Doakes grabs for the boy, but the child recoils.  Terrified. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Subtle.  Maybe you should cuff him. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Hijito, todo esta bien.  Te vamos a 
                    ayudar.  <<Sweetie, it s okay.  We re 
                    here to help.>>

  LaGuerta steps forward.  A smile.  Slowly extending her hand.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Nadie te va a lastimar.  <<No one is 
                    going to hurt you.>>                                                                                          12.



Without warning, the boy throws his arms around LaGuerta.  
Holding on for dear life.  OFF LaGuerta s surprise...  

                                                                          CUT TO:


Outside the trailer, FIND Dexter packing up his gear.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    The noose is tightening. 

He peeks around the Air-Stream.  There s LaGuerta awkwardly 
tending to Oscar on the bumper of a car.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    This is how it ends, in the hands of a 
                      seven-year-old? 
                            (beat)
                    And I usually like kids.             

As Debra comes around the corner, Dexter pulls her aside.  

                                    DEXTER
                    Who s the boy?    

                                    DEBRA
                    All we got so far is he s Cuban and 
                    seems to like LaGuerta.  Spend enough 
                    time in a hot trunk and I guess she d 
                    look good to anyone.  

                                    DEXTER
                    Did he, you know... see anything?

                                    DEBRA
                    Not sure.  He s pretty out of it.   
                    Social Services is on their way.

Debra looks over her brother.

                                    DEBRA
                    You okay?  You got a whole brow thing 
                    goin  on.                                                                                          13.



                                    LAGUERTA
                    Morgan -- bring some water! 

                                    DEBRA
                            (deadpan)
                    I love her.  

Debra grabs a bottle of water from a cooler and crosses away.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Masuka.  Deb.  Doakes.  They can 
                    already sense it.  My neat little world 
                    of lies is crumbling all around me.    

                                                                      FLASHBACK:


Reading an autopsy report, Dexter s eyes nervously dart back 
and forth.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    No hair.  No fibers.  C-O-D 
                      exsanguination.  So far, so...

  Annoyed, he stops.

                                    DEXTER
                    You re hovering.

REVEAL Masuka pacing behind him.  Excited.  

                                    MASUKA
                    Keep reading. 

                                    DEXTER
                    What am I even looking for?

                                    MASUKA
                    Wait for it.    

                                    DEXTER
                    This is the prelim, I don t have time 
                    for... 

Masuka turns the page for him.  Points.                                                                                           17.



                                    MASUKA
                      M-fucking-99.

                                    DEXTER
                    ...games.

  Stunned, Dexter has to feign ignorance. 

                                    DEXTER
                       Etorphine Hydrochloride? 

                                    MASUKA
                    An animal tranquilizer more powerful 
                    than morphine.  Causes total 
                      paralysis.  That mark on her neck kept 
                    bugging me so I ordered up a tox 
                    screen.  

Dexter looks down at the autopsy report again.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    That s it.  No more donuts for Masuka.

                                    MASUKA
                    Stuff s strictly controlled.  Only way 
                    to get it is with a DEA license.  I 
                    put in a request for their list.  I ll 
                    have it for Doakes in the morning. 

Dexter hands back the report.  Forces a smile.

                                    DEXTER
                    Good work.  

As Masuka exits, the cold reality sets in for Dexter... 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I m on that list.  And eventually, the 
                    alias I used will lead them back to 
                    me.  Tick-tock.   

  Dexter s phone RINGS.  He looks to see who it is and puts on 
a happy face as he answers.

                                    DEXTER
                    Hey you...

                                                                        INTERCUT:


With the crime scene deserted, Dexter walks among the endless 
rows of rusting steel carcasses.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Nothing lasts forever.  Just ask a 
                    Ford Pinto.  

He stops.  REVEAL the dilapidated car Dexter saw LaGuerta, 
Doakes and Debra pull the Cuban boy out of.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Eventually, most serial killers 
                    get caught.  There s really not 
                    much of a retirement plan.  

Dexter passes under crime scene tape.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    But it can t end like this.  It s too 
                    soon.  I m not ready. 

Dexter climbs into the trunk.  Pulling down the lid, he s 
  immersed in DARKNESS.  A beam of fading sunlight passes through 
the missing keyhole.  Slowly, he puts his eye up to the light.

  DEXTER S POV

Like a telescope, the field of view is exactly where Dexter 
  abducted Valerie Castillo.

  QUICKFLASH.  Dexter plunging his syringe into Valerie s neck.  
As she goes limp, he throws her body over his shoulder, carrying 
her inside the Air Stream.                                                                                           23.



BACK TO SCENE.  Dexter in the trunk, a sliver of light on his 
face.    

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    He saw me. 

Pulling himself out of the car, the consequences wash over 
Dexter.  Simmering, he suddenly lashes out, kicking a hubcap 
and launching it into the air in a cloud of dust.  OFF Dexter, 
collecting himself...           


In jeans and a t-shirt, Dexter is back at the yard underneath 
the blazing sun.  RACK FOCUS to the Air-Stream.  Suddenly, the 
door swings open and there s... Harry.  He s dressed in loud 
  vacation garb, waving to his son.

                                    HARRY
                    Dex, hurry up.  Storm s on its way. 

Dexter looks up...

PITCH BLACK CLOUDS

now billow overhead.  Then, he feels a drop hit his shoulder.  
And another.  He touches his white shirt, then examines his 
  fingers.  They re moist with... BLOOD.  

  Suddenly, Dexter finds himself in a downpour.  Running for the Air 
Stream, he pulls open the door as a torrent of crimson beads 
cascade down its tarnished silver skin. 

                                                                  SLAM CUT TO:                                                                                          28.




Dexter gasps awake.  Throwing back the sheets, he s covered 
in sweat.  He lies there.  Motionless.     

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I don t have bad dreams.  When I 
                    sleep, all of me sleeps.  Nothing ever 
                    goes bump in Dexter s night.  

Getting up, Dexter crosses to the window.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I ve never felt a moment of remorse.  
                    Doubt.  Regret.  

He sees his haggard, distorted features in the window.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    What s happening to me? 

As Dexter pulls back, his reflection simply... disappears. 


FIND Oscar in back of a car as a Social Worker, (TELMA, 
Black, 50s), unbuckles his seatbelt while LaGuerta looks on. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Thanks for bringing him by.                                                                                           30.



Free of the seatbelt, Oscar scooches out of the car. 

                                    TELMA
                    Normally, I wouldn t approve of 
                    something like this...

The boy sidles up next to LaGuerta. 

                                    TELMA
                    ...but you ve made quite an 
                      impression.  You have kids?

  Uncomfortable with Oscar s closeness, LaGuerta doesn t know 
what to do.  She opts for a clumsy pat on his head.   

                                    LAGUERTA
                    No.  But I was like him once.  A 
                    stranger in a strange place.  Left to 
                    grow up in the hands of strangers.  
                    All for a better life.   

                                    TELMA
                    Police Lieutenant.  I d say you ve 
                    done okay.

  Startled, LaGuerta sees that Oscar, without looking at her, 
has slipped his hand inside her s.     

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Any luck with family here?

                                    TELMA
                    He talks about an Uncle Roberto.  But 
                    with just a first name...    

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Maybe someone will come through on our 
                    end.

                                    TELMA
                    I hope so.  I d hate to send another 
                    one of these kids into foster care.

OFF LaGuerta, considering Oscar...

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

A COMPUTER MONITOR SCREEN.  A list of names quickly scroll 
by.  We re...


Reading a comic book on his bed, Dexter looks up to see 
Harry standing in the doorway.  Pained.  Urgent. 

                                    HARRY
                    Where s your sister?

                                                                          CUT TO:

A soup can and soda bottle resting on a tree stump.  
  Suddenly, the can rockets into the air with the simultaneous 
sound of a GUNSHOT.  We re...


REVEAL Debra holding a small .22 caliber hand gun.  But just 
as she takes careful aim at the bottle...  

                                    HARRY S VOICE
                    What the hell do you think you re 
                    doing?

  Startled, Debra turns to see her father striding toward her.  

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    Dad, I  -- 

                                    HARRY
                    Not.  Another.  Word. 

He snatches the gun away, emptying its ammunition.

                                    HARRY
                    How d you open my cabinet? 

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                            (softly)
                    You hide the key in the pantry... top 
                    shelf.                                                                                          34.



With the gun secure, Harry paces.  Trying to maintain his 
composure. 

                                    HARRY
                    You and your brother know never to 
                    touch my guns unless it s under my 
                    direct supervision.

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    But I was careful...  I was only 
                    shooting at cans and bottles.  And I m 
                    good.  Like Dexter.  Now we can all go 
                    hunting. 

Harry puts both hands on Debra s shoulder.  Locks eyes with her.   

                                    HARRY
                    I am so disappointed in you.

The words blister.  

                                    HARRY
                    Get your jacket.   

  Fighting back tears, FOLLOW Debra past Harry... to Dexter.  He s 
been here the whole time and led his father right to her.  As she 
brushes by her brother...    

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    Thanks a lot. 

                                                                END FLASHBACK:


QUICK CUTS of Dexter efficiently moving through his place.  
A TRUNK hides a false bottom that contains syringes, small 
bottles of medicine and latex gloves.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...that boy saw my eyes...

Behind COUNTLESS BOOKS on a shelf, Dexter collects 
handcuffs, boxcutters, a scalpel.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...and he knows I have no soul.

Sliding the MATTRESS off his bed, we see that the BOX SPRING 
has been hollowed out.  Inside, layers of plastic sheeting, 
rope, and two, small surgical saws.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    When he gets around to the rest of my 
                    face...

Buried underneath his colorful print shirts in a DRESSER 
DRAWER is a sea of black killing clothes.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...I ve got nowhere left to hide.

  Finally, Dexter removes the front of the AIR CONDITIONING 
UNIT, retrieving his precious box of blood slides.  Into a 
large duffel bag it goes, landing on top of the other items.  
Dexter takes one last look around his place.  Satisfied he 
got everything, he zips up the duffel and heads for the door.                                                                                           41.




  Anchored out on the water, FIND Dexter in back of  The Slice 
of Life.   The duffel bag open at his feet.  Depressed, he 
begins tossing overboard the weighted down items one by one.                                                                                           43.



                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    For all the police know, this is only 
                    one murder.

SPLASH.  There go the folded plastic sheets.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    With the right defense lawyer, I 
                    probably beat this.  Who convicts a 
                    coyote killer in Miami?   

SPLASH.  The surgical saws.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    But how could I put Deb or Rita 
                    through the circus of a trial?   

SPLASH.  A bundle of dark clothing. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    This will be hard enough on them 
                    without the world wondering why they 
                    never suspected that dear, darling, 
                    Dexter had... issues. 

SPLASH.  The bottles of M-99 and a handful of syringes taped 
  together.  A beat.  Then, Dexter picks up the bag, dumping 
what s left over the side of the boat.  He stares longingly 
as the last remaining items disappear below the surface.  
But he s not done just yet...

THE BOX OF SLIDES

rests on a deck chair.  He opens the box.  Begins to  
  contemplate individual slides.   

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Alex Timmons, sniper. 

  QUICKFLASH.  ALEX TIMMONS (20s) defiant to the end. 

                                    ALEX TIMMONS
                    You think I m scared?  Do it, man... 

BACK TO SCENE.  Another slide. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Gene Marshall, arsonist. 

  QUICKFLASH.  GENE MARSHALL (50s) pleading for mercy. 

                                    GENE MARSHALL
                    Please... make it quick.                                                                                            44.



BACK TO SCENE.  Another slide.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Cindy Landon, black widow. 

  QUICKFLASH.  CINDY LANDON (30s) choking back tears.

                                    CINDY LANDON
                    I ll fuck you if you let me go... 

BACK TO SCENE.  Dexter sighs.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Such fond memories of them all.

He leans back against the boat s rail.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    They all accepted their fate in their 
                    own way.  Now it s time for me to do 
                    the same.  

  Finally, Dexter pulls a slide from the back of the box.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Valerie Castillo.  My last victim...  

Then, Dexter notices something.  Startled, he searches for a 
his maglight which he proceeds to put underneath the slide.  

There, etched in the blood, is a tiny... 

SMILEY FACE

Slowly, Dexter begins to realize...

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    He s not angry.  That s not what this 
                    is about... 
                            (beat)
                    ...he s testing me.


At his desk, wearing latex gloves, Dexter removes Valerie 
Castillo s slide from the tray.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I was wrong the whole time... 

With a steel-point, he gently breaks the dried blood drop in 
half, eliminating the smiley face in the process. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...my playmate saw an opportunity to 
                    paint me into a corner to see if I d 
                    find my way out...  

Using a piece of clear adhesive tape, Dexter applies it to 
one half of the slide.  Running his gloved finger over the 
tape, he presses down, smoothing it out.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...if I d fight to survive.                                                                                           46.



TIGHT ON the tape as Dexter delicately lifts off one half of 
blood drop from the slide as if it were a fingerprint.  He 
rolls his chair to the other side of the desk.  

A LARGE BONING KNIFE 

rests atop clear plastic.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Transferring a dried drop of blood is 
                      relatively easy, if you have a well-
                    preserved sample.

Ever so carefully, he transfers half of the drop of blood 
from the tape onto the knife s razor sharp blade.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


Dexter withdraws a man s black sock from an evidence bag.  
Placing it on his desk, he reaches into a pocket, withdrawing 
Valerie Castillo s slide in a small baggie.  Carefully, he 
begins scraping off the remaining dried flecks onto the sock.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Now for the hard part.

  Glancing out his window into the bullpen, Dexter sees...

                                                                          CUT TO:


Doakes and Debra stand beside Dexter looking at the sock 
laid out on an evidence tray. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    The wife s blood, you re sure?

                                    DEXTER
                    Without a doubt.  This was found in 
                    the Castillo s bedroom hamper.  We 
                    check all clothing items brought in.  
                    Because of sheer volume, sometimes 
                    that takes awhile.                                                                                               48.



                                    DEBRA
                    Still doesn t prove anything.  

                                    DEXTER
                    Not by itself, but I re-examined the 
                    footage I took that morning... 

He picks up a remote control.  Pushes Play.   

ON A NEARBY TV MONITOR

footage rolls of Valerie Castillo s neck wounds. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Notice the cuts along the carotid 
                    arteries.  Long.  Deep.  Valerie 
                    Castillo bled to death in minutes. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    No shit. 

                                    DEXTER
                    The person who did this wasn t trying 
                    to emulate the Ice Truck Killer -- he 
                    was in a hurry.  Probably afraid of 
                    getting caught.   

                                    DEBRA
                            (scoffs)
                    Most killers are.

                                    DEXTER
                    Except if this was a copycat, he 
                    wouldn t be in a rush.  He would savor 
                    his first kill.  Control the precise 
                    moment when Valerie Castillo died 
                    instead of simply letting her bleed 
                    out. 

Dexter hits Pause.

                                    DEXTER
                    This is all too... passive.       
                            (beat)
                    Have you completely ruled out the 
                    husband?

                                    DEBRA
                    Why re you doing this?  The kid didn t 
                    recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the 
                    photos.                                                                                           49.



                                    DEXTER
                    He was a dehydrated and traumatized 
                      seven-year-old left to fend for 
                    himself for days in a salvage yard. 

He crosses to turn off the monitor.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I hate this.  But my only way out is 
                    to turn against the one person who s 
                    always believed in me...    

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    You really think it s the husband?

                                    DEXTER
                    He was a deep sea fisherman, most know 
                    how to use a knife.  And he s still 
                    missing.  Have you finished your 
                    search of the salvage yard? 

Doakes hesitates for a beat.  Neither Dexter nor Debra sure 
what side of the fence he ll land.  Then, Doakes pulls out 
his cellphone.  On the move.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    I m gonna have  em send out the cadets 
                    again.

Once he s gone, brother and sister are left alone.

                                    DEXTER
                    I m sorry.  

He can see the hurt in Debra s eyes.

                                    DEXTER
                    I know how hard you worked on that 
                    profile.

                                    DEBRA
                    No, I really don t think you do. 

As she goes...

                                                                      FLASHBACK:


Dexter finds Debra out in the driveway bouncing a tennis 
ball against the closed garage door.

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    How long you grounded for?                                                                                          50.



Debra can t even bring herself to look at her brother.

                    Two months.

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    I had to tell him.  

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    No, Dex, you didn t.  

She bounces the ball.

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    You could ve kept your fucking mouth 
                    shut.   

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    Dad was really worried.  So was I.  

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    Well, now you can spend more time 
                    together.  I m not stupid, Dexter.  
                    That s what you ve always wanted.  

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    That s not true.  Deb, you re my 
                    sister.  

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    No, I m not.  And he s my father.  I 
                    swear, there are so many times I wish 
                    he never brought you home.

A beat.  Debra hates herself for saying it out loud.

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    I m sorry.  I didn t mean it like 
                    that. 

Stung, Dexter digs in a baggy pants pocket.  

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    Here.  Thought you might want this.  

He sets a bullet-riddled soup can down in front of her.

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    You re a better shot than me.

Dexter heads back inside the house.  Left alone, Debra picks 
up the can, running a finger over the small holes...   

                                                                END FLASHBACK:                                                                                          51.




TRACK through the maze of rusted vehicles.  PUSH INSIDE a 
wrecked pickup.  There in the dented glove compartment is...                                                                                            52.



THE BONING KNIFE

wrapped in plastic.  TILT UP.  A fresh-faced CADET is 
calling it in on his walkie-talkie.


Dexter is putting the box of blood slides back behind the air 
  conditioning unit.  His phone RINGS.  Crossing to pick up, 
Dexter checks to see who it is.

                                    DEXTER
                    Morgan...
                              (listening, a smile)
                    I ll be right there.


TIGHT ON the boning knife.  PULL BACK.  There s Dexter 
  swabbing the blade while Doakes and Debra and look on.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Wrecks like this are usually sold for 
                    scrap.  The husband stashes the knife 
                    inside and lets a demo crew shred the 
                    truck before we find it.  No more 
                    murder weapon. 

The swab Dexter holds is turning purple.  He calls out...

                                    DEXTER
                    There s blood.  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Wanna bet it s the wife s?                                                                                          54.



                                    DEBRA
                            (shaking her head)
                    It s always the husband.  You were 
                    right all along.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Shake it off.  Homicide takes time.  
                    You don t have to swing for the fence 
                    when a basehit will do.  We ID d our 
                    killer.  Now we just gotta find him.     

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    It s not Doakes  fault.  I fed him one 
                    right over the plate. 

Masuka carefully takes the knife from Dexter and bags it while 
Doakes and Debra move off... 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    As for Deb, she ll forgive me... 
                      eventually.  That s who she is.     
                      Big-hearted.  Kind.  Nothing like me.  

Then, Dexter looks over to see...

BATISTA

  bounding toward his colleagues.  The police sketch in hand. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                            (braces himself)
                    Okay.  I gave them Jorge s sock and a 
                    knife.  Let s see if forensics 
                    evidence trumps a child s drawing.       

                                    BATISTA
                    LaGuerta thought you should see this.  

He shows the drawing to Doakes.

                                    BATISTA
                    Oscar swears this is who he saw. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                      Sonofabitch.

He hands it to Debra.  She s speechless. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Dex...?

Debra turns the sketch around, revealing a drawing of...

JESUS CHRIST                                                                                          55.



Like his colleagues, Dexter is taken aback as well. 

                                    MASUKA
                    Dude, he has your eyes. 

                                    DEXTER
                            (joking)
                    Reminds me, I need a shave.  

Debra shakes her head, moving off.  

                                    DEBRA
                    Too fuckin  weird.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Jesus Christ saved this kid? 

                                    BATISTA
                    On his own for as long as Oscar was, 
                    who s to say he didn t.

OFF Dexter, relieved...


As Astor plays with friends, FIND Dexter and Rita lighting 
  birthday candles in tandem on a picnic table.

                                    RITA
                    When did lighting candles become more 
                    fun than blowing them out?

                                    DEXTER
                    Nice turn-out.

                                    RITA
                    I called all the moms to assure them 
                    that Paul would not be making an 
                      appearance.    

                                    DEXTER
                    Do Astor and Cody know you told their 
                    dad not to come?

She considers her children.  A beat.

                    After presents. 
                            (then)
                    Ready?                                                                                          56.



Rita and Dexter carry the lit birthday cake over to a waiting 
table of children to the strains of  Happy Birthday.   Then, 
as Astor is about to blow out her candles, Rita whispers into 
her ear.

                                    RITA
                    Make a wish, baby.  Just don t tell 
                    anyone or it won t come true.   

                                    ASTOR
                    But it already did come true.  Daddy s 
                    not here.

With a big huff, she blows out the candles.  As everyone 
claps, FIND Dexter.  He s pulled back away from the crowd.  
  Watching the celebration from afar.   

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I was wrong about birthdays.  Maybe 
                    the reason to celebrate them is what 
                    they offer -- the hope of living to 
                    see another one.   

Dexter gives a little wave to Debra who s helping hand out 
cake, but she s not in the forgiving mood.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I barely escaped getting caught this 
                    time.  

Dexter positions himself so that he now hides behind a tree.  
He crouches.  Lying in wait.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I realize now my days are numbered.  
                    So... 

  Suddenly, Dexter swoops in.  Picking up Cody who was 
  bringing out his crudely wrapped present for Astor from the 
house.  The boy squeals in delight.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...I d better make the most of them.  

OFF Dexter, carrying Cody over to Rita and his sister...

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


Dexter installs new locks on his front door.                                                                                          57.



                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    All along I thought this was a game my 
                    alter ego and I were playing.  But 
                      relationships change.  Evolve.  And 
                    this one is turning deadly. 
                            (beat)
                      I wouldn t have it any other way. 

Dexter grabs the door handle.  Checks the locks.  Makes sure 
they re secure.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Like Harry said in my dream...

He looks to the horizon. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...a storm s on its way.             

OFF Dexter, shutting the door behind him... 

                                                                      FADE OUT.
