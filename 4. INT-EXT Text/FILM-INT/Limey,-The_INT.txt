EVENING.
He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
glide.
His moves are neat.
His expressions just as
economical, not giving much away.
Outside the planes are
practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and
chemical.
He's only got one light bag.
Unzips, unpacks a few things.
Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items
(shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar
British brand names.
Goes into the bathroom.
Turns on the shower in there.
Comes back to sit on the bed.
Takes an envelope out of his
jacket.
ENVELOPE
Turns it over to see the return address on the back.
CUT.
NIGHT.
Wilson in the back.
Stares at the impenetrable name on the
driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver.
DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
mirror.
CUT.
NIGHT.
Ed takes Wilson inside.
ED
I didn't expect anyone.
WILSON
No reason.
ED
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
WILSON
Round about, yeah.
They've entered a cauldron of family life.
TV blaring
(SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).
A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama".
Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
Spanish) that she only has two hands.
A sullen TEENAGER
walking by.
ED
I didn't even know who I was writing to --
just someone with the same last name.
She never talked about any family.
WILSON
It was better than a telegram.
Ed opens a screen door to the backyard.
NIGHT.
Ed drives Wilson back to his motel.
Wilson silent.
Ed still
not quite sure who he's dealing with.
Is this really or
merely a grieving dad?
ED
What you gonna do, man?
You gonna go to
the cops?
WILSON
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
ED
Those streets up in the hills, man.
Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on
the ball.
Two o'clock in the morning,
it's dark, your mind is all agitated,
you're drivin' a little too fast ...
(beat)
Those curves don't kid around.
Could be talking about the girl.
Wilson doesn't move.
But
touch him, he'll explode.
Out the window lights are passing,
but no landmarks.
He might as well be on the moon.
ED
You should talk to Elaine.
That was her
best friend.
WILSON
She didn't write to me, did she.
ED
She didn't know what to say.
(shrugs)
I thought someone should say something.
To someone.
With me it was, I don't know
-- Jenny liked me for some reason.
I
felt like I owed her.
WILSON
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass
or whatever?
ED
(self-conscious again)
Not me, man.
I'm no drug dealer, what
you think.
WILSON
(re Ed's tattoos)
I think you didn't get that lot in the
Navy, doing your National Service.
ED
I already told you, man.
Corcoran.
Know
what that is?
State prison.
WILSON
Nick's a nick, n' it?
No matter what
state you're in.
State of remorse, most
likely -- for gettin' caught.
ED
But that's not me anymore.
That's when I
was into the gang lifestyle.
That's not
who I am now.
Five years in the joint --
that's it for me, man.
Now Wilson drops the clanger.
WILSON
Just got out meself, didn't I.
And Ed turns.
Looks at Wilson.
Fellow ex-con.
CUT.
DAY.
Hundreds of tables.
Under bright lights.
Displaying every
kind of firearm.
Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make
machine guns.
A weapons bazaar.
WILSON AND ED
Walking around.
Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help
but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless
mayhem.
DEALERS
Touting their wares.
VISITORS
Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages.
Guys
in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders.
Women
in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal
protection.
WILSON
Doesn't know where to look.
At the booth featuring "Classic
Cowboy Collectibles" -- or the most OBESE COUPLE he's ever
seen who just walked by.
PA SYSTEM
Attention:
the long-range vermin-
shooting panel is due to commence in two
minutes in the blue room at the rear of
the Convention Center.
... and other anomalous oddball ANNOUNCEMENTS in the
background as long as we're here.
DEMONSTRATION
At a booth selling laser attachments.
BEAM SALESMAN
BeamSight II is easily mountable on any
shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will
project a small, bright red dot directly
onto the point where your weapon is
aimed ...
For purposes of display, a smiling YOUNG WOMAN is the
"target."
WILSON
Walking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with
the symbol of death on her.
TABLE
A .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's.
DEALER
Man knows what he likes.
ED
(he'll talk if Wilson won't)
Lookin' good.
DEALER
(while Wilson checks)
That's a high-end item.
Total
reliability.
ED
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
DEALER
Yes, sir.
Won't find a better CQC on the
market.
Wilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question.
ED
CQ what?
DEALER
Close Quarters Combat.
Keep one in my
own home.
WILSON
Trouble is, I'm not at home, see.
Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know,
while I'm here -- with me mate.
Nods at Ed.
DEALER
Oh really?
Where you from?
WILSON
England.
(sighting the weapon)
Only, we saw there was a show on, thought
I might pick something up for a price,
type of thing.
DEALER
You came to the right place, sir.
My
wife's second cousin is English.
Well,
Scotch-Irish.
Can I interest you in a
holster?
WILSON
Just luck, this, really.
Never been to
one of these before.
DEALER
You're in gun country now, my friend.
WILSON
(picks up another, checks it
out)
Been to the Boat Show.
DEALER
(re Wilson's new selection)
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has
accessible features -- makes a nice
concealed-carry piece.
ED
(playing the reluctant buyer)
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
WILSON
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork,
y'know.
Just popped over on a quick
visit.
DEALER
I can take care of the paperwork.
WILSON
Yeah?
DEALER
No problem.
If you don't have a problem
with me reporting this gun stolen.
A look of understanding between them.
WILSON
No.
Not at all.
(to Ed)
Do we?
ED
Not me, man.
WILSON
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what
you said -- four hundred for this one?
DEALERS
Well, I'll have to add another two
hundred on top of that.
WILSON
Oh, aye?
DEALER
(another look)
... for the paperwork.
CUT.
DAY.
Ed drives.
Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase
beside him.
WILSON
Violation of my parole, this.
(a perfect pause)
-- Goin' abroad.
Ed shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor.
ED
You hadda show up on a weekend.
This
weekend.
Wouldn't've even been a gun
show ... for another month.
WILSON
Fucking out of order, that.
Shouldn't be
allowed.
As he puts away a box of ammo.
ED
Now what.
You gonna take your new
arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just
like that?
Boom bam boom.
WILSON
It's only insurance.
Can't be too
careful.
This Terry Valentine, he's
probably a wonderful fella.
They were
together how long?
ED
Five years, I think.
Long time.
WILSON
Well, there you are.
Jen must've liked
him.
Doesn't make Ed feel any better.
Nor does the way Wilson
seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques.
Paying
attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and
cars without clutches work over here.
ED
(remembering)
Jenny told me she met him at the beach.
Got blinded by his smile.
(beat)
You believe that shit?
Son of a bitch
never smiled at me.
Buried her at a
"private" service.
Private for who.
Him?
WILSON
(confused)
Hang about.
I thought you said he come
into the restaurant where you worked with
Jenny.
ED
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant
where I work.
That's not where they met.
WILSON
And that's where you met Jenny.
ED
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a
waitress.
Before she met him.
But
that's not where she met me.
Not in my
restaurant.
WILSON
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
ED
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson at the wheel himself.
Getting the hang of L.A.
Driving downtown.
Along one of the major boulevards.
Glances at a street sign as he goes by.
Picks up the map
book on the seat beside him to check his route.
DAY.
Parks it.
Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him
unpack at his motel.
Unzips it.
Under the usual assortment
of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still
more personalized items:
a set of select slim
lockpicking/cutting tools.
A SCRATCHING at the door.
It opens.
He's in.
Waits.
Cautious.
Nothing.
He starts along the hallway.
A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take
as Wilson passes.
SUPERVISOR
Hey!
Wilson stops and turns.
Says nothing.
SUPERVISOR
How'd you get in here.
WILSON
Walked.
SUPERVISOR
You walked.
(coming over)
What the hell are you doing here.
WILSON
Looking for a bloke named Valentine.
Know him?
MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here
gathering.
The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange
glances.
SUPERVISOR
He's expecting you?
WILSON
(beat)
I doubt it.
The Supervisor moves toward Wilson.
SUPERVISOR
So why would he want to see you.
WILSON
I have a message for him.
About Jennifer
Wilson.
SUPERVISOR
Jennifer Wilson.
More looks are exchanged.
WILSON
You know her?
SUPERVISOR
Yeah.
I know her, all right.
She came
down here once, stirred up a shitstorm.
We lost a full day's work, took me weeks
to get back on schedule.
If she hadn't
a' been Terry's woman I would've broke
her jaw.
'Course, she's nobody's problem
now.
Wilson stares at him.
WILSON
Is Valentine here?
SUPERVISOR
What do you think?
Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area.
WILSON
Where is he, then?
SUPERVISOR
Listen, get the fuck out of here before
you get hurt.
Who the fuck do you think
you are, waltzing in here, asking
questions?
Wilson just looks at him.
SUPERVISOR
Do you hear me, asshole?
The Supervisor shoves him.
The Meat Puppets move a little in
anticipation.
Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's
going to leave.
SUPERVISOR
Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,
don't you?
He pushes Wilson again, hard.
SUPERVISOR
Go on, get outta here.
He pushes Wilson again.
Still, Wilson won't leave.
SUPERVISOR
Fuckin' nut.
Go on.
This time he tries to slap Wilson.
Wilson blocks the
Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.
The Supervisor
stumbles back and falls to the floor.
THE MEAT PUPPETS
Move to Wilson.
He tries to fend them off, but there are too
many.
They beat him.
When they find that he's armed, they
beat him harder.
CUT.
DUSK.
A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three
decades at least.
Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
bathing suit named ADHARA.
She advances slowly, not entirely
sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.
At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.
He looks
her up and down, more from reflex than anything.
She continues on.
Eventually she emerges through sliding
glass doors and on to a patio.
HER POV
A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.
His back to us.
The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.
ADHARA
Approaches, then sits beside him.
His voice is soothing, but
with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
slightly ahead of everyone.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
Not before.
Not before.
Think about it.
What does it mean?
What -- no, I'm not.
Think.
Yes.
See?
You figured it out
all by yourself.
I know.
Are we done?
Okay.
He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn.
VALENTINE
Adhara.
I told your father, if you're
looking for a name, you can't go wrong
with a constellation.
ADHARA
I used to hate it.
Now I like it.
VALENTINE
Could be worse, he could've named you
Reticulum.
He turns and we see him for the first time.
VALENTINE
Polished.
Handsome.
Charismatic.
Especially when he's
smiling like he is now.
He leans over and kisses her.
VALENTINE
Is there anything in the world that you
want or need?
ADHARA
I want to know why you need that scary
guy in your house.
VALENTINE
Gordon?
He's been with me for years.
He's not as tough as he looks.
ADHARA
Then what good is he?
VALENTINE
Is it possible that you're too young to
be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
ADHARA
Is that a problem?
VALENTINE
Not for you, clearly.
ADHARA
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
VALENTINE
Am I a thing?
ADHARA
Well, you're certainly not a person.
VALENTINE
I'm not.
ADHARA
No.
You're not specific enough to be a
person.
You're more like a vibe.
VALENTINE
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
ADHARA
It's not a knock.
VALENTINE
It's not a compliment.
ADHARA
It's an observation.
Like:
I'm hungry.
When are we eating?
VALENTINE
As soon as you get dressed.
ADHARA
What kind of food?
VALENTINE
Anything but Japanese.
ADHARA
Why?
VALENTINE
I'm not into finger foods.
Too fussy.
ADHARA
Like you.
VALENTINE
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.
Buffets.
Salad bars.
ADHARA
You demand to be served.
A fork
fetishist.
VALENTINE
It's just fuel to me.
I'm not there for
distractions.
ADHARA
For some, eating is a sensual experience.
The sensual experience.
VALENTINE
That's what Gordon's always saying.
ADHARA
Oh, god.
His cell phone rings.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
Yes.
He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY)
stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
I'll be there as soon as I can.
He hangs up.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
We can leave as soon as you're ready.
ADHARA
Okay.
EVENING.
She comes in.
A modest studio apartment.
Puts her bag on
the kitchenette countertop.
Glances at her answer machine to
see if she has any messages.
The phone RINGS.
She sits down
glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands.
EVENING.
Elaine opens the door.
Wilson in the hall.
ELAINE
I was just going to toss some vegetable
rolls in the microwave, open a can of
diet soda.
(beat)
Want to take me out?
CUT.
NIGHT.
Wilson and Elaine at a table.
WILSON
... No, I went in for more improving
pastimes.
Philosophy classes, language
courses, European history, all that lark.
Did you know that in Paris in the
Eighteenth Century there were more rats
in people's houses than there were people
in people's houses.
ELAINE
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
WILSON
Here, are you always this sarky?
ELAINE
Sarcastic, moi?
Maybe I'll mellow when
my ship comes in.
It's expected any day
now.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
WILSON
Weren't you on a television series?
ELAINE
(has he seen it?)
If it played in England somebody owes me
money.
Who told you that -- Eddie?
WILSON
(yes)
Said it went on for donkey's years.
ELAINE
Three seasons.
They found that's the
limit of human tolerance when it comes to
following the adventures of a family of
Mormons on the Chisum Trail.
(blinks coquettishly)
I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
WILSON
Oh, it just ended, then.
ELAINE
Now who's being sarcastic?
WILSON
When you've lost as many years as I have,
love, puts things in perspective, know
what I mean.
ELAINE
I'm sorry.
I guess the rest of us have
no excuse for wondering where the time
went.
(raises her drink)
It must've been the bars.
Their food arrives.
ELAINE
It's a kind of prison, doing a series.
Early to bed, early to rise, no time off
for good behavior, you grab the boodle
for as long as it lasts.
(the kicker)
Only difference is you can't get arrested
afterwards.
Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
table.
Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his.
A BUSBOY
bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without
anyone even asking.
WILSON
I can't believe Jenny told you all that.
About me.
She was always so embarrassed.
ELAINE
Not embarrassed.
WILSON
(correcting)
Ashamed.
ELAINE
Not ashamed.
Wilson looks at her.
Okay.
What then.
ELAINE
Disappointed.
WILSON
She never told Eddie, though.
ELAINE
She never told anyone else.
(making light now)
About the convict strain -- or is it
stain?
No, I was privileged.
I was
someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
WILSON
How'd you manage that, then.
ELAINE
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic
television I do double-duty as a voice
coach.
Not that her accent would have
hobbled her progress.
Not with that
look.
WILSON
Yeah, well, she started all that in
London.
ELAINE
Modelling.
WILSON
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.
(putting it on a bit there.
Then, upper crust:)
Central School of Speech and Drama.
It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know.
At seventeen.
They offered her a place
at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait
till the next session and she was always
in hurry to get on, was Jenny.
She could
talk posh without any training, when she
was knee-high to a grasshopper.
(indicating himself)
Show up the old man, you know.
Elaine smiles slightly.
None of this information new to her.
But warming to this man.
ELAINE
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
WILSON
In Jenny?
'Course not.
How could I be.
'Course I wasn't.
ELAINE
She was twenty-one when she came to me.
(looks at him)
... Straight from leaving you.
WILSON
Footloose and fancy free.
ELAINE
She was happy here.
However the two of
you might have parted.
Don't think she
wasn't.
It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here.
Looks at Elaine.
WILSON
That's the trouble, n' it.
(hard as nails again)
She enjoyed life.
CUT.
NIGHT.
They come in.
ELAINE
Make yourself at home.
Steal something.
That gets her a look.
ELAINE
There's nothing I can't afford to lose.
She goes to make coffee.
Wilson looks around.
ELAINE
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
WILSON
Well, I gathered something from the
article what Eddie sent me.
Some sort of
pop music producer, wasn't it.
Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of "pop" music.
ELAINE
Rock n' roll, is what we called it.
He's
sort of a forgotten figure now, but back
when the West Coast was the grooviest
place on earth, Terry Valentine was where
all the happenings happened.
More of a
kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that
means.
Just took that whole Southern
California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with
it.
Packaged and sold it.
Made out like
a bandit.
FLASH CUTS:
VALENTINE. At home. Watching as Adhara undresses, either
deliberately for him, or just casually. She smiles as she
notices he's looking.
WILSON
What's he done lately.
That line pregnant with meaning.
Elaine looks at him.
Avoids answering the question actually implied there.
ELAINE
(brings a tray over)
Lives high off the hog and waits for the
next big thing.
Like me -- but on a
grander scale of failure.
WILSON
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.
My
employer, Mr. Lindgren --
ELAINE
-- Your employer?
WILSON
-- Mr. Lindgren.
ELAINE
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON
My employer.
ELAINE
What line is he in.
WILSON
Proprietor of a London firm.
Of
longstanding.
ELAINE
I see.
WILSON
Based in London, but with international
concerns.
ELAINE
I bet.
WILSON
Various enterprises, style of thing.
ELAINE
I thought you said you never did an
honest day's work in your life.
WILSON
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is
dishonest, exactly.
ELAINE
(she gets the picture)
Right.
WILSON
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave,
never run yourself down, son -- 'cause
there'll always be plenty of people
willing to do it for you.
ELAINE
In what capacity are you employed by this
Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON
This and that.
Y'know.
Ways and means.
ELAINE
-- When he wants someone run down, you're
willing to do it for him.
They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and
sit down.
Coffee steaming.
ELAINE
So what's the deal.
You and Terry
Valentine at twenty paces.
Is that what
this is about.
WILSON
Why not.
ELAINE
Are you serious.
WILSON
Have you ever known me not to be.
Elaine looks away:
ELAINE
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
WILSON
What'd you want me to do.
Stay at home,
twiddlin' me thumbs.
Doing sweet F.A.
[Fuck All].
ELAINE
You don't believe it was a car accident.
WILSON
What do you think.
ELAINE
Terry's never going to give you
satisfaction.
Not the type.
WILSON
Depends, don' it.
ELAINE
On what.
What makes you so certain.
WILSON
I'll bloody well ask him.
ELAINE
There's the phone.
You want his number.
WILSON
That look again.
WILSON
I got his number.
ELAINE
Past caring.
ELAINE
I'm not going to help you.
She goes into a bathroom.
Shutting the door behind her.
WILSON
Sips coffee.
Bites into a cookie.
CUT.
LATE AFTERNOON.
Ed sits in here, RADIO on.
Wilson appears out of the brush,
gets in.
Ed turns the radio down.
ED
(mindful of the odd car driving
past)
Told you you wouldn't be able to see
through that gate.
WILSON
Gate's open.
I had a butcher's at the
house.
ED
(alarmed)
Who'd you butcher at the house?
WILSON
Butcher's hook.
Look.
(doesn't anyone speak English
in this fucking country?)
I don't much reckon those minders of his.
ED
Huh?
WILSON
He's brought in the heavy mob.
ED
What?
WILSON
Extra muscle.
Bodyguards.
ED
Has he?
WILSON
They look a right load of wallies.
Patrolling back and forth outside the
gate, all ponced up like the fuckin'
Household Cavalry.
(ducks suddenly)
Watch it.
As one of the "bodyguards" runs by, only fleetingly glimpsed
by us.
ED
That was one of them?
WILSON
(sits up again)
See what I mean?
Wearing bloomin'
uniforms n' all.
Off Ed's perplexed look ...
AFTERNOON.
Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive.
A smattering of
other GUESTS.
Elaborate catered cuisine.
They mosey over to
the wet bar.
BARTENDER
Gentlemen.
What can I get you.
WILSON
(suggesting Ed take first
crack)
Dubonnet with a twist?
Baby sham?
Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?
By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease.
ED
(to Bartender)
Got a Coke?
AFTERNOON.
Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror.
TV on
in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!).
Not quite
satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom.
BATHROOM
Valentine takes one more closer look.
ADHARA (O.S.)
You have the same posters.
Valentine turns.
VALENTINE
Hmm?
ADHARA
Is lounging in the large tub.
Staring dreamily at a couple
of framed posters on the walls:
more 60's psychedelia.
ADHARA
That you have down at your office.
Valentine sits on the edge of the tub.
With a nostalgic air
as he looks at her:
the embodiment of youth.
VALENTINE
Different ones.
He strokes her wet skin.
They kiss lightly.
ADHARA
I like the colors.
VALENTINE
We all did.
ADHARA
It must've been a time.
A golden moment.
Beat.
VALENTINE
Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you
don't really recall ever having been
to ... a place that probably doesn't even
exist except in your imagination ...
somewhere far away, half-remembered when
you wake up ... but when you were there you
spoke the language, you knew your way
around ...
(significant pause)
That was the 60's.
With that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go.
Then pauses, turns again.
VALENTINE
No, it wasn't.
Wasn't either.
Comes back to her.
Faraway look in his eyes.
VALENTINE
It was '66 ... early '67.
(comes back to now)
That was all.
He goes.
DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.
AFTERNOON.
Wilson wanders around, exploring the house.
Comes to a wall
of photographes.
Casually scanning them as he passes slowly
by, he's caught up short by one.
POV
A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter.
WILSON
A series of emotions play over his face.
He turns -- SEES
Valentine coming down the stairs.
Valentine joins the party
without noticing him.
BY THE BUFFET TABLE
Ed peruses the available food.
Valentine comes over to check
it out.
Glances at Ed without recognizing him.
VALENTINE
Hi.
And goes away.
Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.
AFTERNOON.
Wilson has come up here.
Peeks into one room.
Moves along to
another:
the master bedroom.
Opens the door gently.
Adhara is still enjoying her bath.
Wilson enters.
Careful.
Aware that someone's in the adjoining
bathroom.
The soft RIPPLE of WATER from in there.
Perhaps he
even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around.
He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the
television.
Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.
BATHROOM
Adhara reacts.
ADHARA
Shit.
She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel.
Quickly wrapping herself, she exits.
BEDROOM
Adhara enters and goes for her purse.
She pulls the RINGING
phone out and answers it.
ADHARA
Hello?
Hey!
Great.
You got my message?
Yeah.
No, Crestview Terrace, not
Crestview Place.
Yeah, there's like three
different ways up the hill; the quick way
is to bear to the right.
Sure.
Okay.
Okay.
'Bye!
She hangs up and begins toweling her hair.
After a moment
she stops.
Something isn't right.
She looks around the
room, and her eyes stop on the TV.
Her brow furrows, trying
to place the familiar image on the screen:
a girl towel-
drying her hair by the bed.
ADHARA
That's me.
She looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned
on and pointed toward the bed.
She's not sure if it's funny
or creepy.
CUT.
DOWNSTAIRS.
AFTERNOON.
Valentine mingling, all smiles and movement.
WILSON
At the foot of the stairs.
Watches him, all stillness and
intensity.
VALENTINE
Catches Wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double
take, then moves on.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.
AFTERNOON.
Adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads
for the stairwell.
DOWNSTAIRS.
AFTERNOON.
Adhara descends the stairs.
WILSON
Turning to SEE her as she comes down.
ADHARA
Makes her way across the room to Valentine.
ADHARA
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet
person.
VALENTINE
I'm a gracious host.
WILSON
Watching them, when --
GUY
Excuse me?
Wilson looks at him.
Reluctantly.
GUY
Don't you work with Ian?
WILSON
Ian?
GUY
I could swear I met you with Ian at the
EMI offices in London.
WILSON
Sorry.
Wasn't me.
GUY
You sure?
WILSON
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
GUY
That's too bad.
Ian's got a good thing
going over there.
WILSON
Yeah?
GUY
Turned that place completely around.
180
degrees.
WILSON
No kidding.
GUY
What I like about Ian, he believes in a
chain of command, but not a chain of
respect, you understand what I'm saying?
WILSON
Right.
Chain of respect.
That's good,
that.
GUY
Yeah.
I really admire the guy.
Well.
Good to meet you.
WILSON
Yeah.
Cheers, mate.
The Guy leaves.
Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other
side of the room, separated from Valentine.
He heads for
her.
VALENTINE
Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
attention.
He notices:
WILSON AND ADHARA
Talking in a corner.
She seems attentive.
VALENTINE
In a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still
keeping his eyes on:
WILSON AND ADHARA
Who, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk.
Finally, they
separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck.
VALENTINE
Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her.
ADHARA
Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low.
After a
few moments of conversation, they both look toward:
WILSON
On the deck outside.
Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here
with a plate of food.
What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES
it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a
high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.
On the other
side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less
than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.
WILSON (cont'd)
(jumps back with only slightly
affected vertigo)
Flipping heck.
Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in
agreement.
ED
If you could afford a house like this you
would buy a house like this.
Wilson edges forward to the rail again.
WILSON
What are we standing on?
ED
Faith.
They stand there looking out.
Quite a view once you get used
to it.
Breeze.
ED (cont'd)
(nods to the hazy distance)
You could see the sea from here if you
could see it.
WILSON
Could you?
But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine
inside the house is making his way out here.
WILSON
Why don't you go nick one of those little
cooker what's its warming up the sausages
cocktail and meet me in the garage.
Look
about for a toolbox while you're at it.
Ed considers.
His is not to reason why.
ED
Okay.
Ed moves off.
Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded.
VALENTINE
Hi.
Terry Valentine.
He extends his hand.
Wilson shakes it.
WILSON
Pleasure.
VALENTINE
Have we met?
There's something I can't
quite --
WILSON
EMI in London.
I work with Ian.
VALENTINE
Ah.
WILSON
You must know Ian.
VALENTINE
I don't.
WILSON
Great bloke.
Really turned things around
there.
180 degrees.
VALENTINE
I suppose that's good, unless things were
fine the way they were.
WILSON
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.
Definitely.
Otherwise, people get lazy,
don't they?
Forgetful.
Start thinking
they can get away with things.
Gotta
shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay
attention.
Wilson looks at him.
Valentine looks back.
Something about
those eyes ...
EXCITED GUY
Terry, Terry ...
The Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine.
WILSON
Glad I got to meet you.
EXCITED GUY
Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...
VALENTINE
Thanks.
You, too.
WILSON
Be seein' you.
The Excited Guy ushers Valentine away.
Wilson watches him
go.
EXCITED GUY
Charles Grodin is here.
CUT.
AFTERNOON.
Ed, waiting.
Wilson enters.
WILSON
Got it?
Ed displays the Sterno.
WILSON
Toolbox?
Ed points to a table, where a toolbox sits.
Wilson crosses
to it, begins going through the contents.
WILSON
Put the Sterno on the ground, near the
center of the garage.
Ed does.
Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and
crosses to the rear of one of the cars.
Dropping to the
ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank.
Ed raises his
eyebrows and moves toward the door.
Wilson crosses to the
other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well.
Then he
puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the
exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance.
THE GASOLINE
Spills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the
garage door.
DOWNSTAIRS.
AFTERNOON.
Valentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and
looking around.
He stops as he sees Wilson once again
stepping onto the deck.
He points Wilson out to Gordon, who
nods and heads for the deck.
DOWNSTAIRS.
AFTERNOON.
Valentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her
Girlfriend.
As Valentine greets her, he glances outside
where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck.
Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her
Girlfriend.
When he glances back to the deck he's a little
concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore --
just Wilson coming back in.
WILSON
Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.
Behind
him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.
A
few yells of "Call an ambulance!" etc. are heard.
VALENTINE
Moves that way.
WILSON
Moving across the room towards the front door.
They are
heading right toward each other.
WILSON AND VALENTINE
Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.
Wilson's
eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.
Valentine throws
a last look back before reaching the deck.
Ed jumps -- though he's driving.
The gas pedal his most
pressing concern.
Negotiating the dangerously winding road
comes second.
Exhilaration mixed with panic.
WILSON
Steady on.
ED
You steady on, man.
What the fuck else
did you do back there.
ED
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the
chance.
WILSON
That would be too easy.
ED
Too easy?
WILSON
He's gotta know why.
ED
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever
will?
What more do you want, man?
Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) -- BAM! -- another
car shoots out to cut them off, sideswiping them.
Despite the fact that Ed is still in the driver's seat (and
managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts
like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car
into reverse, virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own
foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes
monitoring the door-mirror, steamrolls the car backwards
towards Avery.
Valentine comes back in.
In the living room beyond, Adhara
stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him.
Cops
visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge.
VALENTINE
Heading that way.
Then stops.
Backtracks.
Something
peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it.
His
wall of photographs.
AN EMPTY FRAME
The one that had contained the picture of Jenny.
CUT.
AFTERNOON.
Safely down the hill.
Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer
now.
WILSON
Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his
jacket and looks at it.
CUT.
NIGHT.
Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall.
Staring
ahead, without purpose.
Halfheartedly watching a game of
pool in progress.
Just hanging out.
Strange, threatening
characters.
One of them is young.
Lean, hungry-looking.
STACY is his name.
A shrewd, scheming kid.
But definitely a
little unhinged.
Weirder is his companion.
UNCLE JOHN.
The
title isn't one of courtesy.
He's an actual blood relative.
Maybe 25 years older than Stacy.
But intellectually younger.
Physically, much bigger.
The man is huge.
Nevertheless, the
safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.
Way
they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they
feel in each other's company.
Tight bond.
They're good
buddies.
AVERY
Walks in.
Stops to look around.
Spots his two freaks.
Walks toward them.
DOORWAY
A mysterious black man has followed Avery in.
THOMPSON is
his name.
He hangs back and watches.
AVERY
Makes contact.
AVERY
Stacy.
Stacy turns to see him.
Uncle John looks vacantly.
STACY
(bored)
Hey.
AVERY
Come over here.
That was in the way of an order.
He nods around the corner
where it's less crowded.
Stacy stops Uncle John from
following, and goes after Avery.
THOMPSON
At the bar.
Keeping his eye on them.
AVERY
Speaks softly.
Alone with Stacy.
AVERY
How they goin', kid?
STACY
Not bad.
AVERY
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
STACY
Okay.
Avery gives him an envelope.
AVERY
Same as last time -- the rest after.
STACY
(pockets it)
Where do we go?
AVERY
When you find the guy, you'll know.
STACY
What shit is this.
I just do it.
I
don't prepare it.
AVERY
I'll point you in the right direction,
but you'll have to take it to the end-
zone.
He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I
figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
STACY
This is un-fucking professional.
AVERY
See, a successful man like me has
limitations -- I lose touch at a street
level.
So I have to depend on a smart
boy like you who's closer to the nitty
and the gritty than I am.
STACY
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is.
This is a lifestyle I embrace.
AVERY
That's why I'm letting you take care of
this.
I'm the one with appearances to
maintain.
But who gives a shit about
you?
Not even God.
CUT.
NIGHT.
Wilson on the bed.
Watching TV (ACCESS HOLLYWOOD!).
KNOCK
at door.
He turns down the TV.
Takes a .45 from the springs
under the bed.
Looks carefully through the peephole in the
door.
Opens it.
Elaine has come to visit.
Lets her in.
After
closing the door resumes his position on the bed.
Elaine looks around.
ELAINE
I was in the neighborhood.
I come down
here quite a bit.
Watch the planes
taking off.
(re this motel)
Study the architecture of early David
Lynch.
But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now.
Leans back against the door.
Wilson remains silent.
He's done the same to Elaine now that
he did to Ed.
Almost magically induced her to a confessional
verge.
Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this
revenge tragedy.
But here goes:
ELAINE
Jenny was supposed to come to my place
that night.
She called me, asked if she
could come over.
She and Terry had been
-- having some trouble.
Lately.
I don't
know about what.
On this occasion, it
reached some sort of crisis point.
WILSON
She told you all about my details but not
about his.
Lovely.
ELAINE
She'd never called me like that before.
She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry --
than upset or afraid.
But she never
turned up.
I called the house but only
got the answer machine.
When they found
her ... she'd been going the wrong way.
Not the direction she'd have gone if
she'd been coming to see me.
Or coming
straight to see me.
Who knows.
Maybe she
just wanted to drive.
She looks at Wilson.
Shrugs.
That's it.
That's all.
Isn't
it?
WILSON
(measured)
How did you come to have my address?
Found it, did you.
Among her things.
ELAINE
You think Terry gave me access to her
things?
Probably sold her clothes.
WILSON
(gently urging)
And how did you get it?
Elaine looks at him.
ELAINE
She gave me your address.
Wilson nods.
ELAINE (cont'd)
(starting to realize)
Not long before ...
(realizing)
She said if anything ever happened ...
(realizes)
That's how you know.
That's why you're
so sure.
(realization)
Jenny's telling you.
She's sitting on the bed now.
CUT.
Wilson and Elaine.
Getting dressed.
She's in pantyhose.
Fastening a bra.
He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt.
WILSON
How long've you lived here?
Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt.
Her bra strap
cuts across her bare back.
ELAINE
This town's been chewing my flesh
since ... what we now refer to as "the
early 70's."
(thinks back)
Christ, my past became nostalgia and no
one even asked me.
WILSON
Early 70's.
I was away.
(tries to remember)
Maidstone.
Possibly Brixton.
ELAINE
These more highlights from the Zagat
prison guide?
Wilson looks at her:
she's the one who goes to bed with ex-
cons.
WILSON
You don't seem bothered.
ELAINE
You don't know how I've compromised my
standards.
WILSON
Tell us about it.
ELAINE
It's too involved; a lifetime of non-
involvement.
Anywhere else I'd be an
interesting little number, here I'm just
SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.
(quickly)
SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
WILSON
Oh, I was gonna say ...
ELAINE
Still, there have been rewards.
It's
sunny.
And some of the producers who
call even have credits.
WILSON
I can see the attraction.
She glances up at him to try and see how he means that.
Is
he looking at her or out the window?
ELAINE
What did you do?
To make them take the
early 70's away from you.
WILSON
A jeweller's up the West End.
We
tunnelled our way under the shop floor
from the public lavatory down the road.
Filthy work.
Trouble was, the bloody
thing collapsed -- after we'd made the
grab, 'n all.
Would you Adam n' Eve it.
ELAINE
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you
actually broke and entered you would only
have been charged with making a mess.
WILSON
We were lucky to be nicked.
Me and the
lads went down there Sunday evening, we
weren't discovered till the Monday.
Good
job we were still breathing.
ELAINE
It didn't discourage you, though.
WILSON
Hey?
ELAINE
From pursuing your chosen profession.
WILSON
I'll tell ya something:
it made me a
model prisoner.
Put me right off any
escape attempts.
Tunnel my way to
freedom after that experience?
Not
bloody likely.
ELAINE
I was inside once.
I punched a cop at a
demo.
WILSON
Did you.
What was that in aid of?
ELAINE
Who remembers.
WILSON
Get seven years, did you?
ELAINE
Overnight.
What about just now?
WILSON
Just now?
(playful, goes over, ready for
more)
Overnight?
ELAINE
You have been away.
(lies back, regards him
carefully)
Or is all this just new to you?
WILSON
It's true.
Has to be said.
I got off to
a slow start.
ELAINE
I don't believe it.
WILSON
Honest.
Didn't know where to look till I
was 21.
ELAINE
Pushing the legal limit even then.
He stands again, vaguely disappointing her.
WILSON
Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
street.
Funnily enough, she was married
to a milkman.
Straight up.
I said,
"Good is she?
Been around?"
He said,
"Good?
Listen, mush, it's not that she's
been around, it's that she's been around
hell of a long time."
He laughs uproariously at that.
But the point is:
he's sort
of complimenting both Elaine and himself.
They've been
around, had their knocks, they've lasted.
Elaine remains
unsmiling.
Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt,
hose, no shoes.
She asks again the question Wilson avoided
answering.
ELAINE
Your most recent incarceration.
What was
that for?
And again he evades the answer she wants.
WILSON
It was for nine years.
(buttoning his shirt)
The last nine years.
CUT.
Valentine at the wheel.
Adhara besides him.
ADHARA
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've
never done this drive.
VALENTINE
All your life.
That happened while I
swam the length of my pool.
Adhara looks back over her shoulder.
Checking the road
behind.
VALENTINE
What's the matter?
ADHARA
Nothing.
I guess it's hard to pass on
this road.
VALENTINE
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain
majesty.
ADHARA
Just feels like the car behind has been
following us the longest time.
VALENTINE
I sure hope so.
A big utility vehicle.
With Avery in the front passenger
seat.
And three bodyguards he's brought along to protect
Valentine.
RICK driving, TOM and LARRY in the back.
TOM
All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't
be the same rate.
Travel time is down
time, right?
I mean, we're not even in
the same car as the client.
(to Avery)
You told me the job was at the house.
When we get to it.
Well, are we shadowing
the client right now or are we just going
the same way?
The company I was with in
Seattle, these distinctions were made.
Now, I don't dispute him getting the full
whack.
(he means Rick, who's older)
Seniority and all that.
But if I'm
getting paid the same hourly rate when
we're at the house as I am in this car,
that doesn't sit well with me and I feel
obliged to say so.
'Cause in Seattle
what you're paying now for so-called
travel time was half what we got for
actual clock-time with the client.
So I
just feel we should get more when the job
actually commences.
After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story, Larry
just turns to him and says:
LARRY
... I'd really like to eat your pussy.
CUT.
Going somewhere.
Unaware of the creeps in her wake.
An "8x10" of Elaine on their back seat.
Another picture of
her on a page torn from a "Player's Directory."
UNCLE JOHN
Maybe she doesn't even know the English
guy.
STACY
(driving)
Avery said she was tight with his
daughter.
UNCLE JOHN
That don't mean nothin'.
Stacy knows better than to argue with a moron.
UNCLE JOHN
She's nice lookin'.
STACY
So what.
UNCLE JOHN
I dunno.
I just said she's nice lookin'.
STACY
And I said so what.
You think she's any
happier?
UNCLE JOHN
What d'you mean, any happier?
STACY
Any happier than any other asshole in
life.
Pause.
UNCLE JOHN
I dunno.
I never met her.
CUT.
DAY.
On screen:
A BEAUTIFUL MODEL -- but speaking in ELAINE'S
VOICE.
ELAINE
At a mic.
Wearing headphones.
Matching her voice to the
model's lip movements.
Looping this commercial or whatever
it is.
Wilson.
Comes to a window where he can see Elaine inside in
the sound-proofed studio.
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson and Elaine talk while technicians change reels.
ELAINE
-- they want Southern, I do Southern,
they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they
want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm
shit out of luck.
(pauses)
One thing I can't do is English.
Americans can't.
Shouldn't even try.
And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
WILSON
You ever been to London?
ELAINE
Only in the movies.
WILSON
I've 'ardly ever left it.
ELAINE
Yeah, well, you're here now --
(re Wilson's accent)
-- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
WILSON
I've got the hang of the driving.
Found
this place all right.
ELAINE
Stick with me, kid.
Looks big when you
get here but you can cover it in five
minutes.
Beat.
ELAINE (cont'd)
So, is there anybody in your family who's
not a criminal?
WILSON
Not that I recall.
ELAINE
What about your grandmother?
WILSON
Nah -- she was married to me grandad --
he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to
make knuckle-dusters down the shop.
Crafty old sod.
ELAINE
He alive to see this?
WILSON
(shakes head)
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon,
Muswell Hill.
Watching Doris Day.
ELAINE
What'd your father do?
WILSON
Black market during the war.
Elaine shakes her head.
ELAINE
I guess you're just habitual.
WILSON
You sound like my fucking probation
officer.
ELAINE
Won't he be looking for you about now?
WILSON
Good luck to him.
He couldn't find his
prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
ELAINE
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
WILSON
Do us a favor.
Can't even go have a
slash without 'em saying, what're you
going in there for?
DAY.
Wilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor
approaching her apartment door.
Pause to kiss.
Walk closer.
And Stacy appears at the other end of the hall.
Both arms
stretched out with the .38 at the end of them.
STACY
Hi, kids.
Starts to squeeze off a shot.
As Wilson pushes Elaine to the
floor.
As another SHOT rings out from further along the hall
behind Stacy.
Catching him across the cheek.
Only skimming
him.
But knocking him down.
Bullet chipping the wall.
UNCLE JOHN
Across from Stacy.
Freezes, his own gun in hand.
AT THE STAIRS
Three BLACK GUYS.
Including Thompson.
They approach.
Guns
pointed at Stacy and Uncle John.
WILSON
Hand on his .45 now.
But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind
him.
Wilson lowers the .45.
ELAINE
Flattened herself back against a wall.
Petrified.
STACY
Sits on the floor.
Holds his hurt face.
Thompson walks over
and picks up Stacy's gun.
One of the other blacks relieves a
reluctant Uncle John of his.
THOMPSON
(stops at Wilson)
Come with us.
If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks
gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head.
Cocks the
hammer.
They all go off down the stairwell.
Except Stacy and Uncle
John.
Hit men wondering what hit them.
CUT.
DAY.
Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell.
A small window, high up.
Bricks and debris around the floor.
And Wilson and Elaine.
Sitting, leaning against opposite
stone walls.
ELAINE
Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady
income.
Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket.
Lights himself
one.
Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine.
WILSON
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
ELAINE
(lights up)
A leech on the welfare state in addition.
You don't miss a trick.
WILSON
I fiddle it.
They got me down as an
immigrant with five kids.
Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that.
ELAINE
Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her
imaginary siblings.
Though real ones might have been nice.
This an unspoken
thought between them.
ELAINE (cont'd)
Do you remember the last time you saw
her?
WILSON
Last time might as well've been the
first.
I remember all the times, don't
I.
Watching her grow up --
(finding the word)
in increments.
ELAINE
She told me you were a ghost in her life.
Daddy the friendly ghost.
Coming back to
haunt her.
WILSON
Well, she twigged by the time she was
eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the
Royal Marines or doing scientific
research in the jungles of Borneo or
playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
OTHELLO.
ELAINE
Still, you could never ... do what she
wanted.
Wilson shakes his head.
WILSON
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.
(tries to laugh about it)
Little kid.
Ten year old.
"If you're
naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."
She
didn't want me sent down again, see.
When I was planning some job.
"I'll tell
'em, Dad, I promise I will.
Here, look,
I'm calling the Old Bill right now" --
picking up the telephone.
I can see her,
the phone in her hand.
Became a sort of
joke between us.
Only it wasn't a joke.
ELAINE
She never would have turned you in, not
in a million years.
WILSON
I know that.
But as time went on ...
well, it wasn't a joke, was it?
She had
a feeling about it -- about the last job
-- how long I'd get the hook for.
Said
she wouldn't be there this time when I
got out.
DOOR opens.
Thompson.
Gun in hand.
CUT.
DAY.
Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows.
Dockyards,
harbor activity outside.
Toward a door with things
stencilled on it.
One of them:
US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS.
A man named FEATHER.
Black.
Half sitting on the edge of a
table.
Wilson is shown in.
Wilson at the door.
Sizes Feather up at a glance.
WILSON
This is where I come in.
He walks confidently in.
Outside, through the window, an
image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a
crane.
There's a chair.
Wilson sits in it.
Feather squints a little.
Seems ready to listen to whatever
Wilson has to say.
WILSON (cont'd)
How's it going, squire, all right?
Now
listen -- when I was in the nick --
second time, it was -- no, third.
Third
stretch, yeah.
There was this screw had
it in for me.
That geezer was top of my
list.
Two years after I was slung, I saw
him.
He was sitting on a bench in
Holland Park.
There was no one else
about.
I coulda gone up behind him and
snapped his fucking neck.
But I left it.
Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't.
'Cos
what I thought I wanted wasn't what I
wanted.
What I thought I was thinking
about was something else.
This berk on
the bench wasn't worth my time.
See what
I mean?
It didn't matter.
It meant sod
all in the end.
Feather has been listening to this, expressionless.
Now he
raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified.
FEATHER
There's one thing I don't understand.
(wants to make this clear)
The thing I don't understand ... is every
motherfucking thing you're saying.
WILSON
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I
can see that, I'm on your manor now,
right.
So there's no need to get out of
your pram.
I'm Johnny-come-lately to all
this.
Whatever the bollocks between you
and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing
to do with me.
I don't wanna know.
FEATHER
Well, I'll tell you.
I believe this
Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of
money.
WILSON
I can well believe it.
I'm sure he has
done, son.
He's about as straight as a
dog's hind leg.
FEATHER
But I can't be sure.
I don't even know
who he is.
He's too insulated.
Too many
layers around him.
WILSON
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.
I'm
here on another matter entirely.
FEATHER
(moves to window)
Yeah, I guess you are.
WILSON
Good job your lot showed up when they did
or it would've been me for the high jump.
FEATHER
That dude who works for Valentine.
He's
the one sent those guys after you.
You
know that.
WILSON
Yeah.
Shouldn't wonder.
Must've done.
FEATHER
So what's your beef, pal?
WILSON
Nothing financial.
Strictly personal.
(moves to window)
I can see how all this import-export
malarkey might give rise to confusion
where I'm concerned.
A foreigner,
showing up unexpectedly, like.
FEATHER
(looks at him)
It was you.
Downtown.
WILSON
(all innocent)
Eh?
FEATHER
Because that wasn't anything to do with
me.
And suspicion has been cast in my
direction.
(pondering)
Didn't make any sense.
Choosing those
shitheads over me, cutting me out of the
deal, then screwing them over too.
WILSON
No, I can reassure you on that point.
Valentine was just as surprised by that
turn of events as you.
FEATHER
He'd already grabbed more than his
allotted cut.
Didn't think he'd be so
bold as to take all of it.
WILSON
All of what?
FEATHER
Of the deal, man.
WILSON
Oh, yeah, right.
The deal.
FEATHER
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad
at you ... that must make us pals.
WILSON
As you prefer, squire.
As you prefer.
FEATHER
(weary of his life)
In which case I'll just do what I usually
do.
WILSON
And that is?
FEATHER
What am I doing?
He's standing at the window, staring out.
As if Wilson isn't
even in the room any more.
A ship being loaded out there.
Inspectors with clipboards.
Trucks like the ones we saw at
that warehouse downtown.
WILSON
Looking the other way.
(turns to go)
Gotcha.
CUT.
DAY.
Stacy.
Nasty bruise on his cheek.
Takes a cue off the rack.
Chalks up.
STACY
Straight rotation, no shit, call your
shot.
UNCLE JOHN
Lemme break.
They're playing against a couple of other creeps.
CREEP
You broke last time.
STACY
Let him break - he likes to break.
CREEP
Fuck you.
STACY
I wouldn't talk.
CREEP
Huh?
STACY
I saw your mother on the Strip last
night.
She went up to three guys, said
she'd like 'em to stick one in each,
know what I mean?
Creep rushes Stacy.
But doesn't get past Uncle John.
Who
drops him with one punch.
Flooring him between two pool
tables.
Stacy then goes over.
Supports himself with a hand
on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face.
BARTENDER
(calls)
Stacy.
Stacy looks.
Bartender holds up phone.
Stacy goes over.
BARTENDER (cont'd)
I can do without you inhibiting my
business.
Stacy just scowls, takes the phone.
STACY
(into phone)
Yeah.
UNCLE JOHN
Breaks.
STACY
Hangs up.
Goes back to Uncle John.
Picks up his cue again.
STACY (cont'd)
We've been fired.
CUT.
KITCHEN.
DAY.
Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door.
It's clear that
he's not the head chef here -- because the HEAD CHEF, an
Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going.
Over this we hear:
WILSON
(over)
Where's Big Sur?
ELAINE
(over)
Up the coast.
WILSON
(over)
How far?
ELAINE
(over)
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
WILSON
(over)
Fancy it?
ELAINE
(over)
I could use a vacation.
Of course, I
keep forgetting, for you this is a
vacation.
WILSON
(over)
Never thought of that.
(grunt of laughter)
Busman's holiday.
ELAINE
(over)
What's in Big Sur?
WILSON
(over)
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
ELAINE
(over)
How do you know?
WILSON
(over)
Bloke told me.
Beat.
WILSON (cont'd)
(over)
You shouldn't go back to your place.
Not
till ... this is resolved.
Another beat.
ELAINE
(over)
I hear it's a nice drive.
CUT.
Ed drives.
Wilson beside him.
Elaine in the back.
ED
What d'you say, Elaine?
ELAINE
Not much -- you?
ED
Same.
ELAINE
Uh-huh.
ED
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for
some equity-waiver thing?
ELAINE
Probably.
ED
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann
movie, you know -- with Pacino and
DeNiro.
Got three callbacks.
ELAINE
Really.
ED
Didn't get it.
ELAINE
Well, those are the breaks.
ED
Not no more, they ain't.
I quit that
acting shit, man.
ELAINE
You just cooking then?
ED
Hell, no.
I started writing.
Elaine and Wilson exchange glances.
DAY.
Stacy and Uncle John sit and drink.
Uncle John lamenting
their monetary loss.
Stacy thinking to himself.
UNCLE JOHN
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half
grand.
STACY
There's more than a measly few grand in
this.
UNCLE JOHN
There is?
STACY
Something's on.
UNCLE JOHN
What?
STACY
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-
his-name-is than he thinks I know about
him and his operation.
UNCLE JOHN
You do?
STACY
You bet.
UNCLE JOHN
Like what.
STACY
Like he'd never hire me for real.
Not
week-to-week.
I don't have the
credentials.
He thinks I'm just a
sociopath, someone he can turn to when he
needs "plausible denial."
UNCLE JOHN
Well, we blew it, didn't we?
He ain't
wrong.
STACY
(savage mimicry)
"He ain't wrong."
Listen, I know this
asshole who did just go to work for him.
Full-time.
And this dickhead's parents
just told me he took a road trip up the
coast.
That's the type of individual gets
hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off
to his family while on the job.
UNCLE JOHN
I don't get it.
STACY
I don't know who that English guy is.
Some kind of --
(finding the word)
-- courier or something.
Maybe a seller.
Maybe a buyer.
But Mr. Avery wanted him,
those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha
there's a briefcase somewhere.
UNCLE JOHN
What's in it?
STACY
(shrugs)
Drugs?
Cash?
Both if we're lucky.
UNCLE JOHN
How we gonna get that lucky?
STACY
While they're all fucking each other
over ... couple of parties like us could
move right in.
CUT.
Ed still driving.
Wilson next to him.
Opening a new
cigarette pack.
ED
I've been wondering something.
WILSON
Again?
ED
Do you have any friends, man?
WILSON
Yeah, I suppose.
Call 'em that, yeah.
Down the boozer Saturday night.
Meet
some of the lads.
ELAINE
(a little more pointed)
Friends and colleagues.
WILSON
You can't count on very many people,
that's the trouble.
Number of times a
decent job's been cocked up ...
ELAINE
Poor baby.
Little back-seat sarcasm there.
Wilson looks kind of bitter.
WILSON
Useless gits.
I was gonna do the Post
Office once.
ED
What post office?
WILSON
The lot.
The whole British bloody Post
Office.
I had a brilliant plan -- all
worked out -- work of genius, it was.
Could I get anybody interested?
No --
they're too busy pinching orange squash
from the milkman.
Lazy sods.
Jumble
sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the
crack of dawn.
ELAINE
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
WILSON
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Flicks some cigarette pack paper out the window.
He looks around.
She doesn't shut the door.
VALENTINE
You've made it ... brighter.
SUSAN
I don't want you here, Terry.
VALENTINE
Sure you do.
He turns to look at her.
Smiles.
Somehow it doesn't work on
her.
One of the reasons she divorced him.
Just one.
She
sighs.
Resigned to his presence.
Starts to close the door.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
Don't shut the door -- I have people with
me.
Now she gets it.
SUSAN
What kind of trouble are you in?
VALENTINE
No trouble.
Susan SEES Adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the
drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick
defiance.
SUSAN
Surely you can think of somewhere else to
take one of your chippies for a quick
getaway.
VALENTINE
Susan.
He actually puts his hands on her arms.
To hold her firm
while he locks onto her eyes.
And doesn't smile.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
I just need ... somewhere remote.
Away
from L.A.
For a couple of days.
(now the kicker)
I pay for this house too.
Susan reads him.
He's not claiming ownership rights.
He's
telling her this house, because of the connection to him, is
a target of some kind.
SUSAN
What have you done?
The Land Cruiser pulls up outside.
Avery emerges, comes
over, comes in.
Susan notes the bodyguards out there as well.
AVERY
(to Valentine)
We weren't followed.
(to Susan)
Susan.
Valentine lets Susan go.
Knowing she's now speechless at
what's turned into, as far as she's concerned, a home
invasion.
VALENTINE
(moving, looking around)
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
SUSAN
-- You know his name is Frank.
VALENTINE
Is he here?
SUSAN
You know I don't live with him.
VALENTINE
Go to him.
Go to his studio, or writers
workshop or artists colony, Esselin
retreat, nudist camp --
SUSAN
Are you finished?
VALENTINE
In a couple of days this whole thing --
SUSAN
Who's looking for you?
VALENTINE
Go now.
Encouraging, if not in fact ushering, her towards a bedroom.
SUSAN
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to
leave again.
I can't believe this.
VALENTINE
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm
to blame.
It's that simple.
That does it.
Susan turns on him.
SUSAN
It is that simple.
I blame you for
everything.
Losing inhibitions and
chicks without bras didn't have to lead
to hardcore porno in every American
household:
that was you.
The first on
your block to turn on a camera in a hot
tub and peddle it to your friends.
A
little recreational pot didn't inevitably
have to lead to the eventual devastation
of the inner cities:
you made that
happen, the first time you bought a
bigger stash than you yourself meant to
smoke.
It happened when you made your
first buck hyping some so-called "event"
that was over before it began or marketed
some "product" whose only value was its
instant disposability.
You were the
first person to see there was a lot of
money to be made selling Navajo rugs --
you've even stolen from the fucking
Indians!
You looked at Charlie Manson
when all he had to show for himself was a
guitar instead of a knife and saw another
merry prankster, the freedom of the
frontier.
Your pal here --
(Avery)
-- He saw gated communities.
Rich people
coming to him with their money, terrified
of what people like you had left of this
society.
Why invest in a marriage and
children when you had him?
He's your
oracle.
But you couldn't even trust in
friendship, could you?
Still he's the
dog you call for its dinner.
Because
everything that might once have been fun
or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and
cold and sour.
That was your "genius,"
Terry.
Haven't you read your own press?
CUT.
NIGHT.
Adhara, dressing.
Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a
figure slithers by.
NIGHT.
Valentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!).
Tom
is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire
magazine.
VALENTINE
Turns to look through the sliding glass doors.
HIS POV
Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the
ocean.
LIVING ROOM.
NIGHT.
Valentine and Avery, still watching TV.
VALENTINE
(re:
the channel)
Check the news.
Avery starts looking around.
AVERY
Where's the remote?
Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.
Tom looks up from his
magazine.
Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head:
It's nothing.
LIVING ROOM.
NIGHT.
Valentine and Avery are still looking for the remote.
Avery
stops, his attention drawn to the fact that he hasn't heard
anything from Larry.
He crosses to the window.
HIS POV
The driveway, car at the top partially visible.
No sign of
Rick.
AVERY
His brow furrows.
VALENTINE
Notices this, looks out toward the backyard.
HIS POV
Same as before, except Larry isn't there.
VALENTINE
Moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the
deck and back yard.
Still no Larry.
VALENTINE
Where's Larry?
AVERY
Leaves the window and moves to Valentine.
Tom has joined
them.
After a beat:
AVERY
Turn all the lights out.
I'll get Adhara.
Tom begins looking for the light switches.
VALENTINE
What's happening?
Avery is already heading for the bedroom.
AVERY
Stay away from the windows.
BEDROOM.
NIGHT.
Adhara, finished dressing, looking at herself in the mirror.
The lights behind her go off.
She turns to see Avery coming
toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror.
ADHARA
Uh, you've heard of knocking?
AVERY
I need you to come with me.
ADHARA
Why, what --
He takes her by the arm.
Firmly, but not roughly.
AVERY
Please.
She sees in his expression that something is up.
ADHARA
Okay.
LIVING ROOM.
NIGHT.
Tom and Valentine have finally found the light switches, and
the room is dark.
Valentine moves slowly to the window,
takes a tentative peek.
HIS POV
The driveway.
Hard to see.
Is there something moving out by
the shed?
AVERY
(off)
I thought I said stay away from the
window.
AVERY
Entering the kitchen with Adhara in tow.
He brings her
around behind the counter.
AVERY
Everybody in the kitchen.
Valentine and Tom move to join Avery and Adhara.
AVERY
Behind the counter.
Everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the
kitchen and crouches down.
They have a wall behind them and
all the windows in front of them.
ADHARA
(scared)
What's going on?
Avery and Tom have drawn their guns.
VALENTINE
We think someone is here.
ADHARA
We think?
VALENTINE
We can't find ...
(what are their names?)
... two of our guys.
TOM
(fucking typical)
Larry and Rick.
ADHARA
Did somebody call the cops?
Tom snorts.
Avery looks at Valentine:
Haven't you told this
girl anything?
VALENTINE
No.
ADHARA
Why not?
VALENTINE
Because --
AVERY
Because I'm taking care of it.
ADHARA
You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --
She starts to stand.
Valentine pulls her down.
ADHARA
Hey.
TOM
Mr. Avery.
Avery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch.
THEIR POV
A silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the
porch, trying not to be seen.
We don't get a very clear
glimpse.
AVERY
Draws his gun and takes aim.
THE FIGURE
Careful not to become fully visible, but growing more
courageous with each step.
AVERY
Locked on him, waiting.
VALENTINE
Puts Adhara's hand to her ears.
THE FIGURE
We see a little more now than we have before.
AVERY
He sees enough.
Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle
flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and
Valentine flinching.
THE FIGURE
Hit.
Spinning and collapsing to the ground.
AVERY
Lowers his gun.
Turns to Tom.
AVERY
Watch my back.
Avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the
body.
KITCHEN.
NIGHT.
Valentine and Adhara drop to the floor.
Tom, gun raised and
pointing, tries to see who shot Avery.
KITCHEN.
NIGHT.
Tom squints, trying to see.
TOM
Fuck.
VALENTINE
What?
TOM
Avery's down.
TOM'S POV
A piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears.
TOM
Fires at it.
Didn't hit anything.
TOM
Fuck this.
Tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in
front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's
silhouette.
LIVING AREA
Tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back
porch.
A portion of the frame SPLINTERS from a gun shot as
he gains access to the other side of the back porch.
KITCHEN.
NIGHT.
Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter.
Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the
back porch.
VALENTINE
Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away
from Ed.
ADHARA
Where are you going?
LIVING ROOM
Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:
WILSON
Standing there.
Wet.
Mad.
He grabs Valentine by the shirt
and pushes him back into the room.
VALENTINE
Bounces off the couch and onto the floor.
WILSON
Comes toward him.
VALENTINE
Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.
It
careens off Wilson's arm and shatters.
WILSON
Is almost on him now.
VALENTINE
Tries to scramble away.
Throwing anything he can get his
hands on at.
WILSON
Who keeps coming.
He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then
throws him into the television.
VALENTINE
Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor.
WILSON
Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls
out his gun with the other.
He seems about to speak when
suddenly he screams instead.
WILSON
AAAAGGGGHHHH!
ADHARA
Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back.
WILSON
Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing
Adhara in the mouth.
ADHARA
Hits the ground.
She won't be retaliating.
WILSON
In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back,
but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH.
VALENTINE
Scrambles through the sliding glass door.
LIVING ROOM.
NIGHT.
Adhara wakes up.
Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.
But
it's not her hand.
It's Valentine's.
She sort of shuffles
away from him along the floor.
Sits against a wall holding
her face.
Valentine sits back against an opposite wall.
They stare at each other.
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson, lost in thought.
Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT
ATTENDANT.
We can see it pains him to reach for it.
WILSON
Ta.
After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the
shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily
dealt with.
FLASH CUTS:
WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing.
ELAINE. Cleaning his wound.
Wilson rubs his shoulder.
The AMERICAN LADY in the seat
beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight
Attendant.
LADY
You're English.
A small beat (which he takes each time he responds).
WILSON
Yeah, that's right.
LADY
I can never decide what I like better.
Leaving home, or coming back.
WILSON
Takes this in.
FLASH CUTS:
WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops.
WILSON. In the car leaving Valentine's house. Fingering the
picture of Jenny.
WILSON
I would have preferred staying home, me.
LADY
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Wilson nods.
FLASH CUTS:
WILSON. In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big
Sur. Everyone in their own world.
WILSON. At Ed's house. Saying goodbye.
WILSON AND ED. Shake hands.
ED. Watching him get into Elaine's car.
WILSON
Got called out to L.A., unexpected like,
to do a job of work.
FLASH CUTS:
WILSON. At the airport, staring at Elaine.
ELAINE. Staring back.
WILSON AND ELAINE. She embraces him.
ELAINE. She watches him leave.
WILSON. Disappearing into the terminal.
LADY
You'll be looking forward to getting
back, then.
WILSON
Yeah.
Another little matter needs
attending to soon as I return.
LADY
No rest for the wicked.
Wilson nods, exhales.
FLASH CUT:
WILSON. In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of
the film. Watching the lights go by.
WILSON
Been away a lot.
LADY
Where else?
Longer beat.
He actually turns to look at her now.
Takes
her in, then looks forward again.
WILSON
Out on a oil rig.
In the North Sea.
Nine years.
LADY
Nine years?
(laughs)
Is that legal?
WILSON
Well, time off for good behavior, you
know.
I shouldn't have even been there
-- it was these other blokes who shoulda
gone in my place.
I got lumbered with
the job they were responsible for.
I
don't mind pulling me own cart, but not
someone else's, know what I mean.
LADY
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that
time.
WILSON
I had to, didn't I.
Nothing else for it.
Then just when I'd finished my nine years
-- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger
off to the States.
LADY
(reacting slightly to his
"colorful" language)
Sounds like you need a rest.
WILSON
Could do, yeah.
Another beat.
WILSON
But first I gotta give these lads a
talking to, these geezers what sent me up
the river, in a manner of speaking.
LADY
The ones whose burden you took upon your
own shoulders.
WILSON
Yeah.
And he turns away, to the window.
Looks at the blue sky.
Sips his drink.
Then, hard:
WILSON
Them next.
CUT TO BLACK.
THE END.
