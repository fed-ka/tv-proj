PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets
of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob
struggling frantically with the toothbrush.
AUTUMN
Pricey BMW's, MERCEDES, etc. sport license plates which read:
FREUD JUNGNRICH HEADDOC PERCA' DAN' etc. Three pre-teens
ride by on bikes and shove the trunks of the cars. Car alarms
sound off like birds. We PAN WITH THE KIDS then PAST THEM
out to sea to see:
Four psychiatrists and three spouses are pleasure boating.
Here all is quiet except the wind and the sound of the birds
(or is it the car alarms?). Shrinks and their wives sit around
an intense doctor in his forties.
DOCTOR 1 (FEINBERG)
I've had the same nightmare three
nights running.
DOCTOR 2
Come on, David, we're on a vacation.
FEINBERG
I'm leaving my office for summer
vacation, when suddenly my patients
rush up looking insane.
MOTION
Dr. Feinberg exits the building with his suitcase. To his
horror an angry horde of men and women, looking like a
sadistic lynch mob, swarm him and attack.
FEINBERG (V.O.)
"Don't leave us!" they scream. Then
they beat me and bite me and kill
me...!
As Feinberg runs to get away he is dragged down then overrun
by his angry patients.
BACK TO THE BOATS
FEINBERG
It's the worst nightmare I've had
since residency. Night after night...
it's terrifying!
PHIL
At least your nightmare is only a
dream. What about what happened to
Leo Marvin?
A YOUNG DOCTOR
Who's Leo Marvin?
PHIL
You never heard of the famous Dr.
Marvin?
ANGLE ON A VACANT LOT ON SHORE
There is a dock, an overgrown slab, and a chimney.
PHIL (O.S.)
That used to be his vacation house.
FEINBERG (O.S.)
There's nothing there.
BACK TO THE BOAT
PHIL
Grab a strong drink and some
Dramamine. I'll tell you a story
that will send you into Rorschach.
ANOTHER WIFE
Who's Leo Marvin?
PHIL
Well, I really can't tell you about
Leo Marvin unless I first tell you
about Bob.
ANOTHER WIFE
Who's Bob?
The SOUND of BIRDS segues to car alarms. We're on the streets
of New York, CRANING and ZOOMING like a bird up and into a
sweltering apartment.
The shrinks are still listening to Doctor 3.
FEINBERG
Leo Marvin. Now I remember. An
incredible asshole.
DOCTOR 2
Had that stupid best seller, what
was the name of it?
FEINBERG
Watching grass grow was more exciting
than Leo Marvin.
PHIL
All that changed.
DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
Why?
PHIL (V.O.)
That's what I'm trying to tell you
lummoxes: Bob.
Sweat pouring off his brow, Bob stands in sunglasses in the
entrance-way to his apartment. A bus squeals up to the curb,
belches smoke, then moves on. A garbage can is kicked over.
Bob starts to take a step when suddenly he gets dizzy. He
steps back and hyperventilates. Bob puts on a dust mask,
steps bravely onto the sidewalk, and walks, eyes fixed
forward.
BOB
I feel good, I feel great, I feel
wonderful.
(repeats)
A man passes Bob, eyes fixed forward.
MAN
Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I'll
get you!
(repeats)
Bob walks through the city like a zombie, eyes fixed forward.
Marvin and family (who we recognize from the pictures in
Marvin's office) exit a cab with their luggage and head into
the terminal.
MARVIN
Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry.
Hurry hurry hurry.
They pass a HOMELESS MAN with a hand out. Marvin's wife FAY
stops and roots in her purse.
MARVIN
Honey there isn't time.
Fay gives the man some money then enters the terminal.
MARVIN
You're only encouraging them, Fay.
Still looking at the hot dogs, Bob shuffles out of the phone
booth. He tosses his crumpled list at a trash can and misses.
Even though there is litter on the street all around the
trash can, Bob (using a Kleenex) picks up his list and puts
it in the trash. He walks to the hot dog stand and watches.
He wants a hot dog.
VENDOR
Can I help you, bub?
BOB
Bob.
VENDOR
Would you like a hot dog, Bob?
BOB
I sure would...
The vendor buns a hot dog.
VENDOR
Mustard?
BOB
I sure would.
VENDOR
Sauerkraut.
BOB
I'd love it.
The vendor holds out the dog.
BOB
But I can't. I really want to but I
can't. It's bird intestine and beef
brain.
Bob looks at the dog with a mixture of desire and revulsion.
He pulls out an air sickness bag, holds it ready, then puts
it back. The vendor retracts the dog.
VENDOR
Hit the road, bub.
BOB
Bob.
Bob moves on.
Bob stands on the corner looking like a lost soul. He watches
as the world passes by. The light changes. Looking both ways
constantly, Bob crosses.
BOB
Baby step across the street. Baby
step across the street...
A "perfect little family" walks past him. A five year old
girl and a three year old boy skip by, hand in hand. They
wave at Bob. He waves back, sadly, then continues.
BOB
(affectless)
I feel good, I feel great, I feel
wonderful.
We recognize this as the same lake the doctors were sailing
in the opening scene: gorgeous greenery, the shore lined
with quaint but expensive summer homes. Where the doctors in
the boat saw an empty slab, stands the Marvin summer house,
a clapboard structure complete with a private dock, old wooden
motorized rowboat, and diving board.
Marvin is relaxing in a chair. Fay is in the background
putting out flowers. Marvin takes a deep breath, sighs
peacefully then picks up a book: Freud's Understanding Dreams
and opens it. The phone rings. Marvin frowns, then answers.
TRIPLE SCREEN WITH BESSIE AND BOB AND MARVIN
MARVIN
Yes?
BESSIE
Dr. Marvin, this is Bessie at your
exchange. I'm sorry to disturb you
but I have a Bob Wiley on the line
who says you'll want to talk to him.
MARVIN
You know better than this, Bessie.
Dr. Harmon is covering for me.
BESSIE
I told him that, Doctor, but he
insists on talking to you. He says
it's an emergency.
Marvin frowns then takes a deep breath.
MARVIN
Put him through.
BESSIE
Go ahead, Bob.
BACK TO DOUBLE SPLIT-SCREEN
Bob's frantic pacing contrasts with Marvin's calm.
MARVIN
Bob, I thought I made it clear to
you that I'm on vacation.
BOB
I know, but I'm a mess. Worse than
usual.
MARVIN
Bob, if this is an emergency, go to
the emergency room. If not, call Dr.
Harmon and I'm sure he can help you.
BOB
I'd feel better if I just knew where
you were. It's Martha's Vineyard
right?
MARVIN
Bob.
BOB
Couldn't we just talk?
MARVIN
In my office, after Labor Day.
BOB
Fire Island?
MARVIN
Good night, Bob.
Marvin hangs up. SINGLE SCREEN. Bob hangs up too. He stands
and thinks then dials again. SPLIT SCREEN WITH MID-MANHATTAN
EXCHANGE.
BOB
Hi, this is Bob. Leo and I got cut
off.
BESSIE
I'm sorry, Bob, but Dr. Marvin just
called and instructed me not to put
you through.
BOB
What?
Bob stands thinking.
Bob almost throws up then puts the air sickness bag away
again. He takes a deep breath, smiles to himself, then exits.
Marvin lies down in the hammock and picks up his book. Fay
enter.
FAY
Honey, let's go to the store.
The Greyhound bus stops. Bob gets out and runs into a field.
He apparently vomits, then runs back to the bus.
A GREYHOUND BUS pulls to the bus stop. Passengers hurry off,
anxiously glancing behind them. Finally Bob, covered in sweat,
exits. Holding his bag and fish, squinting to adjust to the
sun, he stands in a daze as the bus pulls away. After a long
pause, Bob calls out.
BOB
Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!
Bob waits. Passers-by turn and stare. There is no Leo Marvin
in sight.
BOB
Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!
The Marvin family exits carrying groceries. They stop at the
family station wagon and begin loading up.
BOB (O.S.)
Dr. Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin.
FAY
Leo, is somebody calling you?
MARVIN
I didn't hear anything.
BOB (O.S.)
Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin!
Everyone looks around.
FAY
Over there.
Marvin turns and sees Bob.
MARVIN
Oh my god... I don't believe it.
AT THE BUS STOP
Bob looks in all directions. Suddenly he sees Marvin.
BOB
Dr. Marvin. It's you!!
Bob walks toward the Marvins.
MARVIN
stands dumfounded. He watches Bob walking towards them. He
tries to stay calm.
MARVIN
Everybody get in the car.
FAY
Do you know that man, Leo?
BOB
Dr. Marvin! It's me, Bob!
MARVIN
(intense)
Get in the car.
Fay is surprised to see Leo so forceful. She hustles the
kids into the station wagon. Bob hurries up, out of breath.
In one hand he holds his bag. In the other he holds Gil in a
baggie. Marvin closes the station wagon door and stands
outside.
BOB
Hi! This is Gil. It must be fate
that I found you so quickly!
Bob stops and stands, a little out of breath.
BOB
Is this a bad time?
MARVIN
What are you doing here? I thought
you were..., dead.
BOB
Oh no, they told you? I fibbed a
little but... Don't be mad.
(spotting the family
in the car)
Oh...
A sweet beatific smile appears on Bob's face. He sighs.
BOB
The fam.
Marvin leads Bob away from the car, across the street.
Marvin stops and faces Bob.
MARVIN
I think you know, Bob, that your
behavior is entirely inappropriate.
We talked about trust. We talked
about my needs. I want you to get on
a bus and go back to New York.
BOB
You're angry.
MARVIN
I don't get angry.
BOB
You're upset.
MARVIN
I don't get upset.
BOB
Then can't we just talk?
MARVIN
I don't see patients on vacation,
Bob. Ever. How many ways can I make
that clear?
BOB
But you can't just send me away!
I've read your book, I've been doing
what you told me, but I've completely
relapsed! A little time would mean
so much. Please.
MARVIN
Bob, I'm driving away now and I don't
want you to bother me again. You
came for my advice, correct?
BOB
Absolutely.
MARVIN
Then take my advice and go back to
New York.
BOB
But I can't go anywhere! I'm all
locked up!
MARVIN
You got yourself here.
BOB
Barely!
MARVIN
Getting back will therapeutic.
Bob starts begging.
BOB
Please just talk to me. Just a little
talk.
MARVIN
You're testing my patience, Bob.
BOB
A teeny tiny talk. An itty bitty
talk...
ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CAR, WHAT THE FAMILY SEES
Bob is kneeling in front of Marvin.
BOB
Pretty please... Pretty please with
sugar...
The family exchanges quizzical looks.
BACK TO BOB AND MARVIN
Marvin looks around, incredibly embarrassed. He tugs at the
kneeling Bob.
MARVIN
(gritted teeth)
Get up. Come on, get up.
BOB
(standing)
Say you will. Please, say you will.
Marvin looks at his watch.
MARVIN
Bob, it's two o'clock. Go to the bus
station, buy a ticket home, then
wait in that restaurant.
He points to "GUTTMAN'S" coffee shop.
BOB
You'll meet me?!
MARVIN
I'll call you.
(looks at his watch)
In two hours.
BOB
Oh my god, you're the greatest!
Bob moves to hug Marvin and Marvin reluctantly lets him.
MARVIN
But you must buy your ticket and
give your word that you'll go home.
This is all about trust again, Bob.
We must have trust.
BOB
I trust. I absolutely trust. I'll go
buy my ticket. Right now!
MARVIN
I'll call you at four.
BOB
You couldn't possibly make it three
thirty, could you?
MARVIN
Bob...
BOB
Four it is. Four o'clock exactly.
Thank you, Dr. M.
Bob starts across the parking lot as Marvin gets in the car
and closes the door.
Marvin and Siggy march to the end of the Marvin dock. There
is a diving board. Siggy stands in a black terry robe and
flip flops.
MARVIN
Take off your robe. Everything you
wear is black. I wish you'd get off
this death fixation.
Siggy reluctantly takes off his black robe. Under it he wears
a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.
SIGGY
How do you know it's a death fixation?
Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost
childhood.
MARVIN
What do you mean by that?
SIGGY
What do you mean by asking?
MARVIN
Come on, get on the board and let's
see your approach.
SIGGY
(striking a pose)
My approach is to be suave and
debonair and sophisticated.
MARVIN
Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like
we learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.
Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together,
then takes a step with his right foot.
SIGGY
1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1,
2, 3 fall. Time to go dad.
MARVIN
Cut it out, Siggy. Left foot...
SIGGY
This is no fun.
Siggy sighs then starts again. He awkwardly takes two steps
then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water,
afraid to dive.
MARVIN
Why didn't you dive?
SIGGY
With all the horror that's going on
in the world, what difference does
it make?
Marvin opens the door for Bob.
MARVIN
If you have any questions, call Dr.
Harmon.
BOB
Have a great vacation!
MARVIN
You too.
BOB
A vacation from my problems. You bet
I will!
Bob exits. Marvin closes the door and looks up at the ceiling.
He takes a deep breath then turns back into the room. There
is a knock at the door.
MARVIN
(AT THE DOOR)
Yes?
BOB
(FROM WITHOUT)
It's Bob. I forgot Gil.
Marvin opens the door.
BOB
My fish.
MARVIN
Oh. Right.
Bob strides into the kitchen and takes his fish. Sigmund,
now in his clothes, enters from upstairs.
BOB
You must be Sigmund.
MARVIN
Siggy, this is Bob. He's just leaving.
SIGGY
Hi.
BOB
Hi. This is Gil. My fish.
SIGGY
Cool. Did you get him out of the
lake?
BOB
No. He's a city fish.
SIGGY
Cool.
BOB
Your father is the most incredible
psychiatrist in the world! You better
appreciate him.
He strides to the door then turns wistfully.
BOB
Have a great vacation, fam.
MARVIN
You too, Bob.
SIGGY
Nice to meet you.
Bob walks down the country lane. Crickets chirp.
BOB
Vacation from my problems. Take a
vacation from my problems. A baby
stepping, lazy stepping vacation
from my problems.
Bob falls into a rhythm, almost a little jig as he walks.
LONG DISSOLVE TO:
Roosters crow in the new day.
Bob walks down the empty country lane. Crickets chirp.
BOB
Vacation from my problems. Take a
vacation from my problems. There's
nothing to fear, there's nobody here.
Nothing to fear
(he suddenly panics)
THERE'S NOBODY HERE!
He starts running and screaming.
TWO MEN from a van are bringing in the art from Marvin's
office. Marvin is using a weed trimmer to spruce up the shrubs
to within an inch or their lives. Anna, in a bathing suit,
sunglasses, and skimpy cover-up exits the house, gives her
father a good-bye peck on the cheek then gets in the family
station wagon.
MARVIN
Where are you off to?
ANNA
Sailing.
MARVIN
With Teddy Fein?
ANNA
No. George Stark. The boy from the
plane.
MARVIN
It's a quarter mile to the marina.
Why do you need the car?
ANNA
I'm picking everybody up.
She starts the car and backs out.
MARVIN
Stay out of the sun! Remember what's
happening to the ozone layer.
Bob is running in a panic. Anna drives by and sees him.
ANNA
Bob!
Anna hits the brakes and slows next to Bob. He breaks to a
slow trot.
ANNA
Hi! Where you going?
BOB
Just to... town.
(pause)
Buy some..., Kleenex.
ANNA
Want a ride?
BOB
I don't think your dad would like
you picking me up.
ANNA
He wouldn't like a lot of things.
Hop in.
Bob hesitates then gets in.
Standing next to the mast, his hair blowing in the wind.
BOB
You're right, this is great! I never
actually thought I could do this. I
never thought this could be me!
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
That Bob, wearing life preservers on his body and legs, is
wrapped onto the mast from chest to toe with ropes. Anna,
George Stark (from the airport) and a few other kids sit
around enjoying the sail.
Marvin stands at the end of the diving board, holding Siggy
by his ankles out over the water. On the shore next door,
the Guttmans sit in lounge chairs, fishing.
SIGGY
This is child abuse! If you drop me,
I'll prosecute!
MARVIN
I am not going to let go until you're
ready, okay? Trust me and put your
hands out like I showed you.
SIGGY
I'm not ready! Do you hear? I'm not
ready!!
George's sailboat heels by. From it wave Anna and some of
her friends -- and Bob.
BOB
(shouting and waving)
Hey Doctor M, look at me! I'm sailing!
Stunned, Marvin drops Siggy into the water. Siggy does a
belly flop then comes up for air, furious.
SIGGY
Murderer! Child molester...
MARVIN
Siggy, it was an accident!
THE GUTTMANS
Hitler!
Marvin walks along the shore towards the pier in time to see
Anna and a wobbly Bob disembark George's sailboat.
MARVIN
Anna!
Anna sees her father. She says good-bye to George and her
friends then walks towards her father. Bob starts towards
Marvin too.
BOB
Did you see me out there?! I'm getting
better all the time.
MARVIN
I want to see Anna alone.
Bob stops. Marvin waits while Anna walks to him.
MARVIN
I thought I told you to stay away
from Bob Wiley.
ANNA
No. You just said I couldn't let him
in the house.
Marvin starts walking away from the sailboating party towards
the town green. He puts his arm around Anna so that she has
to walk with him.
ANNA
Daddy, where are we going?
MARVIN
Home.
ANNA
What about the car? I left it at the
pier.
MARVIN
Leave it. It's been a while since
I've had a walk with my daughter.
Anna looks back at her friends and Bob. She shrugs then turns
back to her father. From his pockets Marvin removes the Leo
and Anna puppets and hands her "Anna".
ANNA
Daddy, not here!
MARVIN PUPPET
Anna, I know you think you're old
enough to know what's best for you
and I know you're at the age where
you don't want to listen to your
father. But as your father, who's
always loved you, I'm asking you not
to see Bob Wiley.
Anna grabs the Anna puppet and puts it on, defiantly.
ANNA PUPPET
I don't understand the problem! Bob's
a nice guy!
MARVIN PUPPET
Bob Wiley is a patient. He followed
me here from New York which is
bizarre. But even if it weren't
bizarre, my daughter seeing a patient
that I'm treating is entirely
inappropriate.
ANNA PUPPET
Bob said you're not treating him
here.
MARVIN PUPPET
He's right there!
ANNA PUPPET
So if you're not treating him while
he's here, then he's not a patient
while he's here, is he? And I have
the right to see him!
She throws the puppet at Marvin then runs to her friends.
MARVIN PUPPET
Anna, you're acting out!
ANNA
Bob's a perfectly nice guy! He's
intense and sensitive and he listens
which is more than I can say about
you. Bob!
Marvin stands a moment and watches. He is stunned.
MARVIN PUPPET
Anna, come back!
Anna runs to Bob and takes his arm. They start walking down
the shore. Marvin is dumbstruck.
Siggy lies on the deck, looking up at the sky through
binoculars. Fay is in the kitchen, arranging driftwood. She
comes to the back door of the cottage.
FAY
Why don't you come in and talk about
it?
Siggy says nothing.
FAY
Just because your father dropped you
in the water doesn't mean you can't
trust me.
SIGGY
You sleep with him. You're his spy.
Siggy lies back down and peers through the binoculars. As he
does, a grotesque CLOSE UP OF BOB pops into Siggy's field of
view. He sits up with a start. Bob and Anna are standing
over him.
BOB
Hey, Siggy.
SIGGY
Oh. Hi, Bob. You scared me.
BOB
Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on
you.
Siggy lies back down and looks through the binoculars, clearly
not interested in being social. Bob looks at Anna. She shakes
her head.
ANNA
Dad's at it again. I can tell.
(to Siggy)
Another vacation that's not a
vacation, right?
SIGGY
What's with him and diving? Maria
Shriver's not gonna watch me dive!
Siggy is standing on the diving board, ready for his approach.
Bob and Anna watch from the pier. Next door the Guttmans sit
watching.
BOB
Face a fear and it goes away.
SIGGY
Okay. I'm facing it, now what do I
do?
BOB
Hit it. Fast. While it isn't looking.
Siggy takes a deep breath, summons up his courage, and makes
his approach. He springs but can't dive.
SIGGY
My mind says "yes yes" but my body
says "no no". It's hopeless.
BOB
If I'm not hopeless, nothing's
hopeless...
Bob steps onto the board. He "baby steps" out to the end
where Siggy is standing.
BOB
Let's try something I saw in a pirate
movie.
Bob is standing near the end of the diving board holding
Siggy by the hips. Siggy is hanging over the water, hands
and head down, ready to enter the water diving. Anna is
watching. So are the Guttmans.
BOB
Don't think about boiling oil!
SIGGY
I'm not.
BOB
Or searing acid!
SIGGY
I'm not!
BOB
Our Father, we commit this soul to
the sea.
Bob gently releases Siggy. Siggy falls into the water, diving.
Anna applauds. So do the Guttmans. Siggy resurfaces and throws
a jubilant fist in the air.
SIGGY
Yeah!
Bob releases Siggy for another perfect dive.
BACK TO MARVIN
MARVIN
I'll put a stop to this!
Marvin storms out of the bedroom.
FAY
Leo!
Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now,
getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but
this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges
down the dock, Fay right behind him.
MARVIN
Enough. Let go of him! That's enough!
FAY
Leo!
BOB
Dr. M., watch this!
SIGGY
(leaning over to dive)
Watch, dad!
MARVIN
Stop diving this instant!
ANNA
Dad!
Marvin leaps onto the diving board, shaking it. Bob loses
his grip and Siggy falls off the board, doing a back buster.
Bob falls in too.
SIGGY
Ow!
(daggers at Marvin)
You bastard!
FAY
Leo! Look at what you're doing! Leo,
look at yourself!
Everybody looks at Marvin, standing alone on the board. He
realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does.
He looks at the Guttmans.
MARVIN
What are you staring at? I had every
right to buy this house!
ANNA
(looking in the water)
Where's Bob? Where's Bob?!
Anna and Fay dive into the water. They go under looking for
Bob.
Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay,
Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the
house and talks in low tones to his family.
MARVIN
Listen, everybody, I'm not wrong
often, but when I am, I admit it.
I'm sorry. I mean it. How can I make
it up?
There is a pause. Anna and Siggy and Fay look at each other.
SIGGY
Knocking Bob in the water was awful.
What if he hadn't known how to swim?
MARVIN
But he did. I'm not saying I was
right, but Bob can do a lot of things
no one thought he could do.
Anna, Fay and Siggy are silent.
MARVIN
Look, I said I was wrong now I'd
like to forget it. I'd like you all
to accept my apology.
ANNA
What about Bob?
MARVIN
What about Bob?!
ANNA
Don't you think you should apologize
to him?
ANGLE ON BOB
at the outdoor shower, rinsing off his clothes. He can't
hear the family but he can see they're talking about him and
he's giving them his best hang-dog looks.
MARVIN
I will not apologize to Bob.
ANNA
Why not?
MARVIN
Because I won't.
FAY
Honey, why are you so hostile towards
the poor man?
MARVIN
Because he's a patient, Fay! Don't
you get it?
SIGGY
He's not a patient, he's a person.
ANNA
And a nice one.
FAY
I think we should invite him for
dinner.
MARVIN
Dinner?!
FAY
Dinner.
ANNA
Really?!
FAY
The poor fellow's devastated.
Fay heads towards Bob. Marvin turns to her. He keeps his
voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is
about to explode.
MARVIN
I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.
FAY
Leo...
MARVIN
I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay. I
want to think about my interview.
Leo is trying not to explode. Fay hangs in the balance.
ANNA
Do it, mom. Invite him. You'd be
making family history. It'd be the
first major thing you've done on
your own since I've known you!
FAY
Right is right, Leo Marvin.
Fay heads to Bob. Marvin's mouth falls open.
SIGMUND
Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. For the
next few seconds we will be conducting
a test of the emergency broadcast
system:
MARVIN SIGGY
Fay talks to Bob. Anna heads over to him too. Marvin stands
speechless, ready to commit hari-kari.
Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the
moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along
the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin
family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking
the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob,
swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.
BOB
Get away. Get away!
SIGGY
Ring around the moon. Rain coming
soon.
BOB
(edgy to Siggy)
Gee, is that true?
MARVIN
It's superstitious nonsense.
Anna and Fay exit the cottage carrying trays of food.
BOB
(to Fay and Anna)
That looks scrumptious.
Anna smiles and hands the first plate of food to Bob. Marvin
sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at
Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this
exchange of looks.
BOB
Did I do something?
FAY
No, Bob. It's fine. Eat up. Leo.
Fay looks at Marvin and shakes her head "no".
BOB
(eating)
Mmmm. Mmmmm. This sure is good. Mmmm.
Mmmmm. Mmmmm.
MARVIN
Would you please stop that?
BOB
Oh. Sorry, Leo. Would you pass the
salt?
MARVIN
And don't call me Leo.
BOB
I'm sorry. You said in your office
that I could call you Leo.
MARVIN
That was in my office. In my home
you will call me Dr. Marvin.
Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly
at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.
FAY
(low)
He's nervous about the interview
tomorrow. Don't take it personally.
BOB
(to Marvin)
Hey, that's right, I heard about
your upcoming debut. Congratulations.
Marvin nods and eats. Bob throws salt over his shoulder then
salts his food.
BOB
Your book's going to do a lot of
people a lot of good, Le-- Dr. Marvin.
I'm walking proof of that.
Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad
on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.
SIGGY
Dad?
FAY
Sweetheart?
Marvin turns red and points to his throat. He falls to the
deck on his side. Bob stands.
BOB
Don't panic! I know what to do!
Bob hurries to Marvin, lies beside him, and administers the
Heimlick maneuver. On the second try, Marvin's throat clears.
Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.
SIGGY
Dad, you okay?
ANNA
Daddy?!
FAY
Honey?!
Marvin says something. Fay leans over him to hear.
FAY
Leo, are you okay?
MARVIN
I said..., get him off me!
Bob lets go of Marvin. Marvin coughs and crawls away.
SIGGY
Bob, you saved him!
ANNA
Incredible! Wonderful!
FAY
Thank you!
Fay helps Marvin gets to his feet. Suddenly, there is a flash
of lightning. Bob jumps. Rain begins to fall. Marvin looks
up.
SIGGY
Told you so.
A clearing storm, right after dawn. Three vans from "CBS
Morning" wind along the lake towards town.
Through the window we see Siggy and Bob sound asleep in their
beds. DOLLY ACROSS the clapboards to Leo and Fay's room where
Fay lies sound asleep and Marvin lies looking at his watch.
It lets out a series of beeps and he stands and exits. DOLLY
back to Siggy's room where Marvin knocks, loudly.
MARVIN
Six o'clock, rise and shine!
Siggy sits up. Bob doesn't stir. Marvin enters, watch beeping,
and walks to Bob. He puts the watch next to Bob's ear.
MARVIN
Rise and shine. Six o'clock. Rise
and shine, rise and shine.
Bob doesn't move. Fay and Anna enter in robes.
MARVIN
Bob... Bob!
He shakes Bob's bed.
MARVIN
BOB!
Bob sleeps through incredible shaking and yelling from a
desperate Marvin then suddenly sits up with a start.
BOB
AHHHH!
Everybody leaps back.
MARIA SHRIVER and her entourage - PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, video
crew, etc. -- approach the door.
MARIA SHRIVER
Dr. Marvin, Maria Shriver.
MARVIN
(swallows nervously)
Hello.
MARIA
I hope we're not too early. May we
come in?
Marvin steps aside. The crew enters with equipment.
MARVIN
Sure. I thought by the fireplace...
CREW MEMBER
It's a fireplace shot, fellows.
The CBS vans are loading up. Maria, Lenny and Howie stand at
the door saying good-by. Marvin hovers in the background, in
shock.
MARIA
Bob, that stuff about yourself was
refreshingly honest. Could we talk
to you again in a few months to update
your progress?
BOB
Sure. As long as my doctor gives
permission.
Marvin tries to force a smile but can't. A CBS staff
photographer comes over, places Bob and Maria in his frame
and snaps a picture. The CBS people head off.
MARIA
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs.
Marvin.
FAY
Anytime!
Maria and CBS leave.
The doctors and their wives sit rapt, listening to Doctor 3.
WIFE
Yeah, what about Bob?
ANOTHER DOCTOR
What about Bob?
Bob walks down the road, upset, talking to himself.
BOB
The fam is hurt. I've hurt them. I
didn't mean to. Certainly they realize
that. I've hurt the fam. Hurt the
fam. I've hurt the fam.
The Marvin station wagon, Marvin driving, passes. Bob sees
Fay, Siggy, and Anna turn and wave.
BOB
Hi fam!
(pause)
Bye fam!
The car speeds on.
BOB
I hurt the fam.
Marvin's family climbs aboard a small sailboat. Marvin pulls
a line onto the deck, then the boat glides out into the lake.
Bob wanders, looking lost, mumbling.
BOB
I could apologize. But then I'd have
to go back and I'm not sure they
want me. I hurt the fam. That much I
know. Hurt the fam.
VENDOR (O.S.)
Hot dog, bub?
Bob looks idly up. A VENDOR with a cart is talking to Bob.
BOB
(distracted)
Sure.
The VENDOR hands Bob a hot dog. Bob hands him money then
wanders off.
NEW ANGLE, A BUSY GREEN BESIDE THE PIER, DAY
Families of tourists stroll. Bob stands staring dejectedly
out at the lake. Unthinkingly, he takes a bite of the hot
dog then turns.
BOB
This has to be some kind of test. I
know I hurt them but they have to
know I didn't mean it. If it's a
test... I ate a hot dog.
Bob stares at the hot dog like it just spoke Greek.
BOB
I ATE A HOT DOG!
The tourists turn and stare.
Marvin stands at the helm, sailing the small sailboat across
lake. The breeze blows Marvin's hair, making him look wild.
Anna suns. Siggy casts a fishing line. Fay stares into
nowhere.
MARVIN
I mean it's summer time right, what
could their audience be, five million?
Most of them hardly pay attention
anyway, right? The point is, the
book got on. It couldn't hurt sales,
that much could it?
FAY
Of course not.
MARVIN
I mean... It's a disaster, Fay!
FAY
Honey...
ANNA
Hey, look. Isn't that Bob?
Off the bow, a small motorboat is approaching.
ANGLE ON THE MOTORBOAT, SAME
Bob is steering a small motorboat towards the sailboat. He
holds half of his hot dog out like a trophy.
BOB
Dr. M! Dr. M., I've had a
breakthrough! I ate a hot dog! I'm
driving a boat! Thanks to you!
ANGLE IN THE SAILBOAT
ANNA
It is Bob! It's Bob!
MARVIN
Oh no.
SIGGY
Hey, Bob!
Anna and Siggy wave. Marvin's eyes narrow. Bob keeps shouting
as he motors closer.
BOB
I'm really making progress now! I
feel like a whole new world is opening
up!
He keeps getting closer.
BOB
My childhood memories are rushing
over me like a flood!
Marvin turns the rudder and comes about.
MARVIN
Coming about!
He turns the sailboat and heads the opposite direction from
Bob.
ANNA
Daddy, what are you doing?
MARVIN
(at Bob's boat)
Go away!
BOB
What?
ANNA
Daddy, he's trying to talk to you.
SIGGY
Dad...
Marvin keeps sailing away. But Bob's boat is faster and it's
gaining. Marvin sees this, jerks the rudder again, and turns
ninety degrees. He stands and shouts at Bob.
MARVIN
Go away, do you hear me!!
FAY
Leo, the boom!
The boom hits Marvin square in the chest, and knocks him
overboard.
ANNA, FAY, SIGGY
Daddy! Leo! Dad!
Marvin bobs in the water. The pilotless sailboat heels away.
Bob dives in, swims to Marvin, and grabs him by the chin in
a traditional life-saver hold. As Siggy gains control of the
sailboat, Bob begins doing the side stroke towards the distant
shore with Marvin in tow.
BOB
I never had a father, really. Dad
left one morning and never came back.
My earliest memory is mom with a
suitcase. Do you think that's
significant?
Marvin is a prisoner in tow. He drags himself under water.
Bob pulls him up and keeps swimming.
BOB
I'd like to do some free association
about my infancy: A beachball. A
dog. A frog. A log. Poodle, noodle,
doodle...
As Bob swims Marvin towards the shore, going on and on with
this inane free association...
DISSOLVE TO:
Marvin, dry and dressed now, exits the house and gets in the
station wagon. He honks. Momentarily Bob runs out.
BOB
(at the house)
Will do!
Bob gets in the car. Affectless, Marvin stares at him.
BOB
Wherever we're going, Fay wants us
home by seven.
MARVIN
No problem.
Marvin accelerates away, rudely.
Rain is falling. The wipers swish. Marvin drives through
pastoral New Hampshire countryside focused, perhaps too
intently, on the road. Bob sits beside him.
BOB
It's a combustible relationship,
isn't it? Is it just you and me or
is it you and everybody?
(pause)
So what's the big surprise?
MARVIN
Intensive psychotherapy.
BOB
Really?!
MARVIN
Isn't that what you came here for?
BOB
Yeah! But what brought this on now?
MARVIN
You're ready.
BOB
Wow. This is exciting.
The rain has let up. Marvin pulls up to a gated estate
sporting expansive grounds and a hotel sized main building.
Marvin stops at a guard gate.
MARVIN
Leo Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky.
The GATE GUARD checks a list. He waves Marvin through. GATE
GUARD Main building doctor. They're expecting you.
BOB
Where are we?
MARVIN
Therapy land, Bob. A twentieth century
theme park of the mind.
They drive.
MARVIN
The lines look short today.
Marvin gets out and so does Bob. A man Leo's age, DR. TOMSKY,
approaches.
DR. TOMSKY
Hello, Leo. Long time no see! Is
this our friend?
MARVIN
Bob Wiley, this is your new pal, Dr.
Tomsky.
BOB
New pal? What's wrong with my old
pal?
Tomsky makes a motion of his head. Two big attendants move
to either side of Bob.
BIG ATTENDANT 1
Let us show you to your room.
They lead Bob off.
BOB
Hey! Don't touch me! I have seizures!
Dr. M! Dr. M!!
They take Bob into a building. Marvin turns to Tomsky.
MARVIN
I really appreciate your helping me
out on this, Kenneth.
Tomsky holds out a form for Marvin to sign. He does.
TOMSKY
I can only hold him for twenty four
hours, Leo. Without staff
corroboration.
MARVIN
I'm not worried in the least, Kenneth.
I'm sure your entire staff will
corroborate. With intensive treatment
he should be out in about -- fifty
years.
Marvin hands the clipboard back to Tomsky. They shake.
The Marvin station wagon pulls into the driveway, radio is
blasting, playing a tape of Neil Diamond. Marvin exits it,
dancing as he sings along.
MARVIN AND TAPE
"I'll be what I am, solitary man.
SOLITARY MAN!"
Marvin's car screeches up. Marvin hurries out.
Marvin drives. Bob rides. Marvin looks ready to explode.
BOB
Intensive psychotherapy? -- boy, you
weren't kidding, were you? I mean
even Dr. T. didn't think I needed
that.
(pause)
Look I have an idea -- how are your
afternoons? I mean since we're here
together with nothing else to do,
what say we work from two to four,
something like that?
The Marvinmobile screeches to a halt and Marvin jumps out.
He rushes around the car and opens Bob's door.
MARVIN
Get out! Get out of my car, get out
of my life, don't ever come back!
Marvin drags Bob out of the car and slams the door.
BOB
Are you saying you'd prefer mornings?
Marvin gets back in and floors it. He speeds off.
BOB
What is this, isolation therapy?
Bob stands alone on the road.
BOB
You're the doctor.
Birds chirp and crickets crick. A pick-up truck passes and
Bob sticks out his thumb. The pick-up stops.
The motorcycle cop is writing a steaming Leo Marvin a ticket.
A passing pick-up slows and Bob leans out the passenger
window.
BOB
Need any help?
MARVIN
No!
BOB
Remember: be home by seven.
The pick-up drives on. The motorcycle cop hands Marvin a
ticket. Marvin gets back into his car, throws it in gear,
and the car jerks backwards into the guardrail.
MARVIN
Shit!
Marvin throws it into forward. The car, fender dented, tears
away.
Sitting on the porch of his house, an OLD MAN watches as
Marvin's car slows to a stop out in the road. The tire under
the dented fender is torn to ribbons by the metal and the
car is now riding on the rim. Marvin stops, gets out of the
car, and looks at the tire.
MARVIN
First he ruins my life, now he ruins
my tire!
Cursing to himself, Marvin walks to the trunk and removes a
jack.
MARVIN
God! Damn! Son of a bitching! Bob!
A WOMAN comes out of the house and joins the old man. They
watch in silence as Marvin jacks up his car. As he twists
and grimaces and kicks to get off the lug nuts, it starts to
RAIN.
MARVIN
Shit piss crap! Son of a bitching
douche bag asshole!
THREE MORE PEOPLE come out on the porch and watch. As Marvin
struggles, the car slips off the jack and slams to the
pavement. Marvin begins kicking the tire and hitting it with
the jack.
MARVIN
What about Bob?! Think about Bob!
What about Bob? What about Bob? WHAT
ABOUT BOB!!
Mumbling to himself, soaking wet, and filthy with tire grime,
Marvin walks to his house. He kicks open the front door.
MARVIN
I'm home!
Marvin, carrying his shoes, crawls outside. He tries to put
his shoes on and falls flat on his face. He then pulls himself
up and hobbles away.
This is where the Marvin family was shopping when Bob first
came to town. Marvin paces outside until the owner opens the
front door for business.
Marvin, carrying a bag and singing to himself, walks up to
the cottage. He looks around then kicks open the door.
Marvin lays the fuse wire across room and out the door. He
closes the door and starts to set the timer when he spots a
note hanging on the nearby mailbox:
MARVIN
(reading aloud)
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. G., If I'm not
here, I'm at the Marvins. Would you
feed Gil? Thanks. Bob. P.S. Your
denture adhesives arrived so I put
them in your mailbox. Enjoy. Bob. "
Marvin seethes. He thinks a moment then heads back into the
cottage. Momentarily he returns carrying the back pack and
the long wire fuse.
Marvin, carrying the back pack, leads Bob outside. Bob looks
relaxed.
BOB
Where we going hiking?
MARVIN
Into the woods.
BOB
Is this is a new form of therapy?
MARVIN
Yeah, Bob, it's death therapy. It's
a guaranteed cure.
BOB
Death therapy. I like it.
Marvin leads Bob into the woods beside the cottage.
Bob sits on a stump. Marvin puts the back pack on Bob's
shoulders then starts tying his hands behind him. Bob sits
passively, letting him.
BOB
This is pretty imaginative, Dr. M.
Will this be in your new book?
MARVIN
If it is, I'll dedicate it to you,
how's that?
BOB
Great. Ow. That hurts. Ow.
Marvin keeps tying Bob's hands.
BOB
What is this now, pain therapy?
MARVIN
Exactly. Now yell and scream and
suffer!
BOB
Ow! Ahh! Ow! That really hurts.
Marvin sets the timer then walks away.
MARVIN
Say hello to Freud for me.
Marvin walks out of the woods.
BOB
Dr. M, this hurts!
MARVIN (O.S.)
Love hurts.
Bob sits trying to get comfortable.
BOB
I'm worried about getting gangrene,
Dr. M! I think I get the point!
He struggles some more.
BOB
(to himself)
At least I think I get the point.
(pause)
Maybe I'm not supposed to sit here.
(pause)
Maybe I'm supposed to undo these
outer knots...
He begins struggling to untie himself.
BOB
So that my inner knots..., these
strong..., restricting..., inner
knots...
He gets a hand free.
BOB
Will come undone too.
Both hands free, Bob stands.
BOB
Yes!
Marvin runs out to the dock and tries to start the little
motor boat that sits there. Bob stops at the back door of
the house, casually tosses the back pack onto a chair, then
follows Marvin.
BOB
Dr. M.?
Bob walks out onto the dock. Marvin is working frantically
to start the motorboat.
BOB
Dr. M., I'm really cured!
The house explodes. Debris rains down on Bob and Marvin.
After it settles, the bust of Freud lands on the dock in
front of them.
BOB
Did somebody leave the gas on?
MARVIN
Why won't you go away! I disgraced
myself on national television! No
one will buy my book! My family's
going to hate me!
BOB
Dr. M., your family loves you.
MARVIN
I'M FINISHED!
Marvin is about to attack Bob then stands limp, a beaten
man. What's left of the house is now burning. The Guttmans
have run out of their trailer.
THE GUTTMANS
Burn. Burn! Burn!!
In the distance, SIRENS APPROACH.
BOB
Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of
England all around you. You have a
wife with a generous heart. You have
great kids and an incredible sister.
MARVIN
Stay away from my sister!
BOB
Dr. M, you have a fam!
Marvin stares at Bob then takes a small can of gas from the
old motorboat and pours gas on himself. The SIRENS get closer.
BOB
You know, I'm beginning to think
you're an ingrate.
MARVIN
What?!
BOB
People are miserable all over the
world and you're killing yourself?
You should be ashamed.
MARVIN
Don't talk that way to me!
BOB
Maybe I was wrong about you.
MARVIN
Do you hear me?!
BOB
Maybe you're not so good after all.
Marvin leaps on Bob.
MARVIN
I'll kill you!
Marvin attacks Bob on the dock. Fire trucks arrive. Fay and
the family drive up too. As a couple of FIREMEN and the family
rush to separate Marvin and Bob...
LONG DISSOLVE TO:
The doctors and their wives sit around Phil, stunned. Off
their bow is the slab that was once the Marvin house.
PHIL
And they took him away.
DOCTOR 1
My god, it was insanity. Bob drove
Marvin to complete insanity!
WIFE
What happened?
PHIL
Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute
for a few days for observation. He
lost his medical license, of course.
A doctor can't try to kill one of
his patients and expect to get away
with it.
WIFE
Well thank god for that.
(the other doctors
stare daggers at her)
I mean..., you know... I mean...
(pause)
Then what happened?
PHIL
Leo was returned to his family.
Leo stands, small suitcase in hand, looking sad and fragile.
Fay, Anna, Siggy, Lily and Bob get out of the station wagon
and look at him. No one says a word, then Bob goes up and
puts his arms around Leo. Leo stands motionless, shell
shocked.
PHIL (O.S.)
Bob and the family rented a lakeside
cottage where they could help Leo
recuperate.
Gil's bowl sits on a lawn table. In addition to Gil, the
bowl now contains several baby guppies. Marvin lies on a
deck chair, covered with a blanket, staring into nowhere.
Bob is next to him, talking on a cordless phone.
BOB
(into phone)
I understand. Sure.
He hangs up and puts the phone down.
BOB
(to Leo)
Tough business.
Bob makes some notes in his organizer then gets up. He grabs
hold of both of Leo's shoulders.
BOB
(reassuringly)
I'm going over here. I'll be right
over here.
Leo doesn't look at him. A zombie would seem more alive. Bob
goes and joins the volleyball game.
BOB (O.S.)
Okay, I'm with Siggy.
Marvin sits staring into nowhere. The phone rings. Again.
MARVIN
(almost inaudible)
Phone.
The volleyball game continues.
MARVIN
(a touch louder)
Phone.
After another ring, he reaches for it.
MARVIN
(INTO PHONE)
(listlessly affectless)
Hello.
VOICE ON PHONE
May I speak to Bob, please?
MARVIN
(still staring into
nowhere)
Bob's... unavailable right now. Can...
I take a message?
VOICE ON PHONE
I'm Mr. Jameson with the Tucson school
district. Bob contacted us about
buying some toothbrushes but we're
going to have to cancel the order.
MARVIN
(writing)
Tucson canceling order... Any message
why?
JAMESON
(on phone)
It's not a priority right now.
MARVIN
(writing)
Not priority... right now.
(pause)
Why?
JAMESON
(ON PHONE)
Well... money's tight and...
MARVIN
Sure.
(pause)
Though, you know there is another
way to look at it.
JAMESON
(ON PHONE)
What's that?
MARVIN
Well... if you gave a new toothbrush
and taught dental hygiene to every
student at your school... In the
long run you'd save them thousands
of dollars. I mean look at the cost
of dental bills. I bet I could have
put my kids through college with
what I've spent on fillings.
JAMESON
That's an interesting point.
MARVIN
It is, isn't it?
(pause)
Maybe you should try the toothbrushes.
You might do a lot for education by
saving teeth.
JAMESON
Huh. I never thought of that.
(pause)
I tell you what. Tell Bob we'll take
the order and see how it goes.
MARVIN
Great.
Marvin hangs up the phone. He affectless expression suddenly
turns to one full of thought.
MARVIN
Fay.
Marvin sits up, gaining energy, even enthusiasm.
MARVIN
Fay!
The Marvin family hurries over.
PHIL (V.O.)
Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.
Bob puts his arm around Leo as he gestures and talks more
and more animatedly to his delighted family.
PHIL (V.O.)
The irony, of course, is that Bob
brought the family closer than they'd
ever been before. Harvey Green saw
Leo last month and said he never
looked happier.
The doctors are stunned.
FEINBERG
My god. The poor bastard.
ANOTHER DOCTOR
And you thought you had nightmares.
FEINBERG
Unbelievable...
WIFE
What happened to Bob?
The others jump in: "Yeah, what about Bob? What about Bob?
What about Bob?"
PHIL
Bob married Lily and had triplets.
He went back to school, got a degree
in marriage-family-counseling, and
now has a big practice on Park and
75th.
The doctors look at each other in astonishment.
DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
Wait a minute. You're not telling me
that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley,
the psychologist?!
PHIL
That's exactly what I'm telling you.
A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.
PHIL
Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!
ANGLE ON THE BIG HOUSEBOAT
Bob is surrounded by Lily Marvin, three toddlers and lots of
friends. Smiling, Bob waves at the doctors.
FEINBERG (V.O.)
Wrote that huge best seller? What's
it called?
Bob's boat turns. On it's stern, in huge letters is it's
name: "Vacation Therapy".
FEINBERG (V.O.)
Vacation Therapy!
PHIL (V.O.)
Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.
ANGLE ON THE DOCTORS BOAT
who are dark green with envy.
DOCTOR 2
I don't believe it!
DOCTOR 1
Pinch me!
FEINBERG
I'll never take another vacation as
long as I live!
ANGLE ON BOB'S HOUSEBOAT
As the other doctors second in agreement, WE SEE Bob's hugely
happy houseboat motors off. We see Bob's big smile as he
passes out Kleenex to his family then waves good-bye to the
doctors.
ROLL END CREDITS.
