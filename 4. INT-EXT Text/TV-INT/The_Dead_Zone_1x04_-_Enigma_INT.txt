          Johnny and CHANDRA are at a table in one of the town's
          "nice" restaurants.  This is a first date and the awkward
          silences are frequent.  They have just finished ordering
          and the WAITER takes the menus.

                                        WAITER
                                (to Chandra)
                        Thank you.
                                (nods to Johnny)
                        Mister Smith.

          The waiter leaves.  Chandra is surprised -- but also
          relieved to have a conversational opening.

                                        CHANDRA
                        They know you here?  But Sarah
                        said you don't go out... much, I
                        mean.

          The awkward silence descends once more.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        What else did Sarah say about me?

                                        CHANDRA
                                (lying; lightly)
                          Nothing.

          The Waiter returns with two small glasses of wine.

                                        WAITER
                          Aperitif... Compliments of the
                        Gentleman.

          He indicates a man dining with two other people at a
          distant table, and discreetly leaves a business card on
          the table.  The man across the restaurant gives a "cheers"
          sign to Johnny with his own glass.  Johnny responds with
          a somewhat forced smile. 

          More silence.  Chandra indicates the business card.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Well?

          Johnny hesitates.  Chandra picks up the card.

                                        CHANDRA
                                (reading)
                        "I am an admirer of your talent,
                        and have a business proposition
                        that may interest you.  Please
                        call at your earliest convenience."

          She tosses the card down in front of him.  Johnny picks
          it up -- and is suddenly in a vision.



          Johnny, in bathrobe, is checking messages on his answering
          machine.

                                        BUSINESSMAN'S VOICE
                        This is Harold MacVane, I sent

                        Just a follow-up to see if you--

          Johnny hits fast forward.

          Johnny drops the card onto the table.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Are you going to call?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm going to change my number.

          Chandra tries to get a little banter going.

                                        CHANDRA
                                (kidding)
                        I'm a palm reader, by the way.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        Really?

                                        CHANDRA
                              (a demand)
                        Let's see.

          Before Johnny can pull his hand out of harm's way, she
          reaches out and takes it.  He suddenly hears Chandra's
          voice from a nearby table:

                                        CHANDRA (O.S.)
                                (upset)
                        Kind of ironic, isn't it?

          Johnny turns toward the sound, sees himself and Chandra
          at another table, wearing different clothes, leaning close
          toward each other, in intimate, difficult conversation,
          hand in hand.


  44ANGLE - JOHNNY AND CHANDRA - ANOTHER NIGHT

          There are tears in Chandra's eyes.

                                        CHANDRA
                        It's still Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She has nothing to do with us.

                                        CHANDRA
                          Everything.  Everything to do
                        with us.

          Chandra indicates the table.

                                        CHANDRA
                        She might as well be sitting here
                        right now.

          Chandra tries to stop herself from crying, stares down at
          the plate in front of her.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Why do I always have this?  I
                        hate their Caesar.

          She pulls her hand away from his, and at that moment--


  55RESUME - RESTAURANT

          --Johnny suddenly takes his hand away from Chandra's,
          disturbed. 

                                        CHANDRA
                        What's wrong?

          The Waiter arrives, sets down their respective plates. 
          He leaves.  Chandra stares at Johnny.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Did you see something?

          Johnny regains his composure.  Forces a smile.  He
            indicates her plate.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to wish you never
                        ordered that salad.

          Chandra smiles with relief.  But any rapport they might
          have achieved over the last few minutes has utterly
            disappeared.  They pick up their silverware and continue
          the meal in silence...          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - TEASER - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE   6.



          Arthur is now dressed in his "nice" clothes -- jacket and
          tie -- and has brought Johnny an old shoe box full of
            mementoes now placed onto the coffee table.  He's made an
          effort to look as dignified as possible and has succeeded --
          there's a poignancy about his presence. 

                                        ARTHUR
                                (nods)

                                        JOHNNY
                        When was this taken?

                                        ARTHUR
                          Nineteen forty-five.

          Johnny stares again at the photo -- she was definitely a
            beautiful woman.

          Johnny sets it aside, picks up a Bronze Star medal -- THE
          ROOM FREEZES AROUND HIM AND HE TURNS AT THE SOUND OF
          HEAVILY FRITZED MORSE CODE:           THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT ONE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  13.


  1010ANGLE - ARTHUR AS WORLD WAR II RADIO OPERATOR

          In the corner of Johnny's living room, 20 years old, wire-
          rimmed glasses similar to those worn by Arthur even now,
          hunched over a tiny table, writing furiously with pencil
          on paper as the heavily fritzed SOUND of MORSE code, dit-
            daw-daw-dit... is heard over and over.  His glasses have
          been cracked, and the SOUND of nearby mortar shelling can
          be heard.  This is a life or death situation.

                        Yes!

          Johnny sets down the medal.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: medal)
                        Guess you were good at it. 

                                        ARTHUR
                        I was good at brain teasers. 
                        Pulling a signal out of
                          interference was just another
                        puzzle to solve.  No trouble at
                        all. 

          Johnny indicates the photo of Abby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not this one though.

          Arthur shakes his head.  Johnny picks up an old letter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        From her?

                                        ARTHUR
                        I wish.  That's one of mine. 
                        Came back "Return to Sender."  I
                        got overseas and she never wrote
                        to me.  Not even a postcard.

          Johnny puts the letter down, and looks again through the
          objects, picking up a silver cigarette lighter.  He flicks
          the mechanism.  And is in a vision.

          combination of soup kitchen and big band club, circa 1945. 
          He wears the uniform of an American Air Force pilot and
          we'll know him as "Johnny/Tommy" -- since it is through
          Tommy's eyes that Johnny is seeing and experiencing this
          lost era.  At the moment, he is waving the flame from the
          silver lighter near the cigarette dangling from his lips,
          missing it, his attention riveted by what he has just
          spotted across the floor. 

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Man o man.  A dolly just walked
                        in to beat the band...

                                                                    WIDEN TO INCLUDE:

          The young Arthur -- ARTIE -- as he appeared as the radio
            operator: twenty years old, wearing the uniform of an
          American private and the same type of wire rim glasses he
          will wear as an elderly man.  Artie is sitting at the
          table next to Johnny/Tommy, his head down, working
          diligently with a pencil to solve a newspaper puzzle called
          "The Daily Enigma."  He doesn't even look up, but has a
          small, knowing smile on his face.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Artie.  She's coming over here.

          Artie still doesn't look up, his smile grows, he suppresses
          a laugh.

                                        ARTIE
                        You don't say...?

            Johnny/Tommy gives up on the cigarette, slapping the
          lighter down on the table.  Artie pockets the lighter and
          glances up in time to see the arrival of a lovely young
          woman wearing the striped apron of the hostess/waitresses
          who work here.  We recognize her immediately from the
          elderly Arthur's photo.

                                        ARTIE
                        Abby Travers, this is my pal Tommy
                          Peterson.

          Abby puts out her hand, Johnny/Tommy, recovering, shakes
          it.  And as she sits down, he turns to Artie, who is
          already absorbed again in solving the newspaper puzzle.

                                        ROSIE (O.S.)
                        Yoo Hoo!

                                        ARTIE
                                (sotto)
                        The one-two punch.

          A high wind hits their table in the person of ROSIE, early
          20s, bright red hair, pretty but overbearing, wearing the
          same striped hostess apron as Abby.  On impact, she sticks
          out her hand to Tommy.

                                        ROSIE
                        You must be Tommy.  I'm Rosie
                          O'Halloran.  Great uniform.

          Tommy shoots Artie a look, then shakes her hand.  As she
          sits down--

                                        ROSIE
                        Gotta girl, Tommy?

                                        ARTIE
                        You know he doesn't.

                                        ROSIE
                        I wanna hear it from the horse's
                        mouth.

          Tommy smiles at Abby.

                                        TOMMY
                                (re: himself)
                        This horse hasn't been ridden in
                        months.

          Rosie lets out a squealing laugh, Abby blushes
            terrifically.  The Swing Band comes back from their break
          and kicks in with an uptempo number.

                                        ROSIE
                        Come on gang, let's jump!

                                        ARTIE
                                (working puzzle)
                        You know I don't dance.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT ONE - REV. 4/11/02 - PINK  17.

          Rosie turns to him with a cool look--

                                        ROSIE
                          I wasn't talking to you, drip --

          --But when she turns back, she's lost her chance:
            Johnny/Tommy is already pulling Abby by the hand toward
          the small dance floor.  Abby shoots a "should I be doing
          this?" look toward Artie, but the latter just beams at
          her -- he trusts both of them completely.  Artie goes
          back to his puzzle and Rosie steams, shouting after as
          they go, hoping at least to add a note of discomfort:

                                        ROSIE
                                (shouting, false cheer)
                          Remember!  Mum's the word!

          Abby looks momentarily concerned, but Johnny/Tommy pulls
          her into an energetic swing dance, and she instantly
          forgets herself in the moment.  The vision ends.



          Johnny snaps out of it, his eyes just a little dazed,
          dropping the lighter to the table.  He's instantly on his
          feet, energized into motion by the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was in a nightclub... I saw

                                (re: Johnny's power)
                        I have to admit, I still had my
                          doubts--

                                        JOHNNY
                          --"Mum's the word."

                                        ARTHUR
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You had just introduced everybody. 
                        And Rosie said that to Tommy:
                        "Mum's the word."

          Arthur considers this.  Then it dawns on him.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Abby and I were supposed to be a
                        secret. 
                                (explains)
                        The Stage Door was a charity
                        operation.  For us soldiers.  The
                        girls were volunteers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They couldn't go off to fight,
                        but they could help morale.

                                        ARTHUR
                                (nods)
                        With conversation, a little
                          dancing.  It was nice.  The girls
                        liked it too.  Sometimes Broadway
                        people volunteered -- big stars
                        even.  Some of the girls were
                        hoping to get discovered.  Not
                        Abby.  She just wanted a family. 
                        With me.

          Arthur is suddenly lost in thought.  Johnny has to prompt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "Mum's the word...?"  

                                        ARTHUR
                        Right.  If a girl was caught dating
                          a soldier outside the Canteen she
                        got banned.  Worst thing that
                        could happen.  So Abby and I had
                        to keep it quiet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But Rosie knew.

                          Honestly, I can't remember.  But
                        she and Abby were friends, so it
                        makes sense.

          Arthur thinks for a moment, genuinely puzzled, even
          concerned.

                                        ARTHUR

                        saw.
                                (gently)
                        You were standing under the big

                                (nodding)
                        Where we always used to meet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think that place reminded you
                        of Abby... and your mind did the
                        rest.

          Arthur thinks for a moment.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Go there yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A trip to New York isn't on my

                        That's not the point.  I have a
                        life.

          A beat.  In the sudden silence a mantel clock can be heard
          ticking loudly... tick tock tick tock...

          Johnny sighs -- the new tactic just might be working.



          Johnny, now wearing his pajamas and bathrobe, is listening
          to his saved messages on the answering machine.

          It's the exact moment seen in his restaurant vision. 
          Johnny SKIPS to the next message.

                        treat next time?  Give me a call.

          Then he stops the machine.  His expression is ambivalent.



          The oven timer SOUNDS.  Johnny, still in pajamas and robe,
          pulls a midnight snack out of the oven -- frozen macaroni
          and cheese -- burning his hand.



          Johnny, pajamas and robe, is watching an old game show on
          television -- we hear the sound of it offscreen.  The
          crusted remains of the macaroni are on the coffee table
          in front of him.  Johnny glances over at the couch --


          INCLUDE ARTHUR

          Asleep on the cushions -- Johnny has tossed a blanket
          over him for warmth.  He just didn't have the heart to
          turn the fellow into the night.

          Johnny pulls the shoe box over, idly searches through the
          mementoes, then picks up the lighter.  He is in a vision.



          The same night Johnny saw (through Tommy's eyes) in his
          previous vision.  Johnny/Tommy is on the dance floor with
          Abby, the energetic song ends, a slow one begins, and
          before Abby can head back to the table, Johnny/Tommy
          artfully takes her waist and hand and they continue the
          next dance, maintaining a proper distance between them. 
          As they circle around, they both see Artie at the distant
          table, absorbed in his puzzle; Rosie is off chatting with
          another couple of soldiers.

                        If you don't mind me asking, what's
                        a girl like you...

                                        ABBY
                                (curt)
                          ...Doing with a fella like Artie? 
                        You oughta be ashamed.  Your best
                        pal--

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        --Doing in a place like this.

          Whoops.  Abby's defensive answer has revealed a bit too
          much.  Flustered, she quickly recovers.

                                        ABBY
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                          I thought the gals in here were
                        all actresses on the make.  Looking
                        to be on Broadway.

                                        ABBY
                        Some of us just like showing our
                        support for the troops.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (testing her)
                        Say, isn't that Errol Flynn?

          Abby instantly whips her head around to look -- it's not.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (lightly)
                        My mistake.

          Abby frowns at him, but playfully.  He smiles.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Back to Artie.

          Abby smiles too -- disarmed. 

                                        ABBY
                        He's the smartest boy I've ever
                        met.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        No argument here.

                        Good Lord willing.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I hope you get your wish.

          His hand slides up to the middle of her back -- the motion
          sends a chill up her spine.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        But you're only young once.

          She suddenly pulls away from him.

                                        ABBY
                        We'd better stop.

          But they both know they will never "stop" -- until it's
          too late.  The vision ends.



          Johnny is taken aback by what he has just witnessed first-
          hand.  He glances over at Arthur, sleeping peacefully --
          as oblivious now as he seemed to be half a century ago. 
          OFF Johnny's troubled expression.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          A woman in her seventies, ROSE (the present day version
          of "Rosie" from 1945), is peeking through the crack of
          the door, still secured with a lock chain.

                                        ROSE
                        Arthur Allen?!  That's wonderful!

          She unfastens the chain and opens the door, revealing
          Johnny, travel bag off one shoulder.  He shakes her hand --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Pleased to meet you, Rose.

                                        ROSE
                                (upbeat)
                          "Rosie."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rosie.

          If he hoped to get a vision from shaking her hand, he's
            disappointed.  Rose shows him into the room, buoyant.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Very much so.

                                        ROSE
                        Who would've guessed?  So many
                        have passed on.  At least I assume
                        they have.  It's not like I've
                        been keeping records.

          Johnny steps further into the room, and she notices his
          cane.

                                        ROSE
                        What happened to the leg?  Too

          Not like she cares.  Rose's ruthlessly cheery demeanor
          might suggest a note of insincerity and self-absorption.

                                        ROSE
                        Is Artie in New York?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maine.

                                        ROSE
                        I went to Maine once.  More
                          Italians than I would have
                          expected.

          She indicates a chair for him to sit in, but Johnny spots
            something across the room that he recognizes from his
          visions -- a Stage Door Canteen apron, framed and hung on
          the wall.  Amazed, he heads for it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's from the Stage Door Canteen
                        isn't it?

                                        ROSE
                        You have such a good eye! 
                                (upbeat)
                        He never did get over her, did
                        he?  She got to everybody, that
                        Abby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did she keep in touch?

                                        ROSE
                        Just disappeared.  But that was
                        the War.  People did things maybe
                        they wouldn't ordinarily do.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        You too?

                        I'd rather not say.

          Johnny indicates a big photo album on the shelf just below
          the framed apron.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I?

                        Please.

          Johnny opens the book, turns the pages, revealing a program
          for a Stage Door musical show, a napkin, a coaster,
            photos... He touches each one, but no visions.  Then he
          turns to a faded B&W photo of Abby, Artie and Rosie. 
          They are goofing together in a park -- Abby holds a croquet
          mallet, Arthur wears a straw boater hat, young Rosie is
          mugging for the camera.  Johnny casually touches the photo --


  2525THE IMAGE SUDDENLY FILLS JOHNNY'S FIELD OF VISION

          THEN IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER:

          A STYLIZED SERIES OF B&W STILL SHOTS, LIKE A VISIONARY
            "SLIDE-SHOW" -- as if by touching the photo, Johnny has
          tapped into the snapshots contained on the rest of the
          long lost film roll.  We see the three young friends in
          variations on the theme of Afternoon in the Park: Artie
          alone, Abby with Artie, Abby with Rosie, another with
          Abby and Artie, and then Abby, Abby, Abby -- image after
          image of Abby in the Park, at first with the other two in
          the background or mostly out of frame, then finally nothing
          but close-up shots of Abby, like stolen moments, as if
          the photographer had a single goal in mind.


  2626RESUME - ROSE'S APARTMENT

          Johnny recovers his composure.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                  (reassuring)
                          Whatever you want.

          A beat.  She lowers her eyes but says nothing.  That's
          good enough for him.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (to cabby)
                        The Swan Song Hotel.

          The vision ends.



            Establish the cavernous reading room, occupied even at
          night, with tables and study carrels in use.  We hear a
          distant "SHHHH" from below...


  3737CLOSE ON: STUDY CARREL

          Where Johnny at a microfilm reader, talking on his cell
          phone.  The "SHHHHH!" is louder here, because it's directed
          at him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gotta go!

          He clicks off the phone.



          Sarah stops pacing the floor, closing up her cell phone
          with a flustered ARGGH!  Walt, shirtless, is in bed,
            reviewing a work report.

                                        SARAH
                        He thinks he saw the girl!

                        Exactly what I said.

                        I know.  I heard you.

                                        SARAH
                        And now he's looking for a hotel
                        that doesn't exist either.  Because
                        that's where they were headed.

                        Johnny and this... fantasy woman. 
                        He's just a little too into this.

          She sits down on the bed, thinking.

                                        SARAH
                        Can't you find pretty much anybody
                        these days?

                        The woman Johnny's looking for?

                        I'd rather we found her.  Or some
                        kind of record of her.  This just
                        isn't healthy.

                        You're not jealous are you?

          Sarah is taken aback by the comment.

                                        SARAH
                        Of a fantasy woman?

                        Yeah.

                                        SARAH
                                (lightly)
                        That wouldn't be healthy.

          She snuggles up to him.  But Walt pushes it.

                                        WALT
                        What happens when he finds somebody
                        for real?

          Sarah doesn't have an answer.



          Johnny stops the microfilm reader at a page from a
            newspaper that shows "The Daily Enigma" -- the brain teaser
          Artie was seen working in 1945.  He considers it for a
          moment, then gives the knob on the machine one more turn,
            scrolling the paper forward till it stops on an engraved
          image illustrating an advertisement: The Swan Song Hotel.          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT THREE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  37.



          The door opens and Johnny steps inside, the door held
          open for him by a uniformed BELLBOY -- mid-20s, art school
          type, unsmiling but helpful, his humor dry as the thin
          layer of dust in this one-star establishment.

                                        BELLBOY
                        ...This was the Swan Song Hotel. 
                        And then, it wasn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I see.

          The Bellboy continues with his "Bellboy Routine" which is
          how the Artist in him makes sense of this job -- it's for
          his own amusement.

                                        BELLBOY
                        This was the Honeymoon Suite.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And then it wasn't.

                                        BELLBOY
                        No, it still is.

          He drops Johnny's bag onto a suitcase rack,  then indicates
          the knob on an old radiator.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Room temperature is at your
                          discretion.

          He indicates a plastic picnic cooler on the floor.

                                        BELLBOY
                        The minibar is available for your
                          convenience.

          Johnny's cell phone suddenly JINGLES in his pocket.  Once,
          twice, three times.  Johnny makes no move.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Will you answer it, Sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm kind of busy tonight.

                                        BELLBOY
                                (conspiratorial)
                        Of course.

          The jingle finally stops.  A beat, then it starts again. 

                                        BELLBOY
                        You might consider turning the
                        ringer off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can do that?

                                        BELLBOY
                        Allow me.

          Johnny hands it over.  The Bellboy expertly manipulates
          the keys, and the jingling stops.  He hands it back.

                                        BELLBOY
                        It's set to "vibrate."

                                        JOHNNY
                                (puzzled)
                        Is that good?

                                        BELLBOY
                        Not good or bad, but neutral.

          Johnny nods, then pulls out a couple of one dollar bills
          and hands them over.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Too kind, Sir.

          He gives an imperceptible bow and exits, shutting the
          door behind him.  Alone in the room, Johnny starts to
          look around -- at the vaguely mid-seventies wallpaper,
          the plain furniture, the dull carpet.  If he expected a
            "rendezvous" with the Abby of his visions in this place...

          Johnny opens the picnic cooler "mini-bar," revealing a
          six pack of beer on ice.  And a bag of chips.  He goes to
          the bed, sits down.  He touches the bed with the palm of
          his hand, hoping... but no vision.

          He pulls out the bedstand drawer, revealing the ubiquitous
          Gideon's Bible inside.  This one looks like it's been
          there... well, forever.  He picks up the book, turns the
          pages idly, then stops and reads.

                                (reading)
                        "O my dove, that hides in the
                        clefts of the rock, in the secret
                        places of the stairs, let me see
                        thy countenance..."

          The room changes around him, and he is in a vision.



          Johnny is now Johnny/Tommy, still sitting on the bed with
          Bible in hand, reading aloud, continuing the lines from
          above.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        "...let me hear thy voice; for
                        sweet is thy voice, and thy
                          countenance is comely."

          He looks up at Abby, who is standing tentatively nearby. 
          The room decor is 1940s romantic, definitely "Honeymoon
          Suite" material.  She's not close enough for him to touch,
          is still purposefully keeping her distance. 

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY

                        Never knew the Good Book got it
                        so right.

          But faced with the moment, Abby is again torn.

                        We're there now.

          Abby is puzzled.

                        Every second that we let get away

                        You feel it, and so do I.

          He puts down the Bible, and holds out his hand to her.

          him, and they kiss...

          A KNOCK at the door, and the vision ends.



          Johnny is snapped out of the vision -- the KNOCKING
          continues.  He gets up, opens it.  The Bellboy rolls in
          with a drinks cart holding a champagne bucket and two
          glasses.

                          Honeymoon Suite tradition.

          He continues into the room, then stops the cart and pulls
          a bottle of the cheapest champagne on the market out of
          the icebucket and starts to open it.

                                        BELLBOY
                                (re: bottle)
                        Stand back, Sir... there is a
                        danger.

          The cork comes off -- without a whimper let alone a pop. 
          The Bellboy artfully places his thumb over the lip of the
          bottle and gives it a violent shake.  Then he quickly
          pours into the two plastic champagne glasses.  A few sorry
          bubbles reluctantly break the surface.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Enjoy.

          Then he's out the door.  Johnny stares at the glasses for
            a moment, then sits back down on the bed.  No vision.  He
          picks up the bible again, letting it fall open to a page.

                        of it fifty cubits..."*

          Still no vision.  Frustrated, Johnny sets the book aside. 
          Then he lays back down on the bed.  And is in a vision.          DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT THREE - REV. 4/19/02 - 2nd BLUE  40A.

            Johnny/Tommy is naked under the covers with an equally
          naked Abby.  They are in an embrace fueled by both passion

          hand reaches out and picks it up.

          yup, all night.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I was... otherwise engaged.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We... I mean they... it was pretty
                          incredible.
                                (waking completely)
                        Abby and Tommy had a tryst.  Here
                        at the hotel.

                                        SARAH
                        And you saw it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I lived it.

                                        SARAH
                        The two of them.  Having sex.

          Walt looks up again.

                        love.

                        Right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah, this is the first woman
                        I've been with since... you and
                        me.

                                        SARAH
                        She wasn't real!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was speaking psychologically.

                                        SARAH
                        I want you to come home now.

          Johnny is off the bed and pacing the hotel room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What home?  Can you tell me where
                        I'm at home?  I'd like to know.

          Sarah is taken aback.

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny...

                        I'm not leaving.  It isn't over
                        yet.

                                        SARAH
                        What isn't over yet?  You and
                        Abby?  Or you and me?

          Walt is on his feet.

                                (to Sarah, an edge)
                        Do you two want to be alone?

          Sarah waves at him to stay in the kitchen.

                                        SARAH
                                (to Walt)

                        --I gotta go.

          He hangs up.  Sarah does the same.  She turns to Walt.

          A beat.  Sarah sits at the table, calming herself, but
          still concerned. 

                                        SARAH
                        You were running some kind of a

                        We'll hear something today.



          The place is hopping with soldiers and hostesses. 
            Johnny/Tommy spots what he's looking for: Abby, in her
          striped apron, dancing with a young man in a naval uniform --
          just doing her job.  He quickly crosses the floor.  Abby
          is surprised and concerned to see him.

                                        ABBY
                        Tommy.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Who were you expecting, Tojo?
                                (cutting in)
                        Shove off Sailor, I'll convoy
                        this boat.

          The Sailor moves off as Johnny/Tommy takes Abby's hand
          and continues the dance.

                                        ABBY
                          I thought we agreed.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        To give me the bum's rush?

                                        ABBY
                        To not see each other again.

          She looks over his shoulder at Artie seated at a table
          across the floor, head buried in his puzzles as usual.

                                        ABBY
                        Before somebody gets hurt.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Too late for that.

          Abby stops dancing, her voice desperate.

                                        ABBY
                        What happens after the War?  You'll
                        come back to me?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        You know I will.

                        Have a coupla kids?
                                (off his hesitation)
                        That's not you, Tommy.  Never
                        will be.

          She's right.  But he won't admit it.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        We're telling him.

          Abby tries to stop him, but he's already in motion.  He
          reaches Artie's table and remains standing.  Artie glances
          up, smiles hugely.

                                        ARTIE
                        Tommy!  Where have you been?

                          Wouldn't you like to know.

          Abby arrives, slipping onto the chair next to Arthur.

                                (pleasant)
                        Yeah, I would.  We've only got a
                        few more days and I'd like to

                        pal.

          Abby looks up at Johnny/Tommy, trying not lose it.  She
            purposefully echoes the words they exchanged when they
          first met.

                        He talks about you all the time.

          Faced with the moment of truth, Johnny/Tommy hesitates.

                        Really?

          Artie gives his best pal a warm smile -- then goes back
          to working his puzzle.  Johnny/Tommy stares at him, like
          he would a kid brother, with a sudden, overwhelming
          affection.  Then he looks at Abby, who is completely
          vulnerable.  And he decides to do the right thing.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I'm gonna clear out.

          Artie finally looks up.

          Artie goes back to his puzzle as Johnny/Tommy turns to
          Abby for what they both know is the last time.

                        You too, Tommy.

            Johnny/Tommy gives her one last smile, then turns toward
          the door -- his face is devastated.  As he crosses the
          floor, Rosie is hovering in his path -- as if she knows
          everything and has been waiting to make her move.

          But she might as well not exist.  Johnny/Tommy heads for
          the exit.          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  47.



          Johnny has just stepped inside.  Rose is all smiles.

          Rose's smile gets just a little hard.

                        You were in love with Tommy.

          The woman's smile falters.  A long beat.  Then:

                                        ROSE
                        I don't know.  I don't know why
                        she went away.

          Johnny is suddenly facing a vulnerable, frail old woman. 
          He stops going on the offensive, quiets his voice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that true?

                                        ROSE
                        She ended it with Tommy.  Tommy
                        and Arthur went to the War.

                        A month later, Abby disappeared.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Without a word?

                                        ROSE
                        Not to me.

          Johnny studies her for a moment -- and believes she's
          telling the truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Her real name?

          A beat.

                                        ROSE
                        What difference does that make
                        now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe a couple of people who should
                        have been together can get another
                        chance.  While there's still some
                        time.

                                        ROSE
                                (cheery again)
                        Don't be such a drip.  We were
                        just a bunch of soldier crazy
                        victory girls...
                                (voice breaking)
                        It didn't matter then, it doesn't
                        matter now. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sincere)
                        I'm sorry.

                                        ROSE
                          Goodbye.

          There's nothing more Johnny can do here.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Goodbye.

          He heads for the door.  Rose starts paging through her
          book of memories.  Without looking up:

                                        ROSE
                        Tarnovski.  Abigail Tarnovski.

          Johnny turns toward her.  Her voice is wistful.

                                        ROSE
                        She said it would never fit on a
                          marquee.


  5252OMITTED



          Johnny is standing close to the small stage, searching
          among the kids and few adult teachers scattered among
          them.  Then he turns and sees... something incredible. 
          Standing right next to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Abby...?

          She's the same young woman from his visions -- now wearing
            contemporary clothes and hairstyle, but there is no
            mistaking her.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        Yeah?

          Her voice has the edge born of years of fending off
          unwanted advances.  Johnny is really confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... I just spoke with you...

          The young woman stares at him -- who is this nut?  Then
          it dawns on her.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        You mean my grandmother?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Grandmother...

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Mister Smith!

          An elegant, white-haired woman disengages herself from
          the kids she's teaching and steps closer -- she's happy
          to see him.  This is ABIGAIL, the present day version of
          the Abby from 1945.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Thank you so much for coming here.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (still rattled)
                        If... you're busy...

                                        ABIGAIL
                        We're just finishing up.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                                  (impatient)
                        I'm triple parked.

                                        ABIGAIL
                                (calm)
                        We'll just be a few minutes.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        Gram...

                                        ABIGAIL
                        I'll take a cab home.

          That's all her granddaughter wanted to hear.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        Cool.

          She turns and takes off.  Abigail indicates a couple of
          folding chairs on stage and they sit down.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Tell me about Artie.  Arthur.

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be honest, I don't know him
                        very well.  But I know he misses
                        you.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Still.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One track mind.

                                        ABIGAIL
                                (smiles)
                        And you said you didn't know him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wants to see you.

          A long pause.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        I'm not sure that's the best idea. 
                                  (carefully)
                        People can still be made to hurt. 
                        No matter how many years.

          Johnny reaches out and puts his hand on hers in a
          supportive gesture.  And has a vision.


  5454ANGLE - ABBY WITH A BABY - 1946 - VISION

          She's sitting in a spare wooden chair on the stage,
          cradling an infant girl in her arms, singing a wordless
          lullaby.  Johnny can see this image directly over the
          shoulder of the older woman in front of him.  The young
          mother's eyes are filled with love and sadness.  The quiet
          singing continues over:

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Abigail)
                        You must have been lonely, raising
                        a child on your own.

          The vision is gone, but the mood remains melancholy and
          quiet.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        How did you know...?  Of course,
                        you met my granddaughter.
                                  (difficult)
                        I was engaged to Artie... I had a
                        baby by another boy.  A mutual
                        friend.  Tommy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why you left New York.

          Abby nods, now looking painfully toward the past.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Tommy and me... We never should've
                          happened.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was the War.

                                        ABIGAIL
                                (no excuses)
                        It was me.
                                (beat)
                        After my daughter was born... I
                        wrote to Tommy, just to tell him. 
                        He didn't write back.

                        The white picket fence... coupla
                        kids... probably not his style.

          Abigail looks at him curiously -- then nods.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        But it was Artie I loved.  Artie
                          I wanted to grow old with.
                                (quiet)
                        Artie and me... we can't go back.

          A long beat.  Johnny's own eyes are suddenly wet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that the only direction there
                        is?

          Abigail looks at him, a glimmer of hope in her expression.
