MATT (V.O.)
For the last 23 days, I've been living
in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags
and endotracheal tubes and six-month-
old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise
can go fuck itself.
Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying
stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one
side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her
trachea, IVs in her arm.
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is Elizabeth King, my wife.
Twenty-three days ago she was launched
from a powerboat during a race and hit
her head, almost drowned. Now she's in
a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow
scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos
scale, scores showing an extremely
severe coma. Liz is very competitive.
Whatever she does, she does to the
fullest.

Matt is getting the current DIAGNOSIS.
NEUROLOGIST
She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli
in a non-specific manner, but
occasionally her responses are
specific, though inconsistent. Her
reflexes are primitive and often the
same, regardless of stimuli
presented...
MATT (V.O.)
It was exactly what Elizabeth used to
accuse me of.

Matt continues to observe her.
MATT (V.O.)
Twenty-three days in a coma, and any
day now the doctors will give me their
final verdict if she's going to come
out of it or not. Then I have a
decision to make. Wait, that's wrong.
Liz has a living will.

A SCRAPBOOK
shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed. The
compositions are odd, the ANGLES uncomfortably CLOSE.
WIDE --
Matt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS. Hayashi and school
counselor MRS. THULL.
MS. HAYASHI
We just don't think these photographs
are appropriate for Scottie to be
sharing with her classmates. Some of
them went home quite disturbed, and we
got some angry calls from parents.
MATT
Yeah, she's sort of been going to town
with the whole picture-taking thing,
but I had no idea --
MS. HAYASHI
I can't tell you how my heart goes out
to you and your family, but Scottie
just hasn't been herself. Principal
Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would
be better for Scottie to remain at home
with you during this difficult time.
MATT
Home. See, I would think that sticking
to her normal routine would be the best
thing for her -- you know, keep her
occupied. I wouldn't really know how
to...

when she could be with her friends and
people like you who specialize in
children.
MRS. THULL
Mr. King, we see this every day --
children acting out at school when
something's wrong at home. And your
family is facing a devastating crisis.
Have you been engaging Scottie in
really talking about what's going on?
Encouraging her to express her
feelings? That's crucial.
MATT
(No)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
SCOTTIE (O.S.)

This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s.
This shit is bananas.
They look over to see --
TEN-YEAR-OLD SCOTTIE KING --
EARBUDS in place and in her own world, DANCING just outside
the classroom door. A JANITOR down the hall eyes her
suspiciously.
SCOTTIE (CONT'D)
This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s!
Matt stares aghast at this specimen called his daughter. The
ladies glance between Scottie and Matt, wondering when, or
whether, he'll intervene. Finally --
MS. HAYASHI
Scottie, that is not a good choice!
Are you making a good choice?
Scottie remains oblivious.
Ms. Hayashi rises to her feet.

Yeah, Scottie, come on.

Scottie takes Elizabeth's picture again.
MATT
I wish you'd stop doing that. And
rather than taking her picture all the
time, you should talk to her. I'm
tired of asking you. You heard Dr.
Johnston -- people in a coma can hear
you -- you know, well, some of them
can. It lets them know they're still
loved, might even help them wake up
sooner. And it'll help you express
whatever feelings and emotions you're
supposed to be going through -- you
know, make you feel better.
SCOTTIE
I don't know what to say.
MATT
Tell her a story.
SCOTTIE
I don't have a story.
MATT
Tell her anything. Tell her what's
been going on in school.
SCOTTIE
She never cares about that.
MATT
I don't believe that. What about after
school? She's always driving you
around the island. You know,
gymnastics? Soccer?
SCOTTIE
I don't do those things anymore.

Ballet?
Piano?

Nope.

She's in a

MATT
Goddammit, Scottie, stop fighting me on

SCOTTIE
But it doesn't make any sense.
MATT
You know what your mother is hearing
right now? You refusing to talk to
her. Is that what you want?

I'm starving. And I'm thirsty.
I want

He takes Scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair
next to the bed.
MATT
We're not leaving until you talk to
her. I'll even give you privacy.
Recite her the alphabet for all I care.

Fine, Joy, fine.

Have you made your decision yet?

The whole goddamned state is following
my decision on who's going to buy
35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has
owned since the 1860s. My cousins and
I meet in six days to approve a buyer.
Ever since my father died nine years
ago, I'm the sole trustee, the
controlling trustee, so I hold all the
cards. Why does so much have to depend
on me -- my wife, my daughters, my
family's land? I just want to hide.

A POSTCARD shows a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL in a bikini
straddling a surfboard, laughing as she's splashed.
Barely containing his rage, Matt stares at postcard before
grabbing ALL THE POSTCARDS in that rack.
AT THE COUNTER --
About to pay for the postcards and two SODAS, Matt notices a
HEADLINE atop a stack of NEWSPAPERS: "Activists Continue
Protest of Kaua'i Sale."
SHOPKEEPER
Hey, they all the same cards.
You like
buy all the same cards?
MATT
These are inappropriate for a hospital
gift shop. This girl is underage. Why
do you sell postcards like this? This
is a hospital. These aren't get-well
cards.
The SHOPKEEPER blinks at the man weirdly accosting her.
SHOPKEEPER
You like buy all the cards?

MATT (V.O.)
Elizabeth's going to make it out okay.
I know it. It's not her time yet.
She'll wake up, Scottie and Alexandra
will have their mother back, and we'll
talk about our marriage. I'll sell the
land and quit my practice and buy her
whatever she wants -- a big boat, a
house in France, a trip around the

Scottie bolts out the door. Matt takes a last look at Liz,

As Matt speaks on the PHONE, he wanders out of his cluttered
HOME OFFICE and into the DINING ROOM.
MATT
How can I help you?
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)
Let's see, where to start? It's
Scottie. She's been texting some awful
things to Lani, and I'd like her to
stop.
MATT
For instance.
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)
Here's the latest one. "We all know
you grew pubes over the summer." She
sends little messages like that for no
reason. She even wrote it on Lani's
Facebook wall.
MATT
Huh.
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)
She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying
she's like the size of an entire
neighborhood. Do you think that's
nice?
MATT
That's not like her at all.
She's
usually very sweet.
He glances out the window at Scottie, who sits on the ground,
back turned, POUNDING something with a BIG ROCK.
MATT (CONT'D)
As you may know, her mother isn't well,
and maybe this is how she's dealing
with it.

write to my daughter again.
LANI (DISTANT O.S.)
She can in a good way.
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)
If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to
tell the headmaster. You can't buy
your way out of this.
Matt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything else
weren't enough already.

See what I mean? Everybody sees me as
the rich guy, the inheritor. People
resent us. I resent us. Even our last
name -- King. How irritating.

SCOTTIE
Wait, I told Reina she could visit me
in the hospital since I'm not in school
anymore. Can she?
MATT
We'll make a deal. You apologize to
this girl, and you talk to your mother,
and then we'll see about Reina dropping
by the hospital. Okay?
Something outside the window catches Scottie's attention.
SCOTTIE

Matt looks to see --
SIX FAMILY MEMBERS,
walking on the sidewalk with KAYAKS, wearing T-SHIRTS reading
"Melnick Family Reunion."
SCOTTIE (CONT'D)

Scottie sits back in her seat, laughing. Matt glances in his
rearview mirror to see a TEENAGE SON taking off his T-shirt

Scottie, the things you said were
simply evil. Do you realize that? I
don't know what's led you to be such a
nasty young lady.
MATT
Hey, hey. We came over. She
apologized. We're dealing with it.
Kids are mean sometimes. They grow out
of it. It's a kid thing. Here,
Scottie, you're going to stop, right?
And you're really, really sorry, right?
Scottie makes a big exaggerated nod.
BARB HIGGINS
I don't think she's sorry at all.
She's going to keep doing it. I can
tell.
MATT
No, she won't. It's like the time Lani
locked Scottie out of the house at her
birthday party and Scottie sat outside
by herself. It was a mean thing to do,
but Lani here probably did it just to
show off, right?
Lani thinks a moment, nods.
MATT (CONT'D)
But I'm not about to declare that one
action defines a human being's entire
character. She's a work in progress,
and like all complex people is a bundle

The camera makes its way past PHOTOS of Matt's ancestors,
BOOKS of Hawaiian history, other family memorabilia to find
Matt at his desk pouring over PAPERS. A clock reads 1:20.
MATT (V.O.)
My great-great-grandmother was Princess
Margaret Ke'alohilani, one of the last
direct descendants of King Kamehameha.
She was originally supposed to marry
her hanai brother, but she fell in love
with her haole banker and estate
manager, Edward King, whose parents
were missionaries. Between his land
deals and her huge inheritance, all of
their descendants for generations have
watched the past unfurl millions into
our laps through leases and sales. Now
the Rule Against Perpetuities is
forcing us to dissolve the trust, and
we're selling the last parcel of
undeveloped land.
Matt looks up, his glance falling on the portraits of Edward
and Margaret.
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Soon my daughters and I can just be
normal citizens like everybody else,
and these dead people will stop
controlling our lives.

MATT (V O.) (CONT'D)

Matt eats a SACK LUNCH at his desk. His window has a grand

MATT (V.O.)
Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't
touched my share of the trust money.
Like my father before me, I live only
on the income from my law practice. I
don't want my daughters growing up
entitled and spoiled. And I agree with
my father -- you give your children
enough money to do something but not
enough to do nothing.
Matt's secretary NOE cracks open his door.
NOE
Mr. King, your cousins are here.

Matt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet
him. From their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer
might hardly suspect their status.
MATT (V.O.)
Not only am I the sole but I'm a
commercial real estate and
transactional attorney, so the most
involved of my cousins have been
meeting with me regularly to analyze
the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal,
Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa,
Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of
whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't
be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i
some of the most powerful people look
like bums and stuntmen.
LATER --
Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table,
looking at blueprints and architectural drawings.
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Elizabeth has so many friends, a big

Elizabeth, but instead he finds a room full of warmth and

ALEXANDRA
I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
Now that we get a closer look, we might recognize Alexandra
from the postcards at the hospital. We also see a
resemblance to her mother.
MATT
How are you feeling?
Shrugging, she plops down near Scottie.
MATT (CONT'D)
Hungover, huh? Why am I not surprised?
I don't know where to start, and we
probably shouldn't in front of Scottie.
SCOTTIE
I don't mind.
MATT
I thought you were supposed to be
getting your act together.
ALEXANDRA
I have gotten my act together. I was
just drinking. I've been doing really
well, but nobody ever seems to notice
my grades are better, and how I was in
that stupid play you guys didn't bother
to see. Do you even remember the name
of it?

ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)
That's what I thought. So what if I
got drunk on the ONE night you happened
to drop in? So the fuck what?
MATT
Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in
front of Scottie.
SCOTTIE
I'm okay.
MATT
(sitting with them)
Anyway, it's good to see you.
Welcome
home. Want some eggs?
ALEXANDRA
How long do I have to stay?

We'll discuss that.

I'm going swimming.
MATT
Then I'll join you.
ALEXANDRA
Good times.

They sit together now on sofas.
Alexandra appears drained
from crying.
MATT
I just found out yesterday. We have to
go through this thing together, you and
Scottie and I. And I need to go around
and tell people what's happening -- our
family and close friends. Sometimes
I'll want you to come with me. Other
times I need you to watch Scottie.
ALEXANDRA
You want me to go around with you and
tell everyone that Mom's going to die?
What's the point of that? Breaking the
news, watching them cry, dealing with
their emotions. How depressing is that
going to be? Just call them.
MATT
Alex, nobody wants to do any of this.
But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu, a
few friends. They have the right to
know and to be able to say goodbye.
ALEXANDRA
I don't want to talk about Mom with
anyone.
MATT
Whatever you fought about with her at
Christmas, you need to drop it. Grow
up. You love your mother. Your mother
loves you. Move on.

Dad, she was cheating on you.
Whoa.
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)
That's what we fought about. When I
was home at Christmas, I caught her
with some guy. It made me sick to see
her near you. I went back to school
thinking that was it, I was done with
her. I was going to call and tell you
everything. But then the accident
happened, and I was waiting until she
woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't
even suspect. Right?
(off his silence)
That disgusted me too. You're always
so busy.
MATT
Caught her with some guy?
What does
that mean?
ALEXANDRA
Brandy and I were on our way to swim in
the Black Point pool, and suddenly I
see Mom and some douchebag walk into a
house. His house, I guess.
MATT
Just a guy? It could have been
anybody.
ALEXANDRA
He had his hand on her ass.
It was
gross.

And?
ALEXANDRA
First she acted like she didn't know
what I was talking about. Like I'm
blind. Then she got super-mad and
started yelling at me and denied it.
That's when I decided I didn't want
anything more to do with her.
MATT
Who is he?
ALEXANDRA
I don't know. Some guy.
MATT
What did he look like?
ALEXANDRA
Dark hair.
Matt stands up, walks in a little circle -- he literally does

Hello!
It's me, Matt!
MARK AND KAI appear at the top of the stairs looking as
though they haven't been downstairs all day.
KAI
Oh, hey, Matt.
MATT
You guys weren't sleeping, were you?
As they come downstairs --
KAI
No, we were just fighting. Come on in.
Want a drink? Want some coffee?
MATT
(shaking his head)
What were you fighting about?
MARK
Stupid.
KAI
It's not stupid. He wants us to throw
parties and have people over, which we
do, of course, but who ends up doing
all the work? Me.
MARK
It's work that's totally unnecessary.
You don't have to do anything.
Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a
new outfit and think of some goddamn
theme cocktail. We can just invite
people over last minute and drink
whatever we have and hang out. It's
more fun that way, anyway.
As they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the
pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is
impatient with it, and longs for it.
MARK (CONT'D)
You know what? We can talk about it
later. Matt didn't come over to hear
us squabble.

I'm sorry to put you in this position.
But I'm not really the one who put you
there, am I? I just want to know who
this guy is that my wife has been...
seeing.
KAI
Oh, Matt, you're angry.
MATT
You could be a therapist.
Very keen

KAI
Wow. I think we should talk another

Matt sits.
He's not leaving.
No one speaks.
MATT
Is it Troy? That fucking Neanderthal?
MARK
You don't know him.
KAI
Oh, don't you even, Mark.
Shame on
you. You're her friend.
MARK
I'm Matt's friend too. And this is a
very unique and dramatic situation.
I'd want to know.
KAI
Don't betray her when she can't even
defend herself. Matt, you may not be

Your marriage was not... You worked so

take that away from you. But then you
made partner, and you only got busier.
And it's not like you were so involved
with the girls. She was lonely.
MATT
So you're going to talk to me in
clichs about women? Nothing is ever a
woman's fault. Was it still going on
when she had the accident?
Kai looks away.
Mark nods.
MARK
But I stayed out of it, Matt. Anytime
Kai talked about it, I walked away.
MATT
(to Kai)
And you what? You probably egged her
on. Add some drama to your life
without any actual risk. Whom do you
think you're protecting anyway? She
doesn't need your protection -- it's
over. She's going to die.
KAI
Don't say that.
MATT
I almost told you yesterday. She's
never going to wake up. It's for sure
now. You hear me? We're pulling the
plug. You were putting lipstick on a
corpse.
MARK
Come on, Matt.
That's a little
intense.
Kai's face dissolves into tears. Mark reaches out to comfort
her. Everybody falls back to Earth.
MATT
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take it
out on you guys. I just... Does she
love him?
Matt looks at him blankly, then at Kai.

That was unreal. I mean, how often do
old people just haul off and fucking
cold-cock you in the face?
MATT
He's hit me a couple times over the

MATT
You little fuck.
Do you get hit a lot?
SID
I don't know.
I've had my share.
MATT
(to Alex)
Your friend is completely retarded.
You know that, right?
SID
Hey, my little brother's retarded.
Don't use that word in a derogatory
fashion.
Matt looks at him. Given who Sid is, there's no reason to
think he wouldn't have a retarded brother.
MATT
Oh.
SID
Psych! I don't have a retarded
brother!
ALEXANDRA
You suck, Sid.
SID
Speaking of retarded, do you ever feel
bad for wishing a retarded person or an
old person would just hurry up?
Sometimes I wait for them to cross the
street, and I'm like, come on already!
But then I feel bad.
Rather than lashing out again at Sid, Matt turns around and
lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. It's

Hey, boss.
Matt looks up to see Sid in his boxers.
SID (CONT'D)
Did you call him?
MATT
None of your business. And put some

Alex's room. In fact, you should
really go home, son.

Matt closes the glass door behind him and slides the privacy
curtain across it. He looks at his wife. She's starting to
look different -- her face more gaunt, her hair more matted.
Since the last time we saw her, OTHER ITEMS have been added
around her bed. Along with draped LEIS, we see a childhood
DOLL, DIPLOMAS, and of course SPORTS MEDALS and RIBBONS. An
antique QUILT covers her legs. Her father meant it when he
said they'd bring her old things.
Matt crouches down bedside.
MATT
You were going to ask me for a divorce?
So you could be with some fucking

me? Who are you? Because the only

Isn't the idea of marriage to make your

Of course, part of me agrees with the
cousins who don't want to sell.
They're going to make a pretty big
stink at the meeting.
MATT
I know, but we have to sell. The trust
has to dissolve in seven years, and if
we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess.
Selling now and distributing the cash
is the only clean way to do it.
RALPH
But it's a shame, yeah? On the other
hand, hey, it's just sitting there. No
one's using it. At least this way the
whole world will be able to enjoy it.
MATT
(to his daughters)
Take a good look, girls. In the old
days, this was part of your great-great
grandmother's inheritance going all the
way back to Kamehameha I.
With them, we look across this land, vivid and verdant.
ALEXANDRA
Down there is where Mom and I would
camp.
MATT
We all did, all our lives.
A lot of
memories.
SCOTTIE
What about me? I want to camp.
I wish
we lived in the old days.
ALEXANDRA
We do. We still do.
(to Matt)
Do we really have to sell?
MATT
Doing anything else would get extremely
complicated. A lot of your cousins
just want the money. Everything has
its time.

I want us to keep it!

Can you like specify what businesses

ALEXANDRA
We're not watching porn.
SCOTTIE
Reina's dad watches pornos. Reina
calls them masturbation movies. Her
dad has some. She plays them when her
parents aren't home and one time
invited boys over to see if they grew
down there. One did.
SID
Reina's awesome.
MATT
Were you there?
Have you seen any of

SCOTTIE
No.

You've got to watch her with

Understandable.
MATT
I'm worried about my daughters. I'm

I used to do some messed-up shit when I

She doesn't.

We don't really talk about our like

Or no, I'd buy `em a bunch of shit.
Like with all the money you're going to
get when you sell the land -- you're
going to make stupid money, right? --
dude, you could buy them anything.
Matt questions his sanity at having asked Sid any advice.
MATT
Do you want some of it?
Some money?
SID
Sure.
MATT
If I gave you a lot of money right now,

Why would I leave?

No, Sid, I'm asking you a favor.
If I

Oh. I get it. Is that what you want?
You want me to go?
MATT
I guess not.
SID
Look, dude, you're right. If I had

Exchange them for sons, I guess.

It's possible.
My mom's sort of busy

MATT
What does she do, your mom?
SID
She's a receptionist at a pet clinic.
But mostly she's been getting the house

died a few months ago.
At first refusing to fall for it, Matt sees this is no prank.

November 24th. Drunk driver. Actually

He looks over his shoulder to see whom Matt might have come

Barney, an old-fashioned for my cousin

MATT
Not much otherwise. Between our

I've just trying to keep my head above

people staying in the cottage.
COUSIN HUGH
Oh, hey, Mattie, if I'd known you were

MATT
No, no, no, I'm just wondering about
the guy you're renting to. I think his
name is Brian Speer.
COUSIN HUGH
Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a-

wait. Lou has a sister, and the
sister's husband... Lou's brother-in-

That's the guy.
MATT
What do you mean, the guy we're doing
business with?
COUSIN HUGH
Who do you think? Don Holitzer.
MATT
Holitzer.
COUSIN HUGH
That's what I'm saying. That's Don's
brother-in-law in the cottage. You
don't know him? I would have thought
you'd know him. He's a realtor over by
you. So if we sell to Don -- and
that's what we're going to do, right?
That's what you want too. Nice guy,
Don. He'll do right by us. Then when
Don develops and re-sells and leases
and all that --
MATT
Yeah, yeah --
COUSIN HUGH
He's letting this brother-in-law in the
cottage handle the transactions. A lot

say no to things. I should have. I
love my family.
MATT
Then I guess it's all working out. Her
lips are sealed, and you don't have to
go through the trouble of dumping her.
BRIAN SPEER
Hey, hey, that's really unfair. I had -

She's a wonderful woman.

Too bad her husband found out. You
can't win `em all. One more question.
Have you ever been inside my bedroom?

You could have had the decency to lie

Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry,

While still a hospital room, there is no medical equipment
present. Bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended
to be uplifting. But unlike the expansive view outside
Elizabeth's ICU window, here the window looks out partially

Sid and the Kings are greeted by DR. JOHNSTON and grief
counselor DR. HERMAN, who affects a comforting smile.
DR. JOHNSTON
Hello, everyone. Matt.

This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you

counseling.
DR. HERMAN

Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi.
Hello.
The two professionals allow the Kings to turn their attention
to Elizabeth, who now lies with no machines at all. Around
her BALLOONS droop, FLOWERS wilt, get-well CARDS lie in a
pile. Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping. Her skin is
pasty, and her cheeks are hollow.

DR. HERMAN (CONT'D)
That's right. It's an octopus. Such a
funny creature with its eight legs.
But did you know octopi are actually
extremely intelligent, like dogs and
cats? They have unique personalities,
and just like us they have a lot of
defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know
about the ink sac. She uses ink to
confuse her predators. She can
camouflage herself. She can emit
poison, and some can mimic more
dangerous creatures, like the eel. I
keep her to remind me of our defense
mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,
our poison, all the things we use to
keep away hurt. The reason Dr.
Johnston invited me here today is to
meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot
about you.
SCOTTIE
Like what?
DR. HERMAN
I've heard that you're a wonderful and
unique and spirited girl.
Dr. Herman shoots a look at Matt before continuing.
DR. HERMAN (CONT'D)
And I've heard your mom's not doing too
well and that she's going to die very
soon.
All watch Scottie react to this news.
SCOTTIE
Dad, is that true?
MATT
Yes, Scottie. It's true.
DR. HERMAN
You're going to have to be a very brave
girl right now, and you're surrounded
by people who love you. I came to meet
you and tell you that if you ever want
to talk about what you're feeling, I
would like to talk to you too. I can
help you face what's going on without
all the silly defense mechanisms that
work for an octopus but not for us.

ALEXANDRA
What the fuck was that?
DR. JOHNSTON
Yes, well, they say she's very good one-
on-one.
SCOTTIE
So Mom's going to die for sure?
DR. JOHNSTON
Yes. We worked really hard with her,
but three other doctors and I agree
she's in what we call an irreversible
coma. Do you know what that means?
SCOTTIE
It means she doesn't have a brain
anymore.
DR. JOHNSTON
Not exactly, but... yes, that's the
general idea. So we're doing exactly
what she wanted us to do if that ever
happened. That's why she's not
attached to the machines anymore.
ALEXANDRA
It's for the best, Scottie. Look at
her. She's not happy like this.
DR. JOHNSTON
The purpose of medicine is to heal, and

into this misfortune just as you're

everything, Matt. A good, happy home,

Matt looks to Barry for help, but Barry's silence and

Scott, what's your point?
SCOTT THORSON
She wanted her own boat. She should
have had her own boat, one she would
have been familiar with.

She wasn't even driving! Her boat,
someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have
made any difference. You're not going

SCOTT THORSON
Sure, sure, quibble about the details.
She was a faithful, devoted wife. She
deserved more.
Why fight it?

You're right. She deserved more.

(gesturing toward the door)
Girls, Sid.
Matt, Sid and the girls quietly go into --

-- where they take a few steps away.
SID
Man, that guy's a prick.
Was he always
like that?
MATT
Yep.
Scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the
door. Noticing, the others join her.
THROUGH THE DOOR --
As Barry and Alice remain seated, their backs to us, Scott
stands above his daughter, touching her arm, eyes closed.
SID
Is he praying?
MATT
No.
SCOTT THORSON
(opening his eyes)
Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice.
ALICE
Oh.
Goodbye, Elizabeth.
The old man puts his hand over his mouth and squeezes his
eyes shut. Then he opens his eyes and places a hand on her
forehead, smooths her hair back.
WIDE --
Matt and his daughters watch without moving.

Matt sits at his desk lost in thought. The only sound is the
tick-tock of an old clock reading 3:20. Then he gets up and
starts pacing, shooting occasional glances at the BLUEPRINTS
and RENDERINGS atop his desk.

Matt opens all front doors and lanai doors, letting air into
the old place. He notices old PHOTOS OF KING ANCESTORS.

From the way Matt, Sid and the girls are positioned around
the room, we can tell their presence there is now way of
life. Scottie snoozes on the little sofa. We may notice
that Elizabeth is even more shrunken.
A KNOCK is followed by --
A VASE OF FLOWERS
appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by
thin bronzed arms. It's JULIE SPEER.
MATT
Julie.
What are you doing here?
He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers.
She
nods to the girls.
JULIE
I know we just met, but I was thinking
about you guys these past few days, and
I knew your mom was here. I don't
know. I just felt I should stop by.

MATT
You remember Alex. This is Scottie.
Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.
JULIE
Julie.
SCOTTIE
Were you friends with my mom?
JULIE
No, we never met.
But I know a lot
about her.
As they now do often, Matt and Alex exchange a look.
MATT
Well, we appreciate your coming by.
The flowers are lovely.
SID
(heading to the door)
Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the
cafeteria.
The girls follow Sid's prompt, leaving Matt alone with Julie,
standing, a dying woman between them.
MATT
I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know
about my wife's condition, but she's
going to die very soon. Any minute,
really. That's sort of why we're all
here.
JULIE
I know. That's why I came. Because I
know. I came because my husband
wouldn't. And that just didn't seem
right. I thought someone from my
family should come.
Wow.
MATT
I'm sorry I came to your house like
that. Just barged in on you.
JULIE
It's all right. I assume you're angry.
Of course you are. I'm angry too.

MATT
So he told you, huh?
JULIE
After you left that night, he was
acting really weird. Then I started
smelling it all over him. I'd already
smelled it.
MATT
You're a woman.
JULIE
I finally got it out of him. We've
been going crazy ever since. Not easy
with the kids around. It's all
something I never could have imagined.
And then your family's decision about
the land. I think you're doing the
right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's
all so complicated and confusing.
MATT
I know.
JULIE
Brian told me everything. Well, how
can I ever know it's everything? When
did you find out? Have you known for a
while?
MATT
Just a few days ago.
JULIE
I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry.
I
can't imagine what you're going
through. Do you mind if I say
something to her?
Matt is unsure but what else can he do?
Julie approaches the
bed.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Elizabeth, I'm Julie. Brian's wife. I
just want to say I forgive you. I
forgive you for trying to take Brian.
I forgive you for almost destroying my
family. I have to forgive you. Even
though I want to hate you.

MATT
Okay. All right. That's enough,
Julie. I think... I think that's
enough.
Matt walks to the door and opens it. Alex and Sid -- who've
clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away,
unnoticed by Matt and Julie.
MATT (CONT'D)
He didn't love her. Just so you know.
He didn't really love her.
JULIE
That's why I'm here.
Julie heads to the door. At the door, she looks at Matt.
Matt looks at her. She leaves.
Matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly
that this is his moment.
He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her
hair. He says something to her as though silently praying,
then realizes he should say it aloud.
He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach.
MATT
Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love,
my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

The door to Elizabeth's room opens, and Alexandra emerges, a
far-away sadness on her face. She walks slowly toward --
A NEARBY WAITING AREA
-- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid. Matt and Sid rise
to comfort her, but she's not in the mood. She allows them
each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie.
Signaling to Matt to let her do this, Alex escorts a fearful
Scottie toward Elizabeth's room, and, reassuring her, guides
her little sister inside.
Matt and Sid are left alone.

Scottie lies on a sofa watching television, draped with the
QUILT that lay atop her mother's hospital bed. Matt comes
over with TWO DISHES, hands one to her.
MATT
One scoop strawberry, one scoop mocha
chip.
SCOTTIE
Great.
Matt gets under the quilt with her. Moments later Alexandra
wanders in, notices what they're watching, sits next to Matt,
pulls the quilt over her legs.
ALEXANDRA
Can I have some?

His eyes not leaving the TV, Matt hands Alex his ice cream.
As they sit there on the sofa, the CREDITS roll quietly over
them.
