                                      TEASER

  FADE IN:

    A MAN S EYE11

    Squints against a harsh light...

    A WOMAN S HAND22

    Twisting a lock of BLONDE HAIR around its fingers...

    A PAIR OF LIPS33

    Hungrily seeks another pair of LIPS in a dark room...

    A MAN S FINGERS44

    Attaching wires to a lead...

    A PENCIL55

  Moves across a sheet of paper...

    A PLATE66

  Is laid on a TABLE...

  THE EYE77

    Closes.  The Man s head TURNS and reveals a BANDAGE where the 
  other eye should be...

  THE HAND88

    Restless.  Filled with tension.  It tucks the hair behind an 
  ear, rubs an aching neck...

  THE LIPS99

  Kiss with a passion that seems more angry than erotic...

  THE FINGERS1010

    Quickly covering the wire with DIRT...    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 2.



  THE PENCIL1111

    Finishes writing a line of text.  Pauses.  SCRATCHES it 
    out...

  THE PLATE1212

  Is joined by a FORK, a SPOON, and a NAPKIN...

  THE ONE-EYED MAN1313

  Is COLONEL TIGH.  Sitting shoeless on the floor of a bare 
    DETENTION CELL.  No furniture.  A bucket in the corner.  The 
  light in here is harsh and unforgiving.  His clothes are 
    FILTHY.  The bandage over his left eye has been there a 
    while, probably needs to be changed.  He s SCRATCHING a 
    small, almost imperceptible MARK on the bottom of the stone 
  wall with one fingernail, where it joins DOZENS of hashmarks 
    already there...

  THE WOMAN1414

  Is D ANNA BIERS, standing discreetly between one of the ROWS 
  of TENTS in the city and watching something o.c.  She keeps 
    glancing around -- edgy, nervous, can t believe she s 
    actually doing this and certainly doesn t want to be seen 
  here. 

  THE LIPS1515

    Belong to ELLEN TIGH.  She s having violent sex on a COUCH in 
    a dimly lit office with SOMEONE.  The aggression is palpable 
  on either side -- two people attacking each other more than 
    making love...

  THE FINGERS1616

    Belong to TYROL, who is hurriedly covering up an improvised 
    explosive device in the ground amid large STACKS of 
    CONTAINERS.  Nearby is SAMUEL T. ANDERS, quickly doing 
    similar work with another set of hidden explosives.  Both men 
  are nervous, constantly on the look out...

  THE PENCIL1717

  Is in the hand of LAURA ROSLIN, writing out something in long-
  hand on a PAD at her desk in the SCHOOL.  The pad is FILLED 
  with her handwriting and Laura glares down at the pad and 
    writes with furious concentration.  TORY FOSTER stands 
    nearby, holding NOTES and SCRAPS of PAPER...    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 3.



  THE PLACE SETTING1818

  Is being laid on a dining room table by KARA THRACE in a 
    comfortable, domestic apartment.  A living room connected 
  with dining area, a hallway leading to a bathroom and 
    bedroom.  The furniture is understated and soft, the fabrics 
    mellow and calming.  Heavy drapes are pulled over the 
    windows, letting in only thin shafts of light from the sun, 
    giving the room a shuttered, funereal mood.  Kara sets the 
  table for two by rote, her eyes hollow and exhausted, every 
    movement an effort...

  INT. DETENTION CELL - DAY1919

  Tigh jumps slightly as the door to the cell OPENS and BROTHER 
  CAVIL ENTERS, carrying a small chair with him.  He sets the 
  chair down in the middle of the cell and regards Tigh evenly.

                                BROTHER CAVIL 
                You know... every time you leave 
                the cell... we change the hashmarks 
                on your little  calendar  over 
                  there... 

    Tigh s one eye can t help glancing over at the hashmarks he s 
    laboriously scratched on the wall.

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  Guess how long you ve really been 
                  here.

  Tigh doesn t respond.  In fact, he s taken non-communication 
  to a fine art throughout the course of his incarceration, and 
    Cavil s used to it by now.

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - RESIDENTIAL TENTS - DAY2020

    D Anna is still out of sight from most PASSERSBY as she 
    watches another TENT across the way.  This tent has a 
    distinctive ENTRANCE, with hand-lettered INSCRIPTIONS around 
  the crude wooden DOOR set into a frame.  Small OFFERINGS have 
  been laid alongside the tent itself.  D Anna waits, 
    watches... 

    Finally DUCK EXITS the tent, closes the door behind him.  He 
  seems troubled.  He presses his fingers to his lips and then 
  onto a SYMBOL written on the DOOR before walking away.

    D Anna looks around furtively for a beat, then hurries across 
  the way, and quickly ENTERS the tent.    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 4.



  INT. ORACLE S TENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS2121

    D Anna ENTERS the darkened space, lit by guttering CANDLES 
  and filled with INCENSE.  Lying on a cot at the end of the 
  tent, raised slightly as if on an altar, is an old woman -- 
    SELLOI DODONA.  Her breathing is labored and shallow.

                                SELLOI
                  Don t be afraid.  I know who you 
                  are.  What you are.  Poor thing... 
                you must be terrified...

    D Anna hesitates, then moves toward the cot...

  INT. CYLON PLANNING MINISTRY - DAY2222

  The windows are shuttered, the sun STREAMING across the room 
    through the slats, painting Ellen s naked back with slashes 
  of light as she writhes on top of someone on the couch.  Her 
  voice is angry, charged:

                                ELLEN
                  Yes!  C mon!  Don t stop!  Frak me 
                you sonovabitch!  FRAK ME!

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - STORAGE AREA - DAY2323

  Tyrol and Anders finish their work, just as they HEAR the 
  sound of TURBINES.

                                ANDERS
                  They re inbound -- let s go!

  The two men scurry away as we see a CYLON HEAVY RAIDER appear 
  on the horizon.

  INT. LAURA S SCHOOL - DAY2424

  Laura still scribbling away on her pad of paper.  Tory has a 
  small stack of CANDID SNAPSHOTS featuring a variety of 
    humans, each of which seems to have been taken quickly, most 
    blurry or poorly framed.

                                TORY
                  I think we can match names to 
                  about... fifty of these photos.  
                But our best guess puts the total 
                  police force at around... 200.

                                LAURA
                        (distaste)
                Two hundred.  
                                (MORE)


                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 5.

                        (writes the number down)
                  I wouldn t have believed they d 
                  have found twenty people to turn 
                  against their own kind.  I want the 
                  rest of those names.

                                TORY
                  That s tough.  Cylons are afraid 
                the population will go after any 
                  human who joins the New Caprica 
                  Police.

                                LAURA
                As well they should...

  She writes furiously, with passion, flips over to the next 
    page...

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - DAY2525

  Kara sits at the dining table, a thick and juicy STEAK now on 
  the plate before her, but she makes no move to eat it, her 
    blood-shot eyes staring down at the food without seeing it.  
  Her hair is still long, but unkempt.  Dark circles emphasize 
  puffy eyelids and a haggard countenance.  Gods know when she 
  slept last.  

    LEOBEN ENTERS from the (unseen) kitchen, carrying more bowls 
  of food.

                                LEOBEN
                  Okay... mashed potatoes, gravy, and 
                  even some carrots.  

    Leoben fills her plate with food, then sits down.  He reaches 
  out to her and she puts her hand in his after beat.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)
                        (bowed head)
                  Heavenly Father, we thank you for 
                the bounty of this table...  

  INT. DETENTION CELL - DAY2626

  Cavil and Tigh.

                                BROTHER CAVIL 
                We reviewed your case today. 
                        (beat)
                  I can tell you, there was great 
                  disappointment on the review 
                  committee.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 6.

    CONTINUED:2626


  Tigh says nothing.  Won t even look at him.  Cavil reaches 
  into a pocket and takes out a TOOTHBRUSH, a WASHCLOTH, and a 
  BAR of SOAP.

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  Brought you some things.  Might as 
                  well be comfortable as long as 
                  you re here, right?

  Tigh closes his eye, trying not to slide into hopelessness as 
  he realizes this means he s going to be here a long time.

  INT. ORACLE S TENT - DAY2727

    D Anna stands above the frail form of Selloi, not sure what 
  she should be doing here or even why she s come exactly.  
    Selloi isn t well.  

                                SELLOI
                Did you bring any candy?

                                D ANNA
                        (surprised)
                  Candy...?  No.  

  She grabs a VIAL, shakes out CHAMALLA LEAVES -- the raw form 
  of the drug that Laura once took -- and begins chewing them.

                                SELLOI
                  Chamalla s so... bitter.
                        (beat)
                  Zeus sees all.  He sees you, Number 
                  Three... sees your pain.  Your 
                  destiny.  The gods all weep for 
                  you.

                                D ANNA
                  There is no Zeus.  No other gods 
                but God.

                                SELLOI
                You don t believe that anymore.  
                You don t know what to believe.  
                  That s why you re here. 

                                D ANNA
                        (quick)
                  That s not true.  And I don t even 
                  know why I m here.  Stupidest thing 
                  I ve ever done...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 7.

                It was your dream which brings you 
                  here to me.  

                                D ANNA
                        (shocked)
                How do you know about that?

                                SELLOI
                  I have a message for you... from 
                the One you worship.  He speaks to 
                you through me... just as He speaks 
                in your dreams...

  INT. CYLON PLANNING MINISTRY - DAY2828

  Ellen and the man both climax with shuddering YELLS... then 
  she collapses on top of her lover.

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - HIDDEN VANTAGE (STORAGE AREA) - DAY2929

    Anders and Tyrol are watching from a safe distance as the 
  Heavy Raider goes into a HOVER, then begins to gently set 
  down right where they planted their explosives.  Tyrol has a 
  crude REMOTE CONTROL.

                                ANDERS
                        (sotto)
                  Ready... now.

  Tyrol presses the button -- nothing happens.

                                TYROL
                  Frak!

  He frantically fiddles with the control...

  INT. LAURA S SCHOOL - DAY3030

  Laura is still writing.

                  Someday Adama s coming back.  And 
                  when that happens, the story of what 
                  went on here has to be told.  Our 
                  children need to know some people 
                  fought back.  Some people did 
                  nothing.  And some collaborated.

  Ellen is putting on her shirt.  Her face a mask of self-

  is sitting up -- but we still can t see his face.

                  I quite enjoyed that.

                I m so glad.  And when do I get 
                  what I want?

  The Man moves into the light to pick up his pants and we see 
  for the first time that he s a Brother Cavil Cylon.

  INT. DETENTION CELL - DAY3333

  Cavil stands up, goes to the door and KNOCKS, signalling his 
    imminent departure.  Tigh sits hunched against the wall, 
    struggling to fight off the hopelessness engulfing him.  The 
  door OPENS and Cavil looks down at Tigh with just the hint of 
    a smile.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Let s go.  Processing will take a 
                few hours -- bureaucracy must be 
                  served.  But with a little luck you 
                  should be home by dinnertime.

  Tigh looks up in shock.  Is this a trick?

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  I won t hold the door open forever,

  and heads for the door.  He limps on his left side.      'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 9.

  Tigh comes limping out of the gates and she runs to him, 
    throws her arms around him in tearful joy.

                  Thank you.

  She looks up at him and her expression softens just a little.  
  It catches Leoben short, he puts a hand to her face.

                                LEOBEN
                You look... so lovely tonight.

  She gives him a small smile -- and in an instant, Kara s 
  hands fly up from her lap with a homemade SHIV from where 
  she d hidden it and PLUNGES IT INTO HIS NECK.  Leoben gasps 
  and gurgles, clutching at her with his hands, but she spins 
  out of the chair and away from him as he crashes to the 
    floor, blood pouring out of his wound.  The look on Leoben s 
  face is more disappointed than angry.

  She stabs him viciously and repeatedly in the chest until his 
  body stops convulsing and he lies there dead.  Then she sits 
  down at the table and begins to eat with relish...

    shadows of the people within as they move about.  There are 
    MUFFLED SOUNDS OF VOICES, and the CLANG of MEDICAL 
    INSTRUMENTS IN PANS.  A WHINING SOUND from o.c. makes D Anna 
  turn to see --

  AN OLD DOG

  Tied up to a pole across the way from the Hospital Tent.  The 
  dog -- Jake -- is wagging his tail at her, but he s too old 
  and scruffy to get up from where he s lying.  His yellow DOG 
  BOWL sits empty to one side.  She smiles at him.

  to the dog, who gobbles it quickly.

  She heads off.  Then, just after she s gone, an o.c. PERSON 
    approaches.  Jake rouses himself briefly, then wags his tail

  Tyrol and Anders exchange a look -- what do you say to that? 
  They start to mumble their Sorry, Colonels but Tigh takes 
    another drink, changes the subject.

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LEOBEN S APARTMENT - NIGHT5050

    Leoben arrives at the door to the apartment, pauses just 
    before going inside.  He looks exhausted.  Presses his 
    forehead to the door for a beat... then rallies himself, 
    shakes off his fatigue and goes inside.

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS5151

  Kara is sitting on the living room floor, nonchalantly 
    braiding a lock of her long hair -- the corpse of Leoben 
  lying where it fell, a short distance away.  Kara ignores the 
    Leoben who enters, continues to braid the lock of hair as he 
    crosses the room and sits in one of the dining room chairs, 
  his former body at his feet in a pool of dried blood.

                  That s why He wants us to be 
                  together.  

  Kara suddenly looks to be on the verge of tears.

  Kara stops before she reaches him, then allows herself a 
  small smile before tossing the SHIV at his feet before moving 
  away.  He picks it up and examines it.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)

  Kara goes to a wall, presses her head against it -- 
    inadvertently echoing the same gesture Leoben made outside -- 
  she seems on the edge emotionally, physically, mentally.

                                KARA

    Leoben EXITS to the bedroom -- the instant he s gone, Kara 
  bolts for the door, yanks it open and is confronted with a 
  METAL CELL DOOR leading to a darkened hallway.  She throws 
    herself against the bars in crazed fury -- and not for the 
  first time.

                  two-one, mark!

  The Raptors launch DRONES from their bomb bays, but the 
    release is sloppy -- the drones KICK OUT and IGNITE as the 
    Raptors brake, but the Raptor behind Racetrack LAUNCHES LATE.  
  Its drone narrowly misses Racetrack...

    slamming into each other.

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - PYRAMID COURT - DAY6060

    Anders is playing a rough and tumble game of Pyramid against 
    a team including Duck on the outdoor dirt court, while a few 
    on-lookers watch, including Tyrol and Tigh, who has a wooden 
  cane by this point.  



























                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 26.

    Throughout, we INTERCUT between snatches of conversation 
    between Anders and Duck on the court and the more casual 
    conversation between Tyrol and Tigh on the sidelines:

    ANDERS & DUCK

                                ANDERS
                        (jump, throw)
                  Gotta be square on this -- can t

                  Don t like this, Colonel.  Think 
                  we re the ones crossing a line 
                  here.

    ANDERS & DUCK

                                DUCK
                        (catch, throw, tackle)
                I m not backing out -- I went to 
                see the Oracle Dodona -- she said I 
                  don t have a future --

  TYROL & TIGH

                                TIGH
                  It s the only way it s gonna work.

                  She s right -- I know it -- after 
                  they killed Nora -- feels like I 
                got nothing to live for anyway --

                  He s a soldier.  Not the first time 
                  we ve sent a soldier on a one way 
                  mission, Chief.  You know that, 
                  don t you?

                                TYROL
                  This is different.

    ANDERS & DUCK

  Duck SCORES.  Game over.  The players shake hands -- Anders 
    shakes Duck s hand, gives him a direct look.

                                ANDERS
                  Look me in the eye and say you re 
                  committed to doing this.

  Duck looks him right in the eye, still holding Anders  hand.

                                DUCK
                I m committed.

    Anders takes his measure for a beat, then puts his arms 
    around him in a strong hug.

                                ANDERS
                May the gods welcome you.

  TYROL & TIGH

  Tigh never looks at Tyrol.  There s something dark and 
    dangerous in Tigh s entire demeanor ever since he returned 
  from detention.

                                TIGH
                        (low)
                  This is our best chance to take out 
                  Baltar -- it may not come again, 
                and we re sure as frak gonna take 
                it.

                                TYROL
                  Some things you just don t do, 
                  Colonel.  Even in war.

                  you re sitting in detention.  Duck 
                  volunteered.  He s going.

  Tigh limps away, leaving behind a deeply troubled Tyrol.

                  Well, guess what?  It s gonna get a 
                lot harder before it gets easier.  
                So turn around and march your fat 
                ass out that hatch, go back to your

    D Anna, TWO Brother Cavils, and TWO DORALS, Caprica Six, and 
    BOOMER are meeting with Baltar.  D Anna is distracted 
    throughout, her thoughts still back on her meeting with

                  Let s review why we re here, shall 
                we?  We re supposed to bring the 
                  word of  God  to these people, 
                  right?  

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                To save humanity from damnation by 
                  bringing  His  love to these poor 
                  benighted people?

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  We re here because a majority of 
                the Cylon felt that the slaughter 
                of mankind had been a mistake.

                                BOOMER
                  We re here to find a new way to 
                  live in peace.  As God wants us to 
                  live.

                And it s been a fun ride so far. 
                But I m still trying to clarify our 
                  objectives.  Now, if we re here to 
                  spread  God s word  then it follows 
                  that we must employ any means 
                  necessary to do so -- any means. 

                                BROTHER CAVIL #1
                  Fear of the Lord is a key article 
                of faith as I understand it.  So 
                  perhaps it s time to instill more 
                  fear in people s hearts and minds.

  Kara ENTERS the bathroom, closes the door behind her.  Turns 
  on the WATER in the SINK.  Then quietly takes the TOP off the 
    toilet, reaches down inside the toilet TANK and quietly 
    disassembles part of the mechanism, removing TWO PIECES OF 
    METAL.  She wedges one piece of metal into the door JAM, 
    effectively wedging it closed.  She then goes to the sink, 
  which is filling with water... looks up at her reflection in 
  the mirror for a long beat... then takes the other piece of 
  metal and begins to DIG into her wrist with the sharp tip.  
  She draws BLOOD... pulls back... struggles for a beat... 
    grimaces, tries to force herself to do it... starts cutting 
  her wrist again... but can t do it.

  Water begins to flow over the rim of the sink and onto the

  the doorjamb itself SPLINTERS and BREAKS.  He looks in and 
  sees Kara in a heap on the floor -- her wrist bloodied, but

                You know, when you put me in this 
                  cell a year ago, I was at a 
                  crossroads.  I sat in here for

                  Betraying my people.  Losing the

                the only way to move forward was to 
                  forgive myself.

    Suddenly the wireless begins BEEPING -- it s so loud and 
    startling that they all jump back.

                  Frak!  Turn that thing down!

  Tyrol quickly works and the BEEPING gets much quieter.

  The words mean everything to the three men standing in the
