      EXT. FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

      We PUSH past the putting greens, past the perfectly-manicured 
      grounds, past the monied MEMBERS and GUESTS mingling on the 
      patio under a banner that reads --  ANNUAL LABOR DAY BARBECUE. 

      This is Firmwood, an exclusive country club located amongst 
      the monied estates of Westchester, New York, just north of 
      New York City, where many of our most successful CEOS -- and 
      CEOs to-be -- live, work and play.

      Amidst the snippets of dialogue --  No, the insider trading 
      charges were dropped,   She was a wonderful nanny until she 
      was deported,   I have the X3 and the X5.  One day I hope to 
      get the X7.  -- we HEAR something slightly more interesting -- 
      the SOUNDS of SEX.  And we re --

      INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - FIRMWOOD - CONTINUOUS

      A COUPLE is engaged in passionate love-making.  DUNCAN, early 
      40s and dapper, has LISBETH, also early 40s but with the 
        surgically-enhanced attributes of a woman half her age -- 
      pinned amidst a row of brooms.

                                    LISBETH
                    Do you think they re going to hear 
                    us?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Only if we keep doing it right...

      Another beat of lovemaking.  We re not quite sure who this 
      pair of lovers is until...

                                    LISBETH 
                    Oh...I forgot to mention -- you re 
                    behind on your child support.

      Duncan acknowledges his ex-wife with a simple  mmm,  not 
      wanting to distract himself from the sex.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    And you need to talk to our 
                    daughter.  She dropped out of 
                    school last week.

      Duncan looks at her.  Lisbeth nods.  But he stays focused on 
      the task at hand.  And Lisbeth seems to be enjoying it too.                                                                                      2.



                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    God.  If we did it like this when 
                    we were married, we might still be 
                    married.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Or just very, very tired.

      As Duncan continues to perform, we FREEZE FRAME over him.  
      The screen reads -- 

      DUNCAN COLLINSWORTH, CEO REV-NET COSMETICS.

      CLOSE ON A DIAMOND NECKLACE.  WIDEN TO REVEAL we re --

      INT. OAK ROOM - FIRMWOOD

      The necklace rests in the hand of WALTER STORRS, late 50s and 
      craggily handsome.  Walter is the CEO of AMERIMART 
      INDUSTRIES.  As he admires it, the door pushes open and

      JAMES AUSTER, 35, enters.  James is our moral center, 
      handsome with an easy charm that makes him instantly 
      likeable.  As he enters, Walter fumbles the necklace.  It 
      falls to the floor.  James moves to pick it up.

                                  JAMES
                    Let me get that...

      He notes the INSCRIPTION --  TO MY ONLY LOVE...  as he hands 
      it back to Walter.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                          (re: the necklace)
                    Your wife is a very lucky woman, 
                    sir.

      Walter says nothing.  He simply slips the necklace back into 
      its BLACK CASE.  Then he motions for James to sit across from 
      him in one of the leather club chairs.

                                  WALTER
                    Thanks for meeting me, James.  So 
                    tell me -- how long have you been a 
                    member of Firmwood?

                                  JAMES
                    Since the promotion. And thank you 
                    for that, by the way.                                                                                      3.



                                  WALTER
                    Well, I hope it won t be awkward.  
                    Running into each other here.

                                  JAMES
                    Why would it be awkward?  We see 
                    each other at the office every day.

                                  WALTER
                    Because I m letting you go 
                    tomorrow.

      James is stunned.  Off his look...

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Stock price is down.  The Street is 
                    rumbling.  Nothing turns things 
                    around like a good shake-up.

                                  JAMES
                    And you re so sure the Board will 
                    allow it?

                                  WALTER
                    The Board doesn t know yet.  No one 
                    does.  But when I present my 
                      reorganization plan to the 
                      stockholders tomorrow, they won t 
                    have any choice.  
                          (beat)
                    You ll land on your feet, James.  I 
                    know you will. You re a survivor.  
                    That s why I hired you in the first 
                    place.

      James shakes his head in disbelief.  Walter stands to leave, 
      then turns back.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    And since you re new to Firmwood, 
                    make sure you try the shrimp -- 
                    it s one of life s true pleasures.

      And with that, the CEO is gone.  James remains, shell-
      shocked, his professional life flashing before his eyes.  A 
      moment ago, the shining future of AmeriMart and now...nearly 
      unemployed.  We FREEZE FRAME over him as the screen reads --

      INT. HALLWAY - FIRMWOOD

      In a secluded corner off the main dining room, we FIND KARL, 
      late 30s with a sweet, round face -- as he talks in hushed 
      tones into his cell phone.

                                  KARL
                          (into phone)
                    I m sorry, sweetie.  But after the 
                    barbecue, I need to get right to 
                    the office.  No, I told you -- it s 
                    a crisis.  Distribution mixed up 
                    our shipments of Viagra and 
                    chewable vitamins.  Boys all over 
                    the Midwest are getting spontaneous 
                      erections.

      Karl is clearly not pleased with himself. Or his lies.

                                  KARL (CONT D)
                    So don t wait up, okay?
                          (he listens, then)
                    French toast for breakfast sounds 
                    great.

      Karl hangs up.  His face sinks, instantly drained.

                                  KARL (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                      God...this is the first and last 
                    time I m having an affair.

      We FREEZE FRAME over him as the screen reads -- 

      KARL MIXWORTHY, CEO FLEXOR-WELLMAN PHARMACEUTICALS.

                                                                            SMASH TO

      INT. DINING ROOM - FIRMWOOD

      ON THE BUFFET LINE, as an OVERWEIGHT CLUB MEMBER piles a heap 
      of food onto his plate.  

      DOWN THE LINE, we find BRODY -- 35, edgy, handsome -- as he 
      watches the glutton and mutters to himself --

                                  BRODY
                          (under his breath)
                    Jesus, hasn t he ever heard of 
                    seconds?  I mean, how about this 
                    concept -- two trips.                                                                                      5.



      The Overweight Guy pads off with his food, as Brody moves 
      down the line.  But as he does, he realizes that one of the 
      trays is EMPTY.  Brody looks instantly concerned.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    Where s the shrimp, Hector?

      HECTOR -- in his serving whites -- looks up from behind the 
      buffet.  Mexican accent.

                                  HECTOR
                    I m sorry, Mr. Brody. We re out of 
                    the shrimps.

      Brody stares at him.

                                  BRODY
                    What do you mean, you re out of the 
                    shrimp?  People wait the whole year 
                    for that shrimp.

                                  HECTOR
                    Yes. But --

      Brody gets increasingly animated, although he does his best 
      to keep his voice down.  Clearly, a nerve has been touched.

                                  BRODY
                          (worked up)
                    I mean, how do you explain to 
                    someone that the dish they ve 
                    looked forward to for twelve months 
                    isn t available because Fattie over 
                    there built the goddamn Mayan 
                    pyramids out of shellfish?

      Hector looks knowingly at Brody.

                                  HECTOR
                    The shrimps.  They re for your 
                    wife, Mr. Brody?

                                  BRODY
                    First of all, they re shrimp.  Not 
                    shrimps, okay?  No  s  even when 
                    plural.  Second of all, Brody is my 
                    first name, not my last.  And 
                    third...
                          (softening)
                    ...help a brother out?

      A beat, Hector smiles.  He gets it.                                                                                      6.



                                  HECTOR
                    There may be some left in the lower 
                    kitchen.  I ll have them run it 
                    down to the pool at once.

      Brody smiles.  Relieved and appreciative.  Instantly, his 
      cell phone buzzes.  He answers it with a smile.

                                  BRODY
                          (confidently)
                    Hi, honey.  The shrimp is on the 
                    way.

      Duncan and a deeply-conflicted Karl share a table.

                          (full of anxiety)
                    I m just not the affair-type.  I 
                    mean, my lies -- they re inane.  
                    How Wendy doesn t see through 
                    them...

                                  DUNCAN
                    She trusts you.

                                  KARL
                          (guilt-ridden)
                    Great.  Remind me that I m cheating 
                    on the saint who plans my 
                      breakfasts in advance...

                                  DUNCAN
                    C mon, don t beat yourself up.  We 
                    all change.  Look at me -- I just 
                    finished banging my first wife in 
                    the broom closet.
                          (off Karl s look)
                    When we were married, she couldn t 
                    have been less interested in sex.  
                    But now that we re both single 
                    again, it s kind of like the 
                    perfect marriage.

                                  KARL
                    Maybe you should remarry her.                                                                                      7.



                                  DUNCAN
                    Right.  And then sex in the broom 
                    closet becomes  Don t touch me, I m 
                      exfoliating. 

      Karl nods, as Brody approaches.

                                  BRODY 
                    Sorry I m late.  Operation 
                    Shellfish took longer than I 
                    thought.
                          (beat)
                    Hey, has anyone seen James?

                                  KARL
                    No.  Not since he went to talk to 
                    his boss.

      On cue, we SMASH TO --

      EXT. LOUNGE - FIRMWOOD

      James emerges, still reeling from the turn of events.  He s 
      met by STACEY, 35, his beautiful, sympathetic wife.

                                  STACEY
                    There you are.  The guys were 
                    looking for you.

      James nods.  Stacey notes his preoccupation.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                          (concerned)
                    Hey, are you okay?  What did he 
                    want?

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                      Oh...nothing.  You know, work 
                    stuff.

                                  STACEY
                          (skeptical)
                     Work stuff?   Today?

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah, you know.  SEC poking around. 
                    Quarterly reports.  All that.
                          (off her look)
                      Listen...I m just gonna go find the 
                    guys.  And then I ll meet you and 
                    the kids for smores, okay?                                                                                      8.



      Stacey nods.  James gives her a kiss.  As he walks away, he 
      turns back to her -- 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    That dress still kills me, by the 
                    way.

      James exits.  Stacey watches him go, thinks.

      INT. MAIN DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      James sits with the guys -- Duncan, Brody and Karl.

                                  KARL
                    He fired you?

                                  JAMES
                    No one knows yet.  It won t be 
                    official until tomorrow.

                                  DUNCAN
                    He s threatened by you.  It s 
                    obvious.  You re younger, you re 
                      better-looking and -- worst of all -
                    - you have a hotter wife.

                                  BRODY
                      Absolutely.  Hot Wife Envy.  It s 
                      practically Darwin.  
                          (off James  look)
                    Every time he watched Mrs. CEO get 
                    out of the shower, you were one step 
                    closer to the unemployment line.

      James can t help but smile.  As he does, we HEAR --

      The SOUNDS OF SKIDDING WHEELS and a CRASH.  A WOMAN SCREAMS.

                                  KARL
                          (urgently)
                    Sounds like it s right out front.

      The guys stand and quickly make a bee-line towards the exit.

      EXT. FIRMWOOD - CONTINUOUS

      AN OVERTURNED GOLF CART spins its wheels, as nearby a SMALL 
      CROWD huddles around a STRICKEN MAN.

      James pushes through the crowd to see that the downed man is 
        none-other-than...the CEO who just fired him.                                                                                      9.



                                  JAMES
                          (exclaims)
                    OhmyGod.  My boss!

      Meanwhile Brody, just OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE of ONLOOKERS, looks 
      down to see an EMPTY PLATE and SHRIMP strewn across the 
      putting green.

                                  BRODY
                    OhmyGod.  My shrimp!

      Brody scurries to start collecting his wife s shrimp as James 
      pushes to his boss  side, loosens his shirt and presses his 
      fingers against his neck to check for a pulse. 

      But there s nothing. The impact of the crash has rendered the 
      CEO unconscious.  James turns to a CLUB WORKER.

                                  JAMES
                          (aloud)
                    Call 9-1-1.

      James tears open Walter s jacket -- the black JEWELRY CASE 
      falls out of the inner breast pocket.  He pulls open his 
      shirt, pounds on his chest and begins administering CPR.  

      As the onlookers -- including Karl and Duncan -- watch, James 
      furiously tries to breath life into the CEO.  But it s no 
      use.  James once again checks for a pulse.  But...nothing.  
      The CEO is, well, dead.

      James looks up at his friends with a grave look in his eyes.  
      Then, to the Club Worker...

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You can forget 9-1-1.  

      James exhales.  He takes off his jacket and gently lays it 
      over Walter s face.  And just then, Brody -- with his plate 
      of reclaimed shrimp -- sidles next to James.

                                  BRODY
                          (sotto)
                    I think things are suddenly looking 
                    up for you, huh, James?

      As Brody smiles at an unsure James, we...SMASH TO:

      MAIN TITLE CARD.

      We DISSOLVE to BLACK and then FADE UP ON --                                                                                    10.



      INT. BRODY S HOME GYM - (NEXT) DAY

      Brody runs on his treadmill, talks on his speaker-phone.

                                  BRODY
                    Maybe they should have had a sign.  
                     CAUTION: CEO CROSSING. 

      INT. JAMES  BEDROOM

      James ties his tie in the mirror, a phone cradled between his 
      shoulder and ear.  We INTERCUT between the pair.

                                  JAMES
                    It s touching to see how hard 
                    you re taking this.  But a man is 
                    dead and I may be unemployed.

                                  BRODY
                    Relax.  You said your boss didn t 
                    tell anyone.  And even if he did, I 
                    know a guy who got shit-canned 
                    once.  Kept coming into the office 
                    anyway.  Two months later he got 
                    promoted.  True story.

      James considers this.  Then..

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    Besides, I ve got real problems.  
                    Guess what the velociraptor wants 
                    now?

                                  JAMES
                    Why do you call your wife a 
                      velociraptor?

                                  BRODY
                    Because it s true.  I ve seen her 
                    birth certificate.
                          (beat)
                    She wants me to throw her a 
                    birthday party next weekend at 
                    Firmwood.  But she wants me to plan 
                    it.  As a way to show how much I 
                    care.  I said,  Sweetheart.  I 
                    didn t go to Harvard Business 
                    School to study goddamn party 
                      planning. 

                                  JAMES
                    You said that?                                                                                    11.



                                  BRODY
                    Of course not.  The woman tolerates 
                    no dissent.  It s like being 
                    married to Dick Cheney.

      Just then, Stacey enters, with their two adorable kids -- 
      SAMANTHA, aged 8 and DASHIELL, aged 6 -- in tow.  The kids 
      have their back-packs on.

                                  STACEY
                    Okay, guys.  Give Daddy a kiss.

      James grabs kisses from his kids, who ad lib  Bye Daddy  and 
       We love you,  etc.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                          (noticing the phone)
                    Sorry to interrupt.

                                  JAMES
                    No problem.  It s just Brody.

      INTERCUT Brody on the treadmill, as he rolls his eyes.

      The kids unpeel themselves from James and run off.  Before 
      Stacey exits, James looks at her.  Her eyes look red.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You okay, sweetie?   Your eyes are -
                    -  Have you been crying? 

                                  STACEY
                          (laughs)
                      Allergies.  Ran out of my Claritin.  
                    I ll see you later.  Remember... 
                    chili night.

      Stacey gives James a quick kiss and exits.

                                  BRODY
                    She s hot and she cooks.  I gotta 
                    be honest with you.  If you worked 
                    for me, I d can your ass too.

      INT. COUPLES  THERAPIST S OFFICE - DAY

      Karl and his wife, WENDY -- late 30s and plainly pretty -- 
      sit across from the dour couples  therapist, DR. DARLENE 
      SEAVER-FILNER.  Filled with guilt, Karl looks like he d 
      rather be anywhere else.                                                                                    12.



                                  WENDY
                    I mean, I must sound like a 
                      clich ...but sometimes I wonder if 
                    Karl is seeing someone else.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Are you, Karl?

                                  KARL
                    Yes.  My staff of twelve hundred 
                    employees who count on me each and 
                    every day.

                                  WENDY
                    It s ironic.  When I had a career 
                    and friends, Karl wanted more of 
                    me.  So I quit my job and stayed 
                    home and now he complains that I 
                    smother him.  
                          (then)
                    And we barely do anything together 
                    anymore.  Last week, I asked Karl 
                    to go to the movies.  To see  The 
                    Devil Wears Prada.   He said he had 
                    to work.  On a Sunday.

                                  KARL
                    I run a billion-dollar 
                      pharmaceutical conglomerate.  
                    People need anti-depressants on the 
                    weekends too.

      Wendy nods.  She s lost her fight.

                                  WENDY
                    Sometimes I just wish he could look 
                    at me like he used to.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Karl...as a gesture to Wendy, could 
                    you find the time to take her to 
                    the movies?  I think it could be a 
                    small but important step in 
                    repairing this marriage.  

      But Karl is distracted when he looks down at his cell phone, 
      as it reads  NEW TEXT MESSAGE RECEIVED 

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER (CONT D)
                      Karl...could you?

      ANGLE ON THE TEXT MESSAGE    I MISS YOUR PENIS.                                                                                     13.



      Karl is flustered.  Clearly it s from his mistress.  He puts 
      down the phone and looks up at the therapist.

                                  KARL
                          (at a loss)
                    I m sorry. You were saying...?

      Off Dr. Seaver-Filner s annoyed look, we re...

      INT. DUNCAN S OFFICE - DAY

      Duncan sits in his spacious office at RevNet, completing an 
      interview with LORI HODGE, an attractive 30-ish journalist.

                                  LORI
                    What s been your greatest triumph 
                    in building a cosmetics empire, Mr. 
                      Collinsworth?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Duncan.  And my father built it.  I 
                    just renovated.

                                  LORI
                          (checking her notes)
                    You re too modest.  Since you 
                    assumed the chairmanship eight 
                    years ago, you expanded into the 
                    global marketplace, increased your 
                    share price by over 200 percent and 
                    branded RevNet as the industry 
                    leader in personal grooming.  

                                  DUNCAN
                          (false modesty)
                      Oh...that.

                                  LORI
                    And I ll be honest, I won t leave 
                    the house without first applying 
                    your toner and blush.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Well I ll be honest, it s working.

      Lori smiles, flattered.  She closes her notebook, stands.

                                  LORI
                    That should about do it.  If all 
                    goes well, you ll be  Capitalist s  
                    cover boy in November.
                          (beat, stops herself)
                    But I do have one last question.                                                                                      14.



                                  DUNCAN
                    I m an open book.

                                  LORI
                    Do you spend much time in Roscoe, 
                    New York?

      Duncan is immediately flustered.  Clearly, she s struck a 
      nerve.  But he does his best to hide it.

                                  DUNCAN 
                     Roscoe, New York?   I don t 
                    underst --

                                  LORI
                    You see, there are rumors. Rumors 
                    that might interest your 
                      shareholders.  And what kind of 
                      journalist would I be if I didn t 
                    ask...?

                                  DUNCAN
                    I can assure you I ve never been to 
                    Roscoe, New York in my life.

                                  LORI
                          (smiles)
                    That s what I thought.  In any 
                    case, since your profile doesn t go 
                    to press for another six weeks, 
                    I ll have plenty of time to look 
                    into those rumors.  Nothing worse 
                    than a good man being tarred by the 
                    brush of innuendo.  Good day, 
                    Duncan.

      Lori exits.  

                                  DUNCAN
                          (under his breath)
                    Mr. Collinsworth.

      INT. AMERIMART CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      James walks tentatively down the hall.  As he passes oncoming 
      CO-WORKERS, he gauges their reactions, as if trying to 
      determine if he s still employed here.  

      As he reaches his outer office, his ASSISTANT steps in behind 
      him --

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Mr. Auster.                                                                                    15.



                                  JAMES
                          (dreading)
                    Yes?

                                  ASSISTANT
                      Accounting is waiting for you in 
                    the conference room. 

                                  JAMES
                          (hiding his relief)
                    Of course.  Tell them I ll be right 
                    in.

      James enters his office...

      INT. JAMES  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      ...closes the door behind him and exhales.  Apparently, he s 
      still employed.  After a beat of relief, KATIE GRAHAM -- mid-
      30s and attractive -- swivels around in James desk chair.  

                                  KATIE
                     Death by golf cart,  huh?  I 
                    thought the Old Man was going to 
                    outlive us all.

                                  JAMES
                    Make yourself at home, by the way.

      Katie smiles.  The pair couldn t be closer.  In fact, around 
      AmeriMart, she s referred to as James   work wife. 

                                  KATIE
                    Rumor is that the front-runner for 
                    the CEO job is that jerk from GE 
                    who hit on me at the Sun Valley 
                      conference.

                                  JAMES
                    Wait a sec.  Didn t you go on a 
                    date with that guy?

                                  KATIE
                    Hey, I m a single woman over 
                    thirty.  If I only went out with 
                    sweet, polite men, I d be dating 
                    the guy who collects shopping carts 
                    outside my supermarket.                                                                                    16.



                                  JAMES
                          (smiles)
                      C mon...let s not keep Accounting 
                    waiting.  They re the guys who 
                    calculate our bonuses.

      As Katie and James begin to exit, the CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
      enters the room.  

                                  CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
                    Good, you re both here.  I d like 
                    to speak with you...

      Off James  and Katie s looks, we re...

      EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRMWOOD

      The guys are golfing.  Karl -- complete with a fanny-pack 
      around his middle -- tees off.  Brody and James stand nearby 
      in the khakis and golf shirts.  Leaning on their drivers, as 
      they await their turns.

                                  JAMES
                    So not only am I still employed, 
                    but they ve decided to promote from 
                    within.  They re interviewing every 
                      upper-level exec for the CEO s job.  
                    Including me.

      Karl slices the ball unsettling close to the other guys.  
      They duck for cover.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Jesus, Karl.  What end of the club 
                    are you using?

                                  KARL
                    Sorry.  My instructor says that 
                    sometimes I break my wrists too 
                    soon.

                                  BRODY
                    No, Tiger Woods sometimes breaks 
                    his wrists too soon.  You just 
                    suck.

      James laughs.  Karl takes another ball out of his fanny pack 
      and tees it up.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    You re gonna get it, aren t you?
                          (off James  unsure look)
                    You re gonna be a CEO at 35.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    And I ll still be a senior VP.  And 
                    I ll be honest with you -- that s 
                    gonna be a real blow to my self-
                    esteem.  So you know what?  As a 
                      friend...I d appreciate if you tank 
                    the interview.  For me.

      James laughs.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (stares at him)
                    What part of that do you think 
                    wasn t serious?

      Just then, Duncan flies up in a golf cart.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (to Duncan)
                    You re late.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (serious)
                    I got trouble.

      EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER

      The cart is parked at the mid-way break.  The guys sit at a 
      secluded table, as Duncan recounts his troubles.

                                  JAMES
                    Wait a second.  I thought you said 
                    you were arrested for a DWI.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (shakes his head)
                    No.  That was just my cover.  For 
                    why I needed bail money.

                                  KARL
                          (hurt)
                    You lied to us?

                                  BRODY
                    Karl, we re guys.  If it involves 
                    sex, money or a pending criminal 
                      proceeding...we re allowed to lie.

                                  JAMES 
                          (to Duncan)
                    So I don t get it...then what 
                    happened in Roscoe, New York?

      Duncan exhales, as the guys await his explanation.                                                                                    18.



                                  DUNCAN
                    I was coming home from a hunting 
                    trip...

                                  BRODY
                    You don t hunt!

                                  DUNCAN
                          (edgy)
                    Fine, I was antiquing.  Can we 
                    stick to the subject here?

      The guys nod.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    I was getting tired, so I pulled 
                    into a rest stop for some coffee.  
                    To keep me awake for the drive 
                    home.  There was a woman there.  
                    Dark and beautiful.  She smiled at 
                    me and we began to talk...

                                  JAMES
                    Don t tell me.  She was a pro.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (nods)
                    I was lonely.  And one thing led to 
                    another and before I knew it, we 
                    were in a men s room stall for a 
                    little business transaction.

                                  BRODY
                          (blanches)
                    Why do I feel dirty?

                                  DUNCAN
                    But in the midst of our... 
                      transaction, a State Trooper 
                    stumbled in.  Arrested both of us.

      Brody looks at Duncan.

                                  BRODY
                    Okay, so you got pinched for 
                      solicitation.  Maybe not something 
                    you want on the resume, but it 
                    could have been a lot worse --

                                  DUNCAN
                    Let me finish.

      The guys look at him expectantly.                                                                                    19.



                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    This dark, beautiful woman.  
                      Well...she was full of surprises.  
                    And probably the biggest surprise 
                    was, well...her penis.

      The guys all let out spontaneous  eeewwws. 

                                  BRODY
                          (repulsed)
                    You got a hummer from a 
                      transvestite hooker?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (defensively)
                    I told you, I didn t know.  How do 
                    you think I felt?  I mean, you 
                    should have seen her.  Every inch 
                    of her was woman.

                                  BRODY
                    Except the eight-and-a-half between 
                    her legs.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (bristles)
                    Nice.  Very supportive...

                                  BRODY
                    No...just personal preference.  
                    When it comes to chicks, I m not 
                    what you call a  penis man.   I 
                    like my ladies sans shvantz, if you 
                    know what I mean.

      James steps in.

                                  JAMES
                    Look, let s focus here.  If this 
                      journalist gets corroboration...it 
                    could sink RevNet s stock price.  
                    Not to mention cost Duncan his job.

                                  BRODY
                          (getting on board)
                    Alright, well you ve come to the 
                    right guy.  This is what crisis 
                      management is all about.  So...did 
                    you pull the arrest report?                                                                                    20.



                                  DUNCAN
                    Of course.  And I greased the palms 
                    of every state trooper in a ten-
                    mile radius.  So they wouldn t 
                    talk...

                                  BRODY
                    Good.  That s good.

                                  KARL
                    First year law school -- if there s 
                    no corroborating witness, then it s 
                    all hearsay until someone gets a 
                    hold of the tranny.

                                  BRODY
                    Exactly.  Which is why you need to 
                    get to him -- or her -- first.  And 
                    figure out a way to keep her -- or 
                    him -- quiet.  And you re home free.  
                    This reporter can t touch you.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (a mission statement)
                    Track down the tranny.

                                  BRODY
                          (concurs)
                    Track down the tranny.

      As Duncan considers the task at hand, we re --

      CLOSE ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE CEO IN TRANQUIL REPOSE.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he s in his coffin and we re --

      INT. OAK ROOM - FIRMWOOD - NIGHT

      The Wake is in progress.  MOURNERS file past the deceased 
      CEO s body to pay their respects. But since it s an Irish 
      wake, the alcohol is flowing.  The room is crowded with 
      EMPLOYEES AND FRIENDS including Stacey (James  wife), Katie 
      (James   work wife ) and our four guys.

      ANGLE ON BRODY AND KARL.  Brody shakes his head, displeased.

                                  KARL
                    What s wrong?

                                  BRODY
                    This is the same room I reserved 
                    for Janelle s party this weekend.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                  BRODY (CONT'D)
                    Christ, if she smells formaldehyde, 
                    I m a dead man.

      ANGLE on James, as he approaches the CEO S WIDOW, a sturdy 
      woman in her late 50s.

                                  JAMES
                          (to the Widow, introducing 
                            himself)
                    Mrs. Storrs?  James Auster.  From 
                      AmeriMart.  I m very sorry for your 
                    loss.

                                  WIDOW
                          (cynically)
                    That makes one of us.

      James looks unsurely at her, then reaches into his breast 
      pocket and takes out the BLACK JEWELRY CASE that was on the 
      CEO s body at the time of his death.  He hands it to her.

                                  JAMES 
                    I think this belongs to you.  They 
                    left it behind at the scene.

      The Widow opens the case but -- it s EMPTY.  James is 
      surprised.  But a wry, knowing grin forms on her face. 

                                  WIDOW
                      Apparently he found someone more 
                    deserving than me.
                          (beat)
                    Excuse me.  

      The Widow moves off.  James -- a  little stunned -- moves 
      towards Katie.

                                  JAMES
                          (to Katie)
                    Probably bad etiquette to gossip at a 
                    wake, but the necklace -- not for the 
                    loyal wife.  For the other woman.

                                  KATIE
                          (eyes widen)
                    Okay.  And suddenly, things got a 
                    little more interesting...

                                  JAMES
                    He must have given her the necklace 
                    right before he died.

                                  KATIE
                    That sonfabitch.                                                                                    22.



                                  JAMES
                    I know...

                                  KATIE
                    Guy s worth forty million and not 
                    even a sniff in my direction.

      James smiles.  Katie notices that Stacey is sobbing quietly 
      to herself as she takes in the body.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                          (re: Stacey)
                    She okay?

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah, you know Stacey. She takes 
                    things hard.  I mean, when our 
                    springer spaniel died, she was a 
                    mess for --

      But James words trail off as Stacey turns away from the 
      coffin.  Around her neck is the VERY SAME DIAMOND NECKLACE 
      that we saw earlier.  James stares at it.  His face ashen.

                                  KATIE
                    You okay?
                          (no answer)
                    James?

      James can t even hear Katie.  His eyes simply bore into the 
      necklace around his wife s neck.  The love of his life was 
      apparently the love of another man s too.  

      Katie studies the pain in James  face, as if trying to 
      understand it.  But she doesn t and he doesn t bother to 
      explain.  He bolts from the room.  Pushes through the crowd 
      and out the door.  As Katie watches in concern, we...

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    23.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. MEN S ROOM - FIRMWOOD

      James -- reeling from the discovery that his wife has been 
      having an affair with his dead boss -- splashes water on his 
      face as he stares at himself in the mirror, as if searching 
      for the wounds that he feels so deeply.  

      A beat, and Duncan emerges from one of the stalls.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hey, James.

                                  JAMES
                          (half-hearted)
                    Dunc.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Nice wake.  Though the cash bar is 
                    a little tacky.

      James doesn t react.  He s lost in his own thoughts.  Duncan 
      notes James  preoccupation.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                    Yeah.  Just got a call from an old 
                    friend of mine.  He, uh, just found 
                    out his wife was having an affair.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (smiles)
                    Rite of passage for men.  Loss of 
                      virginity, first threesome, 
                    discovery of cheating wife.  The 
                    holy trinity.

                                  JAMES
                    You, too?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (nods)
                    My second wife.  After Lisbeth.  Of 
                    course, I encouraged her to do it.  
                    Spice things up.

      James nods. Preoccupied.  Duncan studies him for a moment.  
      Then, in a somewhat knowing way...                                                                                    24.



                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Your friend.  How s he doing?

                                  JAMES
                    Trying to breathe.  He s not asking 
                    much more of himself than that.

      Duncan nods.  He doesn t press the issue.  Then...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Alright, well I d better run.  Off 
                    to have lunch with a woman who 
                    hates me.

                                  JAMES
                    Your ex?

                                  DUNCAN
                    No. My daughter.

      And on that, we SMASH TO --

      INT. RESTAURANT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

      Duncan sits across from his daughter, CAMERON, a beautiful 
      and belligerent 19-year old.  He s in mid-story.

                                  DUNCAN
                    ...it must have been your seventh -- 
                    no eighth -- birthday. And the look 
                    on your face when the clown showed 
                    up at your party.  Sheer terror.  
                    I ll never forget that look.

      Duncan laughs.  Cameron isn t amused.

                                    CAMERON
                    For the record, it was my fifth 
                    birthday, Duncan.  And the reason I 
                    remember is because it s the last 
                    one you came to.

      The waitress sets down another scotch before Duncan.  Cameron 
      raises an eyebrow.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                          (re: his drink)
                    That s your third, you know.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I didn t know you were keeping 
                    score.                                                                                    25.



                                    CAMERON
                          (wry)
                    I didn t know you needed to get 
                    loaded to face your daughter.

                                  DUNCAN
                    You should try facing her.  You d 
                    get loaded, too.

      Cameron rolls her eyes.

                                    CAMERON
                    Look, the stroll down memory lane 
                    is touching, but I told you -- I m 
                    not going back to school.  I mean, 
                    your life turned out fine without a 
                    degree.  Professionally, at least.  

                                  DUNCAN
                          (ignoring the slight)
                    Fine with me, Cam.  I m just 
                    curious what your plan is.

                                    CAMERON
                     My plan?   I m gonna work, Duncan. 
                    Find a job.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Dad, okay?  Call me Dad, please.

                                    CAMERON
                    Dad was the guy who raised me since 
                    I was eight and died from a stroke 
                    last year.  You re biology, Duncan.  
                    That s it.
                          (beat)
                    And you don t need to worry about 
                    me, okay? I m bright.  I give good 
                    meeting.  I ll find something.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Really?  What s the market out 
                    there for over-entitled 19-year-
                    olds with smart mouths?

      Cameron stands, starts to collect her things.  Duncan looks 
        disappointed that he let himself take the bait.

                                    CAMERON
                    This has been fun. In a really  not 
                    fun  kind of way.  So do me a 
                    favor, the next time you want to 
                    pass judgement?  Send an e-mail.                                                                                    26.



                                  DUNCAN 
                    What?  You can reduce me to DNA.  
                    But God forbid I open my mouth to 
                    you...
                          (then)
                    Look, sit down, okay?  Whatever you 
                    think of me, I m still your father.

                                    CAMERON
                    Okay, Duncan. You want to act like 
                    my father?  Then step up to the 
                    plate.  Prove it.

                                  DUNCAN
                    How?

                                    CAMERON
                    Give me a job.

      Off Duncan s surprised look, we re...

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      CLOSE on KARL, with a wide smile on his face.  After a beat, 
      we WIDEN to REVEAL that he s not alone.  Lying next to him on 
      the hotel bed is MARLA, Karl s mistress, a high-strung 
      Southern beauty in her late 20s.

                                  KARL
                    I think I should get you in touch 
                    with my Trademarks department.  There 
                    are some things you just did that we 
                    might want to get a patent on.

      Marla smiles, nestles close.

                                  MARLA
                    I m glad I make you happy.  You 
                    deserve it.
                          (beat, then)
                    Can I ask you a question, Karl?  
                    You and your wife...do you still 
                    sleep together?

                                  KARL
                    No, I told you.  Not in months.  
                    And honestly, after being with you, 
                    I m not sure we were even doing it 
                    right to begin with.

                                  MARLA
                    But you still do other things with 
                    her, right?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  MARLA (CONT'D)
                    And I love you so much I want to do 
                    those things with you, too.

                                  KARL
                    The truth is -- there s only one 
                    thing we do together anymore.  
                    Couples  therapy.  Two mornings a 
                    week.

                                  MARLA
                    Couples  therapy.
                          (Karl nods)
                    Then that s what I want to do with 
                    you.

                                  KARL
                          (huh?)
                    But we re not even married.  Plus 
                    we get along great.  We don t need 
                    couples  therapy.

      Marla cheeks redden as her face turns pouty.

                                  MARLA
                          (not happy)
                    Oh, I see how this works.  I do 
                    things to you that you ve 
                      fantasized about since junior high 
                    school.  But the second I ask for 
                    one tiny thing...
                          (then, threatening)
                    Let me ask you.  How are you gonna 
                    like having to call your wife the 
                    next time you feel horny, Karl?

      Off Karl s fearful look, we SMASH TO --

      INT. COUPLES  THERAPIST S OFFICE - DAY

      TIGHT ON MARLA, who dabs at her eyes and sniffles --

                                  MARLA
                    I m not afraid of the hard work, 
                    Doctor.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Marla and Karl sitting across from the bemused 
      couples  therapist, Dr. Seaver-Filner, who turns to Karl.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Um, Mr. Mixworthy?  A word.

      Karl and Dr. Seaver-Filner huddle off to the side, out of 
      Marla s earshot.                                                                                    28.



                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    This is highly unorthodox.

      Karl motions to Marla.

                                  KARL
                    Look at her. She s an interior 
                    designer by trade.  But you know 
                    what her real skill is?  Making an 
                      overweight, balding, insecure man 
                    feel like a porn star.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    That s touching but --

                                  KARL
                    And I ll double your fee.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Done.  My contractor is bleeding me 
                    dry.

      Dr. Seaver-Filner returns to her chair and Karl slides back 
      in next to Marla.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER (CONT D)
                    So... where were we?

                                  MARLA
                          (emotionally)
                    My father.  He could be so cold...

      Marla sniffles and dabs at her red eyes.  As Karl forces a 
      smile, we re...

      INT. BRODY S CAR - MOVING

      Brody drives, his cell pasted to his ear.  Duncan sits in the 
      passenger seat, as they speed down the New York State Thruway 
      on their mission to track down Duncan s tranny.

                                  BRODY
                          (into phone, upbeat)
                    Okay.  No...not a problem.  Don t 
                    worry, sweetie. Consider it done.

      Brody hangs up the phone.  Instantly, he sours.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    I have an MBA, an S-Class and can 
                    run a six-minute mile.  And you 
                    know how she judges me as a man?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    If I can fly in her favorite 
                    dessert from this little patisserie 
                    on the Left Bank in time for her 
                    party this weekend.

                                  DUNCAN
                     Til death do you part.   Sometimes 
                    it sounds like a real threat, 
                    doesn t it?

                                  BRODY
                          (shakes his head)
                    Christ, how the hell am I gonna get 
                    500 Napoleons here by Saturday?

      As Brody s car fires down the Thruway...

      EXT. HIGHWAY REST STOP - ROSCOE, NY - LATER

      Brody s S-Class pulls off the service road and into the rest 
      stop adjacent to the New York State Thruway.  When the car 
      slows to a stop, Duncan and Brody emerge.

                                  BRODY
                    Classy spot.  I can see how those 
                    vending machines might really put a 
                    guy in the mood.

      The guys peer around.  Looking for the tranny.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (to Duncan, re: the 
                            tranny)
                    So you re sure she s going to be 
                    here?

                                  DUNCAN
                      I remember she told me this was her 
                    regular spot.  That her pimp had 
                    just promoted her.

                                  BRODY
                    She got promoted to this?  Where 
                    was she working before, a 
                      slaughterhouse?
                          (beat)
                    By the way, you never told me her 
                    name...

                                  DUNCAN
                      Dontrelle.

      Brody stops, looks incredulously at Duncan.                                                                                    30.


                                  BRODY
                          (stunned)
                    You hooked up with someone named 
                    Dontrelle and you didn t think it 
                    MIGHT be a dude?  He sounds like a 
                    middle linebacker.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (defensively)
                    She said  Dontrelle  was a family 
                    name.  Besides, I told you it was 
                    dark.

                                  BRODY
                    Yeah.  Because Dontrelle probably 
                    went 6 4 , 220 and blocked out the 
                    sun.

      Duncan chooses not to respond.  Then he spots a PROSTITUTE 
      loitering by the vending machines.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hold on.  There s someone...

      Brody and Duncan approach the hooker.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Hey...

                                  HOOKER
                    Hey, yourself.  You boys looking 
                    for a good time?

                                  BRODY
                    No.  I m married. I m done with 
                    good times.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Actually, we re looking for 
                      Dontrelle.

                                  HOOKER
                    Dontrelle doesn t work Exit 47 
                    anymore.

                                  BRODY
                    Another promotion perhaps.

      Duncan shoots Brody a look.  Not helping.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (to the Hooker)
                    Do you know where I could find, um, 
                    her?                                                                                    31.



                                  HOOKER
                      No...sorry.  Can t help you.

      Duncan pulls out his bill-fold and peels off a couple of 
      TWENTIES.  He hands them to the hooker.

                                  HOOKER (CONT D)
                    You know, now that I think about 
                    it, I might be able to track 
                    Dontrelle down through an old john 
                    I know.

      Duncan jots his phone number on a piece of paper and hands it 
      to the hooker.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Tell her to call me at that number.  
                    And tell her it s important.

                                  HOOKER
                    She was that good, huh?

                                  BRODY
                    Let s just say -- when it comes to 
                    sex, she s the man.

      As Duncan shakes his head, we re --


      EXT. JAMES  HOUSE - NIGHT

      James sits alone on his back porch, overlooking his pool and 
      spacious backyard.  He nurses a beer and thinks.  After a 
      moment, Stacey emerges.

                                  STACEY
                    The kids are asleep.  Florie said 
                    they were angels.

      James says nothing.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                    I m pretty tired myself.  I think 
                    I m going to head up and --

                                  JAMES
                          (interrupting)
                    The first time I saw you.  Freshman 
                    year at Madison.  Econ 101.  

                                  STACEY
                          (laughs unsurely)
                    What s this about?                                                                                    32.



                                  JAMES
                            (continuing)
                    You walked in -- I was already 
                    there, of course, because I arrived 
                      everywhere 15 minutes early 
                    freshman year -- and I thought to 
                    myself that if I could sit across 
                    from that girl and have a cup of 
                      coffee...that my life would be 
                    perfect.

                                  STACEY
                    You got more than a cup of coffee.

                                  JAMES
                    I know.  But my life isn t perfect.

      Stacey looks at him unsurely.

                                  STACEY
                    What s wrong?  Are you nervous 
                    about your interview tomorrow?

                                  JAMES
                    No, I was just thinking about 
                    seeing you that first time.  And 
                    wondering if my boss felt the same 
                    way.  The first time he saw you.

      Stacey stares at him.  But does her best to betray nothing.

                                  STACEY
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JAMES
                    You...you were sleeping with him.  
                    He gave you that necklace before he 
                    died, didn t he? 

      Stacey reflexively clutches at her necklace.

                                  STACEY
                    Jamey...

                                  JAMES
                    Don t call me that, okay?  Don t 
                    talk to me like you love me.

                                  STACEY
                    But I do love you...                                                                                    33.



                                  JAMES
                    Answer me.  Were you having an 
                    affair with him?  And I ll respect 
                    you a helluva lot more if you tell 
                    me the truth.
                          (beat, then forceful)
                    Stacey.  Answer me!

      A long beat, then...

                                  STACEY
                    Yes.

      James nods.  His worst fears confirmed.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                          (gently)
                    At least you can t say I m a liar.

                                  JAMES
                    No, I am. Because I don t respect 
                    you one bit.

      James walks past her.  As he does, she clutches at his arm.  
      But he pulls away.

                                  STACEY
                    Wait.  Where are you going?  Jamey?  
                    Let s talk about this.  James... 
                    don t walk out on me.

      He stops, stares at her.

                                  JAMES
                    I may be leaving.  But I m not the 
                    one who walked out.

      James walks past her and down the driveway.

                                  STACEY 
                          (calling after him)
                    James.  Wait.  James!

      We HEAR his car start and peel off.  He s gone.  As tears run 
      down Stacey s face, we SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    34.


                                      ACT THREE

      INT. JAMES  OFFICE - NEXT DAY

      CLOSE ON A FRAMED PICTURE OF JAMES AND STACEY.  Happy, 
      carefree.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL James sitting at his desk.  He looks every 
      bit the man whose whole world has been turned upside down. 
      Barely slept.  Unshaven, no tie.  Although a few tie options 
      rest on his desk.  He can t help but stare at the picture.

      Just then, Katie enters.  Stylish and confident in her sleek 
      Prada suit.  She takes him in.

                                  KATIE
                    Jesus... look at you.  I can t 
                    believe I need to tell you this, 
                    but today s the wrong day not to 
                    bring your  A-game. 

                                  JAMES 
                    How do you know that my  A-game  
                    doesn t include making you think 
                    I m not bringing my  A-game? 

      Katie considers this.  Then...

                                  KATIE
                    By the way, why d you run out of 
                    the wake like that?  You didn t 
                    even say goodbye.

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                    Stomach thing, sorry.

      Katie looks at him as if trying to determine if he s telling 
      the truth.  Just then, James  assistant pokes her head in.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Ms. Graham, the Board is ready for 
                    you now.

                                  KATIE
                    I ll be right in.

      Katie turns to James.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    You know, you may be my best friend 
                    but I want this job.  And except 
                    for men, I m pretty good at getting 
                    what I want.                                                                                    35.



      James nods.  Then Katie takes him in -- in all his pitiful 
      glory.  She can t help herself...

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    Oh, Jeez.  C mere...  

      Katie straightens James  collar.  Smooths his hair.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    And wear the blue tie.  It looks 
                    great on you.

      And she s gone.  James smiles to himself.  Then as he looks 
      back at the picture, the smile runs from his face.

      INT. REV-NET CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

      Duncan holds court, as he stands before his upper-level 
      management that sit around the conference room table.

                                  DUNCAN
                    It s nice to be able to talk about 
                    all the things that went right for 
                    us this year.  Market share is up.  
                    The fall campaign has cemented our 
                    brand recognition. We re the 
                    darlings of Wall Street.  

      As Duncan talks, Cameron quietly enters with a TRAY OF TO-GO 
      COFFEES.  She hands the execs their espressos and macchiatos 
      as Duncan continues to speak.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    But even in success, RevNet must be 
                    a leader, not a follower.  Did you 
                    know that by the year 2015, the 
                    most rapidly expanding population 
                    group will be women over sixty?   
                    Why not take the opportunity to 
                    target this growing demographic?  
                    Why not make these women feel 
                    beautiful too? 

      The execs nod and murmur  yes  as Duncan continues.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Why shouldn t women in nursing 
                    homes not have access to the best 
                      foundation and base available?  Why 
                    not market a line of hair products 
                      specifically for wigs?  Or --                                                                                    36.



                                    CAMERON
                          (interrupting)
                    Actually, I think the way to reach 
                    seniors would be to appeal to the 
                    girl in them.  Not the old woman.

      All eyes turn to Cameron.  Duncan boils.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Excuse me?

                                    CAMERON
                    C mon, Duncan.  Everyone knows 
                    women don t like to think of 
                      themselves as old.  The exception 
                    being your last three teenage 
                      girlfriends, of course.

      The other execs shrink in their seats, wishing they were 
      anywhere else.  As Duncan seethes, we...SMASH TO --

      INT. COPY ROOM - REV-NET - LATER

      A livid Duncan dresses down Cameron.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (pissed)
                    I gave you a job.  I gave you 
                      responsibility --

                                    CAMERON
                    Yeah.  To go to Starbucks. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    That s not the point.  Do you know 
                    what my father would have done if 
                    I d ever embarrassed him like that?

                                    CAMERON
                    Gotten drunk and made a pass at the 
                    maid?  Or was that just on 
                      Christmas?

      Duncan shakes his head. Exasperated.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you want this job, Cam?
                          (no answer)
                    Cam?

                                    CAMERON
                            (grudgingly)
                    Yeah.                                                                                    37.



                                  DUNCAN
                    Then you need to shut your mouth 
                    and prove you belong here.

      Duncan takes in the messy, disorganized copy room. 

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    I want the copy room in shape.  By 
                    Monday morning.  Or --

                                    CAMERON
                    Or what?

                                   DUNCAN
                    I guess you ll find that out Monday 
                    morning.

      Duncan exits.  Cameron looks around, taking in the massive 
      job that lays ahead of her and exhales.

      INT. AMERIMART BOARD ROOM - DAY

      James, wearing his blue tie, sits across from the BOARD 
      MEMBERS.  He s mid-interview. But preoccupied with recent 
      events, he s just not himself.  Not even close.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1
                    ...so what would you do differently 
                    if you were AmeriMart's CEO?  

      James is lost in thought.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1 (CONT D)
                    Mr. Auster?

                                  JAMES
                    Hot in here, isn t it?  

      He unbuttons his top shirt button, loosens his tie.  Again, 
      the Board Members exchange looks.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1
                    Mr. Auster, are you feeling okay?

                                  JAMES
                    No.  But thanks for asking.  
                          (then, pulling at his 
                            collar)
                    Man, it s like a greenhouse in 
                    here.  If you re not careful, the 
                    embalming fluid might start leaking 
                    out of some of you.                                                                                    38.



      He takes a drink of water, as the Board Members exchange 
      curious looks.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1 
                    Mr. Auster, are you serious about 
                    being considered for the CEO s job?  

                                  JAMES
                    Yes, sir.  I love this company.  
                    And trust me, I know what it s like 
                    to lose something you love.  And 
                    we re on the brink of losing this 
                    place.  Walter Storrs knew we were 
                    in trouble when he died. 

                                  BOARD MEMBER #3
                          (combative)
                    AmeriMart is one of the most 
                      influential corporations of our 
                    time.

                                  JAMES
                    And the Romans kicked ass in 100 
                    BC, but what have they done since?  
                    Nothing s permanent, gentleman.  
                    Trust me on that.

      Clearly the Board isn t into James  style.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1
                          (dismissing him)
                    Thank you for your time, Mr. 
                    Auster.  But we have other 
                      candidates waiting.  

                                  BOARD MEMBER #2
                    Serious candidates.

      James stands.  Faces the Board.  Passionately.

                                  JAMES
                    Look... maybe I m not telling you 
                    what you want to hear.  But have 
                    you checked our stock price lately?  
                    Have you analyzed our earnings 
                    numbers?  You don t want someone 
                    who s gonna blow smoke up your ass, 
                    you want someone who can turn this 
                    company around.

                                  BOARD MEMBER #1
                          (curious)
                    And how do you propose to do that?                                                                                    39.



                                  JAMES
                    Focus on our core businesses.  
                    Raise capital by selling our under 
                      performing divisions.  Issue bonds 
                    to pay down our debt.  Get the 
                    Street back on our side.  It won t 
                    be sexy but it ll be effective.
                    And when your broker calls to tell 
                    you that your portfolio just 
                    doubled -- and your wife thanks you 
                    for the new beach house you bought 
                    her with AmeriMart stock options -- 
                    you ll be glad you hired the guy  
                    serious enough to tell you the 
                    truth.
                          (then)
                    And one other thing -- do me a 
                    favor, turn down the goddamn heat 
                    in here...

      He exits.  As the Board Members exchange looks at what just 
      transpired, we... SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    40.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Karl lies in bed.  Post-coital.  Marla stands off to the 
      side, dressing.  

                                  KARL 
                    You re sure you have to leave?  
                    Because I can cancel my golf 
                    lesson...

                                  MARLA
                    I told you, silly.  I have to look 
                    at fabric swatches with a client.  
                      Unfortunately, sex with you doesn t 
                    pay the rent.

      She zips her skirt.  Then she opens her pocketbook.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    Damn.  I forgot to go to the cash 
                    machine.  Can you loan me twenty 
                    dollars for a cab?

                                  KARL
                    Pants pocket.

      Marla picks up Karl s pants, takes out his wallet.  But 
      instead of cash, she pulls out two TICKET STUBS.  We re CLOSE 
      on the tickets which read,  The Devil Wears Prada.   Marla 
      furrows her brow.

                                  MARLA 
                          (unsure, re: the tickets)
                    You saw  The Devil Wears Prada? 

                                  KARL
                            (innocently)
                    Last night.  Wendy was dying to see 
                    it.  

      Marla stops short.  She thinks, then...

                                  MARLA
                          (unsurely)
                    But you said -- hmmm, you said you 
                    don t spend time together anymore.

                                  KARL
                    We don t. The couple s therapist 
                    thought it would be a good idea.                                                                                    41.



                                  MARLA
                          (dubious)
                    The couple s therapist suggested 
                    you go to the movies?

      Karl nods.  But Marla shakes her head.  Scorned, she s 
      instantly on the war-path.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    Well, don t I feel like a fool? I 
                    mean, you had me convinced that you 
                    and your wife were practically 
                    strangers and --

                                  KARL
                    We are...

                                  MARLA
                    Well, I don t go to the movies with 
                      strangers, Karl.  Do you?
                          (beat, angry)
                    I mean, what kind of man would be 
                    so deceitful as to lie to the woman 
                    he s cheating on his wife with?

      Karl looks like his head might explode.

                                  KARL
                    Marla, you re over-reacting.  It 
                    was just a movie.  We didn t even 
                    discuss it afterwards.

                                  MARLA 
                    You know, I bet Wendy would like to 
                    know what her loving husband is up 
                    to when he s not at home.

                                  KARL
                          (alarmed)
                    What are you saying?  You re gonna 
                    tell her...everything?

                                  MARLA
                    No, not everything.  
                          (then)
                    Just the part about the sex in the 
                    hotel rooms.

      Marla exits. Karl wraps a sheet around himself and scurries 
      to the door.                                                                                      42.


                                  KARL
                          (calling after her)
                      Marla...wait.  I ll take you to see 
                    it tomorrow.  There s a matinee!

      But it s no use -- she s gone.  On Karl, worried, we SMASH TO --

      INT. STEAM ROOM - FIRMWOOD - LATER

      Karl, Brody, Duncan and a contemplative James are wrapped in 
      towels in the steam room.  Karl clearly has just finished 
      recounting Marla s threat.

                                  DUNCAN
                    That s just bad movie stuff, Karl.  
                    The mistress never tells.  
                          (then)
                    I mean, not usually.
                          (then)
                    Okay, it only happened to me once...

                                  BRODY
                    Christ, how many affairs have you 
                    had?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (shrugs)
                    Every man needs a hobby.

      Karl shakes his head.  Beating himself up.

                                  KARL
                    What have I done?  Maybe Wendy and I 
                    have grown apart lately, but she 
                    loved me when I was poor and had bad 
                    skin.  The thought of losing her...

                                  JAMES
                          (edgy)
                    You know what s funny?  You re so 
                    worried about losing her but maybe 
                    you ve lost her already.

      All eyes turn to James.

                                  KARL
                          (shocked)
                    What?  What s he talking about?

                                  JAMES
                    How do you know she s not spending 
                    her afternoons in some hotel room, 
                    too?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    43.

                                  JAMES (CONT'D)
                    Lying in bed with your contractor 
                    having the same conversations about 
                    you.

                                  KARL
                    But Wendy hates our contractor.  He 
                    was completely unreliable...

                                  BRODY
                          (calmly, to James)
                    Hey.  Ease off, Jimbo.

                                  JAMES
                          (guns blazing)
                    No, I think Karl might like a taste 
                    of what it s like to be on the 
                    other side.  Because people do get 
                    hurt, you know.

      Brody, Duncan and Karl share a look over James  
        uncharacteristic behavior.  Duncan turns to James.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (gently, knowingly)
                    What s wrong, James?

      James looks up at his friends.  A long beat, then...

                                  JAMES
                    Stacey was having an affair with my 
                    boss.

      The guys all turn to James.  Full of surprise and concern.

                                  BRODY
                          (shocked)
                    You re kidding?  Stacey and the 
                    dead guy?

      James nods.

                                  KARL
                    Man, I don t know what to say...  

                                  BRODY
                    Well, I do -- that sucks.  And I d 
                    offer to take the guy out if Hector 
                    hadn t already done it for us...

                                  DUNCAN
                          (sincerely)
                    Whatever you need, James. You know 
                    that, right?                                                                                    44.



      James nods appreciatively.  A long beat, as the guys let the 
      moment linger.  Then Karl stands...

                                  KARL 
                            (apologetically)
                    Hey, I hate to break things up.  
                    But I think I m gonna go home... 
                    see if Wendy wants to spoon or 
                      something.

      Karl quickly exits.  Brody shakes his head.

                                  BRODY
                    Look at us.  We re supposed to be 
                    the  masters of the universe.   And 
                    now... James  wife is sleeping 
                    around, Karl can t control his 
                    crazy mistress and I m too p-
                    whipped to tell my wife that the 
                    delivery company can t locate her 
                    shipment of Napoleons.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (shakes his head)
                    Men.  We re the new women.

      Just then, Brody s cell phone -- which sits next to him on 
      the wood bench -- rings.

                                  BRODY 
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?
                          (beat)
                    What do you mean, they re in Tampa?  
                    How the fuck does that help me?
                          (beat)
                    Okay.  Hold on a second.

      Brody puts down the phone, turns to the guys.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    I gotta deal with this.  I ll see 
                    you guys later.

      Brody pats James on the back, exits.  Duncan turns to James.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I ve always said Brody had a real 
                    Napoleon complex.

      James smiles.  The joke cheers him slightly.                                                                                    45.



                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    We re going to her birthday party 
                    tomorrow, right?

                                  JAMES
                          (nods)
                    We have to.  He s our friend.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What do you get for the dragon lady 
                    who has everything?

                                  JAMES
                    A jock strap for her balls?

      Duncan laughs.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do me a favor.  No more jokes about 
                    women with penises, please?

      James smiles.  A silent beat as the two friends sit alone.  
      Then, Duncan says simply --

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                          (re: Stacey)
                    I m sorry.

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah.  Me, too.

      And as the pair sits quietly, we re --

      EXT. KARL S HOUSE - LATER

      Marla emerges from a taxi cab in front of Karl s house.  
      Apparently, it was not an idle threat.  She takes a deep 
      breath, steeling herself for the task ahead, and marches 
      towards the front door.

      She knocks loudly on the door and composes herself as she 
      waits.  A beat and Wendy opens the door.

                                  WENDY
                    Hi.  Can I help you?

                                  MARLA
                    Actually, maybe I can help you.  

      And on Marla s smile, we...SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    46.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. KARL S HOUSE - LATER

      Karl pulls up to his house in his BMW.  He parks and moves 
      quickly towards the front door.  He s here to do his best to 
      reclaim his marriage.  He opens the front door and enters.

      INT. KARL S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Karl steps into his living room and, much to his horror, he 
      sees Marla and Wendy sitting on the couch and having tea.  
      Karl does his best not to betray a reaction.  Wendy looks up 
      at him and smiles.

                                  WENDY
                    Karl... why didn t you tell me you 
                    hired a decorator?  Marla and I 
                    were just discussing ideas for the 
                    guest house.

      Karl can only force a weak smile.  Apparently, Marla hasn t 
      yet revealed the affair.

                                  KARL
                          (at a loss)
                    Oh.  Good.  The guest house.

                                  WENDY
                          (to Marla)
                    It s so unlike Karl to take an 
                    interest in decorating.  

                                  MARLA
                    Isn t it amazing?  To be married to 
                    a man for all these years and not 
                    have the faintest idea who he is...

      Karl looks like he d rather be anywhere else.  As Marla 
      smiles at Wendy, we re --

      INT. LISBETH S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Duncan follows after Lisbeth -- his first wife -- as she 
      gathers her things.  She is dressed up and looks beautiful.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (agitated)
                    Cameron is belligerent.  She s 
                      headstrong.  You can t tell her a 
                    thing she already doesn t know...                                                                                    47.



                                    LISBETH
                    You should be happy. Proof that 
                    she s yours.

      Lisbeth stops at the foyer mirror to put on her earrings.  
      Duncan takes her in.

                                  DUNCAN
                    You look pretty.

                                    LISBETH
                    I have a date.  The guy who 
                      refinanced the house.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Well I don t just know if it s 
                    gonna work out.  With Cameron.

                                    LISBETH
                    She ll be disappointed.  But it 
                    won t be the first time.

      Lisbeth starts walking again  Duncan follows.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                    LISBETH
                    She s angry at you, Duncan.  Not that 
                    she can admit it.  But she is...

                                  DUNCAN
                     Angry?  I ve given her everything 
                    she s ever asked for.

                                    LISBETH
                    That s true.  But did you ever 
                    notice, that after she turned 
                    twelve she stopped asking?

      Clearly, this lands on Duncan.  He s instantly lost in 
      thought.  Lisbeth puts her lipstick in her purse, then looks 
      up at him with sympathy.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    Look.  You may not have been the 
                    greatest father to date.  But 
                    you re a good man.  And the best 
                    thing about being a father   every 
                    day s a chance to do better.

      Duncan nods, softens.                                                                                    48.



                                  DUNCAN
                    Were you this pretty when we were 
                    married?

                                    LISBETH
                    Prettier.  You never stopped long 
                    enough to notice.

                                  DUNCAN
                      I wouldn t mind stopping for a 
                    while now.

      Lisbeth smiles.  She knows Duncan all-too-well.

                                    LISBETH
                    Go home, Duncan. My date s going to 
                    be here any minute.

                                  DUNCAN
                    You like this guy?

                                    LISBETH
                    I might.

                                  DUNCAN
                    If it gets serious...we wouldn t be 
                    able to sleep together any more, 
                    right?

                                    LISBETH
                    That s right, Duncan.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Call me after, okay?  So I don t 
                    have to obsess.

      Lisbeth leads him to the door.  She looks at him.

                                    LISBETH
                    You know...if we ever got back 
                    together, you d lose interest in me 
                      completely.  You know that, right?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Try me.

                                    LISBETH
                    Maybe.  Just not tonight.

      Lisbeth closes the door.  Duncan smiles to himself.                                                                                    49.



      INT. JAMES  OFFICE - DAY

      James sits at his desk. After a beat, his cell phone rings.  
      He looks at the display which reads  STACEY CALLING.   He 
      presses a button and redirects it to voice mail.  Just then, 
      we hear an off-camera voice --

                                  KATIE (O.S.)
                    I never liked her, you know.  Even 
                    when I said I did, I didn t.

      James looks up at her.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    Of course, if you take her back, 
                    I ll deny ever saying that.

                                  JAMES
                    Who told you?

                                  KATIE
                    Not you.  Which is an issue for 
                    another time.  I had to find out 
                    the old-fashioned way.

                                  JAMES
                    Office gossip?

      Katie nods. 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    What are they saying?

                                  KATIE
                    The men hate her.  The women are 
                    trying to figure out when you ll be 
                    ready to date.

      James smiles ruefully.  Katie sits next to him.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                            (sympathetically)
                    So...what are you gonna do?

                                  JAMES
                    I thought I d start by not eating 
                    and screwing up my career.  After 
                    that, I m open to suggestion...

      Katie smiles.                                                                                    50.



                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Truth is, I haven t been able to 
                    face her.  I ve been staying with 
                    Duncan. My kids think I m on a 
                    business trip.

      A beat, as Katie looks at him.

                                  KATIE
                    Look, the heart s a complex little 
                    muscle so who knows how this ends?  
                    But you re a great guy.  And a lot 
                    of women out there can see it. Even 
                    if your wife can t.

      James nods appreciatively.  If he was in a better place, this 
      might be a moment.  So let s call it a moment-adjacent.  In 
      any case, it s punctured by --

                                  ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                    Mr. Auster, there s a call for you 
                    on two.

      James picks up the phone.

                                  JAMES 
                          (into phone)
                    Hello, this is James.
                          (long beat, then)
                    Yes, okay.  Thank you.

      James hangs up the phone.  He looks stunned.  Katie takes him 
      in, concerned.

                                  KATIE
                    You okay?

                                  JAMES
                    I m not sure.  
                          (beat, haltingly)
                    I...I just got named CEO of 
                      AmeriMart.

      Katie looks at him, stunned.

                                  KATIE
                          (shocked)
                    You re kidding?

                                  JAMES
                    They said they wanted new blood.  
                    New direction.                                                                                    51.



                                  KATIE
                          (realizing)
                    You re not kidding.

      Katie can t quite believe it.  She s happy for James but, at 
      the same time, she s an incredibly competitive person.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                          (trying...)
                    Wow.  Congratulations.

                                  JAMES
                          (smiles)
                    You could say it like you mean it, 
                    you know...

                                  KATIE
                    Oh, I have to mean it, too?

      Katie stands, checks the time.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    Well, I should go.  I m late for my 
                    Logistics meeting. And I don t want 
                    to get off on the wrong foot with 
                    the new boss.

      James rolls his eyes.  As Katie starts to exit, James calls 
      after her.

                                  JAMES
                      Katie...these women who think I m a 
                    great guy. Do I know any of them?

                                  KATIE
                    Just the one who s going to take 
                    your job if you screw up.
                          (then, smiles)
                    Take care, boss.

      She exits.  James watches her go, smiles to himself.  Then as 
      he thinks and the smile runs from his face, we re --

      INT. KARL S HOUSE - LATER

      ANGLE on Wendy -- down the hall in the kitchen -- as she 
      mixes Karl his nightly seven-and-seven.

      REVERSE onto Karl and Marla, in the living room.  He speaks 
      in hushed, urgent tones.  Occasional glances back at Wendy.                                                                                    52.



                                  KARL
                          (sotto)
                    What the hell s going on?

                                  MARLA
                    I didn t tell her about us, if 
                    that s what you mean.

                                  KARL
                          (unsure)
                    Then what are you doing here?

                                  MARLA
                    Well, I came here to tell her.  But 
                    then I realized -- Wendy s not the 
                    one I want to hurt.  And then we 
                    got to talking and you know what?  
                    We kind of hit it off.

                                  KARL
                          (not thrilled)
                    You hit it off with my wife?

                                  MARLA
                    She s smart and sweet and so 
                    funny...

                                  KARL
                          (incredulous)
                     Funny?   Wendy s funny?  Like, she 
                    made you laugh?  

                                  MARLA
                    Karl.  How you could not appreciate 
                    her is beyond me.  She s a gem.  I 
                    have half a mind to fix her up with 
                    my handyman.

      Karl looks stunned, as Wendy emerges with his drink.

                                  WENDY
                          (to Karl)
                    Here you go, hon.  Sorry if it s a 
                    little strong.

      Wendy admires a vase on the mantle.

                                  MARLA
                    I adore this piece, Wendy.

                                  WENDY
                    I got it at that little antique 
                    place I was telling you about.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                  WENDY (CONT'D)
                    That settles it -- you and I are 
                    going there tomorrow!

      Karl takes the drink and downs it in one gulp.

                                  KARL
                     Scuse me.  Just gonna get a 
                    refill.

      Karl turns and exits.  As Wendy smiles happily at her new 
      friend, we re --

      INT. COPY ROOM - REV-NET - (FRIDAY) NIGHT

      Cameron wipes the perspiration from her forehead, as she 
      slavishly organizes the copy room.  Clearly, it s not 
      rewarding work but she s doing her best.  As she does, she 
      looks up at the doorway --

      FROM CAMERON S POV, we PAN UP FROM A PAIR OF PUMPS TO 
      STOCKING-CLAD LEGS TO A MINI-SKIRT AND UP A LOW-CUT BLOUSE 
      WITH A PUSH-UP BRA TO ULTIMATELY REVEAL --

      A 6-foot, African-American transvestite prostitute.  This 
      could be none other than Dontrelle.

                                    CAMERON
                          (tentatively)
                    Can I help you?

                                  DONTRELLE
                    I m looking for Duncan 
                      Collinsworth.  Do you know him?

                                    CAMERON
                          (smiles)
                    As a matter of fact, I do.

      And on Cameron s impish smile, we...SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    54.


                                        ACT SIX

      INT. FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - LATER - NIGHT

      The party for Janelle, Brody s wife, is in full swing.  We 
      PAN ACROSS the room -- from the sea of Napoleons on the 
      desert table to the formally-attired GUESTS who mingle 
      happily as an ORCHESTRA fills the room with music.

      ANGLE on MARLA and WENDY -- Karl s wife and mistress -- 
      chatting animatedly.  REVERSE ONTO

      KARL, across the room, watching them.  Duncan is at his side.

                                  KARL
                      Unbelievable. My wife finally makes 
                    a friend and it s my mistress.  
                    What are the odds?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (on the bright side...)
                    Well, at least you ll have something 
                    to talk about in couple s therapy.

      Just then, Duncan s face turns ashen as he looks to the 
      ENTRANCE of the room to see --

      Dontrelle, standing in the doorway.  Duncan nearly chokes on 
      his drink.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                          (freaked)
                    Jesus...

      And then...Cameron steps in the doorway next to Duncan.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                            (double-freaked)
                    ...H. Christ.

      Duncan -- hoping to prevent a scene -- moves quickly towards 
      Dontrelle and Cameron, who smiles at him.

                                    CAMERON
                    Duncan, there s someone who I think 
                    you d like to speak with...

                                  DONTRELLE
                          (to Duncan)
                    Hi, sweetie.

      As Duncan pulls Dontrelle out of the room, we re...                                                                                    55.



      INT. PARTY - CONTINUOUS

      A WOMAN -- we can t see her face -- gives Brody a hug and 
      disappears into the crowd.  This is JANELLE, Brody s wife.  
      Brody smiles to himself, self-satisfied, as James steps in 
      next to him.

                                  BRODY
                    Janelle s thrilled.  She s having a 
                    great time.

                                  JAMES
                    That makes you happy, doesn t it?

      Brody uncharacteristically softens.

                                  BRODY
                    I know I bitch about her.  But 
                    she s got another side, too.  Maybe 
                    you don t see it.  Maybe I don t 
                    see it as much as I used to.  But 
                    we just fit, you know?

      James nods. He might have once said the same thing about 
      himself and Stacey.

                                  JAMES
                          (with regret)
                    Yeah.  I know.

      Then, James does his best to pull himself out of his reverie 
      and indicates the desert table filled with Napoleons.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    And I see the Napoleons made it...

                                  BRODY
                    No, they re still in Tampa.  But I 
                    found this little place in Jersey 
                    that knocked  em out in two hours.  
                    Janelle never knew the difference.

      James smiles, but Brody s expression darkens as he sees 
      something off-camera...

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    And speaking of deception...

      ANGLE on Stacey, entering the room.  As James smile slips off 
      his face, we re --

      CLOSE ON A WAD OF CASH -- as it s handed from a white hand to 
      a black one with perfect fingernails.  PULL BACK and we re --                                                                                    56.



      INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - FIRMWOOD

      Duncan hands the money to Dontrelle in the very same closet 
      he had sex with his ex in days earlier.

                                  DUNCAN
                    So remember...if anyone asks, you 
                    never met me.

                                  DONTRELLE
                    For a grand, I can forget almost 
                    anything.

      Before Duncan can exit...

                                  DONTRELLE (CONT D)
                    You know, I consider myself a 
                    business person, too.  B.A. in 
                      Administration from Cal State Chino.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Really?

                                  DONTRELLE
                    And the first rule of business -- 
                    always leave the customer 
                      satisfied.  So if you d like a 
                    little taste on the house...?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (immediately)
                    No, thanks.  I m good.

      Duncan quickly exits the supply closet.

      EXT. FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

      As a TAXI pulls away with Dontrelle inside, Duncan breathes a 
      sigh of relief.  Just then, Cameron steps in next to him.

                                    CAMERON
                    You and Dontrelle -- not just old 
                    hunting buddies, right?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Don t tell your mother, okay?

      Cameron nods.  A beat, then...

                                    CAMERON
                    You know, we re more alike than I 
                    thought, Duncan.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                    CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    We both have trouble getting out of 
                    our own ways.

      Duncan turns and looks at her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you going to stop embarrassing 
                    me at work?

                                    CAMERON
                    Probably not.  
                          (then)
                    Are you going to stop judging me?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Not likely.

                                    CAMERON
                    Well at least we know where we 
                    stand.

      Cameron turns and starts to walk off...

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Good night, Duncan.  See you 
                    Monday.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (calling after her)
                    You can call me  Dad,  you know.

                                    CAMERON
                    I know.  
                          (then)
                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan watches Cameron walk off.  He can t help but smile.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (to himself)
                    Baby steps.

      EXT. FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - POOL

      We join Stacey and James in the midst of their charged 
      discussion.

                                  STACEY
                            (generously)
                    CEO...  God, the articles in the 
                    papers -- the kids were so excited, 
                    they took them to school with them.  
                    I m so proud of you, James.                                                                                    58.



      James nods, says nothing.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                    I m not asking you not to be angry 
                    at me, you know.

                                  JAMES
                    Then what are you asking?

                                  STACEY
                    If you re ever going to be able to 
                    stop.

      James looks at her.

                                  JAMES
                    Did you love him?

                                  STACEY
                    No.

                                  JAMES
                    Then why d you -- ?

                                  STACEY
                    I don t know.  Maybe I was bored.  
                    Or maybe I was scared you were.  
                    That at any moment I d become one 
                    of those  first wives of Firmwood  
                    whose husbands traded them in for a 
                    newer model.

      James shakes his head at the irony.  A beat, then...

                                  JAMES
                          (heartfelt)
                    When I was promoted yesterday, you 
                    know what I first thought?  How I 
                    wished I could call you just to 
                    hear your voice.  And at my press 
                      conference, you know what I thought 
                    then?  How I loved watching you 
                    wake up in the morning.  And at the 
                    company dinner...?  All I could 
                    think was how you should have been 
                    right beside me in your little 
                    black dress.  It was a day I d been 
                    dreaming of since B-school, Stace, 
                    and all I could think of was what 
                    I d lost.                                                                                    59.



                                  STACEY
                    It doesn t have to be like that.  
                    You can come home.

                                  JAMES
                    No, I can t.

                                  STACEY
                    Never?

                                  JAMES
                    Not right away, no.
                          (beat)
                    I ll find a place nearby.  We ll 
                    tell the kids we re taking a  time 
                    out. 

      Stacey nods.  She understands.  Then...trying to ease their 
      pain.

                                  STACEY 
                    CEO of AmeriMart.  World s most 
                    eligible bachelor.

                                  JAMES
                    It s not what I wanted for myself.  
                    Not since Econ 101.

      A last, regretful look.  James is gone.  And as Stacey 
      convulses into tears, we re...

      INT. PARTY - FIRMWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

      James joins Duncan, Brody and Karl in mid-conversation.

                                  BRODY
                    One.  Just one for me.  The lady 
                    with the cute forked tail.

      As James sits down at the table...

                                  JAMES
                    What are you guys talking about?

                                  DUNCAN
                    The number of women in our lives 
                    who drive us absolutely off the 
                      reservation.

                                  KARL
                    Two for me.                                                                                    60.



      ANGLE ON MARLA AND WENDY -- on the dance floor, as they dance 
      and laugh with one another.

                                  KARL (CONT D)
                          (swigs his drink)
                    God help me.

                                  JAMES
                    I m with Brody.  One...

      INSERT STACEY -- as she stands forlorn by the pool.

      BACK TO JAMES -- as he watches Katie, across the party.  
      Brody notices James watching her.

                                  BRODY
                    But ask him again in six months.

      The guys smile.  Karl turns to Duncan.

                                  KARL
                    What about you, Dunc?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Two and a half.

                                  BRODY
                          (unsure)
                     Two and a half? 

      INSERT LISBETH, feigning interest on her dinner date.  
      Clearly, Duncan s on her mind.

                                  DUNCAN
                    There s Lisbeth...

      INSERT CAMERON -- later that night -- as she finishes 
      organizing the copy room and smiles to herself, pleased.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Cameron, of course.
                          (beat)
                    And I think Dontrelle s worth a 
                    half, don t you?

                                  KARL
                    To Dontrelle!  

      The guys start to raise their glasses in a toast...

                                  BRODY
                    And Duncan, I have two words for 
                    you -- corrective lenses...                                                                                    61.



      As the guys laugh and clink their glasses, we DISSOLVE TO

      CLOSE ON A SHIRT -- as it s unbuttoned to REVEAL a LACE BRA. 
      WIDEN TO REVEAL none-other-than 

      DONTRELLE, as he reaches into his bra and pulls out a SMALL 
      TAPE RECORDER that s been affixed to his chest.  We re --

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      Dontrelle hands the micro-cassette to Lori Hodge, the 
      reporter who earlier interviewed Duncan.

                                  DONTRELLE
                    He seems like a nice guy.  I don t 
                    know why you needed me to tape him.

                                  LORI
                    Because a thousand words paint a 
                    very nice picture...

      Dontrelle shrugs.  And as Lori cradles the tape in her hands -
      - and we wonder to ourselves about the intrigue that awaits 
      us, we...SMASH TO BLACK.
