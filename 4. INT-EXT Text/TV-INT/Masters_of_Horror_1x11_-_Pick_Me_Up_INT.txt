      The DRIVER (his oval nametag reads FERGUS) spots the snake 
      in the road ahead. His expression lights as he SPEEDS UP.  


      Fergus is alight with the sadism of a 5 year old.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Gotcha.  


      The pneumatic door chuffs open and FERGUS steps down, 
      contrite. Still captain of his vessel. Sees SMOKE wafting 
      from the engine.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Ahh, crap.  
                              (to passengers)  
                        That's all she wrote, folks.  

      Fergus boards the bus and gets on his radio. The PASSENGERS 
      begin to disembark - about seven of them. Last off is 
      STACIA, our principal:  Late 20s, short blonde hair, hiking 
      Docs, silver drop earrings, tough, confident, old enough to 
      know better.  

      Every PASSENGER except Stacia unlimbers a CELLPHONE and 
      wanders about like sages trying to divine water, their arms 
      in the air, trying to find a signal.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh, this is special.  

      She ducks back into the bus. To Fergus:  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        How far are we from Ganderton?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        More than an hour, still.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Is there anything around?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Just that little Trading Post we 
                        passed about ten miles back. 
                        Guess I should have stopped 
                        there. For bathrooms, snacks, 
                        stretch your legs, you know.  

      She grabs her rucksack out of the bus and slings it. One of 
      the PASSENGERS - DANNY, and early-20s roustabout with a 
      guitar case - notices her. He goes into instant damsel-in-
      distress mode.  

                                      STACIA  
                        What about up ahead?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        A motel off the highway some 
                        twelve, fourteen miles up.  

                                                3.  


                                      STACIA  
                        That ll do.  

                                      DANNY  
                        You're not gonna walk, are you?  
                        Nobody walks.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Yeah. Nobody reads, either.  

                                      DANNY  
                        All alone on the road? Want me 
                        to ride shotgun for you?  

      She sizes him up in a withering instant.  

                                      STACIA  
                        No way.  

      She has a SWITCHBLADE in her hand and cleans her nails with 
      it. Snicks the blade out.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        I ve got all the friend I need.  

      Danny fades back to talk to Fergus. As Stacia departs she 
      encounters a woman named BIRDY, from the bus. Birdy saw the 
      knife.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        That bad, huh?  

      Stacia realizes she's busted. Rueful. Almost apologetic.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Can get to be.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        So young and so bitter, hm?  

      Stacia almost leaves it at "whatever."  Hesitates. Turns 
      back to Birdy.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You ever been married?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Been there, done that.  

                                      STACIA  
                        He ever hit you?  



                                                4.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Anyone strikes me, only strikes 
                        me once.  
                                (beat)  
                        I see you're still wearing a 
                        ring, though.  

      Stacia is, in fact, still wearing a wedding ring.  

                                      STACIA  

      That's to remind me of my past mistakes. See ya.  

                                      BIRDY  
                                (thoughtful)  
                        You take care, now.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I almost always do.  

      Stacia marches away while the other passengers mill around.  

      ON DANNY  

      Slowly watches Stacia crest the next rise until she's out of 
      sight. Then he turns back to Fergus, still in the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Hey, can't you get Triple A, or 
                        something?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Yeah, great idea:  I'll just 
                        call a little ole hick tow 
                        truck. That'll work.  

      Slow, growing RUMBLE of a powerful diesel engine as a 
      customized SEMI TRAILER pulls into view behind the bus 
      (opposite direction), then veers parallel.  

      A power window buzzes down.  


      The driver of the Truck is JIM WHEELER - late-40s, balding, 
      a big man with the look of a military vet turned cowboy 
      bearing of a ex-cop or rescue worker, veneered with a seen-
      it-all, done-it-all weariness. Down vest, gimme cap, Cat 
      boots.  




                                                5.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        Looks like you folks had 
                        yourselves a little mishap.  


      Birdy boards and this is what she sees:  Immaculate leather, 
      tinted glass, custom appointments. Tiny, expensive police 
      scanners mounted under-dash offer a jumpy, active spray of 
      LED light. A feathered earring hangs from the mirror post. 
      On the visors are geegaws and lapel pins, old jewelry and 
      other decorative knick-knacks, rigorously arranged to avoid 
      clutter. Across the dash, a variety of high-end fuel and 
        acceleration monitors that change color as the Truck speeds 
      or slows according to a five-speed manual shift.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You sure travel in luxury.  

      Wheeler smiles at her.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        It s my home. Seat belt.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        So what re you carrying in back?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Just meat.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        They say meat s dangerous 
                        nowadays - with all those growth 
                        hormones, not to mention  mad 
                        cow .  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Oh, mad cow?  

      He moos back at her.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Didn t you just promise me you 
                        weren t a lunatic?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (mock serious)  
                        Rest assured, mine s all organic 
                        meat. Kosher too.  

                                                8.  



      Wheeler loves driving and is utterly serious about every 
      move.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        What kinda engine you got in 
                        this thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Four and a quarter cat, eighteen 
                        speed, double locking 
                        differentials-  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Whoa, that's plenty. I don't 
                        need chapter and verse. Wouldn't 
                        understand most of it, anyway. 
                        Love the way you shift.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I ll bet you know how to drive 
                        stick.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        My preference.  

      As Wheeler SHIFTS smoothly, Birdy notices he is wearing a 
      rather LARGE auto pistol in an upside-down breakaway rig 
      under his left armpit, beneath his vest.  

                                      BIRDY (CONT D)  
                        Say now. I hope this isn t too 
                        personal, but -  

                                      WHEELER  
                                (interposes)  
                        Heh. My gun?  Don't you be 
                        concerned.  

      Wheeler digs into his vest and flops open a BADGE WALLET 
      with police ID.  




                                                9.  



                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Just a lowly deputy sheriff up 
                        Triple Pines way to pick up a 
                        few extra dollars. 

                                      BIRDY  
                        You sound more like a city 
                        fellow.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Actually I m originally from 
                        Brooklyn, New York. Got too 
                        crowded. Too damn congested. Too 
                        many fucking witnesses.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Witnesses?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (ignores her)  
                        So one day I left the wife and 
                        kids and took off driving and 
                        never looked back. Tell me, does 
                        that make me a bad person?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        No worse than anybody else I 
                        guess.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I needed to hear that.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You must like driving.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        When I get lonesome I pick 
                        people up, give them a ride, 
                        make conversation. Most often I 
                        let them go.  

                                      BIRDY  
                              (laughs)  
                        Well that s reassuring.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You re not a bit scared because 
                        you can tell I m normal, right?  

      Birdy seems put at ease, almost ... charmed.  



                                                10.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Mister, I never met anybody that 
                        was  normal  after you get to 
                        know them.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Are we gonna get to know each 
                        other?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Honey, I ll let you know.  


      Marie and Deuce have noticed what's going on outside.  

                                      MARIE  
                              (re: Fergus)  
                        Oh, don't talk to him, you 
                        schmuck!  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Marie?  

                                      MARIE  
                        Some guy just strolls in, out of 
                        the nowhere, he could be -  

      Deuce's lips curl and he offers up some unanticipated 
      backbone.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Honey?  Would it put you out 
                        terribly if for, say, five 
                        minutes, you might -  
                                (harsher)  
                        keep your fucking paranoia to 
                        yourself?  

      Marie mouth STALLS in the open position as she loads fresh 
      invective.  



                                                12.  



                                      DEUCE (CONT D)  
                        Shut. Up.  


      Marie checks her window again and her expression goes sheet-
      white, because she SEES:  

      Fergus SLUMPS into Walker's grasp as he is strangled by 
      Walker with the snake. Walker OPENS one of the luggage 
      compartment hatches and DUMPS Fergus inside.  

                                                14.  


                                      MARIE  
                              (welling panic)  
                        Deuce ...  

      Deuce has to elbow past Marie to see ... and doesn't believe 
      what he sees.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        What the ... hell ...?!  

      Walker is APPROACHING the front of the bus. The open door.  

      Deuce LUNGES to intercept WALKER.  


                                      MARIE  
                        Go away! What do you want?!  

      Walker indicates the BUS RESTROOM behind Marie.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Need to wash my hands.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Fuck you!  

      Marie PILES TOWARD the back of the bus, hitting the 
      EMERGENCY EXIT there and floundering off into the woods, her 
      cellphone long-gone. Walker shakes his head. SIGHS as though 
      he now must doggedly give chase, or something.  

                                      WALKER  
                          Yeah...fuck me.  






                                                15.  




      Most of Wheeler's load (the bus passengers) sit warming up 
      on coffee or making calls from a single pay phone.  

      ROCKO, the market s clerk, is on duty.  

      Wheeler's HANDS place two six-packs of beer, candy, mints, 
      chips, pork rinds, spicy jerky, and a few candy bars.  

      Rocko totes up the haul.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        Sugar addict, huh?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Anything wrong with liking 
                        sweets?  

                                      ROCKO  
                              (warily)  
                        It was only a joke.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dead serious)  
                        That s why I m laughing.  

      Rocko spies Wheeler's big-frame .45 auto, holstered beneath 
      his vest. Rocko's manner curdles.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Gimme a coupla them spicy beef 
                        jerkys, too.  

      Rocko's gaze is still full up with the gun. He SWALLOWS 
      nervously.  




                                                17.  



                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                              (points to cigarettes)  
                        And two packs of them. I m a 
                        nicotine addict too.  

      Wheeler's expression channel-changes. Gruff, yet avuncular. 
      He touches the butt of his gun.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        You got one of these?  

      Flustered, Rocko drops the cigs. Wheeler leans closer over 
      the counter and enunciates:  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Have you got a piece back there?  
                        A gun?  

                                      ROCKO  
                                (stammers; afraid)  
                        No!  I ain't!  I mean, I don't!  

      Wheeler draws the auto and racks the slide. Rocko cringes 
      like he's about to eat lead and see his life flash before 
      his eyes. Wbeeler comes CLOSE, intimate.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Don t be afraid. That s what 
                        this does, it eliminates fear. 
                        It s a scepter of power. You 
                        point it and people...fall down. 
                        Here.  

      Wheeler EJECTS the clip and hands the gun to Rocko.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Careful, now. Point it at me.  

      Rocko lifts the gun, quaveringly.  

                                      ROCKO  
                          It s...heavy.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        See? Don t you feel more 
                        powerful? More in control? Now 
                        all you need is the will to 
                        kill, my friend.  

      Rocko has the muzzle casually aimed at Wheeler s chest.  



                                                18.  



      Wheeler moves it off-target with one finger. Still with a 
      smile.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        But don t point it at anyone 
                        unless you intend to shoot them, 
                        okay?  

                                      ROCKO  
                                (skittish, fascinated)  
                        Why...?  

                                      WHEELER  
                         Cos I appreciate those rest 
                        stops and convenience stores. 
                        Punks are always trying to knock 
                         em off. I hate that.  
                              (a thought)  
                        Oops, almost forgot.  

      Wheeler gently grabs the gun and racks the slide. A 
      CARTRIDGE bounces onto the counter.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Left one in the pipe.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        You mean I coulda actually 
                        really, like shot you?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Guess fate didn t want you to.  

      Wheeler reholsters the gun and shows Rocko the bullet.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Hollow point. Makes this teeny 
                        hole going in. Coming out, it s 
                        like a big slice of cherry pie.  

      Wheeler GIFTS Rocko with the bullet.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        See, you gotta think things 
                        through before you ever pick up 
                        a firearm.  
                                (beat)  
                        And don t forget about that 
                        jerky.  

      Rocko is still fighting an inner war for composure.  


                                                19.  


                                      ROCKO  
                        Eh ... coming right up.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You okay?  You look kinda upset.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        Take it back. Okay Mister. I ll 
                        take my chances without it, if 
                        you don t mind.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You disappoint me.  


      Danny is looking around in slow amazement at all the stuff 
      inside the cab, as they speed back toward the bus site.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You wiped your feet, right?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Huh?  Oh - yeah.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Wouldn't want you getting 
                        dogshit on my carpeting. 
                        Expensive.  




                                                22.  



                                      DANNY  
                        There don't seem to be many cops 
                        out here.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What are you getting at?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Well, I mean, highway patrol, 
                        state troopers, sheriffs, that 
                        kind of thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Out here there's less than one 
                        cruiser for every hundred square 
                        miles. Like I told the lady:  I 
                        usually don't work here. I just 
                        come here to -  

                                      DANNY  
                        Unwind?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Yeah. That's a good word.  


      Danny jumps out.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Where are they?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey - careful, now!  


      Lily cranks around to scope Walker. He can see the rings on 
      her nipples as she leans back to offer him an already-open 
      beer.  

                                      LILY  
                        Care for a taste?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Don't mind if I do, ma'am.  

      That cracks Stoney up.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Oh, wow - "ma'am."  



                                                25.  



                                      LILY  
                        Shut up, Stoney; he's just being 
                        polite. Ain't you?  

      Walker offers a modest toast with the can as 
        acknowledgement.  

                                      STONEY  
                        How'd you wind up way the fuck 
                        out in this piss-poor excuse for 
                        the middle of nowhere?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Walked.  

      Lily offers Walker a huge smoldering spliff.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Like, on foot?  Dude.  

                                      LILY  
                        Never mind him. He's Stoney, and 
                        you can call me Lily. Where you 
                        headed?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Thataway.  

      Stoney giggles again.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Totally western. "Thataway."  

      Lily yanks out one tape and roots around for another.  

                                      LILY  
                        Well, you just tell us how far 
                        you want to go.  

                                      WALKER  
                          I generally always go all the 
                        way.  

                                      LILY  
                              (re: Walker's hat)  
                        Nice head.  

      Walker settles crosswise, his back against the port side of 
      the cabin. 




                                                26.  



      Lily squirms out of her seat and straddles Walker to get at 
      the beer cooler, giving him an unobstructed close-up of her 
      crotch. Above her fishnets, beneath her leather skirt - no 
      panties. She takes her time getting back to her seat.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I could've got that for you.  

      When Lily stares at Walker, she looks almost hungry.  

                                      LILY  
                        I know.  

      ON STONEY  

        Surreptitiously slipping on a nasty pair of brass knucks.  

      ANGLE ON WALKER 

      Calmly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.  


      Walker is at the wheel removing the gloves. No music.  

      Nobody sits in the passenger seat. Walker glances over his 
      shoulder.  

      IN THE BACK OF THE VAN  

      Stoney is GONE. Lily is tied up, duct-taped. Now there's 
      fear in her eyes, and this pleases Walker, who WINKS at her.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I am so glad you came along. I 
                        was working awhile ago ... had 
                        to interrupt before I could 
                        finish up. So you coming along 
                        like this was really lucky. For 
                        me.  

      WALKER'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD  

      As the Van crests a rise, on approach to the Counting Sheep 
      Motor Hotel. His new destination.  


      Two sagging beds, half-hearted Western chintz, threadbare 
      furniture, viral carpet, and a TV that shows things in 
      Martian colors. Stacia's rucksack is on one bed.  


      Stacia peels her grimy clothes and regards herself in a 
      scabby mirror. The hot water in the shower stall is already 
      blasting, making steam.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Jesus, that s good.  

      Stacia enjoys the shower with almost blissful relief. Hears 
      a THUMP on the wall from the adjacent bathroom (in Room 11) 
      which we MATCH with:  

                                                29.  



      WALKER has slammed the medicine cabinet door to REVEAL 
      himself in the mirror:  Shirtless, sweating, a bit manic. 
      Dots of BLOOD on his chest. Mops his face with a towel. He 
      rummages in a paper bag and tears a generic version of a 
      brand-new X-ACTO KNIFE from its blister pak. He tests the 
      tip of the blade with his finger.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oww.  

      Camera backs into the room carrying Walker.  

      Walker looms over LILY, from the van - naked, gagged, tied 
      spread-eagled on top of a VINYL TARP snugged over the entire 
      bed. The TV is on, masking noise.  

      PRODUCTION NOTE: IN FILMING THIS SEQUENCE, WE WILL MATCH 
      MOVEMENTS OF WALKER AND STACIA IN AND OUT OF INDIVIDUAL 
      BATHROOMS SO THEY ARE IN UNISON. CAMERA MOVEMENTS MATCH 
      EXACTLY.  

      Walker is feeding quarters into the magic fingers apparatus 
      on the bed.  

      Walker leans over the semi-conscious Lily ... and SMILES the 
      most generous, friendly smile we've ever seen.  


      Still in the shower, Stacia tries readjusting the hot water 
      and the knob comes off in her hand. She can t shut off the 
      hot water and she can t reconnect the knob which came loose.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Piece of shit motel.  

      She hops out of the shower. Steam now fills the small 
      bathroom. She wraps a towel around herself.  

      Camera backs up with her as she hurries into the motel room, 
      sits on the bed, and dials the phone beside it.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Hello? Come on...pick up... The 
                        hot water won t shut and the old 
                        bastard won t pick up. Where the 
                        hell are you?  

      She s growing increasingly frustrated as she slams down the 
      phone and gets to the bathroom and shuts the door on the 
      steam.  

                                                30.  



      Wheeler leans over the limp, dead form of STONEY, from the 
      Van. A broken bone jutting out of his neck. He is not 
      horrified or repulsed. He just looks at the corpse. Then 
      riffles through Stoney's clothing and comes up with a pack 
      of cigarettes. Wheeler shakes one out and lights it, puffing 
        thoughtfully as he SPEAKS to Stoney's corpse.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Somebody powerful enough to snap 
                        your neck without even working 
                        up a sweat. Could ve hid it but 
                        he had to show off.  


      Stacia ASLEEP on the bed, wearing only a T-shirt, the TV 
      droning.  

      O.S. RHYTHMIC THUMPING AND GROANING - coming from Room 11.  

      Stacia WAKES. Groggy. She orients. It sounds like somebody 
      is having noisy SEX next door. She rolls her eyes ... then 
      LISTENS, vaguely amused, until it gets boring.  

      SLOW TRACK THROUGH THE WALL FROM ROOM 12 TO ROOM 11 

      Where Walker is rinsing off maniac sweat and a little blood, 
      humming. He BELCHES rather obnoxiously at his image in the 
      bathroom mirror.  

      The crimsoned X-Acto knife CLATTERS into a pool of blood on 
      the bathroom sink.  

      Walker STROLLS into the room, languorously. Glancing at the 
      TV.  





                                                31.  



                                      WALKER  
                        Told you you d be prettier 
                        without all that makeup. Without 
                        all that attitude, too.  

      He glances at the TV. Porn is playing. Switch it off.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        That porn shit embarrasses me. 
                        There s no romance to it. It s 
                        just clinical y know?  

      Lily is flayed, half-butchered, yet STILL ALIVE, her eyes 
      dully tracking her tormentor.  

      Walker inserts a quarter into the magic fingers machine that 
      makes the bed vibrate.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Just meat, stuck into more meat. 
                        Doesn t mean anything. Filling 
                        holes. Hell, you can make a hole 
                          practically anywhere.  

      He RAISES the knife again, suddenly miffed.  

      OVERHEAD SHOT 

      Moving from above Walker across the wall to Stacia s room 
      where he listens.  

      Then across her wall to the next room where it s revealed 
      that he s checked in too.  

      RESUME STACIA IN ROOM 12 

                                      STACIA  
                                (yells through the walls)  
                        Keep it down in there. Shut the 
                        fuck up.  

      She can HEAR Walker s muffled voice raised in anger next 
      door. She shakes her head.  

      ANGLE ON WALKER 

      Walker reacts to her voice.  

                                      WALKER  
                                (yells back)  
                        Real sorry.  


                                                32.  


      Walker is now fascinated by the fact that there s a girl 
      next door. He s lost interest in Lily.  

      BACK TO STACIA 

      She ransacks her jeans for change. Pulls them on. Barefoot.  


      Walker ENTERS and stops before the mirror, suddenly smacking 
      his head.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh, I get it!  Trucker Burt out 
                        there, he knows ... but he's 
                        like one of those cheetahs that 
                        chase something and don t kill 
                        it - don t eat it.  

      He is speaking to the INERT CORPSE of Lily, bloodied on the 
      bed.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        They play with it. Honey ...?  
                                (beat)  
                        Never mind.  

      Walker stretches, rather pleased with his deduction.  


      ON STACIA, not-really-watching the cartoons on TV. Feeling 
      anxious. Feeling trapped. Vaguely agitated, like someone who 
      knows they are being spied upon. UNDER the drone of the TV 
      she hears a SKRITCHING noise OS.  

      She damps the TV volume. The NOISE is coming from the 
      bathroom. She sneaks up on the bathroom door. Skritch, 
      skritch ...  


      The shower is still running and the place is full of steam.  

      Stacia, in full-on slasher movie stealth mode. Peeking 
      around the jamb.  

      Above the sound of the water is skritch, skritch, coming 
      from the small, closed bathroom WINDOW.  

      Stacia moves into the bathroom, her switchblade palmed. She 
      hates her own fear.  

                                                37.  


                                      STACIA  
                        God ... dammit ...  

      Her eyes follow the skittering SOUND up and across the 
      ceiling.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Great. We've got party rats.  


      Stacia sits on the bed. Nervous. Something has triggered all 
      her alarms and she cannot sit still.  

      She looks to the far wall - bordering Walker's room. Then to 
      the opposite wall - bordering Wheeler's room. Reluctantly, 
      she DECIDES.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (a whisper)  
                        Right. Dammit.  

      ... and begins to GATHER up her things.  

      Stacia peeks out through a curtain slit. All clear. OPENS 
      her door silently.  


      Wheeler lies on his bed in an almost meditative state. His 
      eyes SNAP open at some sound we cannot hear. But he does.  

      He checks the time and rolls out.  


      TV still on, shower still running, sound down, a shape under 
      the sheets. Wheeler clues in immediately.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, I'll be damned.  

      He SWEEPS the sheets aside. Just pillows. No Stacia. Then he 
      SEES the room key, left behind on the dresser. Stacia has 
      flown in the middle of the night.  

      The SKRITCHING sound begins again, OS at the bathroom 
      window.  

      Wheeler, with a hurried sense of mission, checks his watch, 
      then EXITS. HOLD on the empty room.  


      Full of steam, the CAMERA MOVES from the room to the 
      bathroom window as WALKER pries it up. A ghostly apparition 
      coming through the steam as he climbs through the window.  

      OS SOUND of Wheeler's Truck starting up, revving, backing 
      out.  

      This SPEEDS Walker through the window. He senses his quarry 
      is already lost and when he sees the door to Room 12 
      standing open, that confirms it.  

                                      WALKER  
                                (marveling)  
                        Son of a bitch.  


      As far as Wheeler can tell, the coast is clear. He NODS to 
      himself and begins to accelerate smoothly - checking his 
      watch against the odometer.  


      He eyes the rain with dismay. Checks the time. One hour has 
      elapsed. He pops a can of beer and takes a long, slow pull.  

                                                40.  


      Lights a cigarette. Patient.  

      A LIGHTNING STRIKE illuminates the landscape and reveals the 
      distant form of Stacia, humping over the crest of the last 
      hilltop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, hello.  

      He waits for just the right moment to NAIL Stacia with his 
      high-beams. Bang!  


      Stacia and Wheeler both board the Truck, soaked. 



                                                42.  



                                      STACIA  
                        Gawdamighty, Hell isn't hot ... 
                        it's wet.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Can't fault you there.  

      He hands her a TOWEL from behind his seat and she ruffs her 
      head.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I thought you were that other 
                        guy. From the motel?  I think 
                        he's following me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        He's the reason I'm out here 
                        tonight.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Some kinda manhunt thing?  
                        What'd he do?  

                                      WHEELER  

      He hurt a few people. You know about territory?  He's like a 
      poacher, coming in where he don't belong, and hunting. He 
      hitches rides. Hard to track.  

      Wheeler puts the Truck in gear and MOVES back out onto the 
      roadway - back toward the Motel.  

      Stacia notes Wheeler's odd "decorations" - his souvenirs.  

      Among them, a KEYCHAIN FOB referencing the HORRIBLE THING 
      roadside attraction referenced on the billboard. Its logo:   

                      I SAW THE HORRIBLE THING AND SURVIVED! 

                                      STACIA  
                        So what's the Horrible Thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I think it was a two-headed baby 
                        skeleton. Something awful like 
                        that. Nothing gives me the 
                        creeps more than some monster 
                        baby. Ever seen one?  

      Stacia takes note of the road, and their trajectory.  



                                                43.  



                                      STACIA  
                        Hey, wrong way.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I want to cover the stretch 
                        between here and the motel. Then 
                        turn around and head out. Just 
                        to be sure. Nobody'll pick that 
                        guy up in this rain.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh.  

      She scans the interior of the Truck cab a bit nervously. The 
      way Birdy did.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                                (wary)  
                        Don't you need backup, or 
                        something?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Not just yet. You may have 
                        gathered that this is kinda 
                        personal, between me and him.  
                                (lightens up)  
                        So what's your story?  

                                      STACIA  
                        Same as everybody - just trying 
                        to get from one place to the 
                        other.  


      Resuming Wheeler and Stacia.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Staying out here will get you 
                        from alive to dead in a hurry. 
                        Sure you don't want to hold the 
                        gun?  


                                                44.  


      Stacia eyes the pistol.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I wouldn't even know which way 
                        to point it.  

      Wheeler seems to glaze over, to withdraw into himself.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Never turn down a ride. Never 
                        turn down a weapon.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You lost me there.  

      Stacia eyes all the "souvenirs" inside the cab. Uneasily. 
      Then, a flash of realization stiffens her.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        But, wait - if you're after that 
                        guy who was in the room next to 
                        me, why didn't you just arrest 
                        him at the motel?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        That's not how it works.  

                                      STACIA  
                        How what works?  

      Wheeler has never really had to explain himself before. 
      Ponders it out.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        We're completely different. He 
                        rides. I drive. He gets picked 
                        up. Me, I do the picking up. He 
                        doesn't have any standards. 
                        He'll do anybody. He's like a 
                        mad dog.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You mean like ... you're the 
                        hunter, and he's the hunted?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Some hunters only hunt dangerous 
                        prey. Fighters. Survivors. Not 
                        easy kills. He hunts whoever he 
                        can take.  
                                (beat)  
                        That's wasteful.  


                                                45.  


                                      STACIA  
                                (wary)  
                        I'm not sure I follow you.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I know. Listen, I need to show 
                        you something. It'll all become 
                        clear.  

      Wheeler reaches across, apparently for the glovebox. The 
      smoothest, most natural move in the world. Then, like a 
      striking viper, he grabs the back of her neck and THUMPS her 
      head into the dash, once, twice, and Stacia GRAYS OUT before 
      she knows it.  

      WHEELER'S POV - STACIA'S TATTOO  

      The crescent moon on her neck fading out last of all.  

      (SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT)  

      FADE TO BLACK with engine SOUND of the Truck OVER.  

      FADE IN SLOWLY  


      First there is only the sound of the Truck, OS, different 
      pitch. Time has elapsed.  

      EXCU - STACIA'S EYES  

      As they flutter open. She is still in the Truck, moving 
      along. OS RADIO:  

                                      RADIO VOICE (VO)  
                        ... and just for variety, let's 
                        add some rain to that rain, heh. 
                        Build yourself a nice fire and 
                        watch some cable tonight, 'cos 
                        it ain't fit for man nor beast 
                        out there, and if you gotta-
                        gotta go, wear your hip-waders 
                        ...  

      STACIA'S POV - TRUCK WINDSHIELD  

      Stacia can see the reflection of her torso. Crisscrossed 
      with seatbelts. Hands bound. The Truck wipers sluice water 
      from the glass.  

      CLOSE-UP - HARNESS BUCKLE  


                                                46.  


        A racing-style, X-shaped seatbelt buckle sitting near her 
      sternum.  

      CLOSE-UP - STACIA'S WRISTS  

      Bound with duct tape.  

      RESUME STACIA'S POV - THE DASHBOARD  

      Her switchblade sits there among the souvenirs, just out of 
      reach.  

      And ... WHEELER. Driving, smoking, a beer in his crotch, 
      watching the road. Without looking at Stacia, he knows she's 
      back. He trims the radio SOUND.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        See, it's the chit-chat I never 
                        get right. Now I'm thinking I 
                        should have said something ... 
                        y'know, fancier. Like maybe I 
                        should have said, "gee, I sure 
                        like your earrings."  And you 
                        would have said, "thanks."  Then 
                        I say, "Think you'd give me one 
                        as a souvenir?" And you'd say, 
                        "no," and then I get to come 
                        back with, "Hey, I could have 
                        asked for one of your tits; I 
                        like those, too."  

      Stacia's eyes are rolling in horror. Wheeler's speech 
      unnerves her more than mere physical violence, which she 
      expects, anticipates. This is just ... weird. 

      Wheeler REACHES OVER. Stacia FLINCHES. Wheeler RIPS OUT her 
      left earring and hangs it on the dash grille. As Stacia 
      FREAKS OUT --  

                                      STACIA  
                        Owww jesus CHRIST --!  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (not missing a beat)  
                        And then you'd flip out, and 
                        then you'd try to jump out of a 
                        moving truck, which won't do you 
                        no good because your door don't 
                        open from the inside, just so 
                        you know.  

      Stacia writhes within her restraints, sucking air from the 
      pain.  

                                                47.  


                                      STACIA  
                        Why are you doing this?  

      Wheeler looks directly at her for the first time, and it's 
      not a pretty sight to see.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You know, when you're fishing, 
                        bait usually doesn't ask stupid 
                        questions.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You're not a cop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        That's equally stupid, but at 
                        least it's not a question. You 
                        get one more try before I get 
                        out the duct tape again.  

      Skating the rim of panic, Stacia considers what to say very 
      carefully.  

                                      STACIA  
                        How long was I out?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        'Bout forty minutes or so. No 
                        permanent damage.  


      Wheeler hits the brakes, skidding to a power stop PAST 
      Walker's position. He reverses gears and BACKS UP. Crushes 
      his beer can and stows it. Tucks his gun into his crotch. 
      Perfect, methodical, a man-machine series of moves.  


                                                48.  


                                      WHEELER  
                        Okay, here we go.  

      EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      The Truck barrels BACKWARD to Walker's position. Walker is 
      standing there with his thumb out. Wheeler buzzes the 
      passenger-side window down.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hell of a night.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Yeah.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You offering me a ride?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I think that's how it's supposed 
                        to go.  

      Stacia's eyes are drifting from one madman to the other.  

      Walker seems amused that Wheeler has captured Stacia.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Sure you got room?  

      Wheeler snorts. Yeah, sure. Walker BOARDS, scrunching Stacia 
      over.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Hello again.  


      The Truck ROLLS. Walker points to the road ahead.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hold up.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Snake. Don't hit it.  


      The trio's eyes all track the o.s. progress of the snake.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (almost sub-aurally)  
                        Because he's minding his own 
                        business.  

      They all - somewhat comically - wait for the snake. Walker 
        appropriates a smoke from the pack on the dash, lights it, 
      then says:  

                                      WALKER  
                        You got another cigarette?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I thought you didn't.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Fooled you, didn't I?  

      Wheeler snorts and passes Walker a beer. Walker reaches and 
      meets Wheeler's hand EXACTLY halfway, in front of the 
      immobilized Stacia.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                              (to Stacia)  
                         Scuse me.  

      He doesn t open the beer. He holds the cold can against his 
      head, meditatively.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I gotta a blonde joke for ya...  

                                      WALKER  

      Do tell.  











                                                50.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        This Blonde is walking through 
                        Central Park in the middle o  
                        winter and she sees this 
                          Rattlesnake freezin  in the 
                        snow! The Snake opens one eye 
                        and says,  Listen, Babe... ... 
                         I just got outta the Zoo and 
                        I m freezin  my ass off here. 
                        Could you pick me up and take me 
                        back? .  No way,  says the 
                        Blonde,  you ll bite me. I can t 
                        trust you .  Listen, honey,  
                        says the Snake,  I promise I 
                        won t bite you . Now the Blonde 
                        was a do-gooder for about ten 
                        minutes, so she picks up the 
                        Snake and starts walkin  it back 
                        to the Zoo. The Snake starts 
                        getting cozy in her hands, 
                        warmin  up...ya know...and he up 
                        n  bites on the boob! Gives her 
                        the Big Deep Sleep, ya know! 
                           Ooooohhh,  screams the Blonde, 
                        going down.  You promised not to 
                        bite me! . And the Snake says 
                         Listen, Babe... ...  

                                      WALKER  
                         You knew what I was when you 
                        picked me up . The way I heard 
                        it told, it was a scorpion and a 
                        toad.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Gee...you know the punchline, 
                        huh...so you re notta dumb 
                          blonde...that s good to know.  

      The snake's gone. Wheeler puts the Truck in gear and rolls.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Snakes are great. They've got 
                        three sets of teeth. Disposable 
                        skin. Smell with their tongues. 
                        They belong out here. Rain 
                        brings 'em out when the 
                        pavement's wet, sometimes.  

      Every LOOK, every GLANCE, every SMALL MOTION of both men 
      should be fraught with impending violence. We just don't 
      know how the storm will erupt. 

                                                51.  


      Stacia is helpless between them, mildly tharn with fear, but 
      angered at the helplessness of her predicament.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (tight, measured)  
                        Where are we going?  

      Wheeler ignores her, speaking across her, to Walker:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Where you headed?  

      Walker inclines his nose forward toward Stacia. Shrugs.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Where are you taking her?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Undecided.  

      Stacia SNEEZES explosively. She can't help it. She hates it. 
      She SNEEZES AGAIN.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh, no, goddammit ...  

      Wheeler holds up three fingers.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Wet weather, it's usually three.  

      Stacia sneezes again, despite herself.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Dammit!  

      In a perfect 1-2-3 move, alert for the slightest sign of 
      betrayal or action, Wheeler hands over a Kleenex, which 
      Walker takes and uses to wipe Stacia's nose.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Don't fucking touch me!  

      Wheeler SPINS on her.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey!  You are a passenger!  







                                                52.  



                                      WALKER  
                        Yeah. Be polite.  
                                (beat; to Stacia)  
                        See, our judgmental friend here 
                        is the kind of guy who likes to 
                        hunt. He likes to theorize about 
                        prey, worthy opponents, fair 
                        game, all that. Very 
                        romanticist.  
                                (pointed)  
                        He thinks he's not a predator. 
                        You should have seen him back at 
                        that bus.  


      RESUMING our trio. Stacia notes the speedometer. 70 mph. 
      Slick, curvy roads. Wheeler ominous in his concentration. 
      Walker continues his "explanation," indicating Wheeler's 
      collection of "trophies," now including Stacia's earring.  

                                      WALKER  
                        See all these little souvenirs?  
                        Trinkets, geegaws?  

      Walker indicates the HORRIBLE THING keychain.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        He never saw the Horrible Thing. 
                        He just kept the keychain.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You call that proof?  Am I 
                        supposed to laugh?  

      Walker continues talking to Stacia, captive, hideously 
      intimate:  

                                      WALKER  
                        Your genuinely dangerous 
                        individuals? They almost never 
                        look crazy. No weird tattoos, no 
                        stitches on their face, no 
                        oddly-shaped heads. They are ... 
                        not... predictable.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You within spitting distance of 
                        having a point?  

                                      STACIA  
                        He drives. You ride. The only 
                        question is which one of you is 
                        a bigger psycho.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I told you...be polite.  

                                      STACIA  
                        My money s on the trucker here.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Is that right?  

      Wheeler's HAND moves and Walker is ready to pounce ... but 
      Wheeler is just reaching to fiddle with the radio. Static. A 
      weird Conelrad tone.  

                                                54.  


                                      WHEELER  
                        It's the ozone. Screws up 
                        reception.  

      Walker looks UP toward the night sky.  

                                      WALKER  
                        It wants to rain again.  

      And while Walker is looking / not-looking:  

      Wheeler whip-draws his pistol, cocking it, just as:  

      Walker draws his gun equally fast, pointing it at Wheeler - 
      an INCH from Stacia's nose, where Wheeler is already pointed 
      at Walker ... AS THEY PILEDRIVE ALONG AT 70  MPH.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Wait!  No ...!  

                                      WALKER  
                        Your money still on the trucker?  
                              (to Wheeler)  
                        You get me, but I get her. Give 
                        it a minute, boss.  

      Walker shifts his gun so it presses against Stacia s 
      forehead.  

      Wheeler keeps the bore between Walker's eyes.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Might be worth it.  

      Walker quickly shifts his aim back to Wheeler.  

      Stacia's EYES, millimeters from both guns, track down to 
      REALIZE that Wheeler is NOT WEARING HIS SEAT BELT - all the 
      harnesses in the front have been used to truss her up.  

      Walker purrs, enjoying the tension:  

                                      WALKER  
                        Who ... gets ... who?  

                                      STACIA  
                        Both of you ... get fucked!  

      Stacia STOMPS ON THE BRAKE while the Truck is going FULL-
      SPEED!  

      INTERCUTS:   


                                                55.  




      Wheeler's eyes POP OPEN and he's staring UP at the underside 
      of an ambulance bunk rack. IV bags dangle and the SIREN is 
      wailing.  




                                                57.  



                                      LEMMON (O.S.)  
                        Hold still, pardner - you don't 
                        need to wake up.  

      Wheeler's POV follows an IV hose running out of him. Past 
      bloody dressings. His leg immobilized in a splint. The face 
      of LEMMON - a sandy-haired, bright-eyed young EMT - looms 
      large from a LOW ANGLE.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                        Lucky.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dazed)  
                        What lucky.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        This bird watcher lady out in 
                        the middle of noplace thought 
                        she had a heart attack. Turned 
                        out to be indigestion. By the 
                        time we found her group, it 
                        started raining. So here we are, 
                        headed back to base ... pure 
                        luck, really. You lost you some 
                        blood. Arm's busted, leg's 
                        busted --  

      Lemmon holds up Stacia's switchblade.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                        -- and I guess I should just 
                        mind my own business about this, 
                        huh?  

      The whole world is spinning and Wheeler is fighting for 
        orientation. He can't hold his head up. It sags back - he's 
      got a pneumatic collar around his neck.  

      Contusions and scrapes.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Had an accident.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Now you're getting it.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Lost control.  




                                                58.  



                                      LEMMON  
                        All you have to do now is just 
                        hang on, and don't think about 
                        the bumps in the road.  

      OS SNEEZE. A hand GRABS a tissue. We already know who it is.  

      Lemmon TURNS to hand a tissue to WALKER, now REVEALED to be 
      in the adjacent bunk, less than two feet away from Wheeler!  

      Lemmon MOVES back to the cab of the ambulance.  

      As Wheeler's vision BLURS in and out of focus, Walker 
      SNEEZES a second and third time.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Three. It's always three, right.  

      Walker holds a finger to his lips. Shhhh.  

      OS undiscernable RADIO CHATTER (it should sound like the 
      weird Conelrad noise Wheeler heard in the Truck), the peal 
      of the siren OVER, highballing tires on wet roadway. We see 
      that Wheeler and Walker are STRAPPED into their respective 
      bunks, side-by-side.  

      Walker is equally bruised and battered from the wreck. He 
      holds up his free hand, the one with the tissue. It is 
      heavily bandaged. He stares wonderingly at the dressing, as 
      though impressed. 

                                      WALKER (CON'T)  
                        You bit me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dopey)  
                        What the hell are you about?  

                                      WALKER  
                        I don't understand the question.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Understand that you're fuckin 
                        dead.  

      This news strikes Walker like a gas pain. Oh, puh-leeze.  

                                      WALKER  
                        If I were you, I'd worry about 
                        them finding your Truck. I've 
                        already got my ride.  


                                                59.  


      Wheeler LUNGES against his own safety restraints. Now he's 
      mad again.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Wait. Calm down. You're going to 
                        bust a blood vessel.  
                              (almost a whisper)  
                        There's a helluva lot two guys 
                        like us could do with an 
                        ambulance like this.  

      Walker unfurls his Kleenex one-handed, like a magician, to 
      reveal a SCAPEL he has purloined.  

      HOLD on Wheeler's dawning reaction as OS the SIREN is 
      abruptly terminated.  

      Lemmon RE-ENTERS the ambulance bay.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Okay, boys 'n girls. Seat belts 
                        fastened? Luggage stowed?  

      Lemmon BENDS OVER to retrieve something from a low drawer.  

      ONLY WHEELER can see Walker SIT UP as far as the straps will 
      let him, testing his reach. Walker makes a STABBING MOTION 
      toward Lemmon's back. Yeah - good enough. As Lemmon RISES, 
      Walker RESUMES his supine position and WINKS at Wheeler.  

      Lemmon RISES between the men with two big 60cc HYPODERMICS.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                              (to DRIVER)  
                        Watch this, Vinnie. Two at once.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What's in those?  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Nothing but air, my friend.  

      Lemmon KNEELS forcefully and PLUNGES both hypos, left-right, 
      INTO the chests of Wheeler and Walker, who begin to CONVULSE 
        immediately. He GRINS as he watches them die.  

      VINNIE, the DRIVER, glances back from his driver's seat.  

                                      VINNIE  
                        Awesome. What about dessert?  




                                                60.  



      Lemmon RISES TO STANDING, and for the first time, we can SEE 
      the berth ABOVE WALKER - which contains STACIA, beaten up, 
      strapped down, IMMOBILIZED, gagged, and BUG-EYED WITH FEAR.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        We save her for later.
