      The GIRL S VOICE belongs to JO, a shy, sweet eleven-year-old 
      girl.  Her friend LACEY, a snarky tomboy, also eleven, pushes 
      her on the SWINGS in a big, well-landscaped backyard.         

                                  LACEY
                    Probably more family stuff.  His 
                    mom is such a she-beast.  

                                  JO
                    Yeah.  Maybe.  I don t know though. 

                                  LACEY
                    Or maybe he s having his puberty. 

                                  JO
                          (grossed out)
                    Lacey!  I don t think that s it.  

                                  LACEY
                    My cousin with all the boyfriends 
                    says it makes you moody and crap.
                          (pulling the swing to a 
                            stop)
                    My turn!  Extra high this time. 

      Jo gets up off the swing, as we REVERSE ANGLE ON -- 

      THE BACK DOOR, as a sweaty eleven-year-old BOY steps slowly 
      through it.  This is DANNY RYDER.  He s squeezing a RED JUMP 
      ROPE and staring straight ahead with a dazed, troubled 
      expression.  He hears the sound of Jo and Lacey s LAUGHTER.  
      He slowly turns his head toward it, as we REVERSE ON:

      The SWINGS, where Jo pushes Lacey higher and higher... until 
      suddenly, she grabs the chain, pulling her to a stop.      

      Danny now stands before them, still tightly gripping the red 
      jump rope.  He stares at them, absently.   

                                  LACEY (CONT D)
                    Watch it, numb-nuts.  I almost just 
                    took your head off.                                                                                       2.


      He doesn t respond.  A fall BREEZE blows past.  Jo stares 
      into Danny s cold, vacant eyes.  She shivers.   

                                  JO
                    Danny?  Are you... okay?  Why were 
                    you inside for so long? 

      He loosens his grip on the jump rope, and it falls to the 
      ground.  Then, he speaks, in a quiet, detached voice:     

                                  DANNY
                    I had to.  There was no other 
                    choice.  Please... don t hate me.  

      Jo and Lacey stare down at the rope, then back up at Danny, 
      their eyes filling with mounting horror.  

      We MOVE IN ON Jo s scared, innocent face, then SMASH TO:


      STUDENTS gossip outside the traditional red-brick public HIGH 
      SCHOOL, abuzz over Danny s return.  REPORTERS and CAMERA 
      CREWS move through the crowd, talking to TEENS and PARENTS.


      LACEY (now sixteen) stands before REPORTERS.  She s grown 
      from a tomboy into a beautiful, poised, confident teen -- the 
      kind of cool, fun person that other people wanna be around.    

                                  REPORTER #1
                    You were one of the two kids who 
                      discovered Judith Ryder s body.  
                    Tell us what that moment was like.

                                  LACEY
                    Oh, it was fantastic.  What little 
                    girl doesn t dream of seeing a dead 
                    body before her twelfth birthday?    

      The reporters CHUCKLE.  Lacey grins, but there s a hint of 
      anxiousness beneath her snarky, playful demeanor.        

                                  LACEY (CONT D)
                      Seriously, though... it was hard.  
                    It s still hard.  I don t like 
                    being reminded of that night, but I 
                    guess now I have no choice.                                                                                       7.


                                  REPORTER #2
                    And if you did have a choice?  

                                  LACEY
                    Are you kidding?  I wouldn t let 
                    that socio anywhere near my school.  

      The reporters REACT, loving that sound-bite.  Lacey notices 
      Jo behind them, eavesdropping.  Jo briefly locks eyes with 
      her, then turns and walks off.  Lacey sighs, watching her go.        


      Jo heads toward the school, avoiding eye contact with other 
      STUDENTS, who whisper and point when they see her.  Today s 
      not a good day in her  keep to yourself  social strategy.       

      RICO (fifteen), her cute but nerdy, socially oblivious friend-
      study buddy, rushes to catch up to her. 

                                  RICO
                    You ready for today?  It s gonna be 
                    a tough one. 

                                  JO
                    I m well aware, Rico.  Trust me.

                                  RICO
                    I prepped all night.  My mom had to 
                    make me three espresso shots.   

      Jo stops.  She turns and looks at him.

                                  JO
                    Okay, what are we talking about?

                                  RICO
                    Our pre-calculus quiz.  What are 
                    you talking about? 

                                  JO
                    Danny Ryder?
                          (off his confusion)
                    The murderer?  The one who starts 
                    today at Green Grove High?  

                                  RICO
                    I m not familiar. 

                                  JO
                    Why did you think all these 
                    reporters were here?                                                                                      8.


                                  RICO
                    Doesn t the debate team have that 
                    showdown today with Dayton Prep? 

      Jo smiles, rolling her eyes, as she and Rico head inside. 


      A sweaty, post-gym Tess opens the door, startled to find:

      Karen, on her stoop, immaculately made up and put together.  

                                  KAREN
                    Tess.  I catch you at a bad time?

                                  TESS
                    Uh, no... of course not.  Come in. 

      Karen walks past her inside.  An anxious Tess shuts the door. 


      Danny moves quickly down the street, when a VOICE stops him: 

                                  JO (O.S.)
                    Danny!  Wait!

      He turns to see Jo rushing after him.  He smiles, hopefully. 

                                  DANNY
                    Hey.  Sam kick you out, too, for 
                    cavorting with the enemy?  

                                  JO
                    Look, I know this must be hard for 
                    you.  But you can t keep coming up 
                    to me, at school, or the diner, or 
                    wherever.  It s hard for me, too.   
                          (off his sad silence)
                    You want things to magically go 
                    back to the way they were, but they 
                    can t.  Everything s different.  
                    I m different.   

                                  DANNY
                    Fair enough.  I promise I ll leave 
                    you alone. 

                                  JO
                    Okay.  Thank you. 
                          (beat)
                    You re gonna be alright.

                                  DANNY
                    That s what my mom keeps saying.
                          (then, bitterly)
                    Suddenly, she s this fountain of 
                    parental warmth and wisdom. 

      Jo considers his tough relationship with Karen.  She softens.

                                  JO
                    I m sorry about your dad.  He was 
                    always really nice to me. 

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah.  He was a definite Jo fan. 

      Jo watches Danny control his emotions: But is it real?  Danny 
      reads her skeptical expression.  He can t help but grin.                                                                                      27.


                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    You re wondering if I m mimicking 
                    human emotion, aren t you?

                                  JO
                    What?  No I m not. 

                                  DANNY
                    Don t worry about it.  After that 
                    crazy class, I m assuming pretty 
                    much everyone I see is a sociopath. 

      Jo allows a smile.  Encouraged, Danny steps toward her. 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Okay, I know we just had this whole 
                     leaving you alone  convo... but 
                    there s this party...

                                  JO
                    Danny, no.  I can t deal with...
                          (stops, realizing)
                    Wait.  Are you talking about Regina 
                    Crane s party? 

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah, that s the one. 

                                  JO
                    How do you know about that party? 

                                  DANNY
                    Because I was invited to it. 

                                  JO
                    You?  Invited?  By an actual human?   

                                  DANNY
                    By the hostess herself, actually.  
                    She s a very... friendly person.  

                                  JO
                    And you re going? 

                                  DANNY
                    Sure.  Why wouldn t I?

                                  JO
                    Oh, I don t know... maybe because 
                    most of the people who ll be there 
                    think you re a deranged psychotic 
                    homicidal monster?                                                                                     28.


                                  DANNY
                      Everyone s entitled to their 
                    opinion.  You can either isolate 
                    yourself and bury your head in the 
                    sand, or face the haters head on. 

      Jo takes this in, impressed by his social boldness. 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Of course, it d be easier to show 
                    up there with someone else.  Might 
                    take some of the edge off. 

      Jo pauses, conflicted... before uneasily making a decision:

                                  JO
                    This wouldn t make us friends. 

                                  DANNY
                    You don t even have to talk to me.  
                    I wanna be free to play the friend 
                    field, anyway.  

                                  JO
                    Friend field?  Good luck with that. 

                                  DANNY
                    Hey, the night is young. 

      Off an anxious Jo: Is she really about to do this? 

                                  KYLE (PRE-LAP)
                    A party?  Really?  Our daughter?


      Danny leads Jo down the dark, empty road.  That last body 
      shot pushed her over the edge from  drunk  to  wasted. 

                                  JO
                    That was amazing!  What the hell 
                    did you whisper to him, anyway?  

                                  DANNY
                    I don t know... something about 
                    suing him for assault and winning. 

      Jo erupts in uncharacteristic GIGGLES.  Danny watches her, 
      amused.  A dingy HONDA pulls over next to them.  The window 
      comes down... REVEALING an equally amused Lacey.    

                                  LACEY
                    Thought so.  They didn t teach you 
                    to drive in prison, huh? 

                                  JO
                    Lacey!  Danny, it s Lacey!  Lacey, 
                    Danny... Danny, Lacey...

      Lacey jumps out and helps Danny guide Jo into the backseat.

                                  DANNY
                          (to Lacey)
                    I thought you were a bitch now?

      Danny grins at her.  She glares back with a hint of a smile.


      Kyle and Tess pull open the door, shocked to find Danny 
      standing on their stoop, propping up their drunk daughter. 

                                  JO
                    Mom!  Dad!  You came!  Welcome!

      Danny passes Jo off to Kyle, who guides her into a chair.  

                                  KYLE
                          (furious, to Tess)
                    Some friend from school, huh? 

                                  TESS
                    Just stay calm.    
                          (off his lack of calm)
                    Fine, or don t.  I m gonna go get 
                    Jo some water.                                                                                      40.


      She disappears into the kitchen.  An intimidating Kyle faces 
      Danny on the stoop.  Danny smiles up at him, nervously.  

                                  DANNY
                    Sheriff.  Good to see you again. 
                          (off his anger)
                    Don t be too hard on her, sir.  
                    This is what you do in High School, 
                    right?  Go to parties?  Get drunk?

                                  KYLE
                    And how would you know?  You read 
                    about that in the prison library?

                                  DANNY
                    Juvi, actually.  Sir. 

      They stare each other down.  Tess returns with water for Jo.

                                  JO
                          (energized and babbling)
                    Mom, the party was awesome.  This 
                    dude was like,  take your shirt 
                    off, I wanna lick you  and Danny 
                    was all,  get away from her, you 
                    suck  and then the dude was all, 
                     blah, I m gonna push you now.   
                    And Regina and I totally bonded.  
                    She was like,  I want Danny,  and I 
                    said,  you can have him,  and she 
                    was all,  I ll pass him to you 
                    after, sharing is caring! 

      A horrified Kyle and Tess turn and stare at Danny. 

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah, I should probably...

      Kyle SLAMS the door in his face.  He and Tess watch Jo gulp 
      her water.  They share a look, relieved she s home safe, but 
      troubled by her sudden re-connection with Danny. 


      Jo approaches the house.  Halfway up the path, she pauses, 
      gripped by the same fear that Lacey experienced.  She pushes 
      past it, striding up to the porch and ringing the BELL.  

      Danny opens the door in boxers and a t-shirt, surprised and 
      pleased to find Jo smiling up at him, nervously.  

                                  JO
                    Hey.  Sorry, did I wake you? 

                                  DANNY
                    No, no, I was already up.

                                  JO
                    Oh, okay.  Good.  I just wanted to 
                    thank you for getting me home last 
                    night.  And for standing up for me 
                    to that wannabe rapist jock prick. 

                                  DANNY
                    I think that may actually be his 
                    full legal name. 

      He smiles, motioning for her to come in.  She steps inside. 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    So.  How s the punishment?  Daddy 
                    Dearest didn t seem too pleased 
                    when I brought you home. 

                                  JO
                    We ll see.  He d already gone into 
                    work when I woke up, and my mom was 
                    still asleep when I left.  

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe they ll go easy on you.  
                    First time offense. 

      Jo smiles grimly, doubtful.  Karen passes through.  She 
      notices Jo and reacts, pulling her into a big hug. 

                                  KAREN
                    Jo!  Look at you, you re so big... 
                    not in a fat way, just in a grown 
                    up way.  It s so good to see you.  

                                  JO
                    Good to see you too, Mrs. Ryder.                                                                                    47.


      Karen flashes her son an amused, knowing smile.  

                                  KAREN
                    Well, well, sweetheart... two days 
                    back and you ve certainly had your 
                    share of female visitors.

      Danny responds with a frosty glare, but Karen just laughs, 
      walking off into the kitchen.  Jo looks at Danny, intrigued.  

                                  JO
                    Visitors?  As in, plural?

                                  DANNY
                    As in two.  Lacey ended up sleeping 
                    over last night.

                                  JO
                    Oh!  Wow... you guys didn t... ?

                                  DANNY
                    No, we just talked and fell asleep.   
                    But let s keep it on the DL, okay?  
                    I bet that guy she s dating would 
                    love nothing more than to take it 
                    the wrong way.  

                                  JO
                    My lips are sealed.

      They share a conspiratorial smile.  Suddenly, they hear Karen 
      SCREAM OUT:

                                  KAREN (O.S.)
                    Danny!  Jo!  Get in here!

      They look at each other and rush into the kitchen--


      REPORTERS talk to shocked, grieving STUDENTS, while other 
      TEENS stand together in groups, hugging and whispering.

      Jo and Danny arrive, taking in the FRANTIC ACTIVITY.  Danny 
      turns to Jo with a nervous grin. 

                                  DANNY
                    This is gonna be bad, isn t it? 

      Jo doesn t respond.  Rico sees them and rushes over. 

                                  RICO
                    Did you hear about Regina?  

                                  JO
                    Yeah.  It s insane.   

                                  RICO
                          (abruptly, to Danny)
                    So... did you do it?

                                  DANNY
                    Excuse me?

                                  JO
                    Rico!

                                  RICO
                    I m sorry!  That s what everyone s 
                    saying.  I m not totally immune to 
                    the lures of sensationalized 
                    gossip.  

      Danny catches Jo nervously eyeing him, then quickly looking 
      away.  He turns and faces her.     

                                  DANNY
                    Jo, look at me... I didn t do this.  
                    I swear.  You believe me, right? 

      Danny searches her face with sad, desperate eyes.  Jo wants 
      to believe him... but her own eyes are full of uncertainty.  
      REPORTERS spot Danny and bolt toward him. 

                    REPORTER #1REPORTER #2
      Danny!  What was your Danny!  Danny!  When did you 
        relationship with Regina?leave the party last night?

      Danny, Jo, and Rico rush away from the reporters, heading 
      inside into the-- relative-- safety of the school.                                                                                    51.



      An angry Karen and a demoralized Danny leave the station. 

                                  KAREN
                      Questioning a minor?  Without a 
                    lawyer present?  It s contemptible. 

                                  DANNY
                    Settle down, mother.

                                  KAREN
                    I will not settle down.  Kyle 
                    Masterson is a vindictive, petty 
                    man.  He always hated me, and he 
                    resented your father s success.  
                          (then, uneasily)
                    What exactly did he ask you?                                                                                     57.


                                  DANNY
                    What do you think?  He wanted to 
                    know if I did it, obviously. 

                                  KAREN
                    Did you tell him you were home?  
                    That Lacey spent the night?

                                  DANNY
                    Can we not?  I think I ve been 
                      interrogated enough for one day. 

      He starts to walk away.  Karen calls out after him:

                                  KAREN
                    Where are you going?

      Danny doesn t respond.  Karen watches him go, worried and 
      unsettled by his odd evasiveness. 


      Jo and Rico walk together in silence.  Rico watches her.  

                                  RICO
                    That was brave, the way you stood 
                    up in assembly.  I almost broke out 
                    into hives just watching you.  

                                  JO
                    Whatever, it s not like I was 
                    destined for prom queen or 
                    anything.  But thanks.    

                                  RICO
                    You re welcome.  And you re not 
                    alone in this.  If you trust him, I 
                    trust him.  Okay?    

      A moved Jo pulls him into a grateful HUG.  TIGHT ON Rico s 
      FACE: It s clear from his smitten expression he wants to be 
      more than Jo s study buddy.  Jo looks up, surprised to see:

      DANNY, standing outside the DINER, waiting for her.   

                                  DANNY
                      I escaped.  Had to swim through the 
                    sewer, Shawshank-style.  Not as 
                    easy as it looks on AMC. 
                          (smiling nervously)
                    You got a second? 

      Jo shoots Rico a look, and he nods, understanding.  He heads 
      toward the diner, stopping in front of Danny.                                                                                    58.


                                  RICO
                    Prove me right, Danny. 
                          (intensely, overdramatic)
                    Prove me right.

      Danny hides a baffled, bemused grin, as Rico disappears 
      inside the diner.  Jo approaches him.   

                                  DANNY
                    Hope you didn t catch too much 
                    grief for that little speech.  

                                  JO
                    You stood up for me last night.  I 
                    was just returning the favor.
                          (then)
                    Sorry about my dad.  Pulling you 
                    out in front of the entire school 
                    like that, that was...

                                  DANNY
                    He was just doing his job.
                          (beat; then, anxiously)
                    Regina texted me last night. 

                                  JO
                    Texted you?  You mean... after we 
                    left the party? 

                                  DANNY
                    She wanted me to come back.  And 
                    when I said no, she... insinuated 
                    that she knew why I killed my aunt.  

      Jo reacts, stunned.  She turns suddenly and starts walking 
      away from him.  Danny rushes after her.   

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    She was probably just goading me, 
                    trying to get me to come over... 

                                  JO
                    She s dead, Danny, she died right 
                    after she sent it.  Are you really 
                    trying to tell me it meant nothing? 

                                  DANNY
                    I have no idea what it meant!  All 
                    I know is that I ignored it.  I 
                    should ve told you before, but I 
                    was afraid you d assume I killed 
                    her, just like everyone else...

      She stops, turning to face him.                                                                                    59.


                                  JO
                    Why did you kill her?

                                  DANNY
                    Jo, please, I didn t...  

                                  JO
                    Not Regina.  Your aunt.  And don t 
                    just say you can t tell me.  
                          (stepping toward him)
                    I have to know.

                                  DANNY
                    I m sorry.  I m protecting you... 

                                  JO
                    From what?  Jesus, you want this 
                    second chance, but you make it so 
                    freaking difficult by acting all 
                    weird and mysterious.  If you just 
                    tell everyone why you did it...

                                  DANNY
                    Then what?  They ll get over it?  
                    Laugh it off?  The mayor will hand 
                    me the keys to the city? 

                                  JO
                    No... but maybe they won t call you 
                    the socio anymore. 

                                  DANNY
                    They ll always call me that, but I 
                    can live with it.  It s kind of a 
                    cool, intimidating nickname. 

      He smiles, trying to ease the tension.  But Jo just stares 
      back at him. 

                                  JO
                    What do you want from me?

                                  DANNY
                    I want you to believe me about 
                    Regina.  I want you on my side.
                          (off her reluctance)
                    I may have killed someone before, 
                    but I ve never lied to you.

      Jo can t help but laugh. 

                                  JO
                    That s a real great pitch for a 
                    strong, trusting friendship.                                                                                      60.


      Danny doesn t respond.  Jo looks at him, searching his eyes 
      for that truth, that belief... before accepting she may never 
      be a hundred percent sure.  She exhales, making a decision:  

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    If you are lying to me, I swear 
                    I ll kill you.  Then I ll be the 
                    one with the intimidating nickname. 

      They share a smile, a tentative truce... and maybe the start 
      of a new friendship.  They hear a BEEP, followed by a VOICE: 

                                  ARCHIE (O.S.)
                    Hey buddy!  Murder anyone today? 

      They look up to see a CAR drive slowly by: Archie s behind 
      the wheel, Scott rides shot-gun, and Sarita and Lacey sit in 
      the backseat.  Lacey stares straight ahead, but the other 
      three glare out at Danny and Jo with vicious, hateful eyes. 

                                  JO
                    Lacey sure knows how to pick her 
                    friends, huh?  

                                  DANNY
                    She ll come around eventually. 

      Off an unruffled Danny, watching the car turn a corner...
