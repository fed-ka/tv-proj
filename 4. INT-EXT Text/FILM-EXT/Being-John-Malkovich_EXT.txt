Craig hails a taxi in his get-up. Men on the street turn
and leer at him.
CUT TO:
The girls carry Craig on their shoulders. Everyone is joyous.
CUT TO:
Craig leads the girls in a bike race. Everyone is laughing
and screaming. One of the girls notices that Craig is
riding a man's bike.
MUSIC OUT.
CUT TO:
Craig, now made up to look like a black, lesbian
separatist, hails a cab. Women look at him longingly.
CUT TO:
We tilt up the building.
MUSIC:	Perky Industrial Film Music.
TITLE:	The 7 1/2 Floor
NARRATOR (0.S.)
Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the
Mertin-Flemmer building. As you
will now be spending your work day
here, it is important that you learn
a bit about the history of this
famous floor.
DISSOLVE TO:
Its on the side of Jersey Turnpike. There is a pop and
Craig falls from nowhere into the ditch. He is soaking wet,
and now dirty from the ditch. He stands, looks confusedly
around, sees a N.J. Turnpike sign. After a moment, he goes
to the side of the road and sticks out his thumb.
CUT TO:
Lotte lands in the ditch. She is wet and ragged. Traffic
whizzes by. Craig turns on the headlights in his parked
car. They shine on Lotte. Craig steps out of the car.
LOTTE
I have to go back.
CRAIG
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
LOTTE
I have to go back now.
CRAIG
We'll talk about it in the car.
Craig helps Lotte up and toward the car.
CUT TO:
Craig waits. Lotte pops into the ditch. She's wet and slimy.
CRAIG
How was it?
LOTTE
I have to go back tonight. At eight
Exactly.
CRAIG
Why?
LOTTE
Don't crowd me, Craig.
CUT TO:
Craig waits by his car, checks his watch. "Pop!"
Erroll
plops into the ditch, wet and unkempt. He looks around,
sees Craig, charges him with a yell and gives him an
enormous bear hug.
ERROLL
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thousand times, thank you!
CRAIG
(gasping for air)
Tell your friends.
ERROLL
Oh, I will, and I have many,
many friends and associates, my
friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters
Anonymous. All of them fat and alone
like me, all of them dream of being
someone else, all of them with John
Malkovich as their second choice!
CUT TO:
With a gasp and a wail of release, Lotte pops into the
ditch. She is soaking wet and breathes heavily. She
just lies there.
CUT TO:
There is a pop and Craig lands in the ditch.
CUT TO:
Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against
the wall. After a moment, Maxine emerges from the building
and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
distance.
CUT TO:
Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World
in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
huddled and shivering and soaking wet.
CRAIG
So how was it?
MALKOVICH
That... was... no... simulation.
CRAIG
I know. I'm sorry...
MALKOVICH
I have been to the dark side. I have
seen a world that no man should ever
see.
CRAIG
Really? For most people it's a rather
pleasant experience. What exactly did
you...
MALKOVICH
This portal is mine and must be sealed
up forever. For the love of God.
CRAIG
With all respect, sir, I discovered
that portal. Its my livelihood.
MALKOVICH
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
you in court!
Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.
CRAIG
(calling after him)
And who's to say I won't be seeing
what you're seeing... in court?
Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.
MOTORIST
Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!
Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
and hits him on the head.
CUT TO:
It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
them up. The safari men laugh.
SAFARI MAN
Well, there monkeys ain't going
nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
brews 'fore the boss comes back...
The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.
CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
Son, untie your mother and me!
Quickly! Before the great bald
chimp-men return.
A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
speaks.
CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
Hurry, Elijah!
SAFARI MAN
Why you little bastard!
Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.
DISSOLVE TO:
Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
shakes his head "no."
CUT TO:
We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted
street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns
the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and
Lotte's building.
CUT TO:
The marquee reads:
World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig
Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.
CUT TO:
The Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S.
Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John
Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's "Equus."
CUT TO:
A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the
street. She is dirty but determined.
CUT TO:
A dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and
cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually
merges with the landscape.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
CHYRON:
LATER THAT WEEK
Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
everything is painted gray:
the buildings, the streets,
the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
street looks up.
MALKOVICH
(fifty voices)
Greetings, my lowly subjects.
FLORIS
Great things, my lonely subtext?
MALKOVICH
(rolls his eyes)
Boy, be careful what you wish for.
(to Floris)
Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
will you?
Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.
MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
(to the people on the street)
I am bored. You will dance for your
king now.
Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
void of expression. Malkovich laughs.
MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
Faster! Faster, my little trained
monkeys!
The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
help, nobody dares.
CUT TO:
Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:
A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT
This place is filled with life:
Colorful birds, lizards,
cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.
ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
Must you take this terrible demon
on yourself, my love?
LOTTE
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
Malkovich and destroy him from the
inside. If not me, who?
ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
If there was any way I could go in
your place. But I'm only a monkey
and...
LOTTE
(puts finger to his lips)
Hush, sweetheart.
Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
embrace.
LOTTE
(to the animals)
I'll be with you always, my friends.
Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
rejoin you with wings and a beak.
ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
and a halo.
Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.
PARROT
(softly)
Good-bye. Good-bye.
DISSOLVE TO:
A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
the others, and enters the building.
CUT TO:
