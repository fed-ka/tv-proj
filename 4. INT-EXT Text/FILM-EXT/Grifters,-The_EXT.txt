AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
area.
AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
and watchful.
WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
SPLIT SCREEN.
SCENE TWO:
Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
to open the trunk.
AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
shuts the trunk, walks away.
Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
the right.
SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
SCENE THREE:
A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
SIMULTANEOUSLY:
SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
though it were a file drawer.
AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
Lilly moves.
AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
tickets into her bag.
ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
carefully files the betting slips.
AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
more bets.
CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
shift: odds 26-1.
CALLER (O.S.)
And they're off!
AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
gets out. He's suspicious at first.
COP
Sir? Everything all right?
The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
straightens, smiling through his pain.
ROY
Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
think.
The con's suspicion changes to concern.
COP
Want us to take you to a doctor?
ROY
No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
anyway. Still got a lot of clients
to see.
COP
Take it easy, now.
ROY
Oh, I will.
Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
it from the track entrance.
AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
bag inside.
CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
shoulder, closes the trunk.
A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
basement garage.
AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
with her key, enters.
Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
LILLY
I'm done here. Do I come back to
Baltimore?
The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
on it.
HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
AN ANGLE on the exit doors toward the parking lot. Lilly
comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her,
falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile.
REVERSE ANGLE, as Lilly approaches her car. BOBO JUSTUS, 50,
a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands
leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind
sunglasses.
LILLY
Hi, Bobo.
BOBO
Did I buy you that dress, you piece
of shit?
Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to
play this.
LILLY
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I
work for.
BOBO
You work for me, huh? Then I just
may flush you down the toilet.
Drive me to the Durando.
Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods
convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the
wheel. The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the
gate.
A tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego.
CAMERA PANS with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the
entrance, then PANS UP the balconied facade.
Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
over the side.
Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's
raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
to her.
BOBO
Almost forgot. That ten grand of
yours. It's in the envelope by the
door.
LILLY
(tries for animation)
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
BOBO
You want a drink?
LILLY
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I
still gotta drive back up to Los
Ang-gleez.
BOBO
See your son, huh? Well, that's
nice. A side of you I didn't know,
Lilly.
Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. It's vital
that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue.
LILLY
He's a good kid. A salesman.
BOBO
On the square, huh? And how are you
making out these days? Stealing
much?
Bobo's being jolly now. Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly,
too.
LILLY
From you? My folks didn't raise any
stupid kids.
Bobo's joshing now. He raises a humorous eyebrow.
BOBO
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
LILLY
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a
buck here and a buck there. Not
enough to notice.
BOBO
(honest approval)
That's right. Take a little, leave
a little.
LILLY
A person that don't look out for
himself is too dumb to look out for
anybody else. He's a liability,
right, Bobo?
BOBO
(this is his creed)
You're a thousand percent right!
LILLY
Or else he's working an angle. If
he doesn't steal a little, he's
steeling big.
BOBO
You know it, Lilly.
LILLY
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I
don't know what there is about it,
but it somehow makes you look
taller.
BOBO
(delighted)
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of
people been telling me the same
thing.
LILLY
Well, you can tell them I said
they're right.
(looks at sky)
I better get going. Roy'll wonder
where I am.
BOBO
Worries about his mother, eh? Give
him a hug for me.
LILLY
I will. So long, Bobo.
Lilly leaves the balcony. Bobo eats more orange, looking out
at the ocean. His expression is stern but calm.
A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los
Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main door.
KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved
white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk
in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small cassette
recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot
at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on
patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out to
the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and
watches him approach.
ROY
(cheerful, confident)
Whadaya say?
KAGGS
(uptight, minimal)
Hello.
Roy continues on and enters the building.
A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
though afraid it's raining out there.
ROY
This really is it. Union Station.
Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
good mood and ignores her bad temper.
MYRA
I don't see why we have to take the
train.
ROY
Because it's comfortable.
Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
MYRA
What if we want to drive somewhere
while we're there?
ROY
We'll rent a car.
They start for the station.
MYRA
Big spender.
ROY
You ain't seen nothin.
The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
ROY
You were right, I had to get out of
that hospital. Nothing wrong with
me any more.
MYRA
(purring)
I'll sign that affidavit.
ROY
Great to get away, take it easy.
Next week, I'll get back to work.
MYRA
You already went back to work.
ROY
(confused)
What?
MYRA
(indulgent smile)
I watched you. Working the tap on
those soldier boys.
ROY
(elaborate innocence)
Working the what?
MYRA
Oh, come on, Roy.
She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
bright child.
MYRA
The tap. What you do for a living.
ROY
I'm a salesman.
MYRA
You're on the grift. Same as me.
ROY
(demonstrating patience)
Myra, I'm not following this.
MYRA
(demonstrating
exasperation)
Roy, you're a short-con operator.
And a good one, I think. Don't talk
to me like I'm another square.
Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
mind.
ROY
You talk the lingo. What's your
pitch?
MYRA
The long end. Big con.
ROY
(shaking his head)
Nobody does that single-o.
MYRA
I was teamed ten years with the
best in the business. Cole Langley.
ROY
I've heard the name.
MYRA
It was beautiful. And getting
better all the time.
ROY
(skeptical)
Is that right?
MYRA
(enthusiasm building)
It is, Roy! And now, right now,
it's the perfect time, the best
time since I've been in the game.
New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
the street.
MYRA (V.O.)
All over the southwest, you've got
these businessmen, they were making
money when everybody was making
money, they think that means
they're smart.
Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
attache case.
MYRA (V.O.)
They still got money, but they need
more money, and that's just the
kind of guy Cole and me like.
Roy and Myra at the table.
MYRA
He didn't think they were risks. He
was so good, Roy, he could just
play with the mark.
ROY
And when he got serious?
MYRA
He'd explain he had to have cash,
so there wouldn't be any paper
trail for the SEC. And a lot of
cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
least we ever took was forty
thousand, and the most was one
hundred eighty-five thousand
dollars! From one sucker!
ROY
I thought these people were broke.
MYRA
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
had savings accounts, stocks to
sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
a lot of money, when they put their
minds to it.
Or when I put their minds to it. I
stayed with them, that's the
roper's job, made them get up every
penny they could raise, turn it all
over to Cole.
ROY
And a month later, the sucker calls
the cops and you're on the run.
MYRA
No no! He never calls the cops, not
after we give him the blow-off.
ROY
Yeah? How?
Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo,
each carrying an attache case.
MYRA (V.O.)
Our buy was in the computer, we
were rich, he should come collect.
Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
MYRA
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
rolling in dough, lived wherever we
wanted, only pulled two or three
scams a year.
ROY
What happened to Cole?
MYRA
(suddenly evasive)
He retired.
ROY
Where?
MYRA
Upstate.
ROY
Upstate where?
MYRA
Atascadero.
ROY
That's where they keep the
criminally insane, isn't it?
Myra turns her face away.
Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
MYRA
He retired, and that's it. But I
didn't. I'm still the best long-con
roper you'll ever see.
Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
his questions drop.
ROY
I just bet you are, too. And now
you're trying to rope me.
MYRA
(pushing enthusiasm)
Join up with you! I watched you,
Roy, I've been watching you,
wondering if I should talk about
this at all, or maybe just...
(shrug)
ROY
Take a hike, you mean?
MYRA
I need a partner, Roy. I need an
inside man, and you're it. You
could be as wonderful as Cole.
ROY
(dubious)
I don't know, Myra, I never had
partners. I never needed them.
MYRA
Not to take soldiers for a hundred
bucks. But how about taking a bank
president for a hundred grand?
Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
pats his hand.
MYRA
Think about it. Okay?
ROY
(easy to promise)
Sure.
A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
himself.
ROY
Long con. I'm the one's been
conned. Who needs this?
He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
the room.
Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
DRIVER
Here he comes.
MYRA
I see him.
Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
shifts into gear.
MYRA (CONT'D)
Wait. Hold it.
DRIVER
That's the guy we're following.
MYRA
Just wait.
Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
out of her room in b.g.
MYRA (CONT'D)
Ah.
Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
drives to the street.
MYRA (CONT'D)
Now we follow her.
DRIVER
You're the boss.
AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
but not looked at.
AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
surprised, looks the same way.
MAN'S POV: The parking area.
PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
concentrates, adjusting the focus.
MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
admiring him.
BLONDE
You stay down real good.
ROY
One of my talents.
BLONDE
(pointing upward)
Your mother's calling.
Roy looks up.
AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
up.
PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
blonde.
ROY
Naughty.
He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself.
MYRA
Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city.
MYRA
You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.
Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she
earlier waited in the cab.
AN ANGLE through the windshield at Myra, settling down to
wait, looking at the motel.
Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast,
making the turn, racing away. CAMERA PANS to Myra's Cadillac,
pulling away from the curb, following. CAMERA HOLDS with the
two cars receding in b.g.
Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on
their way out. Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks
again.
He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room,
then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler
had been. He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his
watch, turns away.
ROY
(disgusted)
Thanks a lot, Lilly.
He walks off.
Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front
parking area of a new small motel. The car brakes to a stop.
AN ANGLE from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly
by, while, in b.g., Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as
though she's stiff and tired. Lilly enters the motel office.
Motel in b.g. The blue Cadillac, having turned around and
come back, pulls off onto the shoulder of the road about
fifty yards short of the motel.
AN ANGLE on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler
and leans in.
Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her
room, shutting the door behind her.
CU, the door, with its number. CAMERA PANS to pick up Myra,
approaching. She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler,
smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on
the trunk.
Then she turns to the room. She takes the keys from her
pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over
the lock.
ESTABLISHING SHOT. A plane lands.
MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
speed, alone on the highway.
Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
curb half a block away.
The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
light next to the public door from the interior hall.
AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
GO TO BLACK.
Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
131.
LILLY
She was in her nightgown, you know,
the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
and the Ice bucket and she just got
into the wrong room by mistake.
