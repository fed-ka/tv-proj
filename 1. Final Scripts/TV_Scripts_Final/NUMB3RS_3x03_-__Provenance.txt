  GUARD #1 walks a hallway lined with paintings, doing his 
  rounds.  He walks TOWARD CAMERA, clears frame and is in...

22INT. MUSEUM - UTILITY HALLWAY - NIGHT 

  GUARD #1 moves down the Utility Hallway (no art, should look 
  like a service hallway, hence no security cameras).  He 
  arrives at a staircase, turns and heads down the stairs as...  

  A beat later, at the opposite end of the Utility Hallway... 
  an elevator opens.  A THIEF, mask, gloves, backpack, gets off 
  the elevator and moves down the Utility Hallway.  He arrives 
  at a door marked  Museum Personnel Only.   He slides a key-
  card through a reader.  The door CLICKS open.  He enters.

  INT. MUSEUM - UTILITY ROOM - NIGHTA3A3

  A/C, ducts, wires, etc.  The THIEF removes a PVR device from 
  his backpack.  Taps into the MUSEUM SERVER.  He hits a button 
  on the PVR device.  The DISPLAY flickers: we see SECURITY 
  VIDEO OF THE EMPTY MAIN GALLERY.  He hits another button, an 
  upper corner display flashes:  RECORD.   MATCH CUT TO:

  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - NIGHT33

  SAME SECURITY VIDEO OF THE EMPTY MAIN GALLERY on a central 
  monitor in Museum Master Control.  REVEAL GUARD #2 at a bank 
  of monitors showing security video of different rooms, camera 
  angles.  He switches from the Main Gallery on the central 
  monitor to... A STAIRCASE where GUARD #1 is now descending.

  GUARD #1 descends the stairs to a landing.  He looks through 
  an open doorway into the Main Gallery.  Off his POV of the

  EMPTY MAIN GALLERY, now on the Thief s PVR display, being 
  recorded.  The Thief hits a button, switches to the SECURITY 
  VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE where GUARD #1 is standing.  

  INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUSA5A5

  Satisfied that the Main Gallery is secure, GUARD #1 turns and 
  heads back up the stairs.

  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - CONTINUOUSB5B5

  GUARD #2 watches as GUARD #1 ascends the stairs.  He starts 
  to clear the security camera frame, as we...  MATCH CUT TO:

  SECURITY VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE, but on the Thief s display. 
  GUARD #1 clears security camera frame.  The Thief hits a 
  button on the PVR device, the display flashes:  RECORD.   
  He s now recording SECURITY VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE, empty.

  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - NIGHT55

  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors.  On the central 
  monitor, he punches up the MUSEUM STAIRCASE, empty, as... 

  INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - SIMULTANEOUSA6A6

  We FIND the Thief descending the stairs to the landing.  He 
  opens his backpack, removes a set of hi-tech telescoping 
  tubes, which he extends and screws into a base.  He then 
  removes a fiber-optic fabric material, attaches it.  He pops 
  smoke, revealing LASERS criss-crossing the gallery.  A set of 
  three closely spaced beams guard the immediate perimeter.

  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - NIGHTB6B6

  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors.  On the central 
  monitor he punches up the MAIN GALLERY, empty, as...

  INT. MUSEUM - MAIN GALLERY - NIGHT66

  Reveal the Thief s rigid-tent construction  fiber-optic gate  
  which he slides into place using an optic levelling device.  
  The lasers arc over the top, completing their circuit.  This 
  first set of lasers defeated, the Thief slides through the 
  gate.  He looks ahead at his target: A PISSARRO PAINTING (of 
  a Paris street).  More lasers criss-cross in his path.  He 
  bends and contorts past the first set of lasers, picking his 
  way through, as...        NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    3.



  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - NIGHTA7A7

  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors, punching up different 
  camera angles.  The MAIN GALLERY still appears empty...

  INT. MUSEUM - MAIN GALLERY - NIGHTB7B7

  The Thief works through the last set of lasers, arrives at 
  his goal... The Pissarro.

  INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY MASTER CONTROL - NIGHT77

  Resume GUARD #2 eyeing the monitors.  He checks a central 
  clock overhead: 2:33 am.  He punches up the Main Gallery on 
  the big central screen, stares at the Main Gallery clock: 
  CLOSE ON THE CLOCK: 2:29 am.  Puzzled, he gets on his radio --

                              GUARD #2
                Hey Jimmy, check out Gallery One, 
                  would ya...
                      (off radio static/silence)
                  ...Jimmy?  You there?

  Off Guard #2, concerned.

  INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - NIGHT88

  On the landing of the staircase off the Utility Hallway, 
  below a camera, GUARD #1 lies, mouth taped, plasti-cuffed.

  INT. MUSEUM - MAIN GALLERY - NIGHT99

  The THIEF presses a button on a hand-held device: four motion 
  sensor lights built into the wall at the four corners of the 
  painting turn off.  The Thief takes down the painting, 
  removes it from the frame, slides it into a velvet bag.  As 
  he attaches this bag to his backpack... AN ALARM SOUNDS!  The 
  MAZE OF LASERS switches off.  OVERHEAD FLOODLIGHTS beam down 
  from above, flooding the Main Gallery with bright light. 

  INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - NIGHT1010

  GUARD #2 descends the stairs, wary.  He arrives at the door 
  to the Main Gallery, finds it open.  He looks up to see... 
  The Thief.  The THIEF pulls a TASER, zaps GUARD #2, takes him 
  down... WE FOLLOW the Thief as he vaults up the stairs to...

  INT. UTILITY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUSA11A11

  ...the Utility Hallway, where he passes the tied up GUARD #1 
  and races for the elevator.

  He slides a key-card through a reader.  The elevator door 
  opens and he enters.  The door closes and he s gone.

  through...

                No sign of outside entry -- guy 
                must ve come in during business, 
                laid in wait.  He had key-card 
                access to the whole building, 
                could ve hid out anywhere.

                              DON

                              DAVID
                He had a mask -- guards didn t get 
                a look.

                What d he walk off with?

  They continue into...

  INT. MUSEUM - MAIN GALLERY - CONTINUOUS1212

  ...where they see the empty space on the wall, the discarded 
  frame, the  fiber-optic gate  the Thief left behind being 
  dusted for prints.

  David hands Don a PHOTO OF THE STOLEN PISSARRO PULLED FROM 
  THE MUSEUM CATALOGUE...

                              DAVID 
                Museum curator, Arthur Ruiz.  Home 
                in bed, when he got the call.    

  Don crosses with David.

                              DON 
                Mr. Ruiz, Don Eppes, FBI.  How you 
                holding up?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                It s been a rather rough night.

                              DON
                  I understand.  What can you tell me 
                about your security?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                We re a small museum, but our  
                system s state of the art.

                              DAVID
                What about changes in routine, 
                security guard rosters... 

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                You re thinking one of my people 
                had something to do with this --

                              DON
                We ll need to see a list.

                              DAVID 
                And any video surveillance.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                Of course... 
                      (ruminates)
                That Pissarro was our most valuable 
                piece.  And frankly, the timing 
                couldn t be worse.

                              DON
                Why s that?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                The painting was scheduled to begin 
                a major tour next month.

                              DON 
                You re insured though?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Actually, the Pissarro was on loan 
                from a private owner in Glendale.  

                              DON
                Has the owner been notified?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                A few minutes ago.  He s out of 
                town on vacation.

                              DAVID
                Must be a generous guy, loaning out 
                  something so valuable.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Actually, one advantage of loaning 
                  a painting to a museum is the 
                savings on an insurance policy -- 
                  assumption being a secure museum is 
                as safe as a bank vault -- I ll get 
                you that personnel list.

  Ruiz heads off.  Don and David take in the scene.

                              DAVID
                So much for safe assumptions.

  Don, Megan, David and Tollner...

                              DON
                  ...Nazis?  You re saying they stole 
                this painting during the war?

                              TOLLNER
                The provenance shows a pattern of 
                Nazi looted art I ve seen before.

                              DAVID
                  ...Looted how?

                              TOLLNER
                When the Nazis came to power, they 
                passed laws forcing Jews to register 
                  property.  It provided them virtual 
                   shopping lists.   They looted homes 
                by day, shipped the families off to 
                the camps the same night. 

                              DON
                  ...Eliminating the witnesses.

                              TOLLNER
                Except for the few who survived.

                              MEGAN
                      (digests this, then)
                One thing we know -- whoever stole 
                the Pissarro had skills.

                              TOLLNER 
                The Bureau keeps a database of 
                career art thieves, I d start there.

                              DAVID
                How big s this database?

                              TOLLNER
                Few hundred names at least.

                              MEGAN
                      (exchanges shrug with Don)
                Few hundred shouldn t be a problem.      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    11.



1717EXT. CALSCI CAMPUS - PICNIC AREA - DAY   

  LARRY and AMITA observe as Charlie holds a D-battery with a 
  screw attached by tiny magnet to the + terminal.  As he 
  touches the - terminal with a copper wire, the screw spins.

                              AMITA
                This is the perfect way to show 
                that electric and magnetic forces 
                are two sides of the same coin. 

                              DON (O.S.)
                ...You know they ve already 
                invented a tool for that.

  They turn to see Don walking up, carrying a binder.

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, but this is cooler.  See, the 
                screw is attached to the battery by 
                  a magnet.  The current running 
                through the wire causes it to spin.

                              DON
                This for a classroom show-and-tell?

                              LARRY
                Charlie and I are giving a joint 
                lecture on circular motion. 

                              CHARLIE
                The magnet s movement is governed 
                by Fleming s Left Hand Rule.

                              DON
                ...Left hand rule?  

                              LARRY
                Magnetic field... current... 
                  direction of resulting path.

                              CHARLIE
                The lecture also touches on the 
                Coriolis force --

                              CHARLIE
                -- The same principle that causes 
                  hurricanes to spin counterclockwise 
                in our hemisphere.

                              DON
                Toilets, too, right?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    12.

                Actually to observe the Coriolis 
                force you d need lab conditions and 
                a water tank five meters in size --

                              DON 
                -- I get it.  No toilets.  

                              CHARLIE
                What s up?

                              DON
                  A Pissarro was stolen last night 
                from The Roland Museum -- 

                              LARRY
                -- Camille Pissarro, paterfamilias 
                of the Impressionists --

                              DON
                -- They were in and out in less 
                than six minutes...

  Don hands Charlie a binder.

                              DON (cont'd)
                The Bureau maintains a database of 
                art thieves... Names, M.O.s... I 
                figure you can work through it a 
                lot faster than we can.

                              AMITA
                Maybe we could use a  Quadratic 
                  Discriminant Analysis -- 

                              CHARLIE

                In this case, identifying variables 
                of a particular theft -- such as 
                the type of art, museum, security,  
                other specifics of the crime --

                -- What you re saying is the theft 
                will lead us to the thief.

                              CHARLIE
                There has to be something to this 
                museum or this work of art that 
                proved attractive to your thief.
                      (off Don s look)
                Think of a field of flowers...

  BEGIN AUDIENCE VISION

  WE SEE A FIELD OF WILDFLOWERS, all different varieties...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                We know certain types of flowers 
                attract certain types of insects... 

  ZOOM IN ON A BEE alighting on a specific flower...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d) (CONT D)
                The attraction is based on specific 
                  characteristics of the flower: 
                color, shape, scent...

  Again, THE FIELD OF WILDFLOWERS.  IN FAST-MOTION WE VECTOR-
  TRACK the BEE alighting on various flowers of the same type.  

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                An insect will alight on only 
                certain flowers...

  MATCH OVERLAY a city grid with targets -- METROPOLITAN 
  MUSEUM ,  WALLENSTEIN GALLERY , etc. -- CGI-highlighting in 
  synch with the flowers visited by the BEE.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                ...Just as a thief is attracted to 
                only certain targets -- based on 
                their characteristics...

  ZOOM IN AGAIN ON THE SINGLE FLOWER.  IT DISSOLVES INTO AN 
  IMAGE OF A FLOWER ON CANVAS -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL a framed 
  painting on a museum wall (think Van Gogh s  Sunflowers )...









                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    14.

                Like the composition of a flower, 
                we know the characteristics of this 
                most recent theft.  We can compare 
                this data with past thefts...

  A pair of black gloved hands yank the painting off the wall.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d) (CONT D)
                To see if we can identity the work 
                of a similar thief, or thieves...  

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE (cont d) (CONT D)
                Using a  Quadratic Discriminant 
                  Analysis,  we should be able to 
                quickly and efficiently boil down 
                your suspect pool...

                              LARRY
                From hundreds to perhaps a handful.

1818INT. MUSEUM - GALLERY - DAY   

  Megan and the museum curator, Ruiz, walk and talk...

                              MEGAN
                Did you know about the Pissarro s 
                  provenance, Mr. Ruiz?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Certainly.  As the museum s 
                curator, I have to know.

                              MEGAN
                Doesn t sound like you were 
                troubled by indications it had once 
                been looted by the Nazis.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                It was a concern.  But we did our 
                due diligence.  The owner s 
                  paperwork was in order.  We were 
                  satisfied with the assurances he 
                provided us.

                              MEGAN
                  Especially given the importance of 
                an acquisition like this one.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                      (beat, eyeing Megan)
                There are many paintings with 
                  problematic provenances, Agent 
                Reeves.  That doesn t mean all of 
                them are Nazi looted art.

                              MEGAN
                Of course, none of those other 
                paintings have increased your 
                admission revenue by fifty percent.

  Ruiz holds Megan s look.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                I don t deny the Pissarro s been a 
                boon to a small museum like ours.
                      (prickly)
                Maybe the Guggenheim can afford to 
                be more selective, but we can t.

                              MEGAN
                One man s taint is another man s 
                  treasure, is that it?

  Off Megan, fixing Ruiz with a look.

                  Survival.  Pissarro was Jewish, 
                working in Paris at the time of the 
                Dreyfus Affair.  Anti-Semitic mobs 
                were roaming the streets, he feared 
                for his life.

                He wanted me to see the world the 
                way he saw it.  Such is the 
                inherent flaw of fatherhood.

                              CHARLIE
                  Analyzing past thefts for common 
                  variables with our current crime, 
                I ve succeeded in identifying three 
                  suspects... Michael Ness, Ben 
                Larkin, and Ronald Wheeler.  

                              TOLLNER
                Ness is in a prison in Turkey -- 

                              DAVID
                -- There s a good time.

                              TOLLNER
                And I think Larkin s dead.

  David clicks.  Then looks up, impressed.

                              DAVID

                      (smiles)
                I know my art thieves, Professor 
                Eppes, but I have to say I m quite 
                  impressed with how quickly you were 
                able to comb through our database.

  Charlie smiles, then --

                Homeland Security has no record of 
                Wheeler entering the country.

  Don, David and Tollner move through...

                              DAVID
                We searched Wheeler s room, found 
                plans of the museum, electronic 
                gear, a key-card he d cloned --

                              DON

  Find Megan at her desk.

                I might have a suspect... 8 years 
                ago, a Mrs. Erika Hellman was 
                notified by the Art Loss Register 
                that the present owner of the 
                Pissarro was trying to sell it --

                              DON
                -- Art Loss Register?

                              TOLLNER
                  A database of lost or looted 
                  artworks.  I ve often seen it come 
                into play with Holocaust claims.  

                              MEGAN
                -- Like this one.  The owner s art 
                dealer checked the Pissarro against 
                the Registry and found Mrs. 
                  Hellman s claim it had been looted 
                from her family by the Nazis...

                              DON
                So, what happened?

                She sued the owner -- name s Peyton 
                  Shoemaker -- and lost.  Apparently, 
                there was insufficient 
                  documentation.

                Not surprising.  The Nazis were 
                very good at covering their tracks.

                              MEGAN
                  According to DMV, she s 78.

  Don seems skeptical.

                              TOLLNER
                There are people she could have 
                paid to do this, Eppes.

  On Don, knowing where to go next.

                The painting hung in our home in 
                Berlin.  When I was a little girl, 
                my father used to pretend we were 
                the people in the painting.  He 
                promised me one day when I was old 
                enough, we d go there, to Paris...

                wouldn t be thrilled to actually 
                have the painting... You see, the 
                Nazis took everything.  I don t have

                What my grandson means is we didn t 
                lose the painting on the merits.  We

                Mrs. Hellman s story s not all that 
                unusual.  Similar thing happened to 
                a woman who got several Klimt 
                  paintings back from an Austrian 
                national museum.  They fought her 
                for years.

                              DON
                Hard to blame her.  I mean, these 
                works of art are family legacies.

                              MEGAN
                Guess the Federal court didn t see 
                it that way for Mrs. Hellman --

                              TOLLNER
                Or maybe the owner -- this guy 
                  Shoemaker  -- just had more bucks to 
                throw at a high-priced legal team.

                  A reputable dealer in Paris... 
                Right after the war... My father 
                was in the Army, on leave in Paris, 
                he stopped in a shop, saw the 
                painting and fell in love.  

                              MEGAN
                And he never questioned its origin?

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                After the war, it was difficult to 
                know where anything came from.  So

                  a legitimate dealer.  I have the

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                Twelve thousand dollars was a great 
                deal of money in those days.

                      (re: his desktop computer)
                The museum records all their 
                security cameras digitally.  I 
                pulled these archived MPEG files 
                from three months ago...

  David punches up the security video.  WE SEE a date-stamped 
  image of JOEL HELLMAN moving around the Pissarro.

                You think he was casing the place?

                              DAVID
                He approached Tucci 3 years ago --

                -- About hiring Michael Ness to 
                pull off the theft of the Pissarro.

                              TOLLNER 
                But then Ness got himself caught, 
                couldn t do the job.

                              MEGAN
                Looks like Joel Hellman wasn t 
                willing to take no for an answer.

  BURN IN:

  INT. FBI OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY  (DAY 3)3030

  Don sits across from Joel Hellman.

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I don t know any guy named Ronald 
                Wheeler.  Or how he ended up dead.  
                  I haven t done anything.

                              DON
                Then how do you explain your 
                  relationship with Peter Tucci? 

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                That was over three years ago.

                              DON
                About the time the courts decided 
                the case against you... 

                              JOEL HELLMAN 
                I lost my cool.  It was a stupid 
                thing to do...

                              DON
                  I understand how you feel.  I mean, 
                you re all your grandmother had 
                left and you couldn t do anything 
                to help her....

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                They embarrassed her.  Brought in 
                doctors, tested her memory, made 
                her live through things that --

  Joel stops himself.  Don takes out video surveillance stills 
  from the Museum.  Lays them down in front of Joel.

                              DON 
                So you decided to do something 
                about it... 

  Joel s embarrassed that Don has the photos.

                              DON (cont'd)
                These photographs of you at the 
                museum, this wasn t three years 
                ago.  It was three months ago.

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I go a lot...  I don t know, 
                somehow it made me feel better to 
                be close to it.

                              DON
                Maybe even better if you had it...

  A beat, as Joel Hellman considers his situation...

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I told you, I haven t done anything.

  INT. FBI OFFICE - COFFEE ROOM - DAY3131

  Don enters, Megan, David and Tollner confab...

                              DAVID
                What do you think?

                              DON
                I think he probably thought about 
                stealing the Pissarro three years 
                ago and decided against it.  

                              TOLLNER
                Doesn t look like he made any real 
                efforts to cover his tracks either.

                              MEGAN
                Which leaves the owner, Peyton 
                  Shoemaker, and an insurance scam.  

                              DAVID
                Nice theory, but so far I can t find 
                any paper trail between Shoemaker 
                and our thief, Wheeler.  No payments 
                to a middle man, nothing.

                              DON
                C mon this painting has to be 
                  somewhere.  It can t just disappear 
                into thin air, can it?   

  INT. CHARLIE S OFFICE - LATE DAY3232

  Amita surveys crime data on a laptop, while Charlie plots it 
  on a pair of diffusion maps showing the world.  WE SEE red 
  pushpins connected by strings (heavier flows of art along 
  specific networks indicated by a higher number of strings 
  along those routes), the largest concentration ending up in 
  China.  Larry enters, takes in the scene.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    34.

                              AMITA
                  ...Here s another.  In 2001, a 
                Degas looted by the Nazis was found 
                in Geneva.  The dealer planned to 
                sell it to a collector in Shanghai.

  Charlie plots it, another pin and string going to China.

                              LARRY
                How goes the Network Diffusion 
                  Probability Model?

                              CHARLIE
                The crime data on the trafficking 
                of Nazi looted art is bearing 
                  significant fruit --

                              LARRY
                -- Poisoned fruit.

                              AMITA
                The numbers are staggering.  The 
                Nazis looted hundreds of thousands 
                of artworks, nearly a fifth of all 
                European art at the time...

                              CHARLIE
                ...A lot of it is still out there -- 
                museums, collectors, dealers...

                              LARRY
                It s appalling...  Blood trade. 

                              CHARLIE
                I m starting to see a pattern, the 
                heaviest flow of artworks running 
                along these networks --

                              LARRY
                -- China seems a prime destination.

                              AMITA
                So we should start concentrating on 
                networks supplying to China.

  Charlie nods.  His CELL RINGS.  He doesn t answer.

                              LARRY 
                You and Alan still fighting?

                              CHARLIE
                It s a standoff.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    35.

                One more chestnut from my 
                  painstaking study of the great 
                  artists...  Did you know Monet s 
                father wanted him to be a grocer?

                              CHARLIE
                Good thing he didn t listen.

                              LARRY
                Fathers imposing their wills on 
                their sons is the stuff of legend.

                              CHARLIE
                This is hardly so grand.  The last 
                message he left equated my refusal 
                to take out the garbage with my 
                supposed commitment-phobia and 
                failure to settle down.  It s nuts.

                              AMITA
                Maybe there s some truth to it.
                      (off Charlie s look)
                ...Just saying.

                              CHARLIE
                      (covering quickly)
                ...Where were we? -- China, right?

                              CHARLIE
                You re saying I should challenge my 
                father?

                              LARRY
                I m saying that fathers and sons 
                are born at odds.  Literally.  Like 
                staring through a telescope, 
                there s no way you both can see the 
                same object in the same light... 
                All one can do is adjust one s 
                vision.   

  As Charlie considers, Larry spies Charlie s stack of papers.

                              LARRY (cont'd)
                What s with all the red marginalia?

                              CHARLIE
                Our network analysis came up empty.  
                I found all these leads to China, 
                but still there s no sign of the 
                  Pissarro.  I must ve miscalculated.

                Some of the greatest errors in 
                  cosmology have come not from poor 
                math but from poor assumptions.

                              CHARLIE
                What poor assumption?

                              LARRY
                Current wisdom holds that the Nazi 
                  associations have greatly 
                  compromised the prospects for sale 
                of the painting on the blackmarket.

                              CHARLIE
                  Compromised yes, but eliminated no. 

                              LARRY
                But yet you can find no market to 
                which you can trace a sale.

                              CHARLIE
                Right.  China seemed the best bet, 
                but Don s come up empty.

                              LARRY 
                Then perhaps the Pissarro isn t for 
                sale anywhere because for some 
                reason it s just not...  saleable. 

                              CHARLIE
                Even with the taint, the painting s 
                still worth millions -- why 
                wouldn t it be  saleable ?

  Charlie catches sight of one of Larry s copies of a famous 
  masterwork.  This sparks a thought -- his eyes land on the 
    weather-crackled painted table top...

  FLASH CHARLIE VISION

  The table transforms into the Pissarro canvas. The spider-web 
  cracks in the table top mirror cracks in the painting.

  Charlie rushes off, leaving his lunch.  Off Larry, taking a 
  pencil and beginning to sketch on a notepad he was carrying.

                a while an owner loaning a painting 
                does accompany the piece with his 
                own photographic documentation.

  Don, Megan, David and Tollner run the facts.

                              MEGAN
                  Shoemaker supplied the photograph 
                in the museum s catalogue when he 
                loaned them the painting.

                              TOLLNER
                ...The same photograph your brother 
                used to determine it was a forgery.

                              DON 
                Which means the painting Shoemaker 
                loaned the museum -- the painting 
                that was stolen -- was a fake.

                              DAVID
                  ...Presuming Charlie s right.

                              MEGAN 
                If the painting was a forgery, do 
                you think Shoemaker knew it?

                              TOLLNER
                      (working the facts)
                ...He may even be the one who had 
                it made.

                              DAVID
                A forgery of his own painting?

                              TOLLNER 
                Often owners have forgeries made to 
                protect their art against theft. 
                But maybe Shoemaker was afraid he d 
                lose the painting another way --

                              DON
                -- The Hellmans.

                              MEGAN
                But Shoemaker won the lawsuit.

                              TOLLNER
                In my experience, these types of 
                claims never really go away.  
                  Collectors shy away from paintings 
                with a taint for that reason... 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    47.

    CONTINUED:3838


                              DAVID
                In other words, if the Hellmans 
                ever found more evidence to support 
                their claim --

                              TOLLNER
                They could go back to court again.

                              DON
                ...So Shoemaker creates a forgery 
                to hedge his bets.

                              MEGAN
                And loans it to the museum to get 
                himself a lower insurance premium.

                              DAVID
                  Shoemaker may even be trying to 
                pull a double scam -- have the fake 
                stolen for insurance, then sell the 
                real painting later on the sly.

                              TOLLNER
                But why steal back the fake 
                Pissarro now?  I mean, it s been in 
                the museum for a year and a half.

                              DON
                      (recalling; to David)
                The tour...  The painting was set 
                to go on a major tour next month.

                              MEGAN
                Which would have meant another 
                  authentication.

                              DAVID
                Fool me once shame on you, fool me 
                twice...

                              MEGAN
                So then where is the real Pissarro?

  Off the question, hanging...

  INT. SHOEMAKER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY4040

  FBI AGENTS do a search, rifling closets, pulling shelves away 
  from walls, etc.  Shoemaker protests to Megan.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                You have no right --

                              MEGAN
                -- Actually we have a warrant.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER 
                This is ludicrous.  You re telling 
                me my painting was a forgery, based 
                on an analysis of a photograph --

                              MEGAN
                -- Which you provided the museum. 
                We ve already notified your 
                  insurance company -- they re 
                  withholding payment.

  Shoemaker looks at Megan, furious --

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                Then I ll take them to court. 

                              MEGAN
                  I wouldn t count on the courts 
                backing your play this time, Mr. 
                  Shoemaker.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                The Hellmans are behind this, 
                aren t they?  They paid some sleazy 
                math expert who looked at a 
                  photograph and claimed my Pissarro 
                was a fake.  But if they think this 
                is going to get me to settle, 
                they re wrong.

                              MEGAN
                It s an interesting theory, but I m 
                afraid the math consultant works 
                for us.  

                              PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                Why?  Why would I steal my own 
                  painting?  And if it was a fake, 
                why would the Hellman s have fought 
                for four years to get it back?

                Could be he s been caught before,  
                maybe even has a file.

                              TOLLNER
                A lot of names to run down.

                ...So maybe we don t run down the 
                names, we run down the paintings. 
                      (off his look)
                We have the photo of the forged

                Interpol just faxed the file on 
                Gustav Stolberg.  In 1946, he was 
                convicted of fraud, died in prison 
                two years later.

                the forged Pissarro Shoemaker gave 
                the museum.

                              DAVID
                  Hungarian police assumed all five 
                canvases were fakes...

                You think the real Pissarro s been 
                sitting in a Hungarian police vault 
                for the past 60 years?

                              TOLLNER
                Wouldn t surprise me.  The

                So they just packed the Pissarro 
                into a crate along with the 
                  forgeries...

                Mrs. Hellman s father must have had 
                Stolberg paint the forgery; he gave 
                him the original for safekeeping.

                              DON
                So, the Nazis looted a fake.  

                              MEGAN
                Which means Shoemaker s probably 
                telling the truth.  He didn t know

                then I must have made a mistake.

                  A mistake?  You ve been doing this

                already announced the acquisition.   
                I mean, it was one thing to display 
                  a painting suspected of being Nazi 
                looted art, but to exhibit a 
                forgery?

                During the first appraisal I had my 
                doubts.  Pissarro s bold strokes of 
                fluid light, the unexpected 
                  granularity, they re unmistakable.  
                The painting was good -- very good  
                -- but it was no Pissarro.

                a museum like ours to actually 
                acquire a Pissarro?

                Only you didn t actually acquire a

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                The exhibit sold out in a matter of 
                days.  By the time Patrick alerted 
                me to the forgery, it was already 
                too late... The Pissarro had put us 
                on the map.

                I thought if the painting just... 
                  disappeared; what would be the 
                harm?  Shoemaker had his insurance 
                and the museum had its future.

                              MEGAN
                Not much of a future now.

                              CHARLIE (cont'd)
                No.  You stay put.  I got it.

                              ALAN
                You re gonna grill? 

                              CHARLIE
                T-bone with Mom s special steak 
                sauce.  She taught me the recipe... 

                              DON
                Need any help?

                              CHARLIE
                Nope.  Think I can handle it. 

  Charlie looks at Alan, smiles, exits.  Don looks at Alan.

                              DON
                Your mom s cousin Anna -- you said 
                she never found anyone, right?

                              ALAN
                That s right.

                              DON
                When you get a chance, if you could 
                give me a list of their names...

                              ALAN
                You re gonna look for them?

                              DON
