Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by
a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT
PURSUIT.
Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up
and happy-looking.
RICK
I miss going out with you on
Saturday nights.
She smiles at him.
MAGGIE
I know, it's just like the old
days.
Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.
RICK
Maybe we should make a rule that we
go out at least six nights a week
without the kids.
Maggie GIGGLES.
RICK (CONT'D)
I'm serious. We should go out every
week--just you and me.
A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
GLANCE back AT HER ASS.
RICK (CONT'D)
I think it'd be healthy.
MAGGIE
You gotta be kidding me?
Maggie pulls away.
RICK
What?
MAGGIE
You just checked out that girl's
butt.
RICK
I did?
MAGGIE
Yeah, you did, and it's rude.
RICK
Why? You think she saw me?
MAGGIE
saw you.
5.
RICK
Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm
just kind of spacey today.
GRACE (O.S.)
Come on, we're late!
REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.
MAGGIE
Grace, let me ask you something:
Does Fred ever check out other
women in front of you?
GRACE
No, Fred's not a gawker.
Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to
Dr. Lucy.
We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER
the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric
Association Person of the Year.'
Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are
getting out.
RICK
How about I drive the babysitter
home while you go upstairs and
prepare the altar?
He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front
door.
MAGGIE
I want to, honey, but I've got to
get up early with the kids.
RICK
I'll get up with the kids.
MAGGIE
But I have to go out and buy a gift-
-they're going to a birthday party
tomorrow.
8.
RICK
I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take
the kids to the park, then to the
party. You can dust stay in bed,,
get your beauty sleep, and bask in
the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about
to give you.
MAGGIE
I love it when you sweet-talk me.
Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN
THEIR TRACKS.
THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing
there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar.
GUNNAR
Mommy! Daddy!
RICK
(DEFLATED)
Little buddy.. .what are you doing
up?
Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs
apologetically to Rick.
RICK (CONT'D)
This is just a minor obstacle.
CUT TO:
The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.
Rick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom,
closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY.
F
Rick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred
APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS
COURTS in the b.g.)
FRED
Hey.
RICK
Hey. How'd you make out?
FRED
Great. Lost both sets.
RICK
So'd you get the business?
Fred nods and wipes his brow.
FRED
Pretty sure I got the Auto and
Home. He told me to call his
accountant on Monday about the
Life.
RICK
Nice.
Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with
their CHILDREN.
FRED
Can you believe the talent here
today?
RICK
(PAINED)
Yeah. I know.
They NOTICE something O.S..
THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING
HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.
FRED
Ouch.
14.
Rick SIGHS.
RICK
CPR girl's back, too.
Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING
A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.
FRED
Imagine if we were coming here back
when we were single?
RICK
(FALSE BRAVADO)
Oh baby, the damage we would do.
EMMA
Monkey bars!
The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.
GUNNAR
Me first!
Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor
scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep
past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and
WEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS.
FRED
So you get lucky last night?
RICK
Nah, the kids were up when we got
home. How 'bout you?
FRED
Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked
right out so I snuck out to the car
and rubbed one out.
Rick shoots Fred a look.
RICK
The car? What are you Knight Rider?
Why didn't you just go in the
bathroom like a normal guy?
FRED
And get caught by Grace? Can't risk
it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's
where I lost my virginity. And
they're comfy--I just put the seat
back and turn on the tunes.
The guys sit on a bench.
RICK
That's one of the things they don't
tell you when you're young--that
you'll still be jerking-off after
you get married. I thought it was
dust gonna be a teenage thing.
15
FRED
Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.
The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee
Girls play all around them.
FRED (CONT'D)
You know what I miss the most?
RICK
What?
FRED
The arch.
RICK
What arch?
FRED
You know when you're taking a
girl's panties off for the first
time, and you're wondering if she's
going to stop you, but then she
gives you that little pelvic arch-
thrust that tells you that the
struggle's over, everything's going
to be okay?
Rick SIGHS.
RICK
That's a happy moment.
FRED
Yep. Another thing gone forever.
Rick looks at his watch.
RICK
I should get going, I have to drop
the kids off at a birthday party.
FRED
You want to grab a coffee after?
CUT TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT - COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT MORNING
There are several flashy cars out front of this huge
McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of
Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet
them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a
Polo shirt, just like his father.)
GRACE
There he is! The lord of the manor!
27.
ED
Come on, everyone in the shack! The
grand tour's about to begin!
Maggie and Grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their
shell-shocked husbands. A trembling and IRATE Kimmy is held
back at the door by Ed and a couple other Guests.
KIMMY
You people are horrible! Horrible!
ED
(CALLING OUT)
I'm very disappointed, gentlemen!
32.
This is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in
his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker
For Sale sign with Rick's name on it.
Fred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home.
We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car
and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're...
LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting
in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is
slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.
A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later
BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.
As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to
figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred
continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT.
39.
Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM
FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now
only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE
CAR.
The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred
continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs
out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES
IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each
other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we...
CUT TO:
SAME SCENE - LATER
The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have
gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on.
PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred
standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a
furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.)
OFFICER #1
All right, ma'am, if you say he's
yours.. .you can have him.
The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS.
GRACE
Thank you, officers.
Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the
door shuts, we HEAR:
GRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
WHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF
IN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?!
As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go...
CLOSE ON a smiling Fred.
FRED
I got a Hall Pass!
Rick, Fred, and their MIDDLE-AGED POSSE (Baker, Hog-head &
Gary) walk across a boulevard like rock stars. (Think of the
SLO-MO shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs.) Nobody
smiles, they're all business as they hit the sidewalk and
march straight into ...APPLEBEE'S.
Rick, Fred, Hog-head, and Gary are stretching on the first
tee of a local FOUR-STAR GOLF RESORT while taking in the
sights. Nearby, we see the hotel swimming pool lined with
ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in bikinis.
47.
HOG-HEAD
Wow. This place sure beats the hell
out of the Holiday Inn Express. Why
aren't you staying here?
RICK
Too pricey. Besides, since we're
paying for golf we get full access
to the resort--including the pool
bar.
FRED
Mothers, lock up your daughters--
the dogs are off the leash!
RICK
Turn-and-burn, baby!
Gary raises his hand for a HIGH-FIVE, but Rick balks.
RICK (CONT'D)
Nope. I don't do that.
HOG-HEAD
Hey, I say screw the golf--let's go
straight to the pool bar and start
getting you guys laid!
RICK
Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't
going nowhere. Besides, it'll be
good for us to get a little sun
before making our grand entrance--
chicks love a healthy glow.
FRED
Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a
little sweat--get those pheromones
flying.
Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass.
HOG-HEAD
You talked me into it.
GARY
Hey, guys, look what I brought.
Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey.
RICK
What's that?
GARY
Pot brownskies.
The guys all look at one another, baffled.
RICK
What, are we on spring break? Where
the hell'd you get those?
GARY
I got an in.
48.
FRED
With who?
GARY
Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead.
He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate.
GARY (CONT'D)
Eating it isn't like smoking it.
It's a much mellower buzz--you'll
just feel relaxed.
HOG-HEAD
Are they chocolatey?
As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing.
RICK
Hog-head, come on, who eats pot
brownies at eleven in the morning
when they're playing golf?
HOG-HEAD
John Daly?
GARY
And by the way, Rick, this is
spring break! You've got a hall
pass! Live it up, man! It'll
probably help your rap with the
ladies later.
HOG-HEAD
Gary's right--when are we ever
gonna get the chance to do pot
brownies again?
Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT.
HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
Mmm. These are yummy.
RICK
You don't even have a hall pass.
HOG-HEAD
So? I can still live vicariously
through you guys, can't I?
RICK
It's not vicarious if you're
actually doing it.
HOG-HEAD
Whatever. Just hit your ball.
Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE.
FRED
Oh, what the hell, it's not like my
game can get any worse.
49.
Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT.
Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE.
RICK
All right, give me one of those
things.
As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we
SUPER:
75 MINUTES LATER
A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their
cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of
them speak. Then:
FRED
What kind of soap do you use?
RICK
(BEAT)
You mean in the shower?
FRED
Yeah.
RICK
Dove.
FRED
Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry
your skin so much.
Fred stares into space.
FRED (CONT'D)
Sometimes it's hard to wash off,
though. Because of the moisturizer.
You ever notice--?
RICK
I think Hog-head's dead.
Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN
A SAND TRAP. He's not moving.
FRED
(CALLING OUT)
Hog-head...? Are you okay?
As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an
elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart.
RANGER
What the hell is he doing?
Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority
figure.
RICK
Uh, he's having back spasms.
50.
RANGER
Not him. Him.
Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the
MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM.
RICK
(CALLING OUT)
Gary! What are you doing?!
GARY
I don't know--you tell me!
Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick,
annoyed.
RANGER
Look, this is the third time I've
had to flag your group and you're
only on the fourth hole. Now if I
have to come out here again, you're
done for the day.
RICK
Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir.
The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO
ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them.
CUT TO:
SUPER:
27 MINUTES LATER
The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another
fairway.
RICK
Think. Where did you last see it?
GARY
On the course.
RICK
Where on the course?
GARY
I don't know--on a fairway, I
think. I clot out, grabbed my club,
took a swing, and when I turned
around it had disappeared.
RICK
You're serious? You're telling us
you lost your golf cart?
FRED
(STONER VOICE)
Dude, where's my golf cart?
51.
RICK
Shut up, Fred.
HOG-HEAD
Guys, I gotta go poo again.
GARY
I didn't lose it, I think it was
stolen.
RICK
(ANNOYED)
Who would steal a golf cart?
Gary shrugs.
GARY
Criminals?
HOG-HEAD
Does anyone have any napkins?
GARY
Look, all I know is I had it on the
seventh tee and now it's gone.
RICK
What are you talking about? We're
only on the sixth hole.
GARY
What? Did we miss a hole? Where's
my kids?
Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it
together. Then he NOTICES something O.S..
RICK
Oh, come on, man!
ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker
PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his
O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and
the guys look up.
THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading
straight for them.
FRED
Run for it!
The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick
and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF
THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger
HOT IN PURSUIT.
GARY
He's gaining on us!
RICK
I can't go any faster, I've got it
floored!
52.
FRED
Cut through the woods!
Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and
Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART.
With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog-
head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick
slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then
he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE
WOODS.
Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having
lunch with their two young children. Their 7-Year-Old
Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year-
Old Son is dressed like the father.
7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
Hey, Mom, look!
The family turns to see...
THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary
are driving the golf cart down the city street. They stop at
a traffic light beside them. All the guys stare straight
ahead, ZOMBIE-LIKE, except for Fred who NOTICES the Longs.
He nods.
FRED
Ed. Kimmy. Clones.
The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the
busy intersection, we go
BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads.
KIMMY
Their poor wives.
SMASH CUT TO:
Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
DAY 3
It's a picture perfect day as a THOUSAND PEOPLE watch a Cape
Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic
blankets. The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom
of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, MAGGIE'S PARENTS, and the
kids are CLAPPING ALONG WITH THE CROWD.
CRACK! The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the
TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD.
SAME SCENE - LATER
The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after
the game.
53.
Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch
Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and
REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach.
Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a
strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a
perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN.
GERRY
Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming
out and supporting us.
MAGGIE
Oh, it was fun. You guys looked
good.
GERRY
Thanks.
Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging
him on.
GERRY (CONT'D)
So...we saw you sitting up there
with those little kids--are you
nannies or something?
The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile.
MAGGIE
No, they're my kids.
GERRY
(DUBIOUS)
Yeah, right. You have three kids?
MAGGIE
Uh-huh.
A couple other PLAYERS amble over.
GERRY
Dudes, they're not nannies, they're
mommies.
PLAYER #2
No way?!
GRACE
Well, she is, not me. I'm not old
enough yet.
Maggie and the players LAUGH.
RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)
Guys!
The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN,
approaching with MAGGIE'S FATHER, mid-70's.
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
Time to pack things up--let's go!
54.
The Players quickly scatter.
MAGGIE'S FATHER
Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman-
-the coach.
Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head
of hair and an easy-going manner.
RICK COLEMAN
I hope those clowns weren't
bothering you.
MAGGIE
Oh, no, they were sweet.
GRACE
Yeah. Cute kids.
MAGGIE
So you're the guy who's been taking
money off my dad every Saturday on
the golf course?
RICK COLEMAN
I hate to break it to you but your
old man's the one who's been taking
all the money--he's a thief.
Maggie's Father LAUGHS.
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
Hey, everyone's coming back to my
place for some beers and a barbecue-
-why don't you join us?
MAGGIE
Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the
kids home.
MAGGIE'S FATHER
Your mom and I will take 'em home.
You two go out and have a good time-
-cripes, you haven't been out all
week.
Grace perks up at this.
MAGGIE
Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really
HADN'T PLANNED--
GRACE
Excuse me, can I have a word with
you?
Grace pulls Maggie aside.
GRACE (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
What's your problem?
55.
MAGGIE
Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are
barely out of college, and, in case
you've forgotten, we're married.
GRACE
To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred
had the week off from marriage. So
remind me again--who are we married
to?
Maggie thinks about this.
MAGGIE
Well...I guess one beer won't kill
us.
GRACE
(SMILING)
That's my girl.
Grace glances over at the ballplayers.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Why shouldn't we have fun? God
knows our guys are living it up.
CUT TO:
A CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD
HOG-HEAD
What would you guys rather do--make-
out with a guy or let him blow you?
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that...
The party's in full swing. A hundred or so PLAYERS, PLAYER'S
GIRLFRIENDS, and FRIENDS are in and out of the pool, drinking
beer and rocking out to Arcade Fire on the boombox.
60.
ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the
b.g. we see Grace PLAYING VOLLEYBALL in the pool (still in
the shorts and t-shirt she wore that afternoon.)
MAGGIE
So how about you, Rick, do you have
any children?
RICK COLEMAN
Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom
keeps talking about hooking me up
with your cousin Kate.
Maggie LAUGHS.
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
That's not a good sign.
MAGGIE
No, I hardly know her. She moved to
Miami when I was eight.
RICK COLEMAN
That's what your mom said. I coach
at the University of Miami.
MAGGIE
Then you should go out with her.
RICK COLEMAN
Nice try.
(BEAT)
So how about yourself--how long you
been married?
MAGGIE
Uh...fourteen years. We were
college sweethearts.
RICK COLEMAN
Nice. And where is he this week?
MAGGIE
He's up in Boston.
RICK COLEMAN
Poor guy. All work and no play,
huh?
Maggie forces a smile.
MAGGIE
Something like that.
Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO
GERRY'S SHOULDERS.
GRACE
Stop it! What are you doing?!
61.
Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie
and the coach can't help but LAUGH along with him, as we
CUT TO:
Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van. As
Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out
clutching a MOTORCYCLE HELMET. Rick stares at him.
FRED
(DEFENSIVE)
Chicks dig motorcycles.
Maggie and Grace are laying outintheir bathing suits when
they hear O.S. YELLING and lookupto see the baseball player
Gerry WATERSKIING toward them.Helets go of the rope and
skis UP ONTO THE SHORE.
GERRY
What's up, beach bunnies?
Grace and Maggie sit up and smile.
GRACE
What are you doing here?
He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY
ALL OVER THE GIRLS.
GRACE & MAGGIE
Gerry, stop it!
GERRY
Hey, where are the kiddies? We
thought we'd take you all for a
boat ride.
MAGGIE
My parents took them to Martha's
Vineyard for the weekend.
Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat
pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and
a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves.
RICK COLEMAN
(THROUGH BULLHORN)
All right, everybody aboard! We're
going waterskiing!
The two women look at each other--why not? As they get up
and RUN INTO THE WATER, we
CUT TO:
67.
Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his
coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week
free trial at the local gym and starts to read them.
LEIGH (O.S.)
I work-out there.
69.
Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh.
RICK
You do?
Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.
RICK (CONT'D)
I work-out at home, but I was
thinking of going public with my
work-outs. What do you squat?
She seems amused by this.
LEIGH
I don't really squat, just run on
the hamster-wheel everyday after
work.
She starts wiping down a table.
COFFEE GIRL
So did you go to Harvard?
She nods at Rick's t-shirt.
RICK
Yeah.
(BEAT)
I mean, you know...I went to a
party there once.
Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up.
RICK (CONT'D)
(RE:SHIRT)
Actually, this is Harvard Health
Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too
much.
(holds up gym postcard)
So is this a good place to join?
LEIGH
Great place. Real chill. And they
have a bar, so I always grab a beer
after my workout.
RICK
Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice
routine. Maybe I'll routine it,
too.
LEIGH
If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent
you--they'll give me two free
months.
RICK
I'll do that, Leigh.
LEIGH
Rockin'.
Leigh gives him the peace sign.
70.
RICK
R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.
Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON FRED - he's wearing SHADES and has a BASEBALL CAP
pulled down over his eyes.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As
he approaches the massage parlor entrance, a bunch of LADIES
walk out of the TRAVEL AGENCY just to the right so Fred veers
into the DRY CLEANERS to the left.
Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is
clear, then DUCKS INTO THE MASSAGE PARLOR.
One hundred GUESTS dance on the top deck of this large ship
as the Bee Gee's Night Fever BLASTS from the speakers.
SONG
.Night fever, night fever.. .we
know how to do it...'
As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick
Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS.
They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are
thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting
tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her
own on a dance floor.
73.
The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as
Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless
wives, we
CUT TO:
SAME SCENE - LATER
Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat
taking a breather.
RICK COLEMAN
Wow. You can really move out there.
Maggie shrugs modestly.
MAGGIE
Thanks. I was a dance major in
college.
RICK COLEMAN
Really? I always wondered--what do
you do with a degree in dance?
MAGGIE
Well, as it turned out, nothing.
(BLUSHING)
I guess the original plan was to go
to New York and try to hook-up with
one of the big dance companies, but
then I got married and. . .your
priorities change.
She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Anyway, that was fun. I haven't
danced this much in a long time.
RICK COLEMAN
Why not?
MAGGIE
I don't know, you get busy, kids,
school, there's so much going on.
RICK COLEMAN
Well you gotta make time for the
stuff you love or you'll forget who
you are.
Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-
contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks
away.
MAGGIE
You know, my husband's name is
Rick.
Rick smiles at this.
74.
RICK COLEMAN
Well that makes me the perfect guy
to have an affair with--you'd never
have to worry about screaming out
the wrong name during sex.
Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
I'm kidding.
MAGGIE
I know.
RICK COLEMAN
Now come on, let's go find Grace
and get something to eat. I'm
starving.
As they head back to the party, we
CUT TO:
A mass of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and SLICK GUYS vie for position
outside this CROWDED CLUB.
REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Rick, Fred and Coakley watching from
across the street.
COAKLEY
I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.
FRED
For what?
Coakley shoots him a look.
COAKLEY
If you're really serious about
this, stop questioning me.
The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE
DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently
across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK
BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD.
83.
SLICK BOUNCER
Good evening, Mr. Coakley.
COAKLEY
What up, my guy?
Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer
UNHOOKS THE VELVET ROPE. Then Coakley smiles back at Fred
and Rick.
COAKLEY (CONT'D)
Push the defrost button on the
microwave, boys. The deep freeze is
over.
Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC
coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking
nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry
appears in the doorway.
GERRY
There she is! Come on in, I'm
mixing up some margaronis. We lost
our final game, but I got four
hits!
94.
GRACE
Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?
GERRY
They all went out to party--now get
in here!
But Grace stays on the porch.
GRACE
Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.
GERRY
What?
Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it
shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.
GERRY (CONT'D)
Is everything okay?
GRACE
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine,
but...
(holds up gift box)
.I can't accept this.
GERRY
Why not?
Grace does a double-take.
GRACE
Gerry, I'm a married woman.
Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the
box and he reluctantly accepts it.
GERRY
Um... I'm sorry if I made you
uncomfortable, Grace. It's just
that...I really like you.
GRACE
I like you, too, Gerry, and you
didn't make me uncomfortable.
She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's
some serious eye-contact, and then BAM!
They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S
NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they
STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we
CUT TO:
A guilt-ridden Grace is just finishing GETTING DRESSED when
Gerry comes out of the bathroom buttoning up his shirt.
GERRY
Everything okay?
GRACE
Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no,
everything's not okay.
GERRY
What?
He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.
GRACE
Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry,
and you're very charming and very
sweet and the last thing I wanted
to do was hurt your feelings,
but...well, what,just happened can
never happen again.
Gerry looks confused.
GERRY
Oh.
GRACE
I know it's probably hard for you
to understand but...I love my
husband.
GERRY
So? What does that have to do with
anything? Fate threw us together
and we went with it--isn't that
what life's all about?
99.
Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of
his words.
GRACE
Not always.
(BEAT)
It wasn't fair to my husband... and
it wasn't fair to you because this
could never become anything more
than just.. .what it was.
She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out
a LAUGH.
GERRY
I know that.
GRACE
You do?
GERRY
(BIG SMILE)
Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no
offense, but let's face it, you're
a lot older than me.
She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check
for Grace.
GRACE
Right.
GERRY
I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm
just saying, I didn't think we were
going to start dating, you know?
Could you imagine the looks we'd
get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and
his girlfriends--except in reverse.
Gerry CHUCKLES.
GERRY (CONT'D)
You'd be Hugh Hefner.
GRACE
Yeah, I got that part.
Gerry looks at his watch.
GERRY
Ooh, I gotta get going. We have
kind of a team meeting in like
twenty minutes.
Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.
GERRY CONT'D
It's, uh, kind o a tradition that
we always get together on the night
of the last game. It would probably
be uncool if I missed it.
100.
GRACE
You don't have to explain.
GERRY
Seriously, though, thanks for
everything--that was awesome.
He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then
Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a
moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START
OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we
CUT TO:
This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood.
We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the
street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are
still arriving.
Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick
on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his
nose.
FRED
What did they tell you? Is Grace
gonna be okay?
RICK
All I know is she was in a car
accident and they rushed her to the
hospital.
FRED
Oh my God...
Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and
REACT.
THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can
see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN
by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is
spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN.
FRED (CONT'D)
Whoa!!! What the hell...?!
Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face.
WANNABE
How do you like me now, Splenda-
boy?
FRED
You moron, that's Lny car! His is
the one next to it!
Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and
quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN
TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF
THE PARKING LOT.
BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR
BREATHS.
113.
RICK
Nice job, Fred.
CUT TO:
The mini-van blows by a sign that reads 'CAPE COD - 60
MILES.'
Maggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck DRINKING WINE.
RICK COLEMAN
This is a great place.
MAGGIE
Yeah, my family's had it since I
was a kid. We used to come for a
week a summer, then two weeks, then
a month, then by the time I got to
high school we were living here all
summer long.
114.
RICK COLEMAN
Something's wrong here, Maggie.
MAGGIE
Hm?
RICK COLEMAN
Something's wrong with a guy who
would leave a woman like you alone
for this long.
MAGGIE
(UNCOMFORTABLE)
Well, you know...I did give him a
hall pass.
RICK COLEMAN
So what? If you were my girl, I
wouldn't have taken it.
An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks
away.
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
You deserve way better.
MAGGIE
Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't
really even want the hall pass. I
kind of forced it on him.
RICK COLEMAN
Why would you do that?
Maggie thinks about this.
MAGGIE
I don't know.
(BEAT)
I guess I felt like he wasn't
noticing me anymore. j guess I
wanted to feel.. .desired again. And
the truth is, in my heart, I never
thought he'd go through with it.
He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each
other's eyes. He leans in and she does, too, and right when
it looks like THEY MAY KISS, Maggie hesitates as suddenly
EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR TO HER.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Oh my God...
RICK COLEMAN
What?
MAGGIE
This hall pass ...it wasn't for him.
(SOFTLY)
It was...for me.
And as they hang on that realization, we
CUT TO:
115
A police cruiser is parked on the highway divider.
The battered MINI-VAN blows by the 'WELCOME TO CAPE COD'
hedges with the cop car on their tail.
We see another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAIL OUT OF A SIDE STREET
and JOIN THE CHASE.
Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE
in the graffitied mini-van.
Rick pulls up in the wrecked mini-van and gets out.
The sky is lightening but the sun hasn't risen yet. A taxi-
van pulls up and Fred gets out. (Fred has a BLACK EYE.) He
helps Grace out of the van, then pays the DRIVER. (Grace has
TWO BLACK EYES and her nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED.) When the
taxi drives off, Fred helps Grace toward the house.
FRED
.And what were you doing driving
around at one o'clock in the
morning?
GRACE
(NERVOUS)
Well...I was upset so I went for a
drive--you know, to think--and I
must have hit a patch of sand, and
before I knew it I was into the
pole.
Fred stops and looks her in the eye.
FRED
I'm sorry, Grace.
GRACE
For what?
FRED
For putting you through all this.
Grace looks awash in guilt.
GRACE
It's not your fault, Fred.
FRED
Yes, it is--of course it's my
fault. This isn't you--driving
around all night, thinking--you're
not a thinker.
When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
smile back.
GRACE
Look, Fred, we have to talk
about... about what happened this
week.
Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
the moment.
121.
FRED
Grace. . .do we really have to do
this?
Grace lowers her head guiltily.
GRACE
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and
BATTERED MINI-VAN.
GRACE (CONT'D)
Horny old man?
FRED
(MATTER-OF-FACT)
Oh, no, honey, that's not me--they
were talking about Rick.
Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his
knees.
FRED (CONT'D)
Look, all you gotta know is that
whatever happened doesn't matter! I
love you and only you! And I'm
going to treat you like the queen
that you are for the rest of your
living days, so help me God! I'll
mow the lawn, I'll shovel the snow,
I'll wash the stubble off the
sink...
Grace looks down at him.
FRED (CONT'D)
.But please, I'm begging you,
sweetie... can we please just never
talk about what happened this week?
Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.
GRACE
Um...deal.
Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.
GRACE (CONT'D)
I love you, Fred.
As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with
his arm around Maggie. Fred shoots Rick a THUMBS-UP.
CLOSE ON RICK AND MAGGIE as they smile at Fred and Grace.
RICK
Come on, you two! We're gonna go
watch the sun come up!
122.
Hall & Oates's 'When The Morning Comes' begins to play and as
our two HAPPY COUPLES hold hands and walk off toward the
beach, we pull up, up, up, and...
FADE OUT:
