      EXT. VERSUVIOCAFE - DAY 1 - 090011
      CHIEF AGENT SHAW, 2 MI9 AGENTS KHAN and LILL, WRAPPED UP 
      WOMAN, A RABBIT  PLAYED  BY THE RABBIT WHO  PLAYS  FLOPSY

    An apparently normal morning in  VersuvioCafe . A counter 
    and three small tables. There are a few people sitting 
      drinking tea and eating pastries. The camera starts to pick 
      oddities... The young woman (AGENT LILL) reading a book has 
    an ear piece... The man (AGENT KHAN) drinking tea is 
      watching the room using her compact mirror... A man (CHIEF 
      AGENT SHAW - late 30 s, handsome, muscled, but cold-eyed) 
    is reading a newspaper (the DAILY DESPATCH) that has a big 
      head shot picture on the front  FOREIGN PRINCE TO VISIT UK - 
    the eyes are cut out so SHAW can see through. 

      A  MAN  enters carrying a white rabbit, his face obscured 
    by his scarf and hat - he looks very much like the GRAND 
      MASTER. AGENT LILL and AGENT KHAN exchange quick looks, 
      then glance to where the newspaper is blocking their view 
    of CHIEF AGENT SHAW. The paper lowers.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Go go go!

    All three suddenly jump up and surround the MAN with the 
      rabbit, who looks confused and makes no attempt to flee. 
      AGENTS LILL and KHAN stand aside for CHIEF AGENT SHAW who 
      confronts the startled WRAPPED-UP MAN. 

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Grand Master, I arrest you in the 
                    name of MI9. Your reign of terror 
                    is over. 

    He takes the MAN S hat off revealing a large amount of long 
      brunette hair. SHAW looks confused, he now removes the 
      scarf revealing what is very obviously a young woman and 
    not The Grand Master at all. 

                                  LILL
                    I don t think it s him.

      SHAW throws LILL a look, then turns to the wrapped-up 
      woman.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    I m very sorry, I thought you 
                    were someone else.

      AGENT KHAN now draws SHAW S attention to the counter. The 
      cakes there have just been arranged in the shape of letters 
      that spell out  Nice try, stupid!  SHAW closes his eyes. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. ST HOPES, FLATLEY S OFFICE - DAY 1 - 110022
    MRS KING, MR FLATLEY

    MRS KING S face wears an expression of horror as she stares 
    at messy piles of different colouredfolders spread out on 
    the desk before her. 

                                  MRS KING
                    Mr Flatley, I asked to see the 
                    school records two months ago! 
                    Why have you filled the room with 
                    waste paper?

    MR FLATLEY seems unphasedby her sarcasm.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    This isn t waste paper! It s our 
                    filing system. Invented it myself 
                    actually. It s rather brilliant. 
                    Even if I do say so myself.

                                  MRS KING
                    But this is chaos!  

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    No no. It s all perfectly 
                    logical.

    MR FLATLEY tidies the files into neat lines.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Each child has a nickname to help 
                    me remember who they are. And 
                    each file is arranged 
                      alphabetically according to these 
                    nicknames.

    MRS KING narrows her eyes as MR FLATLEY continues 
      excitedly.

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    For example...

    He picks up a yellow file marked with a  C .

                                  MR FLATLEY
                      RobbieSmall is under C for Cake.

                                  MRS KING
                    Why cake?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Easy... Small plays for the 
                    football team... footballersget 
                    yellow cards... yellow cards 
                    aren t as nice as birthday 
                    cards... and if it s your 
                    birthday you ll want some cake.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 3.


    MRS KING S jaw has dropped open. She begins rapidly 
      examining the files laid out before her.

                                  MRS KING
                    The whole school administrative 
                    system is based on this?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Well, I ve simplified things for 
                    you of course. The childrens 
                    files are also colourcoded 
                    according to the number of 
                    letters in their surnames. 

    MRS KING shakes her head angrily.

                                  MRS KING
                    Little wonder the school s in 
                    such a mess. It ll take a genius 
                    to sort this lot out! What class 
                    is Rose Guptain at the moment?

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Oh... I gave her the morning off. 
                    Some very important thingymebob
                    she had to do.

    MRS KING rolls her eyes. 

                                  MRS KING
                      Unbelievable. 

    She leaves, slamming the door behind her. MR FLATLEY rather 
      obsessively rearranges a pink file in the correct row.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. MI9 OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY 1 - 110533
      OSCAR, ROSE, CARRIE, FRANK, CHIEF AGENT SHAW, AGENT LILL, 
      AGENT KHAN, N/SMI9 AGENTS

      OSCAR, ROSE and CARRIE are attending an urgently convened 
    MI9 seminar in an atmospheric film-noir smoke-filled room. 
      FRANK is also in attendance. They re at the bottom end of 
    the table that has clearly been set out in some order of 
      hierarchy. CHIEF AGENT SHAW stands by a flip-chart at the 
      head of the table, flanked by AGENTS KHAN and LILL. A 
      Projector shows first  MI9  then  OPERATION SWEET TOOTH .

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    My operation had been planned to 
                      perfection. A tip-off seems the 
                    only explanation for our failure.  

      AGENTS KHAN and LILL nod. ROSE leans across to OSCAR.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 4.


                                  ROSE
                    I can t see a thing through all 
                    this smoke. 

                                  OSCAR
                    I think the air con s broken. 
                    Can t you sort it, Frank?

                                  FRANK
                    I m here in my capacity as a 
                    senior MI9 agent - not as a 
                    caretaker!

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, but I bet you d have it 
                    fixed in no time.

      FRANK raises an eyebrow, gets out his screwdriver and then 
      ducks under the table.

                                  FRANK
                          (as he works)
                    I did once install a whole air 
                    conditioning system for a shanty 
                    town in Latin America.

    The smoke slowly clears. CHIEF AGENT SHAW is still talking.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    ... his weakness for pastries is 
                    the last lead we have on the 
                    Grand Master... 

      CHIEF AGENT SHAW turns the flipchart.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    What we need now is newideas. 
                    Out of the box thinking...

    He writes  1  on the paper and turns expectantly to the 
      table. CARRIE S hand goes up. He chooses not to see it. 
      There are no other hands raised. 

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Agent Lill?

      AGENT LILL - not inspired - tries to think.

                                  AGENT LILL
                    Er, we could... Uh, introduce ID 
                    cards and maybe he d fill one in?

      CHIEF AGENT SHAW writes on the chart.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    ID cards... good...    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 5.


      OSCAR and ROSE roll their eyes. CARRIE S hand is still 
      raised. AGENT KHAN whispers to AGENT LILL who raises her 
      hand again. CHIEF AGENT SHAW nods.

                                  AGENT LILL
                    Offshore savings accounts, sir. 
                    We look to see if the Grand 
                    Master has any in his name?

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Good, good, I like it...

      OSCAR whispers to ROSE.

                                  OSCAR
                    Bank accounts? Get more obvious!

      CARRIE S hand is still raised.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Anyone else?

    He chooses not to see CARRIE.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Agent Khan?

    But before AGENT KHAN can speak, CARRIE is on her feet.

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve got an idea sir.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Ah, yes... we must give youth a 
                    chance. (BEAT) I suppose. 

    He puts the top back on his pen. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve been looking at the data and 
                    I think we ve missed a trick.

      AGENTS LILL and KHAN exchange a complacent smirk.

                                  CHIEF AGENT SHAW
                    Go on...

                                  CARRIE
                    It s the rabbit. We all know The 
                    Grand Master has a rabbit, right? 
                    General Flopsy...

      OSCAR and ROSE exchange a look. Where s she going with 
      this?    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 6.


                                  CARRIE
                    And it goes everywhere he goes. 
                    So maybe we could sort of catch 
                    the Grand Master if we can get to 
                    General Flopsy?

      There s silence in the room. CARRIE sits down. AGENT LILL 
      laughs, followed by AGENT KHAN and then all the other 
      AGENTS except for our team and CHIEF AGENT SHAW who doesn t 
      look at all amused. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      CARRIE, ROSE, OSCAR, MRS KING, N/SKIDS

      CARRIE, ROSE, and OSCAR are passing through. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I still say it was a good idea. 
                    Their pets mean a lot to people - 
                    even someone like the Grand 
                    Master.

                                  OSCAR
                    I didn t become a spy to spend my 
                    time tailing bunnies.

                                  CARRIE
                    Rabbit... goldfish... what does 
                    it matter if it leads us to the 
                    Grand Master?

                                  ROSE
                    I agree. Maybe something 
                    unexpected is just what s needed?

      OSCAR looks witheringly at CARRIE and ROSE. He takes a 
      magazine out of his bag. ROSE looks up to see MRS KING 
      standing over her.

                                  MRS KING
                    Ah, the elusive Rose. Follow me, 
                    I have a task for you.

                                  ROSE
                    But, Miss I-

    MRS KING guides her towards the corridor.

                                  MRS KING
                    It won t take more than a few 
                    hours.

      CARRIE and OSCAR watch her go.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 7.

                    Let s go to HQ and research the 
                    rabbit idea.

      OSCAR flourishes his new magazine: KRAZYCARS WEEKLY.

                                  OSCAR
                    Uh, maybe later.

      CARRIE shrugs her shoulders, disappointed.

                                  CARRIE
                    Thanks for the support.

    She walks off.

      ROSE, MRS KING

      ROSE and MRS KING are sorting through MR FLATLEY S files. 
      ROSE has taken a letter from a red file.

                                  ROSE
                    Uh, I don t think this should be 
                    here, miss.

                                  MRS KING
                          (to herself)
                    I don t think any of us should.
                          (To Rose)
                    What is it?

      ROSE reads the letter.

                                  ROSE
                    Um, it s from the Department of 
                    Education... They re looking for

                    What?

    MRS KING snatches the letter and reads.

                                  ROSE
                    Are you going to go in for it, 
                    miss?

                                  MRS KING
                    What? Er, I don t know... 
                      possibly... 

    She reads the letter avidly.    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 8.


                                  MRS KING
                    This could be justwhat I ve been  
                    looking for...

      ROSE goes back to work on the files only to find MRS KING

      CARRIE, MAURICE HUTCHINSON

      SPLIT SCREEN as CARRIE converses with eccentric MI9 rodent 
      expert MAURICE HUTCHINSON (30). MAURICE is twitchy-nosedwith 
    two slightly protruding front teeth. He holds a carrot as he 
      talks. 

                                  HUTCHINSON
                          (enthusiastic)
                    ... Of course not everyone in MI9 
                    knows that it was my unit s 
                    specially trained squirrels and 
                    rabbits that won the Cold War.

                                  CARRIE
                    It was?

                                  HUTCHINSON
                      Absolutely. The squirrels stole 
                    microchips and hid them in trees.

                                  OSCAR
                    Nothing. 

      AVRIL walks away, enjoying her moment of triumph. OSCAR 
      shakes his head. Suddenly his attention is caught by 
      something in the magazine. He grabs it and reads it closer. 
    We see his POV a full page ad for a new sports car -  The 
        HefirelloOsburn-car .OSCAR takes his pen and blocks out 
    the middle 4 letters of the two words -

                    Hello Oscar!

    We now see it reads  Hello Oscar!  OSCAR looks shocked. He 
      looks around to see no-one else is looking, then examines 
    the other words in the picture. We see him blocking out 
      more letters in words within the text and pictures (on 
      number plates etc). 

                                  OSCAR

      meet. DeightonLake. Thursday 12th. 1pm.Tell no one. Mum. 

                                  OSCAR
                    Mum? 

    He looks at a calendar wall chart - it shows today as the 
      12th. OSCAR s communicator flashes. He answers it.

                    Well firstly it s only WHITE

      GRAND MASTER (V.O)

      A small traditional park. A Sign reads:  DEIGHTON PARK. No 
      playing. No laughing. No Fun.  OSCAR is sitting on a park 
      bench near a band stand - old school spy style. He looks 
      around but there is no sign of his mum. Suddenly he hears 
      something. A small electrical engine. A small remote control 
    car approaches him. It has a flag with  OSCAR  written on it. 
      OSCAR scans the park but there s no-one else in sight. He 
      bends nearer the car. On the car there s a Dictaphone. He 
      presses play and listens to the message.

                    Listen carefully. This is a 
                    message from SKUL. We still have

                    old biological war wound from her 
                    time in East Zanzibar. 

      Again OSCAR looks around. There s no-one in view. 

                                  THE GRAND MASTER (O.S.)
                    She needs vital medication. You 
                    will find it in MI9 HQ. Once you 
                    have the medication, a drop-off

                    one about this. 

      Smoke starts coming from the dictophone.OSCAR quickly puts 
    it back on the car. The car drives off a short way then 
      explodes. OSCAR looks up and sees a TRAMP (OSCAR S MUM in 
      disguise). The TRAMP walks with a pronounced limp.  

                                  OSCAR

      FRANK, MRS KING, OFFICIAL (V.O)

      FRANK is in the office putting up some shiny new shelves.

                    We ll have these up in a jiffy.

    MRS KING is examining MR FLATLEY S old files.

                    If he can understand this stupid 
                    system I ll bet I can... 

    The phone RINGS and she picks up. FRANK listens in as he 
      works on the shelves.

                    for Mr Flatley s application to 
                    become the new Education Tsar? 

    MRS KING edges away from FRANK S prying ears. He hammers in 
      a nail to reassure her he s not listening.

                                  MRS KING
                            (discreetly)
                    Yes... a most able candidate, I 
                    can t speak highly enough of him.

    MRS KING grimaces, that wasn t easy to say.

                    And if we could just check a few

                                  MRS KING

                    Then we must act quickly. Your Mr

                    The final stage will be an

                    I m sure it s a formality. 
                    Goodbye. 

    MRS KING puts down the phone, FRANK quickly resumes fixing 
    the shelf.

                                  MRS KING
                    Mr London, do let me know if you 
                    see any new faces on the premises

      OSCAR

      OSCAR skulks along the corridor. He sees a small anonymous 
      locker room which OSCAR slips in and turns on the light. 
      There are three or four lockers but OSCAR knows which one 
      he s looking for. He takes out the  Magno-Thumb and uses 
    it to pick the lock. The locker opens and OSCAR begins 
      rifling through the various items inside. OSCAR finds what 
      he s looking for...    He takes out and examines a large 
      tube of ointment, reading the small print to himself.

    He sees something else in the locker. He reaches in and 
      pulls out a small locket. He looks at the locket. Moved.

      eye. The door opens, CHIEF AGENT SHAW enters. OSCAR palms 
    the locket and wipes the tear away.     MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 18.

      looks at the tube again, suspicious.

                    Mmm... looks like a simple anti-

    He puts the package into a large round bin then looks round 
    to see if there s anything suspicious. As he does he absent-

                    Carrie s right, we saw how much 
                    The Grand Master loves Flopsy.
                    Maybe he ll exchange your Mum for 
                    his pet?

      CARRIE, HUTCHINSON, MRS KING, EDUCATION DEPTMAN

      CARRIE is about to see MAURICE HUTCHINSON off the premises.

                                  CARRIE
                    Thanks for you all your help, 
                    Maurice.

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    Not at all. I m glad Flopsyhas 
                    recovered so well. Good luck with 
                    the rescue mission.

      CARRIE heads off and HUTCHINSON heads for the door. He s 
      about to exit when another hand grabs his own. He looks up 
    to see --- MRS KING.

                                  MRS KING
                    I know why you re here.

      HUTCHINSON twitches like a nervous rabbit.

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    You do?

                                  MRS KING
                    Mr Flatley is a wonderful man, I 
                    just want to make sure your 
                    bosses know that.

    She drags him off towards the office.

                                  HUTCHINSON
                    Mr Flatley?

                                  MRS KING

    As they EXIT, an anonymous grey-suited man (the EDUCATION 
      DEPTMAN) slips unnoticed into the room and looks around.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

                    You should have come to us 
                    sooner.

                                  OSCAR
                    I wish I had.

                                  ROSE
                    I m not saying it to get at you. 
                    I m saying it so you know we re 
                    on your side.

      OSCAR nods appreciatively.

                                  ROSE
                    This opwon t be easy for you. If 
                    you want to back out, Carrie and 
                    me will cover.

                    Thanks. 

      OSCAR looks at his watch.

                                  OSCAR
                    We should get going...

      ROSE smiles, proud of his courage.

      DIXON-HALLIDAY, FLOPSY, AGENT SHAW, AGENT LILL, AGENT KHAN, 
      2 SKUL AGENTS, MI9 SWAT TEAM

      CARRIE, ROSE AND OSCAR wait at one end of a park 
      footbridge. The team have their faces covered to protect 
      their identities. OSCAR is gripping the locket so hard his 
      hand is white. Figures now appear at the other end of the 
      bridge - The GRAND MASTER, TWO dangerous looking SKUL 
      AGENTS and Oscar s mum - AGENT HALLIDAY. She looks a bit 
      tatty and battered like someone who s been in a harsh 
      prison for a couple of years. OSCAR sees her.

                                  OSCAR
                    Mum!    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 31.


      He s about to go tearing towards her but ROSE drags him 
      back.

                                  ROSE
                    Wait, we have to do this like we 
                    planned. 

      OSCAR nods, struggling to keep his emotions in check. 
      CARRIE raises her hand as a signal for the exchange to 
      begin. The GRAND MASTER raises his hand too. 

                                  FRANK
                          (under his breath)
                    Here we go.

      ROSE picks up the rabbit cage and carries it up onto the 
      bridge towards the GRAND MASTER. AGENT DIXON HALLIDAY is 
      pushed roughly forward by the TWO SKUL AGENTS. AGENT DIXON 
      HALLIDAY starts limping across the bridge. ROSE starts 
      walking back towards the MI9 team. There is a look of hope 
    on OSCAR s face, then confusion as he sees her limp. All 
    the pieces crash into place for OSCAR... we flashback to...

      walks with a pronounced limp.

      OSCAR leaps to his feet. ROSE is halfway back from 
      depositing the cage. 

                                  OSCAR
                    It s my mum... She s working for

                    Oscar, are you sure.

                          (bitterly)
                    She s with them. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Rose, get Flopsy.

    But AGENT DIXON HALLIDAY is already level with FLOPSY S 
      cage. She grabs it and looks for a fleeting moment back at 
    the watching OSCAR. She turns and runs back across the 
      bridge to the GRAND MASTER. CARRIE, ROSE and FRANK run 
      towards the bridge. OSCAR doesn t move, he s in shock. 

                                  FRANK
                          (into walkie-talkie)
                    Swat team, go! Take them!

    As the team start to cross the bridge, three MI9 SWAT TEAM 
      appear. They run towards the GRAND MASTER. But the SKUL 
      AGENTS drop smoke bombs. Under their cover, THE GRAND 
      MASTER and his team vanish down manholes. Smoke swirls 
      everywhere.

                                  CARRIE
                    Where did they go?!

                                  ROSE
                    I can t see anything.

      CARRIE, ROSE, FRANK and the MI9 AGENTS search in vain for 
    the GRAND MASTER using tracking devices. The fog starts to 
      clear and there is no sign of the SKUL group. 

      OSCAR stares gloomily into the mist. OSCAR looks down 
      coldly at the locket in his hand. He throws it in the 
      canal. 

                                                                          CUT TO:    MI High III Ep 12 Operation Flopsy Shooting Script 04.08.08 33.
