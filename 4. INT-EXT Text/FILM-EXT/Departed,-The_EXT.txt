The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't
where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores
with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island.
Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.
COSTELLO (V.O.)
Twenty years after an Irishman
couldn't get a job, we had the
presidency. That's what the niggers
don't realize. If I got one thing
against the black chaps it's this.
No one gives it to you. You have to
take it.
Rose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a
MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who
has just been executed.
COSTELLO
Jeez, she fell funny.
FRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand.
FRENCH
Frank, you gotta see somebody.
They go about their business.
STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI
yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming
down his face. His opinion on the experience is not
decipherable. Ad libs: "Sir, yes, sir."
Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police
Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and
BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very
rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each
other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.
COLIN
Fucking firemen are getting pussy
for the first time in the history
of fire. Or pussy.
COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON
HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light
behind. Misty golden beauty.

CONTINUED:
BARRIGAN
What are you looking at? Forget
it. Your father was a janitor, and
his son's only a cop.
COLIN
(not vainglorious, but
innocently stretching for
the idea)
You're in trouble if you're "only"
anything.
BARRIGAN
Don't tell me I'm looking at the
first dickhead-American president
of the United States.
COLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to
pretend that he does. He smiles.
Bagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of
paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN.
SPEAKER (V.O.)
The Massachusetts State Police has
a long tradition of excellence.
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance into one of the
finest law enforcement agencies in
our nation. As the Governor of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am
confident each and every one of you
will serve with distinction, honor
and integrity.
CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person,
through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by
family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.
THE MAYOR VO
Congratulations. You are dismissed.
The bagpipe band plays "Minstrel Boy."
COLIN'S POV:
AN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the
car.

CONTINUED:
COLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX.
COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE:
The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of
Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.
COSTELLO
School's out. You earned it. Yeah,
no more teachers, no more books.
BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running,
alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs.
BROWN
She tells me, you never finish
anything.
(puff puff)
You finish the police course you
get taken care of again baby.
(puff puff)
So after graduation
(puff puff)
I get a blowjob again.
BILLY
That's great. Your mom must be a
wonderful woman.
BROWN
Fuck yourself.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
BILLY
Look at it this way, you're a black
guy in Boston. You don't need any
help from me to be completely
fucked.
BROWN
Ways to get ahead, though, man,
ways to get ahead.
BILLY
(exasperated by this)
To where. (Yeah)
BROWN is left thinking about this.
BILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI.
DRILL INSTRUCTOR
This is not the regular police.
This is the state police. Your
training will illustrate the
difference. What's the difference?
BILLY
(sotto voce to BROWN)
Rage issues and lower median IQ.
DRILL INSTRUCTOR
You say something?
BILLY
Sir, I was agreeing with you about
our obvious superiority to other
forms of police, sir.
DRILL INSTRUCTOR
We're not superior, we're the best.
BILLY
Sir, yes sir.
BILLY fires, and changes clips.
A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a
plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The
Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at
the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses
and walks towards the door.
A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line,
is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign
fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums.
BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry
young man at his life's turning point.
BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-
bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly
to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY,
hands in the pocket of a good suit.
WASP UNCLE
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?
BILLY
You mean Stephanie who was the only
one who came to my father's
funeral? That Stephanie?
UNCLE
That Stephanie.
BILLY
Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.
UNCLE
Are you trying to prove something
to the family?
BILLY
When you say "family", what do you
mean? You?
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
UNCLE
You always question everything,
don't you?
BILLY
Yeah, well, maybe it would have
done you some good to have a
question from time to time. "Am I
an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?"
"Is my wife a money-grubbing
whore?" Those are questions.
(the UNCLE starts to
leave)
"Have I been good to my dying
sister or am I just pretending to
be?"
(he's stung THE UNCLE)
Too late now, right?
UNCLE
Do you need some money for the
funeral?
THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat.
BILLY
When my mother dies we don't have
any connection. You got it?
AERIAL. FLY FROM the HOSPITAL TO:
THE GOLD DOME ON BEACON HILL
BILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is
the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He's smoking
a cigarette, making his decision.
BILLY throws down his cigarette. He has decided.
FILM TITLE:
THE DEPARTED
23.
Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby
genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy
seems to have no real connection with any of them.
LATER
BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind-
blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The
Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is
signed: "F. Costello".
COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston.
THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied:
worried.
BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and
knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen
cylinder, smoking.
BILLY'S AUNT
Billy?
BILLY nods.
BILLY
Aunt Cathy?
His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then
embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he
is. But he might well love his aunt.
BILLY'S AUNT
Good to see you. Good to see you.
Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer.
SEAN
When did I see you after that?
BILLY
Not for a long time. Down the cape
after Rose's wedding. I think.
SEAN
Fuck, oh shit. I remember that,
dude. I had that fuckin' buck
knife, right, and I cut all the
brass numbas off the doors at the
hotel. I was trippin'...All of
them. That was a night.
Sean looks deflated.
BILLY
Listen, I got twenty thousand
dollars when my mother died.
Insurance.
SEAN
Yeah?
BILLY
In your line of work, if I gave you
ten thousand dollars what could you
give me back?
SEAN
My line of work... I'm not in that
line of work just presently because
I don't have ten thousand dollars.
As a matter of fact I have never
had ten thousand dollars.
BILLY
That's what I'm saying.
Sean nods, and nods.
SEAN
You know what we usually say at
these moments.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
BILLY
You fuckin' moron. What are you
talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm
your cousin.
COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes)
stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful
MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking
whiskey at 9 in the morning.
COLIN
Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in
school together. Myles was behind
me in school but I knew him. I will
get those responsible. Don't you
want to see us catch whoever used
him to do a robbery and then killed
him?
MRS KENNEFICK
Allegedly.
COLIN
(grimaces)
"Allegedly".
MRS KENNEFICK
If he was killed he probably did
something wrong.
COLIN
You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs
Kennefick? That's not what you
think he did wrong.
MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.
33.
MRS KENNEFICK
I mean fuck yourself.
She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he
notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery
van.
COLIN
You get that?
BARRIGAN
"Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"
COLIN
Welcome to the neighborhood.
FRENCH pulls up to a light.
[COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including
the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a
snarl of traffic.]
COSTELLO
Cut 'em here.
French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the
follow cars behind.
COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Bye, bye.
SEAGULLS squabble over unusual food. POWER PLANT IN THE
DISTANCE, the MTA-train going by. TWO BODIES lie in a tidal
ditch in the salt-marsh. They are the Italians who Billy
fought in the restaurant. Hands taped together behind their
backs. Two in the head each. COLIN is with the LYNN POLICE
and the State Police forensics people. COLIN gets down and
lifts a soaking lapel. Revealed is the tag of a men's shop in
Providence.
COLIN
The principles of detection tell me
that these men came from
Providence.
LYNN DETECTIVE
I'd appreciate it if you got out of
my crime scene.
COLIN
This is my crime scene, but knock
yourself out.
COLIN gets up. He walks back across the marsh. Opens his cell
phone.
COLIN (CONT'D)
(walking)
I saw a dead guy. I think I have
post traumatic stress. You
available for lunch? See you then.
At a PAY PHONE he dials another number.
COLIN deadpan, appreciative, hangs up the phone. BARRIGAN
walks in the middle distance, giving the man his privacy.
COLIN
Wanna see some dead guys?
The wire falls into the water.
A GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and
stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going
on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
COLIN
This will get Captain Ellerby on
the six o'clock news.
BARRIGAN
No wonder you get ahead.
BILLY walking and talking on the phone.
BILLY
I won't do it if I have to wear a
wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you
understand me? You don't know what
this is like.
(listens)
Micro what?
ELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones.
REPORTER
Did you have a tip from an
informant?
ELLERBY
No, it was tireless police activity
that ah effected ah the arrest of
the ah alleged perpetrator.
BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge.
MISTER FRENCH
Very interesting.
BILLY
Yeah, well. Fuck.
MISTER FRENCH
Don't worry about it. Guy didn't
need need his teeth anyway. Maybe
if he was an Eskimo. But in this
country we eat a variety of items.
They get into COSTELLO'S CAR. Billy in the front seat. Mister
French in the back.
MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.
COSTELLO does an Edgar Kennedy.
COSTELLO
So?
BILLY
He was...
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
MISTER FRENCH
Reaching for his cigarettes.
BILLY
Okay! You gonna give me shit, it
wasn't no reason----he put his hand
in his coat! I don't know if he's a
bookie or what the fuck he's
doing...
COSTELLO
(interrupting)
Well, you know what the fuck a
bookie does?
BILLY
(to Costello)
Pays you.
COSTELLO
Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who
goes around knocking guys teeth out
for no reason.
He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.
COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Here. From now on call the bar and
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask
for Mikey because there's no Mikey.
Wait. We'll call.
MISTER FRENCH
Forty-eight hours from the time
this phone first rings, you take
the fucking chip out - like so -
and you fucking destroy it. After
three days a phone ain't clean. If
you use a phone which is not clean,
you will have a accident. You never
call us. We call you. You got that?
BILLY
I got it.
MISTER FRENCH
I can't fuckin' hear you.
BILLY
I got it.
53.
FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches.
Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off.
BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His
knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated.
Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it.
In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.
QUEENAN
Hey.
Let's go through the routine.
DIGNAM
You think you can pop someone.
There's no special card to play.
The guy whose jaw you broke was
Boston Police Department.
BILLY
I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be
someone else every day.
DIGNAM
Most of the people in the world do
it every day. What's the big deal?
Dignam is drinking coffee.
BILLY
I'm not them.
DIGNAM
You're nobody. You signed the
paper. We're the only people in
the world who know that you're a
cop. Maybe we'll just erase your
file.
This is Billy's deepest fear.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
DIGNAM (CONT'D)
And zip, you're a soldier for
Costello, open to arrest for how
many felonies? Maybe we'll do
that.
BILLY
Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.
QUEENAN
Easy now.
That was a joke, Billy.
DIGNAM
Just because you play a fucking
tough guy doesn't mean you are one,
you lace curtain fucking pussy.
The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the
wall.
QUEENAN
(gently, like a man
calming a wild animal)
Be smart. If someone was watching
how are we supposed to not arrest
you?
BILLY looks desperately inland.
REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty
terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.
QUEENAN (CONT'D)
Get in the car.
They do.
QUEENAN (CONT'D)
Keep your act together. It's just a
little while longer.
BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his
hands in disbelief.
BILLY
When are you going to take
Costello? What's wrong with taking
'em on any one of the million
felonies you've seen him do. Get
him for pissing in the street.

BILLY (CONT'D)
What, are you waiting for him to
chop me up and feed me to the poor?
DIGNAM
Well. That would stick...
QUEENAN
You shut up. We're building a
case. It takes time. You know that.
BILLY
There's something wrong.
QUEENAN
Maybe. Maybe.
DIGNAM
Keep your ears opened.
No
bullshit.
QUEENAN
I want you to listen for any
chatter about a spy in the Special
Investigation Unit.
(BILLY looks at him)
You hear anything like that?
BILLY shakes his head.
BILLY
Are you serious?
QUEENAN
I'm afraid so.
BILLY
Jesus H. Christ.
QUEENAN
Hang tight for me. Just a little
longer. We're this close.
BILLY nods reluctantly.
BILLY
Okay.
QUEENAN
Thank you, Billy
61.
Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches
up to him.
MADOLYN
Why is the hardest patient of the
day always the last one?
BILLY
Because you're bored and tired and
don't give a shit. It's not
supernatural.
MADOLYN
Look, I'm not just...somebody you
have to see or they put you in
jail. If you are in distress I will
help you.
Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.
BILLY
What's this?
MADOLYN
My card. And a prescription for
twenty Lorazepam.
BILLY stands holding the prescription.
BILLY
Is it enough to kill myself?
MADOLYN
(she fixes him with a
stare)
Maybe it is. All right? Have I done
my job up to your goddamned
standards? Because by my standards
you fit the model of drug-seeking
behavior, and fuck you if you don't
like my initial clinical reaction.
BILLY
(re: prescription)
Thank you.
(CONTINUED)
70.

MADOLYN
I'm transferring you to another
counselor.
She starts to go back inside.
BILLY
You wanna get a cup of coffee?
COSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO
IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone.
Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and
a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel
(random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI,
and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a
BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.
COSTELLO
See, no surveillance here. They
didn't figure we had a navy.
Always figure an exit for your
business partners. What with
everything all dug up, you can't
trust a slant to find the Mass Pike
and, with or without Staties out
front, frankly I don't approve of
orientals driving to begin with.
BILLY
What about us, Frank?
What're we
gonna do?
COSTELLO
We depart. We didn't commit no
illegalities.
BILLY is stunned. Admiring.
MISTER FRENCH
Except sell the ching chongs a
bunch of fuckin' plastic.

The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in
the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and
then follows him.
103A
A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit
stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers
approach the cars they realize they are empty except for
hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the
command center.
COSTELLO, with his collar turned up, is walking along the
floats. Wearing a headset.

COLIN hunches, closing the glass door, and glancing in at

COLIN
Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have

happened once.
COSTELLO
Was that that shrink cunt answered
the phone?
COLIN
Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna
move in, so she moved in.
COSTELLO
You better get organized, quick.
COLIN
Last time I checked, I tipped you

COSTELLO
Are you listening to me?
COLIN
Yes.

COSTELLO

COLIN looks in at MADOLYN.
COLIN
Yes. Yes I do.
COLIN is frustrated.
COSTELLO
So earn it.
(a beat)
I'm gettin' the feeling we got a
cop in my crew.
COLIN
I been gettin' that same feeling.
COSTELLO
He's one of yours. Inside. Have you
seen anything?
COLIN
Look, I have no access to
undercover files in Queenan's
department. It's locked up. Queenan
and Dignam run the snitches. They
don't give anybody a peep. I'm
doing the best...
COSTELLO
(interrupting)
Your best? What do you think
we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery
business?
COLIN takes a breath, tries to reason and mind his place.
COLIN
Please Frank, if you don't relax I
can't relax. Let's start with
this...get me all the information
on the people around you last
night. Everyone that works for you.
Get me real first names. Get me...

COSTELLO
(interrupting Colin)
Get you? Give you? Who the fuck
do you work for?
COLIN
Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you
please get me social security
numbers, ah, I need drivers license
numbers, full names, dates of
birth, anything like that. Bank
account numbers, everything that
you don't get from a criminal
record or, or a wrap sheet or a...
COSTELLO
(relenting a little)
Collie, calm down or you'll shoot
in your pants. I'll get you the
records and whatnot. You'll have
'em but listen to me son, don't
disappoint me on this, or some
other guy will be putting their
cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.
Costello hangs up and walks along and sees QUEENAN and DIGNAM
step out.
QUEENAN
How are you, Francis?
COSTELLO
My mother called me Francis.
QUEENAN
I know she did. And your father
called you the tumor.
COSTELLO, not liking that:
COSTELLO
Oh, what did your father call you,
Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he
wasn't around.
QUEENAN
Where are the real microprocessors,
Frank?

COSTELLO
(to Dignam)
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for
me?
QUEENAN
I will get you, Frank.
COSTELLO
If you could've you would've but I
guess you like to go at your own
pace.
From off-stage we hear a young, angelic GIRLS CHOIR begin to

BANKROBBER

that's what he does.
BILLY
FBI? What the fuck are you talking

BANKROBBER
Oh my God, is that French out

BILLY
(grabbing him by the
shirt)
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?
BANKROBBER
Forget what I said. I'm fucking
high, I'm high.
Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows
what this means.

As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's
"Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has
to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the
kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.
BILLY
Tell me what the fuck you said.
BANKROBBER
(covered with blood)
Why do you think he's not arrested?
Costello's a protected FBI
informant. He'll trade you out.

I thought I was supposed to go into
shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking

BILLY gets out of the house.

BILLY
Hey, it's me.
QUEENAN
What do you want? What are you
doing here?
BILLY
Come here.
QUEENAN approaches him.
BILLY (CONT'D)
Costello is giving people up to the
FBI.
QUEENAN stares.
QUEENAN
The FBI?
BILLY
He gives information to the FBI.
He's a protected informant. Aren't
they trying to make it a Federal
case? And it never gets made?
QUEENAN
(realizing he has to be
very careful)
Go around the back. Go around the
back.
COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.
ELLERBY
Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy
like you since me. You'll be
transferred to Internal
Investigations but you will
continue to work right where you
are in the Special Investigation
Unit.
COLIN
I don't get it.
ELLERBY
We are all convinced that Costello
has at least one mole in the
Special Investigation Unit.
COLIN
Right.
ELLERBY
You'll investigate. Everybody.
Anybody.
COLIN
Well, that's just a dream job for a
cop.
ELLERBY

How's the wedding coming along?
COLIN
Everything's great. On schedule.
She's a doctor.
ELLERBY
Outstanding. That's good. Marriage
is an important part of getting
ahead. You don't want anyone
thinking you're a homo. Married guy
seems stable. People look at a
wedding ring and think: someone can
stand the son of a bitch. Ladies
see the wedding ring and know
immediately that you must have some
cash and that your cock works.
COLIN
Oh, it's working. Overtime.
ELLERBY
I'm glad to hear that.
Hits a drive. Ponk.
HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings.

Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.
Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He
gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.
COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his
coat.
BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate
to see Colin's face.
COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down
another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the
corner.
ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).
BILLY'S POV:
COLIN is halfway down the street.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
BILLY follows.
BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street
(And COLIN is aware of the tail)
when...
BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they
do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only
thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.
BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
Make arrest.
COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife
open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering)
footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner.
COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a
knife.
As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.
COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,
no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at
the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off
through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,
sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon
(the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where
a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes
through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.
BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her
packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into
Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the
door. The chain on.
BILLY
Your name's on the pill label. I
thought you weren't supposed to be
in the book, in case of obsessive
patients.
MADOLYN
How obsessive are you?
BILLY
Medium.
MADOLYN
Are you okay? Why are you here?
BILLY
I really liked our conversations.
I've been...regretting that we
didn't continue...our
conversations.
MADOLYN
I'm glad you want to see me...it's
nice to see you...I enjoyed
talking...I enjoyed having coffee
with you, very much...but I don't
see people...I don't see people in
my home.
Billy gets soaked.
Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.
FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the
restaurant.
DELAHUNT
Of course I know how to spot a cop.
FITZY
Oh yeah, how's that?
DELAHUNT
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.
THEIR POV:
A MAN across the street is looking into the window of an
antique shop.
DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
See that guy over there, he's a
cop. He's not paying attention to
us. He's a cop.
FITZY
Lot of fucking cops.
A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a
lapdog.
FITZY (CONT'D)
What kind of dog is that?
No response.
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
FITZY (CONT'D)
She's a cop.
DELAHUNT
She's probably the fucking Police
Commissioner.
BILLY steps out, ignoring DELAHUNT and FITZY.
DELAHUNT
You're a cop.
BILLY
Huh?
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
DELAHUNT
You're ignoring us. You're a cop.
We're guessing who cops are. Most
good looking women are cops.
BILLY
Right. I'm going home. He's playing
with his new boys.
DELAHUNT
See you later.
BILLY
Later.
BILLY walks down the street and heads into an alley.
Around
the corner, he opens his phone.
BILLY (CONT'D)
He's moving something with all new
guys. (A whole new crew.) I don't
want to tell you what or where. It
might be disinformation. It
probably is. Just keep following
him. I need to see you today.
(a beat...reacting to
Queenan, Billy continues)
No. Today.
A DETECTIVE (DETECTIVE 1) is leading the team to trail after
Queenan. On foot. A plug in his ear. Two other DETECTIVES sit
in a sedan nearby. (These three detectives are new guys,
never seen before, the I.I. surveillance team working for
Colin).
DETECTIVE 1
Can I ask a question, Sergeant?
COLIN
Yes, go ahead.
DETECTIVE 2
Why the fuck are we following
Captain Queenan? To find out about
the good Catholic life?
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
COLIN
(angrily)
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely, however fucking
painful it might be to your
delicate fucking sensibilities.
DETECTIVE 1
Who says I have delicate
sensibilities?
COLIN
I have reason to believe that
Queenan is Costello's informer.
Follow him, and don't get made.
DETECTIVE 1
Copy that, Sarge
The detectives in the car get alert and start their car as
QUEENAN comes out of the building.
DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
We got him.
DETECTIVE 2
Sarge, we got the target.
DETECTIVE 1 trails Captain Queenan through the crowds of
people heading towards work.
QUEENAN, mild in his specs, chewing gum with his dentures,
comes out of the station, and looks at the TEXT MESSAGE on
his phone.
118.
A building under rehab, covered with scaffolding, but still
functioning as a corporate building. QUEENAN goes along to
the entrance, and in.
DETECTIVE 1 comes along after him. We see the Internal
Investigations car up the street. DETECTIVE 1 dials his
cellphone.
DETECTIVE 1
He went into a building on the
waterfront. Address is 344 Wash...
DETECTIVE 1 emerges from the building and joins other
detectives in the car.
DETECTIVE 1
I don't know what we're doing here.
FITZY and DELAHUNT'S phones ring simultaneously.
DELAHUNT
Get the van. Get the boys.
119.
BILLY is waiting on the roof as QUEENAN finally arrives.
QUEENAN
I assume these premises do not have
an anti-smoking ordinance. So,
what's going on?
BILLY
I told you, he's got dope coming
in, I don't know where. He's
getting spooky, Captain...
QUEENAN
What do you mean?
BILLY
He's crazy. I just saw the man.
He had blood all over him. I can't
get any more information for you.
I can't trust it. He's not
including his regular guys... I'm
telling you, he's gonna find out
who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill
me, I know it.
QUEENAN
All right, all right. I hear you.
I'm sorry for you trouble. Look,
I'm not gonna jeopardize your
safety any longer. I'll get you
out. I can't do it overnight but
I'll do it. We can bust him for
what we have. At least I think we
can...I hope. You're out of there
ASAP.
BILLY nods, and nods.
BILLY
Yeah?
What about the FBI?
QUEENAN
They're compromised.
BILLY
What?
QUEENAN
They're fucked, just like this
lighter.
(CONTINUED)
120.
CONTINUED:
BILLY'S phone rings.
BILLY listens in horror, staring at the oblivious QUEENAN.
QUEENAN
What?
BILLY
You were fucking followed.
QUEENAN
By who?
BILLY
Costello's people.
QUEENAN
Impossible.
BILLY
No. One of the cops he's got inside
tipped him.
QUEENAN realizes that his enemy might be...
FITZY'S VAN stops outside the building. COSTELLO'S MEN get
out of the van, and head into the lobby.
BILLY climbs out onto the fire escape at the back of the
building and starts dropping down, fast.
122.
BILLY drops off the fire escape and runs down the alley.
BILLY towards the front doors just as--
QUEENAN'S BODY bounces off the scaffolding, smashes into the
pavement and explodes. BLOOD splashes all over BILLY.
FITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the
UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY.
FITZY
You're fuckin' late. Where the
fuck were you? Get in the fuckin'
van.
(CONTINUED)
123.
CONTINUED:
BILLY
What the fuck happened?
I came to
meet you.
They start piling into a van.
DETECTIVE 1
No pursuit. No pursuit.
DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)
Fuck that.
DETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing
men, gun drawn.
FITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1
fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the
detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN
takes off.
DETECTIVE 4
Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X
to CP. We're being fired upon. I
repeat.
124.
When she comes out: BILLY is waiting.
BILLY
I tried to call you a few times.
MADOLYN
I know.
(I know.).
I can't...
He leans close to her.
She strokes his head.
MADOLYN (CONT'D)
I can't be a friend to you. I
can't. I'm sorry.
BILLY
It's okay, okay, I know.
MADOLYN walks away.
INTERCUT COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT
COLIN needs a shower and is gun-shy as people move past the
glass windows. He is still rinsing blood out of his mouth.
COSTELLO is listening to LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR. GWEN sits nearby
in attractive lingerie, reading a book.
COSTELLO
Now, when I hear Lucia, I can't
stop thinking about the cocaine
curtsy you did on that nigger
broad's face.
(the phone rings. Costello
answers:)
What?
(CONTINUED)
129.
CONTINUED:
COLIN
(into phone)
Your shouldn't have killed Queenan.
COSTELLO
One of us was going to have to die.
With me it tends to be the other
guy.
COLIN
(agitated)
You're crazy, Frank. You killed the
guy who has all the information.
And Dignam's not in the office,
he's gone. He resigned.
COSTELLO
I don't give a fuck about Dignam.
COLIN
He's fucking gone. They took his
papers in. He's not talking. I
don't know where he is.
COSTELLO
Don't get your balls in an uproar,
Collie. That Irish piss-ant won't
be a problem. He's so hot for me,
we give him a whiff of my ass,
he'll crawl right in it. Let's give
him a whiff.
COLIN
I will.
COSTELLO
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
COSTELLO turns to the GWEN.
COSTELLO (CONT'D)
Sweetheart, you're giving me a hard-
on.
He starts to dial the phone.
GWEN
Are you sure it's me or all that
talk about whiffin' and crawlin' up
asses?
(CONTINUED)
130.
CONTINUED: (2)
COSTELLO
Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
GWEN
You watch it.
She rises and as she crosses:
GWEN (CONT'D)
Let me straighten you out.
COLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table
he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained
effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE.
He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on
his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the
glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches
up the last incoming number.
Two cars carrying Costello and his men are speeding down the
highway. Behind them, two SIU CARS are trailing.
COSTELLO is checking the rearview mirror. He sees: The TWO
SIU CARS exit the highway onto Atlantic Avenue. COSTELLO
smiles.
The cars exit the highway. The cars pass through a maze of
industrial streets.
(CONTINUED)
135.
CONTINUED:
BILLY, riding in the back seat, is trying desperately to see
where they are. He sees a STREET SIGN and taps out a text
message on his phone.
It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the
upper parts accessible but still under construction. It is
built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it. The COMMAND VAN
and POLICE CARS pull up with lights off. A TACTICAL VAN
disgorges TACTICAL OFFICERS who spread out through the dark.
BILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza.
BILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the
knife.
BILLY
Costello recorded everything. He
put all the tapes in a little box
and kept them with his lawyer. That
was his insurance. His lawyer came
to me. Costello trusted me the
most. Imagine that you rat fuck.
Sound quality good enough? I was a
little worried.
COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking
for a tail...
COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much
a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him
from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back
of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his
skull.
BILLY
Get your hands up.
Hands.
Hands.
COLIN
Put the fuckin' gun down.
BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's
forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's
belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!"
at Colin every time he makes a move).
COLIN (CONT'D)
I came here to talk some fucking
sense to you. You get a hold of
yourself and put down the fuckin'
firearm and act professional and I
can get you your money.
BILLY
(turning him around)
What did you say?
COLIN
I can get you your...
(CONTINUED)
147.
CONTINUED:
BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes
down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open.
Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun.
COLIN (CONT'D)
(spitting teeth)
Fuck, shit...
BILLY
(going for Colin's cuffs)
You didn't come here to talk, you
fuckin' maggot, you came here to
get arrested.
COLIN
Arrested? Arrested for what.
(as BILLY cuffs him)
So you got tapes of what? Costello
was my informant. I was his rat?
Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was
my informant.
BILLY
Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.
COLIN
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, prick. Only one of us is
a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who
you are. Nobody knows who you are.
BILLY
Would you shut the fuck up.
COLIN
I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State
Police. Who the fuck are you?
Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.
BILLY
You erased me?
COLIN
Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein.
See what happens.
BILLY
What would happen is the bullet
would go right through your fuckin'
head.
(CONTINUED)
148.
CONTINUED: (2)
COLIN
Watch what happens.
BILLY
What, you think you're gonna get
the parade? The bagpipes and
bullshit? Fuck you.
(safeties the gun)
I'm arresting you.
COLIN
That's the stupidest thing you
could do.
BILLY
Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up.
(hits him)
I don't give a fuck if these
charges don't stick.
(whaling him in the beats)
But I'm still fucking arresting
you.
COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his
hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next
move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
BILLY (CONT'D)
[You are what you do.] Get up.
(COLIN doesn't move.)
I said get the fuck up.
BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to
Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both
hear it.
BROWN
Put down the weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.
BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield
aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.
BILLY
I called you. You specifically.
You know who I am. I'm not gonna
shoot. I told you to meet me
downstairs.
COLIN
Help me.
(CONTINUED)
149.
CONTINUED: (3)
Billy realizes he's in a truly shitty situation:
appearances
are everything.
BROWN
Put the weapon on the deck and step
away from Sergeant Sullivan.
COLIN
(a mess, bloody-mouthed)
Shoot the fuckin' prick.
BILLY
(desperqte)
Where's Dignam? I told you to bring
Dignam!
COLIN
Shoot the motherfucker!
BROWN
Put the weapon on the ground and
we'll discuss it.
BILLY
He was Costello's rat. I got
evidence. Tapes. Other documents.
BROWN
Maybe you do, but right now I need
you to drop the weapon.
BILLY
I told you I've got the evidence
cold linking this prick to
Costello...
(BROWN wavers)
You fuckin' know who I am. I'm
taking him downstairs now.
BROWN, weapon ready, follows into the elevator lobby.
POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto
ambulances. COLIN, hands free, is drinking coffee from a
paper cup, being checked out by a doctor.
BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried
in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way
they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting.
MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly
apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him,
apparently forever.
(CONTINUED)
152.
CONTINUED:
COLIN squares off: his job in the world is to get ahead. A
salute is fired with rifles. But later...
COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.
COLIN
What about the baby?
She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out
through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.
