BASE CAMP
The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred
shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.
FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of
the shuttle ramp.
FAT LOU
(yelling over the wind)
Let's go! Time to load up!
YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil.
YLLO
(yelling)
I'm missing two!
FAT LOU
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
left this rock an hour ago!
BOEMAN
(eyes a device)
North three clicks.
CUT TO:
YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky,
physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.
He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.
BOEMAN
(yelling)
There!
KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic
military garb -
KICKER
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
YLLO
We're missing two of the kids!
KICKER
Get your ass back to the shuttle.
I'll check it out.
KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.
YLLO
Not without me!
The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.
CRYO CELL
YLLO
Kay-Em!
Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.
The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.
BOEMAN
That wasn't so bad.
Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.
KICKER
(yells)
This will be!
The others dive for the ground as -
-
KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!
THORGAN
Nice touch.
BOEMAN
And you said high school was boring.
Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.
FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.
FAT LOU
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
YLLO
Just get us to the ship!
Azrael stops in a panic!
AZRAEL
Oh shit I forgot my arm!
ADRIENNE
Here. Dumbass.
She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.
The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the
sky.
CUT TO:
ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE
THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old
satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.
SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.
A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.
LAB ONE CORRIDOR
Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his
cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO
appears.
GAME GRID CORRIDOR
Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The
doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.
KICKER
Damn. Are they playing?
SVEN
Dallas?! Azrael!
Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on
their lights and ready their weapons.
GRENDEL CLASS IV
She banks slowly to the right.
GRENDEL CLASS IV
The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.
GRENDEL CLASS IV
The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!
GRENDEL CLASS IV
Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --
KA-FOOM!
Space Lab EXPLODES!
GRENDEL CLASS IV
Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.
SHUTTLE
One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.
SHUTTLE
IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.
The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls.
The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
to pull away. Then --
KA-FOOM!!
Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.
No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something
foreign.
The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a
camp.
But the image will do.
QUICK CUT TO:
Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --
A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
CAMPERS!!!
He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --
SPLASHING.
He turns.
HIS POV
Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little
boy?
A little Jason from many years ago?
WOMAN
Help me!
(gurgles)
Jason help me!
JASON
Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.
HIS POV
THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!
He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --
JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.
MRS. VOORHEES
Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!
Jason moves closer.
MRS. VOORHEES
Don't let me die again!
As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.
JASON
Pauses staring at the please for help.
He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!
He places his hand over her face, gently, then --
PUSHES HER UNDER!
He holds her there.
QUICK-CUT TO:
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.
Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
The image flickers...he
catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo
the
room. He starts toward them.
Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.
WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
(sings; deep african american voice)
I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...
SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see
our
heroes. Jason is closer.
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in
scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a
tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.
Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
longer fool him.
A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
A couple of goats.
Nothing is stopping Jason.
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
The image finally disintergrates.
Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock,
but --
Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to
the
floor.
BOEMAN(V.O.)
Sergeant!
BRODSKI(V.O.)
Get out of here!
SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.
The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.
BRODSKI(V.O.)
That all you got?!!
Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally,
the tough
old leather neck is silent for good.
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL
AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Hey, easy now.
He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
You wanna release your air tanks?
RIZZO(V.O.)
(nervous)
Okay, good tip.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
You'll be fine.
BOEMAN(V.O.)
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
We'll be fine.
RIZZO(V.O.)
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
So far so good.
WHAM!
Jason starts pounding from the other side.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Don't worry. He can't get through that door.
Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.
BOEMAN(V.O.)
Thrusters.
CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.
Our group enters deep space.
WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL
Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
right hull. They thrust slowly into space.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Rizzo, you okay?
RIZZO(V.O.)
No I'm not okay! I don't
know what the hell I'm doing!
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
You're doing fine. I won't let
anything happen to you, remember?
QUICK CUT TO:
Jason flies out of the air lock.
HIS POV
He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!
ANOTHER ANGLE
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
RIZZO(V.O.)
I think I had some when I was eight.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Did you like it?
RIZZO(V.O.)
I think so, why?
THORGAN(V.O.)
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Shut up, Thorgan!
RIZZO(V.O.)
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
I know you.
Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away
from
the others.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Nooooooo!!
RIZZO
grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.
Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back.
He's
going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her
head,
when --
WHAM!
Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.
Delongpre clings to Jason's back.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Rizzo, pull away!
RIZZO(V.O.)
I'm stuck!
Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until
he's holding Delongpre
around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!
ANOTHER ANGLE
AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...
THORGAN(V.O.)
We're too far away!
BACK TO JASON
AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.
RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.
The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.
Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button
on her sleeve.
KA-CHSSHSH!!!
HER AIR TANK BLOWS!
JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!
But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.
Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
toward Rizzo and Delongpre.
He has them...when --
WHAM!
BRODSKI
Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.
Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --
Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.
CHSHSHSH...
AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.
Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
You okay?!
RIZZO(V.O.)
(breathing steadily)
Oh great...yeah, having a great
time, and you?
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
RIZZO(V.O.)
Old woman?
DELONGPRE(V.O.)
Well I mean, technically you are old
enough to be my great, great, great...
RIZZO(V.O.)
I get it.
Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.
The four survivors huddle
together.
KAY-EM 14
Hello? A little assistance here?
They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her
and pulls
her head into his arms.
THE GROUP CHEERS.
THORGAN(V.O.)
Kay-em you okay?
KAY-EM 14
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
THORGAN(V.O.)
I missed you too.
KAY-EM 14
I love you.
Those two aren't the only two.
CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE
Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's
eyes.
RIZZO(V.O.)
Chinese, huh?
They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.
EARTH II -- ORBIT
Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.
BRODSKI
Yeee---Haaaaa!!
Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.
Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.
Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
descent.
His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.
Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.
Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.
His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his
body!
CAMP SIGHT
Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion
campfire.
KID # 1
Hey! Check that out!
They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.
KID # 2
A falling star!
KID # 3
It's a meteor dickhead.
KID # 2
It's still cool.
It LIGHTS up the night, then --
EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!
KID # 1
Cool!!!
From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.
CRYSTAL RESERVOIR
OUR POV
As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
hockey mask!
IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!
BACK TO KIDS
KID # 4
Damn! It his the reservoir.
KID # 1
Let's go check it out!
The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
could be a wonderful new discovery.
DISSOLVE INTO:
A STREAM.
The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
grusomely charred hands.
THE FINGERS,
TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --
FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --
