It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY
BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK.
Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a
highway.
The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors
up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-
per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and
cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.

Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet
below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.
Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby
away, one arm around his shoulder.

Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of
water.
CAROLINE
(not much heat)
Goddamn thing.
(CONTINUED)

She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare
avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.
CAROLINE
Oh, that poor man.
There is a pause.
Then Toby speaks:
TOBY
I hope to hell this isn't some
kind of omen.
Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees
the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins
and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.

7
Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the
road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and
Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.
CAROLINE
If I could have one wish right
now -- only one wish -- you know
what I'd like? I'd like to burn
this damn Nash Ambassador to a
crisp.
(as Toby laughs)
I'm serious. I hate it. I hate
the factory that produced it, and
I hate the man who invented it.
TOBY
It almost makes me want to see Roy
-- he was the only one could make
the thing stop overheating.
(a beat)
My God, he was boring. Boring and
mean: you sure got crappy taste in
boyfriends.
At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches
the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk
about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and
speaks directly to the car.
CAROLINE
I'd like to burn you to the ground.
(to Toby; big smile)
Let's go get rich in Salt Lake
City!

Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a
three-story concrete building. He holds a portable
RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."
9
10
Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in
a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and
says two words:
CAROLINE
Don't ask.
11
12
Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into
the engine.
TOBY
That mechanic in Colorado said it
needed points.
CAROLINE
I know. Don't tell me what I
already know. This thing's a
bottomless pit. I don't know what
to do. No matter how much money I
pour into it...
Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive
sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and
sympathetic.
WOMAN
I'd rather be whipped with a belt
than have car trouble. 'Course
these days I don't have to worry
about that. My husband got laid
off at the mill, and they
repossessed the car, so wherever
I wanna go, I just have to hoof
it, you know?
Caroline smiles, then her face changes.
CAROLINE
You don't have
a car?
(as the
Woman
shakes
her head)
You want this
one?
Shocked, the Woman says --
WOMAN
I... uh... I...
TOBY
You're gonna give our car away?
CAROLINE
(to the Woman)
Seriously. It needs points, and
it overheats constantly, but you
can have it if you want it,
because my hand to God, I can't
look at it one more minute.
WOMAN
Well, sure...
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

CAROLINE
Get the bags out. Get the owner's
slip out of the glove compartment.
We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch
pink and white albatross. You
don't mind taking a car with a big
dent in the passenger door?
WOMAN
Hell, no.
(she looks)
There's no dent there...
Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific,
flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size
of a dish-pan.
CAROLINE
Oh, yes there is!
Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her
the keys.
WOMAN
... you really just giving me this
car?
CAROLINE
It's done. It's yours. You got
yourself a Nash Ambassador!
(to Toby)
Let's go!
Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in
the world -- and off they go, feeling good.
13
13
1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread
is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed;
people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children
carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and
Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they
were going.
CAROLINE
... find ourselves a cheap room
someplace, we'll get you into
school, I'll brush up on my typing
and get a job, and things'll start
looking up. I feel it: the good
times are coming. And at least
we're rid of that damn Nash
Ambassador!
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

TOBY
Yeah, and like Dad used to say,
'We may be broke, but we're never
poor.' And later, if we get a
house with a big yard, I could
get a collie, you know? One like
Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday
maybe a palomino. And I'm going
to try harder in school, too...
The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an
odd way, brave as hell.
14
15
Caroline and Toby exit.
Toby sullen; Caroline angry.
TOBY
It wasn't me broke their stupid
windows.
CAROLINE
Liar.
TOBY
Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe
them instead of me.
CAROLINE
If you care anything about me at
all, you'll shut up.
(CONTINUED)
10.
15
CONTINUED:
15
TOBY
Yeah, well if you'd stayed married
to Dad none of this would've ever
happened.
CAROLINE
Look, don't you put that
on my
back: I can't make your
father
call you. I can't make
your
brother write you. They
dumped
you. Yes. But it's not
my fault.
16
20
Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch
TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden. One
Woman looks up.
WOMAN #1
Hi.
TOBY
Hello.
The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette,
pokes her companion.
WOMAN #1
My Lord, look at the eyes on
him -- won't he be a heartbreaker
in three, four years?
WOMAN #2
Bedroom eyes.
Toby smiles.
WOMAN #1
You live in the neighborhood,
sweetie?
TOBY
Over there.
(a beat)
I won't be here long, though,
'cause my dad's coming to get me.
WOMAN #1
Oh, yes?
TOBY
Yeah. I'm gonna live on his
ranch in Phoenix. The "Lazy B,"
it's called.
(CONTINUED)
15.
20
CONTINUED:
20
WOMAN #2
That sounds like fun.
TOBY
It is. I've got a palomino horse
and a collie, and Dad lets us go
on hunts all by ourselves. He
gave me this Winchester .22, and
last year I shot a mountain lion
with it. And Lad -- that's my
dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes
one time, and killed all twelve
of them...
The two Women exchange a glance.
It's obvious the boy
is lying.
21
23
Toby and Caroline hurry onboard a Greyhound bus with
Seattle as its destination.
CAROLINE
... I've always had a good head
for figures, and if I could get
my C.P.A. license, I believe we
could make a real go of it in
Seattle. I'll advertise for
roommates, and I bet we find us
a real cute house to rent.
TOBY
If there's a big yard, can I get
a collie?
CAROLINE
Sure. Oh, honey, I feel a wind
at my back: I think this is
going to work out good.
TOBY
(as they board
bus)
Yeah -- like heaven on a June day.
The DOORS of the bus close. WHOOSH! The bus begins to
move. Caroline and Toby's faces are at the window:
Seattle or bust.
DISSOLVE TO:
24
24
The house is a nasty little thing with peeling paint.
From inside we hear:
(CONTINUED)
18.
24
CONTINUED:
24
CAROLINE (O.S.)
... and if you cut school again
I'll just wear you out -- do you
hear me? I'm tired of it!
TOBY (O.S.)
Yeah, yeah...
Toby exits the house.
But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool. A few
months have passed.
He now wears T-shirts and jeans
which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he
combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward
into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip
-- or thinks he is.
He strolls on, feeling cool.
24A
24A
From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into
step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact
replica of him.
TOBY
Hey, Terry.
TERRY TAYLOR
Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say
about skipping school today?
TOBY
Who listens?
TERRY TAYLOR
You go over to Wanda's house last
night?
(as Toby nods)
You make out good?
(as Toby nods again)
How good?
TOBY
I fucked her 'til her nose bled.
TERRY TAYLOR
Sure you did!
Oh, Wolff, you're
rich.
25
29
We hear SCREAMING. Toby and Terry Taylor race BY the
CAMERA on stolen tricycles, yelling as if they're attack-
ing Indians. Behind them comes Terry Silver, on foot.
Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the
TRICYCLES SMASH into a parked car. Then they run like
hell with Terry Silver bringing up the rear.
30
31
We see Dwight driving his shiny Buick, Caroline and Toby
beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS
SHOTS, we hear:
DWIGHT (V.O.)
... air like wine at my place, and
I don't mind saying I wouldn't
live anywhere else, and that's the
God's honest truth. There's good
schools, honest people, and some
of the best fishing in the world.
Ted Williams -- you like baseball,
Toby? That is, Jack, I mean --
you like baseball? 'Cause Ted
Williams, whom I believe is one of
the all-time greats, is also a
world-class angler. Many's the
day he and I've talked over the
best way to get a fish to say yes
to a hook.

DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(a beat)
Hunting, too: there's game
everywhere you look. I don't
think I flatter myself by saying
that I'm something of a whiz with
a rifle, and Concrete gives me
every opportunity to prove it...
32
32
The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down
into the water.
They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their
yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they
leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from
their bodies.
DWIGHT
They always show you salmon
fighting to get upstream, but they
never show you what they look like
when they get there.
Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look.
The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an
eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight.
CAROLINE
It's pitiful.
Awful.
DWIGHT
They'll spawn, and then they'll
die. They're dying now.
As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the
car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear:
TOBY
I hope to hell it's not an omen.
Caroline has to fight back a smile.
A33
A33
The Buick drives into town past an enormous disused
Concrete silo where "Welcome To Concrete" is painted in
huge faded letters.
(CONTINUED)
26A.
A33
CONTINUED:
A33
DWIGHT
So here we go. Welcome to
Concrete. Dwight's home sweet
home. Finest people in the whole
state of Washington, you ask me.
Lots of churches, too. A neighbor
of mine says, "Looking for nice
churches, come to Concrete.
Looking for sin, go to hell." I
think that's funny...
Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their
first impression of Concrete.
33
33
Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and
Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said
it was.
DWIGHT
All the houses are converted Army
barracks, made into duplexes --
Three children exit the
house. SKIPPER, a pleasant boy
who is average in every
way, is 17. NORMA is 18, slow-
spoken and sensual, Toby
cannot take his eyes off her.
The third is PEARL, two
years younger than Toby. Pearl
has a bald spot the size
of a dollar, high on the side of
her head.
DWIGHT
Well. Let's see here. Kids, this
is my pretty friend, Caroline
Wolff, and her boy To...

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
(he catches himself)
Jack Wolff. These are my kids:
Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl.
Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head
into the house.
34
35
The business area is small and rather forlorn. The six
of them walk in pairs -- Dwight and Caroline, Skipper and
Norma, and last, Toby and Pearl. (Toby's eyes are glued
to the movement of Norma's body.)
(CONTINUED)
28.
35
CONTINUED:
35
DWIGHT
(about a gas station)
And over there's where I work.
CAROLINE
(to Skipper and Norma)
How about you guys? You like it
here?
They glance at each other.
SKIPPER
NORMA
Fine.
Yeah, it's fine.
NORMA
It's a little isolated, is all.
DWIGHT
Not that isolated.
NORMA
Well, maybe not that isolated.
Pretty isolated, though.
DWIGHT
Aw, there's plenty to do in
Concrete if you kids would take a
little initiative. When I was
growing up we didn't have T.V. --
we used our imaginations. We read
the classics. We played musical
instruments. You show me a bored
kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.
CAROLINE
I didn't know you played an
instrument, Dwight. What do you
play?
DWIGHT
(one-half second's
hesitation)
Sax.
Tenor sax.
Skipper and Norma glance at each other, then look away.
Caroline takes a cigarette from her purse. Again Dwight
jumps to her service: we are once more treated to the
mini-drama of Dwight unsheathing the Zippo from its
velvet case, opening the top on his pants leg, etc.
CAROLINE
(back to Skipper and
Norma)
How's the school here?
(CONTINUED)
29.
35
CONTINUED:
(2)
35
SKIPPER
There isn't one. We go to
Chinook.
NORMA
Chinook High.
DWIGHT
It's a few miles downriver.
SKIPPER
Forty miles.
DWIGHT
Come off it -- it's not that far.
SKIPPER
Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine
miles.
In spite of the fact that he's eager for this day to go
well, Dwight's bottom teeth begin to show.
DWIGHT
Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam
school was in your fugging
back yard. Just shut your god-
damn pie-hole.
They all shut their pie-holes. The six walk in a tense,
uncomfortable silence for five full beats. Then Pearl
tries to help out:
PEARL
I'm in fifth grade.
Nobody seems to care.
36
37
A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his
name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away,
Caroline stops him and holds out some money.
CAROLINE
Wolff.
Caroline Wolff.
MAN
You mean you want to enter? I
think it's against the rules.
(CONTINUED)
31.
37
CONTINUED:
37
CAROLINE
Well, that sign says this is an
N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying
N.R.A. member. That gives me the
right to participate in the
activities of other chapters.
MAN
You'll be the only woman shooting.
Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money
and writes down her name.
38
38
The shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten
turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye
fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a
portable scoreboard.
A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause.
Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the
concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs.
The score comes:
84.
There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's
turn.
From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good
shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going
to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID
SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then
his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate
smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline.
There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her
position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama,
shake that thang!" Caroline ignores it, taking her
shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and
professional-looking.
She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once,
deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is
raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and
then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of
applause.
SAME SCENE - LATER
Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally
surprised.
(CONTINUED)
32.
38
CONTINUED:
38
On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second
place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last round
finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are
complimenting her shooting. Dwight's smile is even
bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win.
The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first
place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he
passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks
confidently.
MAN
That second-place trophy ain't
bad, honey.
CAROLINE
(big smile)
Then you won't feel too bad about
carrying it home, will you?
Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away.
Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is
evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he
SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is
an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a
virtually perfect round.
Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but
clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right-
handed, then with both eyes closed.
His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter,
and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his
attitude says.
Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her
TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won.
The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone
else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official
presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a
pedestal, and a huge ham.
In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close
enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances
toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby:
CAROLINE
That was for you, honey.
TOBY
(impressed)
I didn't know you were a member of
the N.R.A.

Thirty-six years behind.

Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver
and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too
innocent: something's up.
They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns
and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them
open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and
start it rolling down the hill.
(CONTINUED)
36.
43
CONTINUED:

The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into
another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE.
The three boys run like the wind out of sight.
44
48
Dwights hustles
the bags into the trunk, tells Toby to
kiss his mother,
and hops into the car, all smiles, all
cheeriness. The
Buick pulls away, leaving Caroline
white-faced and
miserable.
41.
49
50
Toby moves to where the dead beaver lies on its back,
its eyes open, in the red glow of the taillights. Toby
picks the thing up and lugs it back toward Dwight, who
has the trunk open.
51
52
Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop as Norma, Skipper and
Pearl come out to meet them. Dwight is calmer now.
DWIGHT
Skipper, go get that washtub out
back, and Pearl, bring the hose
around and fill it up. Hotshot
and me hit a beaver. We'll salt
him down.
Skipper and Pearl move out on the run. Dwight slits the
beaver from throat to testicles, guts it, then pulls the
skin off.
(CONTINUED)
44.
52
CONTINUED:
52
DWIGHT
I know you think you're better
than me. Caroline told me all
about your rich daddy and your
prep-school brother, but your
fancy days are over: you're a
Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give
you a big injection of Concrete.
That's right -- inoculate you.
Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find
out that in Concrete we have to
be able to do more than sing Fats
Domino songs, we work...
Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars
painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver
into the water. The hairless carcass stands in the
tub, its chin on the edge. Pearl shudders and turns
away.
53
60
Dwight's Buick pulls up and Caroline bursts out the front
door. She runs to the car and hugs Toby.
CAROLINE
Oh, I missed you!
TOBY
Me, too.
CAROLINE
You look good.
How are you?
TOBY
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Dwight comes around the car, kisses Caroline, and the
three head into the house.
CAROLINE
I said to hell with the budget and
bought a roast. I made dumplings --
God, what's wrong with your hands?
TOBY
It's just juice from some
chestnuts -- it'll wear off.
CAROLINE
I hope so.
My, your hair's short.
61
62
Toby and Caroline walk slowly, idly down the rail tracks.
Toby avoids her eyes.
CAROLINE
How is it in Concrete?
TOBY
It's fine.
CAROLINE
School?
TOBY
School's school. My grades are
okay.
CAROLINE
You haven't been in any trouble?
(as he shakes his
head)
Good. How're you and Dwight?
TOBY
He made us all snowcream, like he
said.
CAROLINE
Stop that, honey.
TOBY
What?
CAROLINE
(stops walking)
Well, you've got your eyes out of
focus. Look at me. Now, are
things all right?
(CONTINUED)

TOBY
I'm fine.
CAROLINE
You swear?
You act odd.
TOBY
No, I'm fine.
CAROLINE
Well, good. I'd feel awful if it
hadn't worked out.
A pause.
CAROLINE
I told Dwight I'd marry him. In
two weeks. I don't know what else
to do. I mean, he's been helping
me with the rent since Kathy left.
And you need a father. I think
it's the best thing all the way
around -- what d'you think?
There is a pause as they look at each other.
TOBY
I think it's the best thing.
CAROLINE
I think it's the best thing, too.
Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the
house. Toby continues to walk. Suddenly, he spins
around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll
tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the
front door and up the stairs.
63
65
Everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling,
furniture -- all of it. Only the old Baldwin upright
piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it
suspiciously.
DWIGHT
Sort of stands out, doesn't it?
TOBY
Yeah, you could say that.

They paint the Baldwin white. Dwight hesitates, then
starts to paint the foot pedals.

Dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't
suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and they

SAME SCENE - LATER
65
Very carefully, Dwight and Toby finish painting the
dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS
SCREAMS OUT the last line, "You can do anything, but
stay off of my blue suede shoes!"
They stand up, look around -- Arctic white is every-
where. Dwight likes it. Toby is less sure.
The MONTAGE ENDS.
66
66
Skipper and Norma are carrying Caroline's suitcases into
the house from Dwight's Buick. From inside the house we
hear a WOMAN'S LAUGHTER.
67
70
Toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. Norma has
made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee
when she hears Dwight and Caroline's bedroom DOOR OPEN.
NORMA
Happy Wedding Breakfast!
Caroline's eyes
are red and swollen. Dwight turns ON a
RADIO, sips his
coffee, and chats with Norma. Toby gives
Norma's rear-end
an appreciative glance, then comes up
behind Caroline,
speaking sotto voce:
TOBY
So how's the bride?
(CONTINUED)
62.
70
CONTINUED:

CAROLINE
Don't.
TOBY
The bride doesn't want to chat?
CAROLINE
Stop it.
TOBY
Well, the bride is sure snotty
this morning.
Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing,
but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table.
71
71
Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands
talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and
JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, "Uh-oh," and jerks his
head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should
look.
They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur
Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a
small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch
Arthur's approach:
TOBY
What's his name again?
OSCAR
Arthur Gayle.
JIMMY
What a homo.
TOBY
He sure walks like a girl.
JIMMY
And runs like one and talks like
one and throws like one. Probably
takes a pee like one too -- just
squats right down.
TOBY
He smarted off to me the other
day -- told me I was a bourgeois.
JIMMY
What the frig's a bourgeois?
(CONTINUED)
63.
71
CONTINUED:
71
OSCAR
(to Toby)
Call him a sissy.
TOBY
Why?
OSCAR
Just see what he says.
JIMMY
Yeah, do it.
By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior
smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if
they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then
his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands.
ARTHUR
Oh, my, my -- look at all that
yellow: Didn't your mama teach you
to wash your hands after you pee?
TOBY
Oh, shut up.
ARTHUR
(rolls his eyes;
heavily sarcastic)
Now that's what I like -- an
insult with some originality.
Did you just make that up? Just
now? So clever.
TOBY
Why don't you take a long walk
off a short pier?
ARTHUR
(though he's not
nearly close enough
to smell Toby's
breath)
Excuse me, but has anyone ever told
you your breath would gag a maggot?
Both of Toby's friends laugh.
TOBY
Well, at least I'm not a great
big sissy!
Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes
from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single
expectant look: "Here it comes."

Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching
him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the
back of the head.
The fight is on.
Arthur throws
punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action,
but there are
so many of them. Before Toby can react,
Arthur has hit
him four times, including one wild haymaker
that puts Toby
on his knees.
While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick
him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers
in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he
has lost his mind:
ARTHUR
GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A
BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL
STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL
YOU!
Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild
roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to
Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his
heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded
buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and
begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,
still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes
with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the
two stagger around the street like drunken dancers.
They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with
each other again.
Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two
roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment.
They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting,
flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur,
then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each
breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives
out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him
deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby
throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER
BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.
Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully.
He looks relieved -- at least it's over.
No, it's not.
From behind him he hears three words.
ARTHUR
Take it back.
(CONTINUED)
65.
71
CONTINUED:

71
Toby turns
to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur
clambering
up the hill after him, like some monster
that won't
die. Both boys reach the top and stand
facing one
another.
ARTHUR
Take it back.
Arthur's words are not angry anymore.
Toby's worn out
too...
TOBY
Okay.
ARTHUR
Say it.
TOBY
Okay.
I take it back.
ARTHUR
No, say 'You're not a sissy.'
Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful
but he doesn't care what the hell they think.
TOBY
You're not a sissy.
Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores
them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering
his hated newspapers.
72
75
A steady downpour falls outside the porch. Dwight and
Toby, both stripped to the waist, are boxing. Dwight is
totally serious about this, absolutely sincere.
The sweat streaming off the two, Dwight patiently corrects
Toby's movements, or catches the boy's fist to suggest
better form. Their feet shuffle, squeak on the floor.
DWIGHT
No, no. From the shoulder.
Straight.
(demonstrates)
Like this. This. Otherwise you
leave yourself wide open.
(as Toby tries)
Yeah, better, better... and keep
those feet moving, shuffle,
shuffle, that's right... now try
for my face... good...
76
77
Both Dwight and Toby sweating heavily.
They lean against
a wall, resting.
TOBY
You said you'd show me how to
dry-gulch somebody.
DWIGHT
Okay. Now you can always
kick
somebody in the balls, but I like
this one better: What you
do is
hit 'em in the throat with the
side of your forearm. You
wait
'til -- hah!
Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the
side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges
wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment.
(CONTINUED)
70.
77
CONTINUED:
77
DWIGHT
Now that's dry-gulching. Hit 'em
in the throat, but do it before
they're expecting it. Now you try.
TOBY
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.
DWIGHT
You won't.
TOBY
But I might.
Finally Toby gives a half-hearted "Hah!" and swings the
side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat. Dwight
catches the arm easily.
DWIGHT
Come onnn.
You're not trying.
Again Toby hesitates, again he says "Hah!" and gives a
lukewarm swing at Dwight's throat.
DWIGHT
Well, don't go all shy and delicate
on me -- you're as sissy as little
Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah -- I'll just
call you 'Little Miss Jackie Wolff.'
Ooh, my, yes -- Hello, Jackie.
Toby's eyes flare up, then he lowers his head, biting
his lip, sniffling a bit.
DWIGHT
Aw, Jesus Christ, if you're gonna --
Without warning, Toby lunges at Dwight, screaming "HAH!"
trying for the man's throat. Caught off guard, Dwight
stops the main force of Toby's arm, but is slammed onto
the ground stunned.
TOBY
You just about got dry-gulched, my
man.
Dwight manages a grin, but he is not happy to have been
bested.
78
86
As Toby kneels down to tie his shoelace, a small black
dog runs up to him. Toby pets it. Arthur Gayle, his
black eye healed, stands ten feet away.
ARTHUR
You like my dog?
TOBY
Yeah, he's nice.
(CONTINUED)
80.
86
CONTINUED:
86
ARTHUR
Smart, too -- he can talk.
TOBY
(smiles)
Sure -- I just about believe you.
ARTHUR
Hey, Pepper -- what's on a tree?
As PEPPER BARKS TWICE:
ARTHUR
Bark! Way to go, Pepper -- pretty
smart. Oh, I was wondering,
Pepper -- I wanted to ask you
something: how's the world
treating you?
As PEPPER BARKS ONCE:
ARTHUR
Rough!
Yeah, I know what you
mean.
TOBY
That's dumb. A little funny,
though. How come your dad never
comes to meetings with you?
ARTHUR
I don't have a dad. Never did. I
sprang full-blown from my mother's
forehead. You want to walk home
with me and Pepper?
TOBY
Sure -- compared to a ride home
with Dwight, it'll be like heaven
on a June day.
87
87
Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking
cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly,
desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped
much of the flounciness that he uses in public.
ARTHUR
... Tobias? Your real name is
Tobias? Toby... Tobias... I like
it -- it's very elegant.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
81.
87
CONTINUED:
87
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
My real parents would probably have
given me an elegant name, too.
I say 'real parents' because I
suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody
royal -- or at least very, very
beautiful had me and gave me to
my poor but honest mother.
(a beat)
Tell me more about you.
TOBY
(shrugs)
Every day of my life feels like
a mile on the Bataan Death March.
ARTHUR
(laughs)
I knew I'd like you.
TOBY
Why'd you point at me that day?
ARTHUR
Because you're an alien. You don't
belong in Concrete any more than I
do. This place would like to kill
us because we're different.
TOBY
Oh, come on, Arthur.
That's a
little dramatic.
ARTHUR
Think so? You know what chickens
do if one chicken's born with a
little difference? With a few
black feathers on its head, say?
They peck at the black spot 'til
the chicken's dead -- they can't
stand the fact that it's
different. Now we're both
different. Your difference is
something other than...
(husky-voiced
actress)
... my difference...
(normal tone)
But we're both aliens here.
TOBY
I don't exactly feel like an
alien. I've got friends here.
(CONTINUED)
82.
87
CONTINUED:

87
ARTHUR
Yes, and they're fools. And you
act like a fool when you're around
them. A prediction: if you stay
in Concrete, you'll wind up working
at the A&P; -- either that or you'll
go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.
TOBY
Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse
that everybody says likes to dress
up in his mama's old clothes.
ARTHUR
(laughs)
Maybe, maybe, but no matter how
many times I have to repeat: my
primary goal's to get out of
Concrete.
TOBY
Burma-Shave!
Arthur and Toby laugh.
As they walk on, though, Toby's
face is thoughtful.
88
89
Toby tosses his last newspaper into a yard, folds his
sack, and stands wearily for a few beats.
90
94
Toby sits on the front stoop. Caroline approaches
carrying groceries. She notices Toby's expression.
CAROLINE
What's wrong?
TOBY
Dwight traded my rifle for a dog.
He says the dog's for me, but it's
some stupid dog he wanted.
For a moment Caroline doesn't respond.
Then she nods her
head.
CAROLINE
All right.
Okay, Dwight. You
stay here.
Don't come inside.
Toby nods.
Caroline heads inside, loaded for bear.
95
96
Caroline walks to Toby, sits next to him on the stoop.
CAROLINE
Well, I did it -- and the bride
didn't even raise her voice: he
says he'll get the rifle back as
soon as the guy who sold him the
dog sends the papers.
Toby nods.
Caroline looks up at the evening sky and then
shrugs.
(CONTINUED)
86.
96
CONTINUED:
96
CAROLINE
'Course, having seen that dog, I
wouldn't suggest you hang by your
thumbs 'til those papers come. I
mean, that dog is ugly.
Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes
Toby grin.
CAROLINE
That's nice -- I haven't seen a
real smile out of you in a month.
TOBY
Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I
hate it so much. You don't like
it either -- all you do is stick
your head in a sewing machine
night and day. Let's just leave
and start over someplace else.
CAROLINE
'Start over.' Do you know how
many times I've started over,
sweetheart? I don't want to do
it anymore. This is as far as I
want to go. This place. I have
to make this work somehow. We do.
You're fourteen now -- you have
to help me.
TOBY
But if...
CAROLINE
But me no buts, honey. I told
you: I've hit a wall. And
besides, it's not so bad here,
if you just try to --
TOBY
If you say 'look for the good
stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's
30/30 and shoot myself!
CAROLINE
Seriously, though: give the place
a chance. Give him a chance.
TOBY
Great. Just great. What a life:
I gotta live with Dwight... I got
a sissy for a new best friend...
(MORE)

TOBY (CONT'D)
I got no rifle... I got no gym
shoes...
CAROLINE
Well, look on the bright side...
You got a dog.
In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite
of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight,
Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old
self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm
of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She
returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the
steps, staring into the twilight.
97
104
The car is caught so that two of the wheels are off the
ground, and can get no purchase. Toby starts walking
back toward Concrete.
105
105
Toby and Champ have been walking a long time.
A truck
comes from behind Toby, pulls over.
DRIVER
That your car in the ditch back
there?
(as Toby nods)
How'd you do that, anyway?
TOBY
It's hard to explain.
DRIVER
Get in.
106
106
The man is winching the Buick out of the ditch.
107

Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick
inside and heads for the house.
107A
SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - NOON
107A
The clock shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy's Life,
holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake. Suddenly
Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands into his pockets,
leans against the doorway.
(CONTINUED)
91.
107A
CONTINUED:
107A
DWIGHT
Your mother said you were sick.
Feeling better?
TOBY
Yeah, I am.
DWIGHT
Good, good.
Get some sleep, did
you?
TOBY
Yeah, I slept about four hours.
DWIGHT
Must've needed it.
A pause:
DWIGHT
Oh, by the way, you didn't happen
to hear a funny pinging noise in
the engine, did you?
TOBY
What engine?
DWIGHT
I was downtown with Champ a few
minutes ago, and I met a guy who
recognized him. Said he'd seen
my dog this very morning. Told me
an interesting story of how he and
the dog happened to meet. What
d'you think about that?
TOBY
I don't know what you --
Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed.
He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the
left hand then the right, again and again.
Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face.
Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps
the boy's face again and again.
Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.
He
slams his forearm across Dwight's throat.
Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off
the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight
grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face
down against the mattress.
(CONTINUED)
92.
107A
CONTINUED:
(2)
107A
Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back
of Toby's neck. Toby goes rigid with pain. Dwight
stumbles up gasping for breath.
DWIGHT
Only me. On this whole earth, to
straighten you out. And I will do
it kill or cure. Now get your ass
up -- you're going to school.
108
108
A BELL RINGS as Dwight's BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and
Toby gets out. As he heads toward the doors. Toby then
turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then
Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car
disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.
FADE OUT.
FADE UP TO:
108A
SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON
108A
The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT.
The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted
saplings established in the previous scene are both eight
feet taller, with wide spreading branches.
Students pour out
the door. Among them Toby, taller and
a bit heavier, he
now wears black leather boots, and a
pack of cigarettes
rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt.
His hair is still
pure Elvis.
Toby comes back out the door with four very different
friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of
Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second
boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency
toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy-
lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than
Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes
talks to himself or laughs for no reason.
Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53
CHEVY, and they PEEL OUT.
109
110
Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a halt, and Toby exits,
followed by an empty Hawaiian Punch can which someone
tosses after him. Toby gives a wave, starts toward the
house, and the CAR LAYS RUBBER, while OVER that we hear
Psycho SCREAMING, "AGH-H-H!"
111
118
Toby bangs onto the bus, throws himself into a seat
beside Arthur. He hands a grade card to Toby.
ARTHUR
You didn't pick this up yesterday
-- congratulations, you got
nothing higher than a C.
TOBY
Shut up.
He signs the grade card, saying, "Presto."
ARTHUR
You're gonna get caught some day.
(as Toby laughs a
moronic laugh)
You act more like those morons you
hang around with every day. Aghhh!
I'm psycho! I'm retarded!
(CONTINUED)
99.
118
CONTINUED:
118
It's a good imitation of Psycho, and Toby laughs.
TOBY
He hears you do that, you're
dead. Hey, lemme copy your math
homework.
ARTHUR
No, but I'll show you how to work
the problems.
TOBY
I tell you I'm thirsty, you offer
me a sandwich thank you and fuck
you.
ARTHUR
Oh, Jack.
TOBY
Oh, Jaaack!
ARTHUR
I take it back you don't act like
Psycho, you act like Dwight.
TOBY
(new tone)
I know it. He's winning. I do
act like him. I feel like him
sometimes. I've gotta get out of
this place or I'm a dead one.
ARTHUR
I know, but you've said that for
two years.
TOBY
I mean it. I may go live with my
brother Gregory in Princeton.
ARTHUR
You mean the brother Gregory in
Princeton who never calls you?
That brother Gregory?
TOBY
He wrote me.
ARTHUR
And he asked you to live with him?
(CONTINUED)
100.
118
CONTINUED:
(2)
118
TOBY
No. But I'm going. Or maybe I
could go to a prep school like
Gregory did. Like my dad did.
ARTHUR
What about your grades? And what
would you use for money?
TOBY
I don't know. Dwight owes me
over twelve hundred bucks! If I
hadn't let him keep my paper
route money, I'd be okay.
ARTHUR
If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,
he'd have caught the rabbit.
Suddenly Toby is angry.
He stands up, moves to another
seat.
TOBY
I think Dwight was right about
you I think you fight for the pink
team.
Toby falls into another seat, then, pulls his head back
and bangs it against the window. Then does it again,
harder.
119
119
His mood even fouler, Toby toils at his paper route. He
throws the papers against the houses with all his might.
Suddenly Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a stop next to
Toby. We hear Psycho's "Arghhh!" and Toby climbs into
the car.
120
120
We see the Concrete silo dimly-lit in the distance. We
can read "Welcome To Concrete" on it. Toby is leaning
against a wall in a large derelict Concrete plant staring
at the silo. Behind him is a small campfire where the
other guys are slumped around talking. Toby takes a
long, angry pull on a bottle of whiskey, then turns
around and heads toward them.

ARCH
Nobody in your family ever even
been in a Corvette, let alone
owned one.
CHUCK
You wait and see if I don't get
one. I'm gonna move down to
Seattle, get a job at Bendix and
drive a 'Vette to work every day.
JERRY
My uncle can have any car he
wants. He makes big bucks as an
electrician.
ARCH
Yeah?
How big?
JERRY
Hundred seventy-five a week, take
home.
PSYCHO
Bullshitter!
JERRY
Fuck you, it's true.
CHUCK
Even the supervisors at Bendix
don't make that.
JERRY
So how are you ever gonna make
enough to drive a 'Vette then,
fuck-face?
The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the
group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform
that they are on and listens while leaning on a large
hook.
PSYCHO
I'm gonna drive a T-bird, someday.
CHUCK
An' I'm gonna own a Corvette if I
have to hold up the Bendix payroll
to get it.
JERRY
Fuck you.

Toby regards them with a

TOBY
Losers.
What a bunch of losers.
CHUCK
Who you calling a loser,
fuck-face?
TOBY
All of you.
(to Chuck)
You're gonna drive a Fairlane
just like your daddy does.
(to Psycho)
How you ever going to drive a
Thunderbird when you're a janitor
like the rest of your family?
(to Jerry)
An' you can forget being an
electrician, you can't even pass
tenth grade math.
JERRY
Well fuck you.
Who died an' made
you King Shit?
PSYCHO
Yeah, you're no better than us.
TOBY
I know that, Psycho. That's my
point: Ha, ha, ha. You guys are
my buddies. You guys are my pals.
And my dear old dad's called
Dwight.
(he spreads his
arms wide)
Welcome to Concreeee...
Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The
other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES
off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face.
The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to
laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears.

Graceful buildings, green lawns, a CARILLON CHIMING.
Toby walks toward a large building.

Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for
the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the
other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis
hairdo.

SAME SCENE - LATER
124A
All the boys are taking the test, working hard.
125
127
Toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the
lid back on, and then hesitates. He lifts the lid again
and peers into the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips
of four white envelopes made of heavy, expensive paper.
He pulls them up and, though covered with tomato seeds,
are undamaged.
128
133
Toby mails five letters.
134
135
Toby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with
several letters in her hand.
PEARL
'You got letters from those
schools!'
Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life.
Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks
off holding the letters to his chest.
136
136
Three letters lie crumpled on the ground. Toby sits with
his back against a tree trunk. Slowly Toby opens the
fourth letter. Another refusal. Toby tosses it onto
the ground with the others, leans his head back against
the tree trunk, and closes his eyes.
137
138
A beauty shop with a tired sign... "ARLENE'S GOLDEN COMB
BEAUTY SALON," a beer joint, a pool hall, a woman's
clothing store with headless mannequins.
Toby surveys the scene, with an expression of despair.
Toby catches his reflection in a store window.
He
stares at himself.
TOBY
A Concrete boy.
139
142
Mr. Howard shakes Toby's hand.
MR. HOWARD
You seem like a fine boy, and
I'll give you a good report
tomorrow. But there are lots of
boys applying, and we'll just
have to wait and see whether --
From O.S., we hear Dwight's voice, and Toby goes rigid.

Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy.
Both Mr. Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing

DWIGHT
Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he
knows everything. Thinks he's so
smart, but fella, what you don't
know would fill a book.
(glances at Mr.
Howard's new
Chevrolet; offhand)
General Motors makes shit cars.
Dwight turns and enters the drugstore.
TOBY
(weakly)
That's, uh, that's this guy...
he's a mechanic... did some bad
work on our car...
It's not much of an explanation, but Mr. Howard seems to
buy it. He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car,
drives away. Toby stares after him.

Caroline and Toby slow to a walk after running, laughing,

nobody. I'm free as a bird.
Sayonara nest.
(yells it; really
bawls it out)
Heaven on a June day!
Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and
she begins to regard him oddly.
CAROLINE
(weakly)
Yeah, heaven on a June day...
TOBY
What'd he say about you having a
job in D.C.?
CAROLINE
Oh, Helen found me something in a
real estate office, but...
TOBY
So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am
so damn glad to get out of this
place! I'll be in 'fourth form.'
Doesn't that sound great? And if
you get a two-bedroom place in
D.C., I can come for vacations and
summers. I'm out. I'm out!
Caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette.
TOBY
(notices she's upset)
What? Oh, don't cry -- he's not
worth it.
As sad as she is, Caroline smiles...
TOBY
She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him.
CAROLINE
My you've grown, haven't you.
Then clutches him to her fiercely.
Smiling, the two
walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to
each other.

Caroline and Toby stand next to a bus as the driver
STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to tears.
CAROLINE
Are you sure you'll be all right?
TOBY
(nice)
Get on the bus.
CAROLINE
(stuffing bills into
his pocket)
I borrowed money from everybody I
know -- it's the two hundred you
need for the tuition, and an extra
fifty. Buy yourself a blazer.
Oh, God. I'll miss you. I'll
write you. You sure your hand's
okay?
TOBY
Get on the bus, Mom.
Caroline puts her arms around Toby, kisses his cheek
hard, then whispers something into his ear. When Toby
speaks, his words are full of love:
TOBY
I know that, Mom. I've always
known that.
Caroline gets onto the bus, the DOORS CLOSE, WHOOSH and
the bus pulls away. We see Caroline's face at a window.
As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another
direction. His face is shining, incandescent with
happiness. He breaks into a wide grin.
FADE OUT.
