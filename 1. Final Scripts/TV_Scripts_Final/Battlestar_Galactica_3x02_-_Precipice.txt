  FADE IN:

    JAMMER105105

    A member of Tyrol s old Deck Gang, walks through the 
    NIGHTTIME STREETS of New Caprica, anxiety and tension etched 
  into his features...

                                                                          CUT TO:

106106TYROL 

    Scrabbles through a dark, narrow, rough-hewn TUNNEL, 
    somewhere beneath the city.  He s carrying something LARGE 
  and the tunnel is low, forcing him to crouch over as he 
    gropes his way through the near-darkness.

                                                                          CUT TO:

  LAURA ROSLIN107107

  Sits on the floor of a DETENTION CELL, without shoes, 
    eyeglasses, or jacket and trying to shield her eyes from the 
    relentless LIGHT blazing down on her from above with one hand 
  while the other is wrapped around her torso seeking warmth in 
  the chilly air.  A small MIRROR is on the opposite wall.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    JAMMER108108

  And now we REVEAL that he s ARMED and wearing the distinctive 
    UNIFORM of the New Caprica Police, is walking along with 
    several other members of the NCP.

                                                                          CUT TO:

  INT. TUNNEL/TUNNEL HUB109109

  Tyrol comes out of the Tunnel and into the HUB, where several 
    different hand-dug tunnels converge.  Two other men are 
    already here, their faces barely discernible in the gloom:  
    ANDERS and TIGH.  Tyrol puts down the heavy object he s been 
    carrying:  the WIRELESS SET.      'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 2.



  INT. DETENTION CELL - NIGHT110110

    There s a sharp BANG as the DOOR OPENS, and Laura looks up in 
  time to see GAIUS BALTAR ENTER the cell with a CHAIR.  He 
  sets it up in the room as the door is closed and locked 
    behind him.  

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - RESIDENTIAL TENTS - NIGHT111111

    Jammer and his squad of NCP Officers come around a corner and 
  stop.  Jammer swallows nervously, settles himself and gives a 
    salute to someone o.c.  REVEAL BROTHER CAVIL, who mockingly 
    returns the salute.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                You understand your orders, 
                  Captain?  Everything clear?

                                JAMMER
                  Yes, sir.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Good.  
                        (beat)
                  Don t worry.  We have your back.

    REVEAL a PLATOON OF CENTURIONS standing to one side.  Jammer 
  looks at the mechanized soldiers and nods grimly.

  Tyrol working on the wireless while Anders looks on. Tigh 
    lights a cigarette nearby.

                                TYROL
                You hear the Cylons cut food 
                  rations, Colonel?

  Tigh says nothing, keeps smoking.  Anders answers for him.

                                ANDERS
                We heard.  How long until the next 
                  Raptor transmission?

                the marketplace -- saying it s a

    Anders gives Tigh a reproachful look.  Tigh shrugs it off.

                                TIGH
                  We ll shift targets.

                                TYROL
                        (shocked)
                You were going to hit the 
                  marketplace?  The market?  It s 
                  full of civilians -- this is 
                  getting crazy.  Whose side we are 
                we on?

  Tigh barely looks up, but the quiet venom in his voice is 
    nearly palpable and his words send a chill down Tyrol s back.

                                TIGH
                  Which side are we on?  We re on the 
                  side of the demons, Chief.  We re 
                  evil men in the gardens of 
                  paradise... sent by the forces of 
                  death to spread destruction and 
                  devastation wherever we go.
                        (beat)
                I m surprised you didn t know that.

  Tyrol just looks at Tigh, not sure he even knows Tigh 
    anymore.  Anders isn t entirely comfortable here either, but 
  he keeps his own counsel.  The wireless BEEPS and Tyrol 
    checks it.  Tigh pulls a sheet of paper from his pocket, 
    smooths it out.

                                TYROL
                      (off wireless)
                  Contact.  They re ready for our 
                  sitrep, Colonel.

                                TIGH 
                        (hands him the paper)
                  Send it twice, just to make sure.

  Tyrol reads the message and starts TAPPING in the response, 
  using a form of CODE.

    Jammer and his squad of NCP Officers set up a perimeter 
    around a group of residential TENTS in the city.      'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 4.



  INT. DETENTION CELL - NIGHT114114

  Laura watches Baltar dully as he sits in the chair and 
    regards her with sympathy.  

                                BALTAR
                  I heard you were on the list and I 
                  wanted to see with my own eyes that 
                you had not been harmed.  Here -- 

    Baltar pulls her GLASSES from his pocket and hands them to 
  her as he tries to connect with her.

                                BALTAR (cont d)
                  I can help you, Laura.  I can 
                  protect you.  But you have to 
                  understand that things have changed 
                  now.  The insurgency has crossed a 
                  redline.  Suicide bombing -- it s 
                  abhorrent to everything we believe 
                in.  You and I -- we have to 
                  condemn these tactics.  They cannot 
                be legitimized in any way and the 
                  insurgency must be stopped from 
                  employing them ever again.

                                LAURA
                  This is such good news, Mr. 
                  President, I can t tell you.

                  There is something that scares the 
                  Cylons after all.  

                                BALTAR
                  Using men and women as living bombs 
                  should scare all of us.

                                LAURA
                  Desperate people take desperate 
                  measures.

                                BALTAR
                        (heated)
                  Look me in the eye and tell me you 
                  support sending young men and women 
                  into crowds with explosives tied to 
                  around their chests, Laura!  Tell 
                me you approve!

  She doesn t and Laura can t really bring herself to say 
    otherwise.  She opts to deflect the conversation to another 
  topic rather than engage it directly.

                                LAURA 
                  I don t control the insurgents.

                  I know you re as shocked and 
                  appalled as I am by these bombings.  
                My God, Laura -- they killed almost 
                  thirty-three men and women whose 
                  only crime was to put on a police 
                  uniform and try to bring order out 
                of this chaos.

                  I don t think you understand the 
                  very real peril that this city is 
                in right now.
                        (grim)
                You see, the Cylon is a machine.  
                For all the layered psychology and 
                  emotional complexity built into the 
                  programing, they re still only 
                  machines at heart...

                we hope.  And their hearts only

  That stings Caprica Six -- is this what he really thinks?

                  Pity has been in short supply on

  He abruptly gets up and KNOCKS on the door.

                  What I expect is for you to 
                  consider the stakes of the 
                  situation... and obey the dictates 
                of your conscience.  Which is 
                  exactly what I have always done.

                                LAURA
                Of that... I have no doubt.

  He holds her eyes for a moment, hearing the cut, but choosing

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY122122

  Kara is sitting on the couch, watching dully as Leoben sits 
    cross-legged on the floor and watches Kacey play with some 
  TOYS.  He s not exactly the doting father, more like a cleric 
    sizing up a novitiate.

                                LEOBEN
                  After your egg was fertilized, we 
                  transferred it to a human woman, 
                who carried it to term.  She was 
                  pretty -- funny -- great smile.  
                You would ve liked her.  She died 
                  during delivery, but Kacey s heart 
                  never faltered.  She probably gets 
                  that will to live from you.
                        (beat)
                  I ve seen her path.  It will be 
                  difficult, but rewarding for her.  
                  She ll know the mind of God in her 
                  lifetime... and she ll see the patterns 
                  that others do not.  She probably gets 
                  that spiritual clarity from me.

    Leoben looks up at Kara, who gives no sign that she s heard a 
  word he s said.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)
                  She ll be hungry soon.  There s 
                  food on the table.
                      (no response)
                You wouldn t let your child starve, 
                  would you?

                                KARA
                  It s not my child.  I don t even 
                  think it s human.

                                LEOBEN
                  Half-human.  And you know she s 
                  yours.  You just don t want to 
                  admit it.

    Leoben gets up and heads for the door.

                                KARA
                  Where the frak are you going?
                      (re: Kacey)
                  Take this with you.  Hey -- don t 
                  leave me here with this --



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 11.

  But Leoben is out the door and gone.  Kacey looks up at Kara, 
  but Kara isn t falling for this.

                                KARA (cont d)
                  I don t know who or what you are, 
                but I do know this -- I m not your 
                  mother.   

  Kara gets up and walks away, leaving Kacey alone.

  INT. GALACTICA - ADAMA S QUARTERS124124

    ADAMA, LEE, DUALLA, KAT and HELO are all reading copies of 
    Tyrol s message from New Caprica, along with several other 
    OFFICERS, who are also in attendance.

                                HELO
                  Their numbers are a little thin.  
                  Says here... 
                        (finds it in message)
                   Tigh commands 1,150 armed 
                  effectives.   That s a lot less 
                  than he should have if you count 
                all former Fleet officers and 
                  enlisted available down there.

                                DUALLA
                  Could be taking heavy losses.  They 
                  mention a  Cylon crackdown. 

                                KAT
                We should ask for a breakdown of 
                  available pilots in the insurgent 
                  group -- somebody s gotta fly those 
                  ships off the ground if we re gonna 
                  pull this off.

                                ADAMA
                  Those ships aren t going anywhere 
                  yet.  
                      (re: message)
                   Cylons have removed launch keys 
                  from grounded Colonial ships.  
                  Location unknown. 

                                KAT
                Can we manufacture new launch keys?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 12.

                                LEE
                  Forget it.  The specs on launch 
                  keys are incredibly sophisticated.  
                  We d need weeks just to do the R 
                and D.  

                                ADAMA
                  Best option is for Saul and his 
                  people on the ground to find the 
                  original launch keys.

                                DUALLA
                  Assuming they weren t destroyed.

                                KAT
                No way -- Cylons would want to keep 
                  them safe just in case they needed 
                to use one of those ships someday.  

                                HELO
                  She s right.  Keys gotta still be 
                  there somewhere.  Probably locked 
                up tight, though.

                                KAT
                We could make a weapons  drop to 
                the insurgents -- they know the lay 
                of the land and they ve been 
                  hitting the Cylons in the teeth for 
                  months.  Give them the tools to get 
                the keys themselves.

                                LEE 
                No way.  The only thing you ve got 
                  going for you so far is that 
                  they ve reduced their defense 
                  perimeter to just five baseships.  
                You put heavy weaponry down there, 
                the Cylons are gonna know for sure 
                  you re in contact with the 
                  population.  They ll call in ten 
                  more baseships and then your whole 
                  plan is toast.

  Kat turns a hostile eye on Lee.

                                KAT
                  Funny.  I thought it was our plan, 
                  sir.

  The chill in the air is palpable.

    Everyone looks to Adama, who calmly keeps looking over the 
    papers on his desk as if he didn t hear that.

                  Moving on...

  He turns over the papers on the desk, but clearly things are 
  far from settled between him and Lee.

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - LOCATION TBD - DAY125125

  Tyrol is meeting with GAETA somewhere in the city.

                                TYROL
                  Why d they pick her up?  She hasn t

                  help them day after day?  How do 
                you look yourself in the mirror...?

  Tyrol suddenly realizes just how pointless this conversation 
  has become.  He turns to leave.

    Jammer, in civvies, walking down the road, his hands deep in

  He watches DUCK ascend the stage.  Everything is perfect...

  leg falls away, a bloody STUMP at the end.  He recoils, 
    manages to turn over -- and discovers that he s in a PILE of 
  dead bodies, all crumpled on top on him like dolls.  Only the 
    mounting horror of the moment drives him to claw his way out

    Jammer looks up to see Tyrol standing next to him, a 
    concerned look on his face.  It s apparent that Tyrol has no

                  with these suicide bombings... but 
                at first, they probably thought 
                  they were doing a good thing, you

                  streets, let us police our own --

                                JAMMER
                  Yeah.  

  Tyrol heads off, leaving Jammer to deal with his guilt and his 
  fear all alone.  He looks around the city, suddenly feeling 
    vulnerable, and then heads away, keeping his head down.

    Something in Lee snaps.  He turns to Hoshi.

    A short time later, Lee is confronting Adama in his quarters.

                                LEE
                You can t do this.

                the men and women under your 
                  command, that s not the issue --- 
                the issue is that you re gambling

                No, you re not.  That s what you re 
                not seeing.  The human race?  Right 
                  now?  They re the two thousand

                  ships out there who escaped when 
                the Cylons came.  They re the safe 
                  bet.  We have to guard their 
                  survival now... just like we did 
                  after the attack on the Colonies. 

  Adama is taken off-stride, wasn t expecting this particular 
  line of attack.  He s groping, tries to change the subject.

                  They were deliberately programmed

                  becoming... self-aware and suddenly 
                  resisting orders.  They didn t want

  Lee is shocked.  Didn t expect that reply, doesn t quite know

    Suddenly, without warning, Laura s hand shoots out and SLAPS 
  him across the face, knocking the cigarette out of his mouth.  
    Anders is startled -- even Laura is startled -- but Tigh 
    barely reacts.  He casually picks up his smoke.

                  Sorry.  There s no excuse for that.

  But Tigh isn t fazed in the least.  There s a difference in 
  Tigh since his experience in detention:  a clear-eyed vision 
  of what he s doing and why, without a hint of remorse or an 
  idea of giving quarter on any front.  He s totally committed

                We picked up Chief Tyrol s wife in 
                the last raid.  Cally.  She s in 
                  detention.  I think she s on a 
                  list.

    Boomer s surprised, not sure how to react...

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT139139

  Kacey is SCREAMING her head off.  Kara is pacing in the 
    apartment, trying to ignore the shrieking child sitting on 
  the couch.

  But there s nothing like a crying child to pierce the 
    toughest of exteriors and drive you insane.  Kara finally 
  just walks out of the room --

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS140140

  Kara ENTERS, and goes to the sink, turns on the faucet and 
    splashes water on her face, trying to drown out the SCREAMING 
  from the other room.  She looks up into the mirror.

    Suddenly -- there s a muffled THUD and the crying STOPS.  She 
    wonders about that for a moment, looks up at her reflection 
    again.

    Despite her better instincts, Kara finds herself walking 
    toward the door...

  INT. LEOBEN S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS141141

  ... and going back into the living room.  She looks around -- 
  no sign of the child.  Maybe it is really gone.  Then she 
  steps around the couch --

  KACEY

  Is lying unconscious on the floor at the foot of the concrete 
    steps.  A small POOL of BLOOD is spreading from behind 
    Kacey s head.  

                                KARA
                  Kacey...?

                                                                        FADE OUT.

  FADE IN:

  INT. NEW CAPRICA - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY142142

  Kara is sitting at the side of the bed where the unconscious 
  form of Kacey lies.  The child s head is wrapped in bandages, 
  an IV hooked up to a stand.  Kara watches Kacey silently, 
    staring down at the wounded child with obvious concern.  

  The door OPENS and Leoben ENTERS, carrying two cups of 
    coffee.  He silently hands one to Kara, who takes it without 
    a thought.  Leoben sits down next to her and watches Kacey 
  with Kara Thrace... two parents keeping silent vigil...

  INT. DETENTION CELL - DAY143143

  CALLY is sitting barefoot in the same kind of barren, 
    brightly lit cell that Laura occupied not so very long ago.  
  The door OPENS and she looks up to see BOOMER.  It s a 
    charged moment for them both -- feelings of anger, jealousy, 
    resentment, fear, and familiarity wash over them both.

                                BOOMER
                Hi, Cally.  It s me -- Boomer.

    Boomer was prepared for a reaction like that, but it stings 
    nonetheless.  She nods, moves toward the door.

                                BOOMER
                If I can help you... I will.  I 
                  promise.

  Cally shakes her head in disgust, looks away.  Boomer EXITS.

  A B&W (MOS) image, from a high-angle, looking down on...

  EXT. A SECURITY CHECKPOINT

    A SECURITY CHECKPOINT against a large compound.  TWO Masked 
  NCP Guards are checking ID s on a few humans before they pass 
    through the checkpoint and go into the compound.  A WOMAN 
    casually walks up to the checkpoint, waves at the Guards and 
  tries to pass through.  Guard #1 waves her off, tries to stop 
  her.  Suddenly the WOMAN SHOOTS Guard #1 and bolts past the 
    checkpoint and into the compound just beyond as Guard #2 
    reacts a second too late and tries to shoot at her.  Then -- 
  AN EXPLOSION from within the compound ERUPTS and BLOTS OUT 
  the image, which goes to STATIC.  The tape REWINDS...

  INT. COLONIAL ONE - MAIN CABIN - DAY145145

    A full-scale meeting is underway.  Baltar, TWO D ANNAS, TWO 
    DORALS, ONE SIMON, TWO CAVILS and THREE SIXES (including 
    Caprica Six) all watching the security tape on a monitor.  
  Cavil #1 shuts off the monitor.

                  Twenty-three Cylons critically

                The power substation was crippled.  
                  Almost half the city is without 
                  power and our best estimates put 
                the repairs at two weeks. 

    A D Anna turns a jaundiced eye on Caprica Six and Boomer.

                                D ANNA #1
                  Still think we re being too hard on 
                the human population?

    Caprica Six and Boomer shift uncomfortably in their seats.

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                  We ve got a very serious, very 
                    straight-forward problem.  We have 
                to increase control or we will lose 
                  control.  That is a fact.  So... we 
                  think it s time to take stronger 
                  measures.

                                D ANNA #2
                We agree.

                                SIMON

                We agree as well.

    Caprica Six looks to the other two Sixes in the room.  She 
  drops her eyes.

  She takes a document out of a file, puts it on the table in

  snake before him.

                In other words, they re still

  It all happens in a split second:  Caprica Six MOVES TOWARD 
  Doral #2 -- who quickly shifts aim and SHOOTS HER DEAD, then 
  puts the muzzle back to Baltar s head.  Baltar can see her 
  dead body lying on the deck.

  Doral #2 pushes Baltar s head forward slightly with the gun, 
    forcing him to look down at the warrant.  Baltar is on the 
  verge of a complete breakdown when --

    A WOMAN S HAND

  INT. COLONIAL ONE - MAIN CABIN - WIDER145A145A

  The Cylons are now gone and Baltar is alone in the room with 
  only NUMBER SIX standing there in her red dress.  There s a 
    slightly surreal quality to the light in this suspended 
    moment in time.

  She gets up and finishes getting dressed.  The moment she 
  turns away from him, we see the look on her face change to 
    bitter self-contempt.  Cavil reaches for his pants.

                  Don t bother to deny it, Ellen.  We

                  Well -- that too, in all honesty.  
                But having the Colonel out and 
                  active in the resistance presents

    Nothing unusual about the tent, except that there s a MAN 
    casually sitting just outside the flap, seeming to whittle a 
  piece of wood, but actually keeping a close eye out as people 
  move back and forth through the area.

    INT./EXT. TIGH S TENT - NIGHT150150

  Tyrol and Anders are going over a hand-transcribed message 
  with Tigh.

                                TYROL
                  Tomorrow, Galactica s sending a 
                  Raptor, a few Marines and a ground 
                  liaison officer to brief us on the 
                  rescue plan and coordinate our evac 
                  plans with them.

                                TIGH
                  I ll be damned... it s really 
                  happening.  Who s the liaison 
                  officer?

                                TIGH
                  I hope that s your idea of a joke.

                                TYROL
                  Nope.  The Admiral s given her a 
                  uniform and a billet.  She s a 
                  serving officer now -- which is 
                  more than you can say about us, 
                  technically.

  Tigh shakes his head for a moment.

                                TIGH
                Old Man s lost his mind.  All 
                  right.  Where s the rendezvous?

                                TYROL 
                  They left it up to us.

  He takes out a folded MAP of the surrounding area from his 
    pocket and starts to go over the markings with Tigh.

                                ANDERS (cont d)
                If they Jump into Breeder s Canyon 
                out here in the southern range, 
                  they probably won t get picked up --

    Suddenly there s a BANG-BANG from outside.  Tigh moves to 
  peer through the flap --  sees Ellen is standing outside, 
    waiting patiently by the Man guarding the entrance.  Tigh 
  picks up a CUP and BANGS once on the tent pole and Ellen is 
    cleared to ENTER.

  She gives Tyrol and Anders a quick smile.

                                ELLEN

                  they won t get picked up on Cylon 
                  dradis.  

  Ellen busies herself in the tent, but she s also nervously 
    listening to every word and surreptitiously watching the map 
    discussion.

  That registers on Ellen s face... she doesn t want to do 
  this, but Cavil s words echo in her ears.  She takes a deep 
    breath...

  She takes the message and the map, turns her back to them and 
  then leans down to OPEN the TRAP on the small STOVE in the 
  tent.  Out of their sight, she tosses in the message, but 
    POCKETS the MAP inside her clothes.

                                BALTAR
                  Don t take that tone with me --

                                GAETA
                  There are over two hundred names on 
                  this list!  Have you looked at the 
                  names?  LOOK AT THE NAMES, GAIUS!

                                BALTAR
                  I VE SEEN THEM, ALL RIGHT?
                        (beat)
                  I ve seen them.  And... there was 
                  nothing I could do.

  Gaeta looks wildly at Baltar for a moment, completely freaked 
  out and yet unable to figure out what to do.  He turns and 
  bolts from the cabin...

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - ROAD - DAY152152

  NCP OFFICERS are moving through the streets...

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - GARBAGE DUMP - DAY  (PREV SC 156)152A152A

  Gaeta is surreptitiously planting a copy of the death list 
  and a note in a hidden place among the garbage.  He walks 
  away quickly, heading for...

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - HOSPITAL TENT - DAY  (PREV SC 157)152B152B

  Gaeta is walking fast, but trying not to draw attention as he 
    rounds a corner and stops.  JAKE the dog is still there, but 
    before he can reach him, Gaeta sees the TRUCKS and NCP 
    officers moving through the streets, rounding people up -- 
  he s too late.

  INT. TRUCK - MOVING - DAY158158

  Laura is in the back of a TRUCK with about a DOZEN other 
  HUMAN detainees.  Everyone is scared.  No one is talking.  
  The truck bounces to a STOP, the back FLAP OPENS and TOM 
  ZAREK is hustled inside by masked NCP officers.  The FLAP 
    CLOSES and the truck starts MOVING AGAIN.

                                LAURA
                  Hello, Mr. Vice-President.  Need a 
                  lift?

                                ZAREK
                  Guess so.

  Zarek finds a spot to sit in the cramped area.

                                LAURA
                  Haven t seen much of you lately.  
                  Must be very busy these days.

                                ZAREK
                Not much to do in detention.

                                LAURA
                How long have you been held?

                  Four months.  I think.  They play 
                  with time in there.  I told Baltar I 
                  wouldn t have any part of 
                  collaborating with the Cylons and... 
                  well, he got a little pissed.

                                LAURA
                  Well, guess what?  He s a little 
                  pissed at me too.

  Laura smiles and puts out her hand.  Tom grins after a beat 
  and shakes her hand.  Then the gravity of their situation 
  sinks in once more.

                                ZAREK
                At least I ll die with someone I 
                  respect.  I guess that s something.

  EXT. DETENTION BUILDING - DAY160160

    D Anna is confronting Boomer as a long LINE OF DETAINEES are 
    marched out of the building in the b.g. and loaded into the 
  backs of TRUCKS parked just inside the blast wall.

                                BOOMER
                  Killing Tyrol s wife will only embitter 
                him against us.  He s the head of the 
                  labor union -- an organized faction 
                  that could cause us real trouble if 
                  they took to the streets.

                                D ANNA
                  Boomer, let s be honest with one 
                  another.  This isn t about Cally.  
                In your view, there s no reason to 
                  kill any of them, right? 

                                BOOMER
                  Right.

                                D ANNA
                  We ve made a decision, Boomer.  All 
                of us.

                                D ANNA (cont'd)
                  Just like when we listened to you 
                and Caprica Six and came here to 
                  start what we all hoped would be a 
                new chapter in human/Cylon 
                  relations.  What s the human saying 
                  about wishes and horses...?

                                BOOMER
                  This has nothing to do with whether 
                or not we execute Cally.

                                D ANNA
                No one enjoys the thought of mortal 
                  death, Boomer.  But she did try to 
                  murder you.  Maybe this is God s 
                  justice...

    D Anna walks away just as the doors SLAM shut on the TRUCKS 
  and they MOVE OUT.  Boomer looks up just in time to see Cally 
    herded into a TRUCK along with the other detainees.

  EXT. NEW CAPRICA - FOREST - DAY161161

    Anders and his men are hidden in the trees, awaiting the 
    rendezvous.  Suddenly they hear:

                                SHARON S VOICE
                Go Panthers!

    Anders grins, it s the right code phrase and he gives the 
    counter-sign.

    Anders and his men break cover and walk out into the open -- 
  at the same time, Sharon walks out alone toward them.

                                SHARON
                  Hey, Sam.  Been a while.

  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY162162

  Kara and Leoben are still keeping vigil over Kacey.  Kara is 
    praying as Leoben looks on.

                                KARA
                ... oh, Lords... please don t take 
                her life... it was my mistake... 
                  don t punish her for it...

    Leoben puts a hand on her arm, and without realizing it, she 
  lets him.

                                LEOBEN
                It was an accident, Kara.  Nothing 
                  more.

    Suddenly, Kacey stirs... coughs... and then looks around and 
  cries as she WAKES UP.  

                                KARA
                  Kacey!  Oh my gods!  Kacey!  We re 
                  right here, honey.  We re right

  As Kara holds the child and Leoben looks happy at last -- and 
    they re still holding hands...

    INT./EXT. TRUCK - PLAIN - DAY163163

  The truck with Laura and Zarek has stopped on a desolate 
    plain, far from prying eyes.  Jammer comes up to Brother 
    Cavil.  Other NCP Officers wait in the b.g.

    Everyone is instantly on guard and scanning the surrounding

  and Anders dive for cover --

  EXT. TRUCK - PLAIN - DAY165165

                  You.  Over here.

  Cally doesn t resist as Jammer pulls her over to the opposite 
  side of the truck, out of sight from the rest of them.

  Laura and Zarek are standing with the rest of the group of 
  human prisoners, getting a little fresh air and stretching 
    aching bodies.  The NCP Officers and the Centurions watch 
  from a short distance away.

                                ZAREK
                  Tell me something, Laura.  Last

    There s a brief moment where they grin at each other... and 
  then they hear a MECHANICAL SOUND and turn to see --

  THE CENTURIONS

  Are standing in a line.  It s a firing squad.  They turn 
  their hands into WEAPONS and point them right at the human 
    prisoners --

  LAURA & ZAREK

  React in shock.  

  CALLY
