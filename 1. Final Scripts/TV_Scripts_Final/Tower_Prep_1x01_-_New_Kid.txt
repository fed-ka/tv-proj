    EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOLYARD - DAY

    Close on IAN TRAYNOR, fifteen, athletic.  He dodges and ducks 
    with ease as a bigger boy, DEX, tries to hit him.  

    Other kids crowd around to watch the fight, including ANDREW, 
    a bespectacled kid nursing a bloody lip given to him by the 
    bully. 

                                DEX
                  Who asked you to jump in, Traynor?  
                  It s not your fight!

  Ian slaps away Dex s blows.

                                IAN
                  It is when you pick on my friends. 

  Dex throws another punch that Ian eludes.

                                IAN
                  Last warning, Dex.  Only one 
                  getting hurt here is you.  

    This infuriates Dex who charges Ian again.  

                                DEX
                  Stand still!

  Ian sidesteps, grabs Dex s arm and forces it up behind his 
    back.  Dex is restrained and not in serious pain, as long as 
  he doesn t struggle.  Like any bully, he cries out in fear at 
    suddenly finding himself helpless.  Some of the kids watching 
    look uncomfortable.

                                DEX
                        (screams in fear)
                  Let go!  Let go!                                                                                  2.



                                IAN
                  Sure.  As soon as you apologize to 
                  Andrew for knocking him down and 
                  calling him those nasty names.

                                DEX
                        (Blurts out)
                  I m sorry!  I m sorry!

    Even Andrew, the kid who was bullied, starts to show concern.

                                ANDREW
                  It s okay, Ian.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  Traynor!

  The SCHOOL PRINCIPAL hurries in, separating the two boys.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  Get your hands off him!

                                IAN
                  I didn t start it.  Dex was 
                  hitting...

                                PRINCIPAL
                  No.  That s it.  You re done.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    IAN S HOUSE - NIGHT 

    A nice middle class suburban home.  

                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  Suspension.  Wonderful.  How many 
                  times have we warned you, Ian?  How 
                  many?


    INT. IAN S HOUSE - CONTINUING

    Conflict around the family dinner table.  Ian is locked in an 
    argument with his parents, father MICHAEL and mother LYDIA, 
    both in their late thirties.

                                IAN
                  Dad, Dex is the worst bully in 
                  school.  Everyone knows it.                                                                                   3.



                                LYDIA
                  That doesn t mean you and that 
                  temper of yours have to charge in 
                    swinging...again.

                                IAN
                  So I m supposed to watch him push 
                  around other kids and do nothing.  

    Michael tries to reason with his son.  One gets the idea 
    they ve had arguments like this before - a lot.

                                MICHAEL
                  You tell a teacher, or you tell us.  
                  You don t unload on a boy who can t 
                  defend himself.

                                IAN 
                  Dex is tough enough.

                                MICHAEL
                  Not against you.  Remember Johnny 
                  Alcott? 

                                IAN
                  I didn t mean to break his arm.  It 
                  was a tournament.

  Ian is stung as an old wound is reopened.  Lydia cautions 
    Michael.

                                LYDIA
                  That wasn t Ian s fault, Michael.

                                MICHAEL
                  No, it was ours for allowing him to 
                  take karate.  

                                IAN
                  I quit competition and paid 
                  Johnny s hospital bill out of my 
                  college fund.  What more could I 
                  do??


                                MICHAEL
                  You could think before lashing out.  
                  You know the saying,  discretion is 
                  the better part of valor. 

                                IAN
                  Meaning it s okay to turn tail and 
                  run.                                                                                  4.



                                MICHAEL
                  Meaning there s almost always 
                  another option to fighting. 

                                IAN
                  Really?   Cause it seems that s all 
                  we do around here.

  Ian bolts from the table and storms out of the kitchen.


    INT. IAN S ROOM 

    Basic teen boy s room, sport hero and video game posters on 
  the walls.  Ian sits at his desk and plays an on-line role-
    playing fight game like World of Warcraft called HORDE 
    RAIDERS.  He deftly dispatches one attacker after another.  
    It s as if Ian can sense each movement of the character 
    before they make it.  Ian hears voices of other players over 
  his headset.  We see the names of several players on the 
    screen:  Orcslayer (Ian s name) Shadow Knight, Dawn Magus and 
    Echo119

                                HEADSET VOICE #1
                        (male, young)
                  Hey, Slayer.  Leave some for the 
                  rest of us.

                                IAN
                        (into headset)
                  Keep up, Shadow Knight.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                        (female, young)
                  I have a freezing spell that 
                  will...

                                IAN
                  Miles ahead of you, Magus.

    A flick of his wrist and Ian has dispatched the remaining 
    ogres on the screen.

                                HEADSET  VOICE #3
                  You re very skilled, Slayer.

                                IAN
                  Thanks...
                        (checks screen name)
                  Echo119.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                  Yeah.  He never lets us play.                                                                                  5.



                                IAN
                  Maybe tomorrow, Magus.

                                HEADSET VOICE #2
                  I ll believe it when I see it.  
                  C mon, Shadow Knight.  Let s count 
                  our treasure.

                                IAN
                  Haven t seen you in the game 
                  before, Echo.  

                                ECHO 
                  No one sees an echo, Ian.

                                IAN
                  How do you know my name?  Do you go 
                  to my school?

                                ECHO
                        (evading the question)
                  You re a terrific player.  I m 
                  looking forward to our next 
                  encounter.   

                                IAN
                  Whenever.  I m here every night.

                                ECHO 
                  Are you sad about that?

                                IAN
                  Being stuck in jerkwater suburbia?  
                  My only physical outlet on-line 
                  fantasy games?  What gave you that 
                  idea?

                                ECHO 
                  Things change.

                                IAN
                  Not soon enough for me.

    Echo s name vanishes from Ian s screen.

  Ian starts to play the game again.  He cranks the volume.  
    From off-screen comes the voice of his dad:

                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  You want to turn that down?  

                                IAN
                  Not really.                                                                                  6.



                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Ian...headphones, please?

  Ian plugs in his headset and resumes playing.  Beneath the 
    sounds of battle, a strange electronic BUZZING SOUND is 
    building.  Ian tries to turn down the volume but the buzzing 
    sound gets louder.  It seems to have a calming effect on Ian.  
  His eyelids flutter and he falls asleep.


    INT. DORM ROOM - DAY - CLOSE ON IAN

    Asleep in a strange bed.  In the distance a BELL RINGS.  

                                DON (OFF)
                  Hey.  First bell.

  Ian stirs, waking up.

                                ZACK (OFF)
                  Better motivate.  

    Ian s eyes open.


    IAN S POV - ROOMMATES

    Looking down at Ian are three big guys his age or a couple 
    years older.  They are DON, RAY and ZACK.  They are well-
    dressed in identical school uniforms -- ties, jackets, big 
    toothy smiles.  Unnerving.

                                ZACK 
                  You ll miss breakfast.

                                DON
                  And that would suck.

                                RAY
                  Dining hall s closed until lunch.


  IAN 

    Bolts from the bed, shocked at the sight of these strangers.

                                IAN
                  How d you get in my room?

  The guys react with good-natured disbelief.  Who is this 
    screwy kid?                                                                                  7.



                                RAY
                  Your room?  Try our room, noob.

  Ian looks around and for the first time it sinks in that he 
  is not in his own home.  He leaps to the window and looks 
    out.


    IAN S POV - SCHOOL GROUNDS

  We see the well-manicured grounds and stately dormitories of 
    what appears to be an exclusive private school.  

  Ian turns away from the window, his mind spinning.  

                                IAN
                  Where am I?

                                END PROLOGUE                                                                                  8.

    INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

  Ian is still desperately looking for answers about his new 
    surroundings.  Zack, Don and Ray react in a very matter of 
    fact way to Ian s questions.  They give him lots of 
    information, but nothing he can really understand.

                                IAN
                  This place...

                                ZACK 
                  I know.  Tower Prep School.  
                  Awesome, huh? 

                                RAY
                  Many apply.  Only the lucky few 
                  make it.

                                DON
                  Tower s got a great academic 
                  program.  Challenging, intense.  

    Zack is fiddling with a strange-looking piece of equipment, 
    something like a lacrosse stick. 

                                ZACK
                  Our Buffer team s undefeated.  You 
                  play? 

                                IAN
                  What?  No...who are you?

                                DON
                  I m Don.  That s Ray and the big 
                  guy is Zack.  First bell rang.  You 
                  don t have much time, Ian.

                                IAN
                  How do you know my name?

  Ray points to a closet door.  Ian s name is on it.

                                RAY
                  Nice to have a new roommate.                                                                                    9.



                                RAY
                  We ve been a man short since 
                  Phillips did the forest run.  Or 
                  tried to.

  Ian looks where Ray is pointing.  He sees one of four closets 
  set into the dorm room wall, one of which bears his name.  To 
  say Ian is having a hard time taking this in is an 
    understatement.

                                IAN
                  But my mom and dad never...

  Ian turns back to question his roommates.

                                IAN
                  Who brought me here?

  The three guys share mystified shrugs.

                                DON
                  Don t know.  We came back from 
                  study hall last night and there you 
                  were, fast asleep.

                                ZACK
                  About that -- you might want to ask 
                  Doctor to fit you for a snore 
                  guard.  Kinda loud.

  Ian is reeling, he can t fathom any of this.  

                                IAN
                  Doesn t make sense. 

                                DON
                  Nothing does, until you ve been to 
                  orientation.  

                                IAN
                  What s that?

  Don hands Ian some notes jotted down on a slip of paper.

                                DON
                  Figured you d be lost the first 
                  day.  Just follow this.  

                                IAN
                  Okay, but what...

    Another BELL SOUNDS.                                                                                  10.



                                ZACK
                  Last bell.  Going to be late.

                                IAN
                  Late for what?  

    Don, Ray and Zack shoulder their backpacks and head out the 
    door.

                                DON
                  See you at Orientation.  We ll save 
                  you a place.

  The three boys exit, leaving the confused Ian alone in the 
    room.  

  Ian steps to his closet, opens it.  Inside are several 
    uniforms identical to his roommates.  Ian pushes them aside 
  and finds a few of his things on a shelf, including his iPod 
  and cell phone.  He quickly dials his home number.  He hears 
  the line pick up.

                                IAN
                  Mom?!  It s Ian!  Hello?

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  I m sorry, Ian.  You are out of 
                  carrier range.  

  Ian recognizes the voice from the night before.

                                IAN
                  Wait...Echo?

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  Have a nice day.

  The voice clicks off.  Ian pushes more buttons, tries to get 
    a dial tone.

                                IAN
                  Hello?  Hello!

  But the phone is dead.  Ian tosses the phone back in the 
    closet.  He takes a shirt and pants from the hangers and 
    quickly starts to throw them on.


    EXT. DORMITORY - DAY - CONTINUING 

    Ian, hastily dressed in a shirt and pants, exits the dorm 
    room.                                                                                    11.


  He walks slowly around the school grounds, very much the 
    outsider.  Through Ian s eyes we get the first glimpses of 
    this strange place.

  It is indeed a private school and a very unique one.  
    Definitely NOT Hogwarts, but a stately, somewhat austere 
    campus reeking with tradition, old money and secrets.  

    Beyond the school and dormitories can be seen high trees.  
  The school seems to have been set down in the middle of a 
    vast forest -- somewhere.  

  In the center of the school grounds is a gathering area, and 
    nearby, a high flagpole.  Flying from the top is a flag with 
    a stylized Tower on it.  Beneath the Tower is written what 
    appears to be the school motto: Excellentia per obsequium - 
    Latin for  Excellence through obedience.   One small but 
    disturbing detail, there is no state or country flag flying 
    from the pole. 

  As Ian takes this all in, he hears that familiar voice again, 
    this time over a PA system:

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, Orientation 
                  begins in fifteen minutes.  Don t 
                  be late.  

  Ian stops a passing GIRL STUDENT.

                                IAN
                  That voice, where s it coming from?

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  What, Echo?

                                IAN
                  Yes!  Echo!  Where is she?

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  Reception.  

  She points to a building.

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  Over there.

                                IAN
                  Thanks.

  As he heads for the building, the girl adds:

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  You re out of uniform.                                                                                  12.




    INT. RECEPTION BUILDING - CONTINUING 

  Ian enters the building.  Fairly sterile, not much there.  
  Ian notes a sign on the wall: RECEPTIONIST.  He rounds a 
    corner to find an open window, the kind that would house a 
    receptionist in a doctor s or lawyer s office.  He looks in 
  the window.

                                IAN
                  I m looking for Echo?

  But the receptionist booth is empty.  That is, there is no 
    human receptionist there.  There is however, a sophisticated 
    computer installed in the booth.  Above it are monitors that 
    show most of the school.  This appears to be a security 
    system that keeps watch over the students at all times.  On 
  the side of the computer console in raised letters is the 
    computer s name - ECHO 119.  

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, Orientation 
                  begins in thirteen minutes.  Don t 
                  be late.  

  Ian reels away from the window, confusion giving way to fear.  
  He hurries toward another door leading out of the reception 
    building.


    INT. HEADMASTER S OFFICE - CONTINUING 

  Not much of this office is revealed now.  A silhouetted 
    figure, THE HEADMASTER, watches Ian on a security monitor.  
  On screen the boy exits Reception and heads down what looks 
  to be the main road into the school.  Headmaster s gaze is 
    impassive, hard to read.


    EXT. SCHOOL - ON IAN 

  He turns a bend in the road and comes to an enormous FENCE.  
  No openings of any sort on it, not even a gate with a visible 
    lock.  A huge barrier preventing escape in any direction. 

  Ian backs away, his heart sinking.

                                IAN
                  Oh.  This is bad.

  Ian pulls out the paper Don gave him. He notes the directions 
  and hurries off.                                                                                  13.




    EXT. CAMPUS - CIRCULAR BUILDING - DAY

  Ian hurries up to this odd-looking building.  He consults his 
    directions, then enters.   


    INT. CIRCULAR BUILDING - CONTINUING 

  Ian goes down a dark hallway.  A strange muted ROARING SOUND 
  is heard rising in the distance.  The only door in the 
    hallway appears before Ian.  He checks his notes again and 
    pushes through the doors.


    INT. BUFFER ARENA 

    Instantly Ian is assaulted by a blast of bright STROBE LIGHTS 
  and PULSING SOUNDS.  

                                LEADER (O.S.)
                  Move!

    A HELMETED FIGURE streaks in on skates, crashes into Ian and 
    sends him flying.

    Then, MORE FIGURES crash into him from all sides.  The 
    figures wear padded suits, in line skates and carry swing 
    hook-like clubs.  Several of the figures swing their clubs at 
    him.  

  Ian rolls away and comes up fighting.  He decks several of 
  the figures, flips and kicks a few more.  

  The most imposing of the figures, clearly the leader, 
    launches himself at Ian.  This guy can really fight.  Ian 
    quickly finds himself on the defensive.  More helmeted 
    figures run to back up their leader.  They swarm over Ian and 
    take him down -- hard.

                                                                        FADE OUT 

                                END ACT ONE                                                                                  14.





                                PREP

                                 NEW KID 

                                ACT TWO


    INT. BUFFER ARENA - SAME AS BEFORE

  On Ian, on the floor and looking for a way to fight the 
    strange figures that attacking him.  His hand grabs a fallen 
    buffer stick.  He swings it, knocking a few of the attackers 
    away.

  The leader of the figures slaps the stick out of Ian s hand.

                                LEADER
                  Drop it!

  The leader takes off his helmet.  He is Ian s age, African-
    American, bald, and at the moment, angry.  This is CAL RICE, 
  the captain of the buffer team.

                                CAL
                  You better have a real good reason 
                  for attacking my team!

                                IAN
                  They jumped me!

  Ian takes a swing at Cal.  Remarkably, Cal ducks it.  Just 
    then the team COACH runs up.  Late thirties, early forties.  
    BIG. You don t screw with this guy.

                                COACH
                  Hey!  That s all, Rice.

                                CAL
                  Okay, Coach.

  Cal turns, deliberately hooking Ian with his buffer stick, 
    tripping him.  Ian hits the floor to the amusement of the 
    team.

    Coach pulls Ian up.

                                COACH
                  Got a name, tough guy?                                                                                  15.



                                IAN
                  Ian Traynor.

    Coach nods, understanding.

                                COACH
                  Figures.  Every year some clueless 
                  noob gets sent down here to have 
                  his butt kicked by the Buffer team.  
                      (to Ian)
                  You re being hazed, Traynor.

  The other players, including Cal, LAUGH at Ian.

                                COACH
                  You want Orientation.  The building 
                  by the flag pole.  

                                IAN
                  Thanks.  One more thing...

  All traces of the cocky hothead are gone now.  Ian is just a 
    scared kid in need of answers.

                                IAN
                  What is this place?

    Coach studies Ian for a second, possibly pitying him.  But 
  all he says is:

                                COACH
                  Orientation.  Building by the flag 
                  pole.  

    Coach turns back to the players.

                                COACH
                  Break s over.  Take your sides.

  Cal returns to his teammates.  Ian heads out the arena door, 
    more confused than ever.


    EXT. ORIENTATION HALL - DAY 

    Ian s roommates Don, Ray and Zack are idling in front of the 
    Orientation building.  Ian runs up and angrily confronts Don. 

                                IAN
                  Hey!

                                DON
                  You re out of uniform.                                                                                  16.



                                IAN
                  Why d you send me to that, whatever 
                  that place was?  

                                DON
                  Just a joke.

                                IAN
                  Yeah.  Not funny.  

  Ian tries to enter the hall.  His roommates block him.  

                                RAY
                  You can t go in once Orientation s 
                  started.

                                IAN
                  I ll catch up.  

                                ZACK
                  It s against the rules.  

                                IAN
                  I m done listening to you guys.

  Ian shoves Zack into Don and Ray.  The roommates are caught 
  off guard and Ian is able to duck inside.  


    INT. ORIENTATION HALL - CONTINUING 

  Ian enters the darkened hall.  Inside he sees perhaps a dozen 
    uniformed STUDENTS sitting at small cubicles.  The students 
    watch different images of school life as they listen to a 
    muted speech over ear buds.  Each student seems to be 
    listening to something different.  This was the last thing 
  the surprised Ian expected. He doesn t know what to think.

                                DON (OFF)
                  He s in there.  

  An older student, a MONITOR by her different uniform, hurries 
    over.  She s taller than Ian, and tough.

                                MONITOR
                  What s the problem?

                                IAN
                  I was going to Orientation, but...                                                                                  17.



                                MONITOR
                  Orientation s closed.  Headmaster 
                  heard you ve been making trouble.  
                  He wants to see you.

  The monitor roughly pulls Ian outside, causing him to bump 
    into some passing students.  One of them is a girl, fifteen, 
    very pretty.  

                                IAN
                  Sorry.

  And suddenly C.J. turns back to her friends, contemptuously 
    dismissing Ian.

                                C.J.
                  I can t stand kids who won t get 
                  with the Program.

                                IAN
                  Hey, I don t even want to be here.

                                MONITOR
                  Headmaster.  Now.  

  Ian is pulled away by the Monitor.  Don, Ray and Zack 
    exchange grins as they head out.


    INT. HEADMASTER S OFFICE - DAY

  The most arresting feature of this book-lined office is the 
    large 3D relief MAP of the school laid out like a train 
    diorama on a table.  It shows the school from all angles, as 
    well as the surrounding woods, but nothing beyond that.  

  Ian sits uncomfortably in front of THE HEADMASTER, a pleasant-
    looking man anywhere between his late thirties and early 
    fifties.  Headmaster reads from a file.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Ian Traynor.  Fifteen.  Attributes, 
                  intelligence, loyalty, courage.  
                  Flaws, stubbornness and a quick 
                  temper.  Psychological profile 
                  reveals a sensitive core -- still 
                  misses the dog he lost three years 
                  ago.  

                                IAN
                  Where did you get that?                                                                                  18.



                                  HEADMASTER
                        (continuing reading)
                  Excels at all sports particularly 
                  those requiring team strategy.  
                      (to Ian)
                  I think you might enjoy our Buffer 
                  team.

                                IAN
                  I met the captain.  No.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Too bad.
                        (continues reading)
                  Despite excellent leadership 
                  potential, subject prefers to go 
                  his own way. 

  The Headmaster puts the file down, smiles at Ian.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  You re an interesting young man, 
                  Ian.  I hope we ll be friends.

  Ian regards him skeptically.

                                IAN
                  Am I under arrest?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Of course not.

                                IAN
                  In some kind of reform school?  
                  Juvenile hall?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  No.  

                                IAN
                  Then what is this place?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The important question is, who are 
                  you?

                                IAN
                  Excuse me?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Ian, how long would you have lasted 
                  at your old school?  You were 
                  already suspended.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  19.

                                  HEADMASTER (cont'd)
                  One more incident and you d have 
                  been expelled.  Then what?  Off to 
                  another school and another 
                  incident?  A boy like you was not 
                  meant to drift through a system 
                  geared for ordinary minds with 
                  ordinary ambitions.  

                                IAN
                  I m no one special.

                                HEADMASTER
                  I don t think you believe that.  
                  Why did you take on that bully the 
                  other day?

                                IAN
                  He went after my friend.

                                HEADMASTER
                  Real reason?

  Ian doesn t answer, but he seems to be holding back.  
    Headmaster fills in the blank.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  He was a challenge.  As much as you 
                  wanted to help your friend, I think 
                  you wanted to test yourself even 
                  more. 

    Headmaster points to the relief map.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Tower Prep was created expressly 
                  for students like you.  Young 
                  people who believed they are out of 
                  step with the rest of the world, 
                  when in reality everyone else is 
                  lagging behind.

  Ian looks at the map, trying to find a familiar landmark.

                                IAN
                  And Tower Prep is where, exactly?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Where you are geographically is not 
                  as important as where you are 
                  mentally.  As a student here you ll 
                  follow an intensive program to 
                  master what we call your unique 
                  potential.                                                                                   20.



                                IAN
                  I don t believe any of this.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The program is challenging, but I 
                  think it s the kind of test you ve 
                  been looking for.  Certainly more 
                  satisfying than getting top score 
                  at Horde Raiders.

    Ian s gaze falls on the nameplate on the Headmaster s desk.  
  It reads simply HEADMASTER, nothing else.

                                IAN
                  Headmaster, is that it?  No other 
                  name?

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Staff members are addressed by 
                  their titles; Math, Science, I know 
                  you already met Coach.  Keeps 
                  everything simple yet respectful.  
                  Any other questions?

                                IAN
                  One big one...

    Headmaster makes an astute guess.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Yes.  Your parents know where you 
                  are.

  Ian shakes his head in disbelief.

                                IAN
                  They couldn t have been happy about 
                  this.

    Headmaster levies the final words he ll say on the subject.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I didn t say they were happy, I 
                  said they know where you are.

  An emotional punch in the gut for Ian.  He has no comeback 
  for this.                                                                                  21.




    EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS

  Ian walks the campus in the company of the older student 
    Monitor.  She has opened up a bit to Ian, but reveals no 
    useful information.  

                                MONITOR
                  The program saved my life.  Sure, 
                  it took a while to get used to, but 
                  now I see I m so much better off 
                  here than I was at home.

                                IAN
                  And where was home again?

                                MONITOR 
                  The faculty doesn t like us talking 
                  about our time before the school.  
                  Helps us stay focused. 

                                IAN
                        (dryly)
                  Right.  On our  unique potential.  

                                MONITOR
                  You re getting it. 

    Just then a wild-eyed RED-HAIRED KID runs up to Ian.  The kid 
    seems unhinged, desperate. 

                                RED
                  Hey!  Hey, new kid!  Listen to me! 

  The Monitor frowns, having encountered situations like this 
    before.

                                MONITOR
                  Oh, boy.  We got a snapper.

  The red-haired kid grabs Ian.

                                RED
                  They ll force you to follow the 
                  program.  Don t do it.  

  The Monitor moves to intercede.  She means business.

                                MONITOR
                  Back off.  One warning.                                                                                  22.



  As the Monitor reaches to grab Red, the boy grabs the Monitor 
  and flips her.  Ian is so stunned he can t react at first.  
    Suddenly Red is clutching at him again.

                                RED
                  Don t give in.  We can beat them.  
                  We can get out.  I know the way!

                                IAN
                  Where is it?

  Red suddenly regards Ian with suspicion.

                                RED
                  Oh wait, that s what I d expect you 
                  to say.  

  Ian gets creeped out as the strange boy recoils from him.

                                RED
                        (laughs)
                  I see it now.  You re with them, 
                  aren t you?  Another trick.  It 
                  won t work!

  Ian reaches out to calm the kid.

                                IAN
                  What are you...

                                RED
                  Stay away!

  Red shoves Ian down.  The hysterical redhead dashes off.

                                RED
                  Stay away!

  Ian watches as Red runs toward the woods beyond the edge of 
  the school.  The Monitor stands and helps up Ian, who looks 
  in the direction of the fleeing boy.

                                IAN
                  That happen a lot?

                                MONITOR
                  Couple times a year.  Maybe more 
                  around the holidays.  Kids get 
                  homesick, y know?

                                IAN
                        (pointed)
                  I know.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  23.

                                IAN (cont'd)
                        (nods toward the woods)
                  Now what, they sic the dogs on him?  

                                MONITOR
                No dogs.

  Ian follows the Monitor toward the school buildings.  He 
    doesn t get far before he hears a distant SIREN-LIKE SCREECH 
    rising from the woods.  The sound is alien and unnerving, a 
  human screech mixed with an electronic wail.  It comes from 
  the same direction taken by the fleeing kid.  The siren is 
    followed by A SCREAM, then silence.  

  Ian looks back at the Monitor, his eyes wide with fear.  The 
    Monitor just motions impatiently.

                                MONITOR
                  You re missing science.  


    INT. CLASSROOM

  Ian enters a large circular CLASSROOM.  It resembles a 
    futuristic version of a modern college lecture hall.  

  The teacher, known only as SCIENCE, white, late forties, 
    rattles off biology facts a mile a minute.  Pictures of small 
    carnivores flash on a screen around Science as he talks.  All 
  the students in the hall are imputing data to their laptops 
  as fast as Science can spew them out.  

  As Science drones on, Ian looks for an unobtrusive place 
  where he can sit unnoticed.  There is none.  

                                SCIENCE 
                  ...Of which D. Maculatus is only 
                  one example.  Owing to convergent 
                  evolution, many members of the 
                  family Dasuridae share 
                  characteristics with their 
                  placental counterparts, including 
                  the Procyonidae, the Mustelidae...  

    Science abruptly breaks off and addresses Ian.  All the 
    students turn to stare at him.

                                SCIENCE 
                  You re late, Mr. Traynor.  Please 
                  take your seat.  

  Ian sees that his seat is in the dead-center of the 
    classroom.  Even more unsettling, his name is on his desk.  
    Cheeks burning, Ian edges down the aisle to his seat, 
    painfully aware every pair of eyes is on him.                                                                                  24.



    A thin, geeky kid, GABRIEL FLORES, makes a comment as Ian 
  edges by.  

                                GABE
                  And the one thought going through 
                  his head right now,  God, I hope I 
                  don t fart.  

  The other kids erupt with laughter.  Ian shoots Gabe a 
    murderous look.  Gabe shrugs and smiles.  Class clown, 
    whatcha gonna do?

    Science glares coldly at Gabe.  

                                SCIENCE
                  Disruptive and inappropriate as 
                  always, Mr. Flores.  Since zoology 
                  bores you, please engage us with 
                  your analysis of muon-catalyzed 
                  fusion.  

  Gabe starts to give a slow, rambling answer, all the while 
    playing for time.

                                GABE
                        (stalling)
                  Yes...those would be the positively 
                  charged deuterons and tritons that 
                  fuse with what is known in physics 
                  circles as the negatively charged 
                  munons, which as we all know, 
                  create...

  The BELL RINGS, signalling the end of the class.

                                SCIENCE 
                  Too bad, Mr. Flores.  There s the 
                  bell. 

                                GABE
                        (mouths quietly)
                  Yes!

    Then Science adds:

                                SCIENCE
                  That gives you extra time to study 
                  before finishing your answer 
                  tomorrow.

                                GABE
                        (downcast)
                  Ugh...                                                                                  25.



    Science gathers his things to go. Ian stands to exit, but all 
  the other students sit where they are.  Science exits, 
    passing another teacher coming in. The name card on the desk 
    automatically switches to the name MATH.  Math looks up to 
  see Ian standing up by himself, confused.

                                MATH
                  Sit down, Mr. Traynor.  I won t 
                  keep you too long.

    More laughter from the students.  

                                MATH
                  Now then, fractals.

  Ian sits as Math launches into a long discourse on fractals, 
  the numbers flashing quickly on the screen behind him.  

  Ian looks down to see a small folded piece of paper on his 
    desk.  It wasn t there a moment before.  Ian opens the note 
  and reads it.


    CLOSE ON NOTE 

  One revealing sentence, hastily scribbled.  It reads:  I M 
    SCARED, TOO.


  ON IAN 

    Glancing around to find the sender of the note.  He looks 
    from face to face, but each of the students has their head 
    down as they intently type into their computers.  

  Ian slips the paper into his pocket.  He tries, with little 
    success, to focus on the lecture. 


    INT. IAN S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

  Ian enters after his first day of class.  He is not happy to 
    find his roommates sprawled on his bed playing cards.  Even 
    worse, they are playing for the few personal items taken from 
    Ian s closet.

                                IAN
                  Oh, hell no.

  The bullies again play it sort of friendly.

                                ZACK
                  Ian.  How was your first day?                                                                                   26.



  Ian barely contains his anger.  He wants to pummel the three 
    smirking assholes.

                                IAN
                  Well, Zack.  It really kinda 
                  sucked.

                                DON
                  Always does.

                                RAY
                  Never gets better, either.

                                DON
                  Not when you live with us.

                                ZACK
                  Might want to call mommy and daddy 
                  and have them pick you up.
                        (smirks)
                  Oh, right.  Can t.

  Don puts down a winning hand.

                                DON
                  I ll take the iPod.

                                IAN
                  Hey!

  Ian moves to grab the iPod, but Ray tosses it to Don.  Don 
    misses it on purpose and the iPod hits the wall and breaks.

                                RAY
                  Piece of crap anyway.

  And that s it.  Before Ray can move, Ian has him off the bed, 
    face down on the floor.  Instantly Zack and Don are on their 
    feet, facing off against Ian.  There is something almost 
    militaristic about they way they have positioned themselves.  

                                DON
                        (serious threat)
                  You re sure?

                                ZACK
                        (even more serious)
                  Please be sure.

    After a tense moment, Ian realizes now s not the time.                                                                                  27.



                                IAN
                  Take it.  It s yours.  All of it.  
                  I ve had it with you, with that 
                  psycho in the castle, with this 
                  whole damn nut house.  I m out.

  Ian exits, fed up.  Grins all around from the bullies.


    EXT. DORMATORY - EVENING

  Ian walks away from the dorms, across the common and toward 
  the trees ringing the forest.  It s starting to get dark.  
  Ian rants to himself as he walks.

                                IAN
                  No fence here, just trees.  Easy.  
                  No problem.  I trip an alarm, I ll 
                  just keep running.  Keep running 
                  until I find something.  There s 
                  always something.

  Ian enters the forest.  So far nothing happens.

                                IAN
                  This is America.  It s never more 
                  than a five minute walk to the 
                  nearest mall, or some place with a 
                  pay phone.

    Just then Ian notices the trees have taken on a labyrinth-
    like quality.  He  turns back, but he seems to have instantly 
    lost his way.  The school grounds and common can no longer be 
    seen from where he is, a stark contrast to just a few seconds 
    before.   

  Ian runs back the way he came only to encounter more trees.  
  He runs down another trail that dead ends into a thick 
    cluster of thorn bushes.  

                                IAN
                  No way.

  Ian starts back up the trail but again finds himself in 
    another unfamiliar part of the forest.  Even worse, it is 
    starting to get dark.

    Then it starts -- Ian becomes aware of a rustling noise, as 
  if creatures were moving through the trees around him.  Then 
  he hears another sound - low crackles like radio static.  Ian 
    runs off his fears mounting.                                                                                  28.



  Ian hears the rustling again, closer this time, and the 
    static, now louder.  He cranes his neck to look through the 
    trees.  He sees something and grows cold.


  IAN S POV - GNOMES

    A number of black-clad, inhuman CREATURES are slowly moving 
    through the trees.  Their heads are hidden under helmets.  
  The only discernible features are their glowing red eyes.  
  The creatures (called GNOMES by the students) communicate in 
    unintelligible static-like WHISPERS.  

  One of the Gnomes looks up, its eyes seemingly scanning the 
    surrounding woods.


  ON IAN 

    Terrified, pressing himself hard against the ground, hoping 
    against all odds to remain unseen.


    EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 

  The Gnomes continue to scan the area.  Satisfied no one is 
    there, they move back the way they came.


  ON IAN

    Looking out fearfully from his hiding place.  Once he is sure 
  the Gnomes have left, he cautiously moves out.  Taking pains 
  to remain silent, he hurries back through the woods.  


    EXT. FOREST TRAIL - CONTINUING

  Ian finds a trail and takes it.  He runs through the trees 
  and almost pitches over the edge of a cliff.  He jumps back 
    just in time.  Far below is water, wide and black, possibly a 
    lake, possibly the ocean.  It seems to go on forever.  Off 
    Ian s scared expression, we...

                                ACT THREE


    EXT. FOREST RAIL - BY CLIFF - NIGHT 

  Ian cautiously backs away from the edge of the cliff.  For a 
    second or two it looks like he might slide over the rim.  
    Then, regaining his footing, he turns and heads back into the 
    forest.


  INT. FOREST - CONTINUING

  Ian traces his steps, trying to find his way out of the 
    forest.  In the distance he see tiny bobbing RED LIGHTS, the 
  eyes of the Gnomes as they search in a clearing.  

  Ian turns and moves quickly down another path.  He is careful 
  to not make a sound as he hurries away from the direction 
    taken by the Gnomes.  Just then he reacts to the sound of 
    hushed voices coming down the trail.

                                C.J. (O.S.)
                        (whispered)
                  Which way?

  Ian leaps off the trail and hides behind a tree.  He peeks 
  out to see THREE KIDS coming his way.  They are C.J., the 
    pretty girl who sneered at him in the orientation line, Gabe 
    Flores, the class clown, and a Japanese girl, a stranger to 
  Ian.  We will learn her name is SUKI. She consults a small 
    hand-held electronic device, like an iPhone.  On it is a 
    digital map of the forest.  Suki has to hold her hand over 
  the device to keep it from giving off too much light.

                                SUKI
                  Down here, I think.  

  C.J. Whispers to Gabe, who has fallen behind.  

                                C.J.
                  Keep up, Flores!

  Gabe hurries to join them.  He is breathing hard.                                                                                  30.



                                GABE
                  I wasn t made for this.  Wise-
                  cracking my way out of a fight, I 
                  can do that.  Scaling walls to 
                  freedom, not so much.

                                SUKI
                  Shh!  They ll hear us! 

                                GABE
                  If they re even out there.

    Suddenly C.J. hears something.

                                C.J.
                  Wait!  We re not alone! 

  Ian jumps out of hiding.  The other three nearly freak, but 
  Ian gestures for them to be quiet.

                                IAN
                  Shh!

  He gestures for them to follow him.  After a moment of 
    hesitation, the other three follow him.


    EXT. FOREST TRAIL - CONTINUING 

  Ian leads the three kids back to where he last saw the 
    Gnomes.  Sure enough, they are still in the clearing just 
    ahead.  Ian gives a hand signal to indicate how many there 
    are.  The reaction of the other kids shows they were not 
    prepared to deal with that many.  It s clear if they had 
    continued that way, they would have been caught.  Ian nods to 
  the others and they follow him away from the Gnomes.

  One the kids are a safe distance from the creatures, Ian 
    breaks the silence.

                                IAN
                  What is this place?  Tower prep?

                                SUKI
                  We don t know.

                                C.J. 
                  We re not even sure if the teachers 
                  know.                                                                                    31.



                                GABE
                  They can spew trivia about 
                  Musashi s Book of Five Rings or  
                  the Punic Wars, but ask them where 
                  we are and they get lockjaw.

                                SUKI
                  And we ve all asked.

                                GABE
                  You can forget learning anything 
                  from the Proges.

                                IAN
                  Proges?

                                C.J.
                  The kids who mindlessly buy the 
                  Headmaster s spiel.  We re 
                  different, we have potential...

                                IAN
                  Heard that.  

                                C.J.
                  Those kids are too deep into the 
                  Program to ask questions.

                                SUKI
                  Or too scared.

                                GABE
                  Finally the three of us decided to 
                  risk the forest run.  Planned it 
                  for months.

                                IAN
                  Like that kid my roommates said I 
                  replaced, Phillips.  What happened 
                  to him?

    Gabe shrugs.

                                GABE
                  The Gnomes got him, most likely.

                                IAN
                  The things in the woods?

                                GABE
                  We call them Gnomes because if we 
                  really thought about what they 
                  might be, we d start screaming.                                                                                    32.



                                IAN
                  What are they? Guards?

                                SUKI
                  Possibly.  No one s ever come back 
                  to say.    

                                GABE
                  Fun school, huh?

                                IAN
                  Like something out of a nightmare.  
                  But with those things on patrol, 
                  we re probably better off back 
                  there. 

    Suki is still reluctant to call it off.  She shows off her 
    phone.

                                SUKI 
                  Took me weeks to rework my touch 
                  phone into a GPS.  If we don t go 
                  now, we won t get another chance.

                                C.J.
                  Maybe we can circle back.

                                IAN
                  Do you know how these Gnomes 
                  maneuver?  Do they attack together, 
                  or split up?  How do they 
                  communicate?  What are their 
                  weaknesses?  Anyone know?

  The kids silence says they don t know.

                                IAN
                  You ve got to do this right.  

  Ian grows more focused as his father s words come back to 
    him.

                                IAN (CONT D)
                  Can t just lash out. Until we know 
                  what we re dealing with, we re 
                  better off watching and waiting.

    A moment of indecision from the three other kids.  Suki 
    finally nods, giving in.  C.J. steps forward.  She offers her 
    hand to Ian.

                                C.J.
                  Candice Judge.  I prefer C.J.                                                                                   33.



  She nods toward the other kids.

                                C.J.
                  I think you remember Gabe Flores 
                  from class.  

                                GABE
                  Hey.  Sorry about the fart joke.

                                IAN
                        (still a bit pissed)
                  Forget it.  

                                C.J.
                  And that s the brains of our group, 
                  Suki Sato.  

  Ian finally starts to believe he is among friends.  He smiles 
  for the first time that day.

                                IAN
                  Ian Traynor.


    INT. FOREST - NIGHT A FEW MINUTES LATER

  Ian has convinced the others.  They are all trekking back 
    through the dark woods toward the school, Suki in the lead, 
    consulting her map.  

                                IAN
                  ...I m talking on line to that Echo 
                  voice, then I heard this buzzing on 
                  my headphones, then I woke up here.  

    C.J. has heard variations on this story.

                                C.J.
                  A girl in my dorm said she heard 
                  Echo s voice on her cell phone 
                  before she passed out.  Same deal.

    Gabe chimes in with his story.

                                GABE
                  I was listening to my music pod 
                  when I passed out.  Next morning I 
                  was in uniform, listening to a 
                  lecture on Pre-Columbian history in 
                  German.  And the weird thing was, 
                  by the end of class, I was actually 
                  starting to understand it.                                                                                  34.



  Ian looks curiously to Suki.  

                                SUKI
                  My parents had a big fight before I 
                  came.  I never knew what it was 
                  about.  I just turned on our big 
                  screen TV and tried to drown out 
                  their screaming.  Then I heard the 
                  buzzing.

  Ian takes the iPhone-like device from her.  On the phone is a 
    brand name - SATO.  Ian makes the connection.

                                IAN
                  Suki Sato, as in Sato Electronics?

    A source of embarrassment for Suki.

                                SUKI
                  Yeah, kind of.

    C.J. fills Ian in on her history.

                                C.J.
                  I don t have any memories of my 
                  life before TowerSchool.  As far as 
                  I know, I ve always been here.  

                                IAN
                  If this is your home, why were you 
                  trying to escape? 

                                C.J.
                  Maybe I ll start to remember the 
                  life I had before school.  There s 
                  got to be more than just TowerPrep 
                  and The Program.  

                                IAN
                  And yet you dumped on me for not 
                  following it.  

                                C.J.
                  We had the break planned for a long 
                  time.  I didn t want anyone to 
                  suspect.

                                IAN
                  Escapes, masked goons, my old 
                  school was never like this.                                                                                  35.



                                GABE
                  That s because most of us at our 
                  little day care center are what 
                  you d call,  special.   Not short 
                  bus special, but  I can do some 
                  weird thing really well  special.  

                                IAN
                  Not that I m buying into this, but 
                  can you give me a for instance?  

                                GABE
                  Suki?

    Suki pauses and says in a perfect imitation of Ian s voice:

                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  Not that I m buying into this, but 
                  can you give me a for instance?  

  Ian is impressed, and sort of scared.

                                IAN
                  Okay, that s weird.

                                SUKI
                      (as C.J.)
                  I can do that with anyone I ve ever 
                  heard, even once...
                      (as Gabe)
                  And with the right clothes and 
                  moves, I can pass myself off as the 
                  real thing, until I drop the 
                  disguise...
                      (as herself)
                  ...and become me again.  Whoever 
                  that is.  

                                IAN
                  And you?

                                C.J.
                  You know the expression,  I can 
                  read you like a book ?  Everyone 
                  communicates through facial tics, 
                  quick breaths, nervous eyelash 
                  flickers. It s like a second 
                  language to me.

                                IAN
                  Seriously?                                                                                  36.



                                C.J.
                  From the second you walked in the 
                  classroom, I knew you were scared.  
                  I wanted to let you know you 
                  weren t alone.

                                IAN
                        (realizing)
                  You sent me that note.  So what 
                  signals am I sending now?  

    Ceej looks at him intently.

                                C.J.
                  Tense muscles, darting 
                  eyes...little creeped out.  Kind of  
                  angry.  And...

  Ian suddenly turns away from her, not wanting her to go 
    deeper. 

                                C.J.
                  I m sure your folks miss you, too.

    A moment of reflection for Suki, Gabe and Ian.  It s the 
    elephant in the room.

                                SUKI
                  I like to think mine do.

                                GABE
                  Same here.

                                IAN
                        (quiet)
                  We fought last night.  I never got 
                  to say...
                      (to Suki)
                  How much farther?

    Suki consults her map.

                                SUKI
                  Half mile.  That way.

    Gabe is anxious to impress Ian.

                                GABE
                  Want to know what I can do?                                                                                  37.



                                IAN
                  Does it involve flight,  
                  teleportation or any other way to 
                  get us home?

                                GABE
                  Uh, no.

                                IAN
                  I ll pass.

                                C.J.
                  What about you?

                                IAN
                  I got nothing. 

                                C.J.
                  Really?  No flashes of second 
                  sight, sudden busts of strength... 

    C.J. senses a shift in Ian.

                                C.J.
                  Something, though.  I felt it when 
                  you dropped your eyes. 

                                IAN
                  That s creepy.

                                C.J.
                  But I m not wrong.

  Ian decides to open up.  He tells C.J. What he s never told 
    another soul.  

                                IAN
                  I ve always felt like I was a half 
                  step in front of the rest of the 
                  world.  Like I can see things just 
                  before they happen, and react a 
                  second faster than...

  And with that, he throws C.J. To the ground.  Before the 
    startled Suki and Gabe can react, Ian is leaping forward and 
    firing a powerful kick into the mid-section of an attacking 
    GNOME.  The Gnome hits the ground, then quickly springs back 
  up onto its feet.  The crackling static coming from its 
     face  instantly rises into a wailing SIREN.  It is the exact 
    same semi-electronic, semi-human sound Ian heard after the 
    red-haired kid vanished into the woods.                                                                                   38.



    Across the forest answering SIRENS are heard.  They seem to 
  be moving closer to the kids at a fast pace.  Off the kids 
    terrified expressions, we...

                                END ACT THREE                                                                                  39.





                                PREP

                                 NEW KID 

                                ACT FOUR


    EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 

  The bizarre Gnomes race through the forest, their frightening 
    sirens rising.  They move like a coordinated strike team, 
    vaulting over downed trees and thick bushes.  Think storm 
    troopers mixed with ninjas.


  ON IAN AND KIDS

  Ian stands in front of the others, trying to fend off the 
    first Gnome attacker.  The figure is taller than Ian, but Ian 
    moves faster.  As the Gnome reaches to grab him, Ian 
    sidesteps, grabs the Gnome and sends him spinning into the 
  side of a tree.   

                                IAN
                      (to other kids)
                  Run!

    They all dash off through the forest.  

  As the kids run, the red lights of the other Gnomes sweep the 
    woods behind them.  The red lights glance off them and the 
    Gnomes sirens grow louder.  Suki makes a decision.  

                                SUKI
                  I got this. 

  She starts to break off from the others.  C.J. moves to stop 
    her.

                                C.J.
                  Suki!  No!

  But Suki darts around C.J., not about to be stopped.

                                SUKI
                  Whatever you hear, keep going!

    Suki dashes off to side.  She runs back a short way, then 
    hides in the trees.  She calls out:                                                                                  40.



                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  This way, guys!  
                      (in C.J. s voice)
                  Head to the clearing!


  ON GNOMES

  The first Gnome has rejoined the others.  They hear Suki 
    calling in different voices.

                                SUKI (O.S.)
                      (in C.J. s voice)
                  Everyone stay together!


  ON SUKI 

  She scrambles up a rock and calls out:

                                SUKI 
                      (in Gabe s voice)
                  I m right behind you!


    BACK TO GNOMES

  The lead Gnome directs a few of the Gnomes to follow the 
    voices.  They run off in search of the voice.


    BACK TO SUKI

    Smiling, she slides off the rock and runs ahead, luring the 
    pursuing Gnomes away.  

                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  We re home free!

    Suddenly Suki reacts with fear to something she sees ahead.  
  She quickly throws herself off the trail and hides.

    A brand new SECOND COMPANY of even MORE Gnomes, also alerted 
  by Suki s voices, runs in, just missing Suki.  This second 
    company meets up with the first company.  The two company 
    Leaders communicate in low STATIC CRACKLES.  

  In a nearby ditch, a scared Suki tries to make herself as 
    small as possible.                                                                                    41.



                                SUKI
                        (quietly, her own voice)
                Oh great, there s more.

    After a few seconds, the two companies of Gnomes move off as 
  one united larger company.  

  The second they leave, Suki leaps to her feet and runs to 
    find her friends.


  ON IAN, GABE AND C.J.

    Racing through the woods.  Ian calls back to the others:

                                IAN
                  How far is it?

                                GABE
                  Just over the hill. 

  Ian breaks away.  

                                IAN
                  Go on.  I m going back for Suki.  

  But Suki is hot on their heels.

                                SUKI
                  I m here.  The Gnomes are coming on 
                  all sides.  

  And suddenly the forest is swept with red lights from the 
    advancing Gnomes  eyes.  The creatures push in from both 
    sides, the kids caught between them.  

  Ian is ready to fly at the Gnomes, but Gabe steps forward.   

                                GABE
                  My turn.  Finally.

    Gabe starts to speak with confidence to the Gnomes.  His tone 
  is easy-going, trustworthy. A master manipulator just before 
  he takes you for everything you ve got. The Gnomes stay where 
    they are, not attacking, just waiting.  Their sirens have 
    faded to a low whine, barely audible.  

                                GABE
                  Guys, how are ya?  Look, there s 
                  obviously been a misunderstanding.  
                  We took a wrong turn after study 
                  hall, chased a sick raccoon into 
                  the woods, call it what you want...                                                                                  42.



    Gabe gestures for the other kids to start walking.  They do.  
    They head slowly into the trees and Gabe starts backing away 
    after them.   

                                GABE (CONT D)
                  ...mistakes were made.  I m the 
                  first one to admit it.  


  ON IAN AND C.J.

    Edging toward the trees.

                                IAN
                        (whispers)
                  Does this really work?

                                C.J.
                        (whispers)
                  I dunno how he does it, but yeah.  
                  Gabe can talk his way out of 
                  anything. 


    BACK TO GABE AND GNOMES

    Gabe is inching away from the Gnomes who are still hovering 
    nearby, not attacking, but not withdrawing, either.  The 
    Gnomes closest to Gabe relax slightly, standing at ease as 
    they listen to him talk.

                                GABE
                  That said, there s no reason to go 
                  screaming through the forest, we ll 
                  just head on back to campus, and 
                  you can fly back to the batcave, or 
                  wherever you guys hole up.  That 
                  cool?

  The lead Gnome notices several of his  men  relaxing their 
    fighting stances.  A burst of sharp STATIC from the Leader s 
     mouth  snaps the other Gnomes back to attention.  The Leader 
    raises his  voice  to a SHRIEKING SIREN again and the other 
    Gnomes do the same.  The Gnomes quickly dart forward to cut 
  off Ian, C.J. and Suki from escaping.

  As the Gnomes push the four in closer, the SIRENS take on the 
    strange BUZZING SOUND that he first heard over his 
    headphones.  

    Suki, C.J. And Gabe start to fall under the spell of the 
    strange droning sound.                                                                                    43.


    They lose their fear and start to weave back and forth, as if 
    they are falling into trances. Ian shakes them awake. 

                                IAN
                      (to others )
                  Don t listen! 

  The kids snap out of it and quickly slap their hands over 
    their ears.  

  Ian launches himself at the lead Gnome.  Though Ian is much 
    smaller, he manages to tackle the Gnome.  The other Gnomes 
    quickly move to close in.  Ian manages to shout to C.J.:

                                IAN
                  Run!  Trust me!

    C.J. nods back.  She and the other kids dash up the hill 
    toward the school.


  ON IAN

  For the first time we really see Ian cut loose.  It isn t 
    that he s an immensely strong fighter, but an amazingly fast 
  and agile one.  Imposing as the Gnomes are, they are too slow 
  to grab him.  Ian ducks between their legs, dodges away from 
    their blows, and when he connects, he connects HARD.  Every 
    time a Gnome pauses to get its bearings, that s when Ian 
    strikes.  Not wasting his fists on the Gnome s hard helmets, 
  he concentrates with kicks to their mid-sections.  Seeing him 
    bravely take on the Gnomes, we understand why Ian rose so 
    quickly in his karate class.  As he deftly hobbles his 
    attackers one after the other, we also understand why his 
    folks took him out.  

    Staggering the Gnomes for the moment, Ian runs off after his 
    friends.


    EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT 

    Gabe, Suki and C.J. have come to the edge of the forest.  
    Before them is the school common and beyond that, the 
    dormitories.  But to the kids dismay, a series of low 
    infrared SENSOR LIGHTS are sweeping over the grounds. The 
    lights sweep down in one direction, withdraw for a few 
    seconds, then swing back in a new direction.  There appears 
  to be no way to get across in time without being it by one of 
  the beams. 

                                SUKI
                  We re too late.  Security is on.                                                                                  44.



  Ian runs up to the kids.  He sees the lights and guesses 
    their purpose.

                                IAN
                  Do you know the way across?

                                C.J.
                        (shakes head)
                  We weren t planning on coming back.

    C.J. glances toward the woods.

                                C.J.
                  Now we can t.

                                GABE
                  We re screwed.

  Ian studies the sweep of the lights for a second.

                                IAN
                  Hold on.  There s a pattern to the 
                  lights.  

                                GABE 
                  You re crazy.  It s all random.

                                IAN
                  No.  I can see it.  Not sure how, 
                  but I can.   You can make it across 
                  if you stay together and do as I 
                  say. 

  Ian studies the lights again, then nods.

                                IAN
                  Get ready... 

    They wait until the lights finish their sweep.  

                                IAN
                  Three steps ahead.  Go.

    Suki, Gabe and Ceej step out onto the common.

                                IAN
                  Two steps to the left.

  The kids follow his commands.

                                IAN
                  One step right.  Stop.                                                                                  45.



    They do it perfectly.

                                IAN
                  Ten steps ahead.  Duck!

  The kids duck low as the beam sweeps over her head.  Suki 
    barely makes it.

    QUICK REACTIONS on C.J., Suki and Gabe, looking worried.  
  They stay stock still as the light sweeps back and forth 
  above them.  It passes and they straighten.

                                IAN
                  Twenty feet ahead. Stop, wait and 
                  jump.

  The kids run ahead, stop and leap as the beam sweeps under 
  them at ankle level.  At the end Gabe trips instead of jumps, 
  and comes down at a weird angle.  He bends his body in an 
    uncomfortable but funny-looking way to elude the last of the 
    beams.  Suki and Ceej reach back to yank him out of the path 
  of the last beam.  The kids collapse breathing hard but safe 
  on the other side.  


  ON IAN

  He is just starting across when one of the Gnomes darts out 
    from the forest and jumps him.  


  ON OTHER KIDS

  On the other side, the kids see this and react with alarm.  
    C.J. starts back, but Ian gestures for her to stop.

                                IAN
                  Stay there!

  The kids are concerned for Ian but unable to do anything 
    except watch.


    BACK TO IAN AND THE GNOME

    Really going at it.  The Gnome grabs Ian by both arms and 
    starts up its eerie wail again.  The creature s  face  is 
    very close to Ian s.  He bends and twists but can t get away 
    from it. 

                                IAN 
                  That s really starting to piss me 
                  off!                                                                                  46.



  Ian head-butts the creature, then fires his fist into the 
    Gnome s  mouth.   There is a crackle of static and the siren 
    shorts out.  

  Its power source seemingly corrupted, the Gnome collapses. 
  Ian bends over the strange figure.  We and Ian get a good 
  look at the thing.  It is dressed in a close-fitting black 
  suit, with thick-soled boots that make it seem taller.  Ian 
  takes hold of the helmet and pulls it off.  He sees the face 
    beneath it and swallows hard.

    Staring blankly up at Ian is the dazed face of the frantic 
    red-haired kid that ran up to him earlier that day.  The kid 
  is still breathing, but it seems like his brain has shut 
  down.  What the hell?

  Ian looks up to see distant flickering red lights in the 
    forest, drawing closer.  He picks up the Gnome s shattered 
    helmet and runs with it.


  ON SCHOOL COMMON

  Ian runs onto the lawn.  Moving deftly, he eludes the sweep 
  of the infrared lights and joins his friends on the other 
  side.  

                                GABE
                        (points to the helmet)
                  You re some awesome fighter.

                                IAN
                  I just charge in swinging.

  The kids head for their dorms.


  INT. BOY S DORM

  Don, Ray and Zack head toward the dorm s communal bathroom.  
  The guys are wearing robes and carrying towels.  A few other 
  boys move quickly out of their way, showing these are guys 
  most of the rest of the school fears.  One of the boys can t 
  get out of their way fast enough.  Don nods to him in the 
  smug way a bully has of acknowledging a kid worth scaring but 
  not beating up.

                                DON
                        (sneers)
                  Howard.

  The nervous boy smiles, anxious to placate them.                                                                                  47.



                                HOWARD
                  Hey guys.  Hear you got a new 
                  roommate.  

  The trio exchange glances, shake their heads  no  and grin.  
    Ignoring Howard, they continue into the bathroom. 

                                HOWARD
                  Oh well, that s cool.  See ya.


    INT. BATHROOM

  The boys are taking a shower.  Their robes and towels hang on 
    nearby hooks. 

                                RAY
                  Think Traynor made it as far as the 
                  cliffs?

                                DON
                  I ll bet the Gnomes grabbed him by 
                  the first tree. 

    Suddenly Ian, seen only from the back or in quick glimpses, 
    dashes in and swipes their things.  Don looks up and catches 
  and fleeting glimpse.  

                                DON
                  Hey!  Traynor!  

  The guys run out of the shower.  

                                ZACK
                  Oh man, you are dead!

  The naked bullies race out of the bathroom too angry to be 
    embarrassed. 


    EXT. DORM - NIGHT - CONTINUING 

    Ian, seen from the back, wearing a jacket, races onto the 
    lawn and drops off the robes before bolting away.  The 
    bullies charge after him.  The second they hit the lawn, the 
    infrared security beams flash over them, triggering the 
    alarm.  Tensor lights mounted on top of the dorm flash down 
  on them.  All the room doors open as the boys look out to see 
  who got nailed.  

    Remarkably Ian himself looks out of his room.  The bullies 
  see him, can t believe it.  They just saw him run the other 
    way, right?                                                                                  48.



                                RAY 
                  Traynor?!

  Ian shakes his head, seemingly disgusted with his roommates 
    behavior.

                                IAN
                  Keep it down, guys.  I m trying to 
                  study.  

    Gabe knocks on the dorm door marked DORM MASTER.

                                GABE
                  Excuse me, Sir.  Ugly naked dudes 
                  dancing on the common.  

  The teacher called MATH steps out.

                                GABE
                  Kind of cool in a grotesque way, 
                  but really just creeping everyone 
                  out.  Thought you should know.

    Math catches sight of the trio, wet and naked in the security 
    lights.  He can t suppress a smile.

                                MATH
                  Oh good.  And out after curfew, 
                  too.  Mr. Blonsky, please cover 
                  yourself.  

  The shamefaced Zack does so.

                                MATH
                  I m sure Headmaster will have 
                  something to say about this.  Step 
                  into my apartment while I call him.  

  The angry bullies grab their robes. 

    Math notes Ian grinning at the bullies embarrassment. 

                                MATH
                  Everything copacetic, Mr. Traynor?

                                IAN
                  No complaints, Sir.

    Math gives Ian a look that says he might know more than Ian 
  is telling about the incident, and he doesn t think that s a 
  bad thing.  C.J. approaches Ian s room as the sullen bullies 
    file past.                                                                                  49.



                                IAN
                      (to C.J.)
                  You picking up anything besides 
                  embarrassment and the desire to 
                  inflict pain?  

    Ceej looks at the bullies.

                                C.J.
                  I can feel Zack tearing up.  Going 
                  to lose it.

  The Dorm Master s door closes. 

                                ZACK (O.S.)
                        (sobs)

    Ceej gives Ian a  told ja  look.  Suki enters, taking off 
    Ian s jacket.  

                                SUKI
                  I think this is yours.

                                IAN
                  Thanks.  It looked good on you.  

    A shy smile from Suki.

    They are rejoined by Gabe.  He nods to Ian:

                                GABE
                  Well.  Do we show him?

                                IAN
                  What?

  The other three are obviously in on some secret.  Ceej and 
    Suki are in agreement.

                                C.J.
                  It s okay.

    They move off casually in the direction of the classrooms.  
  As this is all within the campus, there are no alarms here.  
    Ian, curious, follows them.


    EXT. OLD SCIENCE BUILDING - NIGHT

    Establish the dark old building at the edge of the campus.  
  Ian quietly follows Gabe, Ceej and Suki to the old building.                                                                                  50.




    INT. OLD SCIENCE BUILDING STORE ROOM - CONTINUING 

  It is a treasure trove of old Frankenstein-like equipment, 
    skeletons in cases, dusty taxidermy animals, creepy things in 
    liquid-filled jars and other scientific paraphernalia of 
    forgotten times.  A centerpiece of the room is an old 
    telescope, mounted to look up through the ceiling.  

  Ian enters with the others and looks around.  He smiles, 
    intrigued with the surroundings.

                                C.J.
                  This is where we met to plan the 
                  escape.  It s the only place on 
                  campus that s completely private.

                                IAN
                  Very cool.

                                GABE
                  It s got that old Skull and Bones 
                  Secret Society charm.  The best 
                  reason a kid should go to prep 
                  school.

    Suki has moved to the old telescope.

                                SUKI
                  This used to be the old 
                  observatory. 

  Ian scrambles up next to her.

                                IAN
                  I m good with astronomy.  Let me 
                  get a fix on the stars and I can 
                  figure out where we are.  

    Suki moves to stop him.

                                SUKI
                  We ve all looked though it, but...

                                C.J.
                  Let him look, Suki.  It s better he 
                  knew.

  Ian looks through the telescope.  

                                IAN
                  This isn t right.                                                                                  51.



    After a second, he looks up, stunned.

                                IAN
                  The stars, everything s out of 
                  place.  
                      (a sobering realization)
                  Are we even in the United States?

  The other kids shrug.  

                                GABE
                  You ve seen the flagpole.  There s 
                  no state flag, no country.  Only 
                  the school.

  Ian is downhearted.  He hadn t counted on this.

                                IAN
                  Didn t think home was so far away.  

                                C.J.
                  How long kids have been brought 
                  here, and what they were trained 
                  for is anyone s guess.  

                                SUKI
                  We still don t know why we re here,
                  Or how we re supposed to develop 
                  our  potential.   

                                IAN
                        (determined)
                  We ll worry about that once we re 
                  gone.

  The other kids listen to Ian with growing respect.  He s what 
  the three desperate kids have needed all along, a leader with 
    a plan.

                                IAN
                  We ll do like C.J. and pretend to 
                  be good little Proges.  Each night, 
                  we ll meet here and map out a real 
                  escape plan.  

                                SUKI
                  I m all for that but...

                                C.J.
                  What?

    Suki brings up that elephant again.  Neither Suki, Ian nor 
    Gabe has wanted to deal with this.                                                                                   52.



                                SUKI
                  You re different, Ceej, you ve been 
                  here all along.  But the three of 
                  us...our parents knew about this.  
                  They sent us here.  If we go back, 
                  what do we go back to?  What will 
                  we have if they reject us?

    After a second, Ian voices the answer that is in all their 
    hearts:

                                IAN
                  Each other.

  Ian puts his hand out.  The other three take it.  As they 
    look into each others eyes, a bond is forged between the 
    four.  Unbreakable, until escape or death do we part.                                                                                  53.

    INT. IAN S ROOM - MORNING

    Close quick shots of Ian taking out his uniform, tying his 
  tie and slipping on his jacket.


    EXT. IAN S ROOM - CONTINUING

  It is the next day, just before the home room bell rings.  
  Ian steps out of his room completely dressed in the school 
    uniform.  His tie is straight, his jacket is neat, not a 
    detail is out of place.  With books in hand, he sets off for 
  the classroom.  He appears to be just another model TowerPrep 
    student.  From some unseen PA system comes the voice of Echo, 
    presumably welcoming any new students that were dropped off 
    during the night.

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, orientation 
                  begins in fifteen minutes.  Don t 
                be late.  

  On his way to class, Ian crosses paths with Headmaster. 

                                HEADMASTER
                  Mr.  Traynor.  Math says there was 
                an incident with your roommates 
                  last night.

                                IAN
                  Guys just being guys I guess, 
                  whooping it up naked on the lawn, 
                  setting off the security system 
                  just for fun.

                                HEADMASTER
                  You saw nothing unusual?  

                                IAN
                  I did mention they were naked?

    Headmaster frowns.  Ian continues:                                                                                   54.



                                IAN
                  I was inside studying.  Ask anyone.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I did.

    Headmaster notes Ian s appearance.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Good to see you in full uniform. 

                                IAN
                  I can t understand the Program if 
                  I m not part of it. 

    Headmaster studies Ian, trying to decide if the boy is on the 
    level.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  You ll find that s the best way to 
                  succeed here.

                                IAN
                  Well, you were right when you said 
                  I like a challenge.

  Ian nods as he moves away from Headmaster.  


  ON HEADMASTER

    A few students run by him, attracting his attention. 
    Headmaster walks after the excited students, curious to see 
    that has grabbed their attentions.  The kids are headed for 
  the center of the school common, and the flagpole.  


    EXT. SCHOOL - CLOSE ON FLAGPOLE 

  At the top of the flagpole, in place of the flag, hangs the 
    broken helmet Ian took off the defeated Gnome the night 
    before. 

  PAN DOWN from the top of the pole to show the students 
    looking up at it in wonder.

                                STUDENT #1
                  Is it really a Gnome?

                                STUDENT #2
                  No one s ever seen them.                                                                                  55.



                                STUDENT #3
                  You mean no one s seen them and 
                  come back.  

                                STUDENT #1
                  Someone did.

  As Headmaster approaches, the students quickly scatter and go 
    about their business.  Headmaster is joined by Math.  They 
    both look at the helmet.

                                MATH
                  First time that s happened.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  We ll make it the last.  

                                MATH
                  Shall I implement disciplinary 
                  procedure?  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  No reason to punish the entire 
                  student body for a message sent by 
                  one person.  If we ignore it, 
                  they ll become over-confident, 
                  careless. We ll catch him next 
                  time.  

                                MATH
                  You re sure it s a  him?  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I have some ideas.  

    Math speaks quietly and personally to Headmaster.  

                                MATH
                  Not every student can deal with 
                  what we do here, Penemue.  Some of 
                  them break.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The strong ones must follow the 
                  Program without question.  It s the 
                  only way they can deal with the 
                  outside world.  

    Headmaster looks back the helmet on the flag pole.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Or themselves.                                                                                    56.



    Headmaster exits, leaving Math to lower the helmet.

    A short distance away, Gabe watches the action at the 
    flagpole, then turns and passes by Ian.  They don t speak, 
  but Gabe touches his nose, a signal to Ian.  Ian responds 
    with a touch to his ear.

  Ian continues on past C.J.  They also share a signal of 
    silent communication.  

    Nearby Don, Ray and Zack watch Ian.  The signals are lost on 
    them, but their sullen expressions say they don t like or 
    trust Ian one bit.

  As the bullies move off, Suki is revealed sitting on a bench.  
  She is seemingly playing with her picture phone.  To anyone 
    else, it looks just like a basic phone, but Suki is giving it 
    a once-over with a small screwdriver.  


    CLOSER ON PICTURE PHONE

  The simple graphics suddenly scramble, becoming a swirling 
    electronic jumble.  Suki frowns and tries to fix it.  Just 
    then, the graphics reform into words.  The message on the 
    screen reads:

    SUKI - I KNOW THE WAY OUT.  TRUST ME - ECHO

    Suki s eyes widen in shock.  She quickly sticks the phone in 
  her backpack and runs off to find Ian and the others.


                                                                        FADE OUT
