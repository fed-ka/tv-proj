Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.
He
gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES.
This is the middle of nowhere.
Scrub cactus and dust and a
heartless sun.
SUPERTITLE: MEXICO - TWENTY MILES SOUTHWEST OF TIJUANA.
A broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of
the road.
It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.
The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.
Then,
an old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.
From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers
down the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.
The moving van slows to a stop.
Javi approaches.
The DRIVER
unhurriedly rolls down the window.
DRIVER
Is there a problem?
JAVIER
No.
There's no problem.
The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his
wallet.
DRIVER
Okay.
I see.
How much do you want?
The driver pulls a wad of bills.
Javi shakes his head.
DRIVER
You want more than this?
Javi shakes his head.
The driver exchanges a look with his
partner.
DRIVER
You want something else?
Javi smiles.
The driver gets out and walks to the back of
the truck.
He opens the rear door.
There are neatly-stacked
crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."
He reaches
into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also
with the scorpion stamped on it.
He turns to see Javi with
his gun drawn.
Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is
motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.
JAVIER
Drop the package.
Put your hands
behind your head.
You're under
arrest.
The driver hesitates.
He starts to comply then looks at
Javi and Manolo.
DRIVER
I don't understand.
I think there
must be some mistake.
JAVIER
No, there's no mistake.
Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.
The driver
begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.
Javi puts the
driver in the front of the Shadow.
Manolo follows in the
moving van.

The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.
Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows
appear, closing fast.
The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull
to a stop.
A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus
past the truck.
Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS
surround them like a SWAT team.
The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO
SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly
pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.
SALAZAR
(to Javier)
What's your name?
JAVIER
Javier Rodriguez.
SALAZAR
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done
a very good job, but we'll take care
of it from here.
Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his
sunglasses.
In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS
over their heads.
SALAZAR
We've been following these Narco-
trafficantes for some time but had
not been able to bring them to
justice.
(to his men)
Put the prisoners in the car.
Impound the truck.
The men follow Salazar's orders.
SALAZAR
(to Javi)
One question.
How did you find about
this?
JAVIER
An informant.
SALAZAR
What is the name of your informant?
JAVIER
(beat)
It was an anonymous tip.
Salazar looks at Javi a beat.
SALAZAR
(to his men)
For a State Police officer, you're
very well informed.
Let's go.
MOMENTS LATER
Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of
vehicles drive away.
Javier lights a cigarette.
MANOLO
Wasn't that General Salazar?
JAVIER
Yeah.
MANOLO
What's he doing up here?
JAVIER
I don't know.
Something.
They start for their car.

Castro is talking

No giveaways.

Nope.
Castro stretches his arms, swings them around.

Gordon looks at Castro,

Oh,

Looks like the

FBI AGENT
This is our show.
Ah, man.
I don't
want to share this one.
The DEA are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who
are shooting back.
From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing
their weapons.
An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing
in return.
Nobody was aware of the other's presence.
It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three
competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS,
GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.
Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between
two buildings.
Castro emerges and chases him.
Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company.
He cuts
between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie

Castro and Gordon shove Ruiz into the sunlight.
They wait

Don't you want to know what kind of

TOURIST MAN
It's a Brown Ford Explorer --
TOURIST WOMAN
It was right here.
It's been stolen.
I want to file a report.
MANOLO
Please.
Filing a report will not
help you find your car.
JAVIER
The police won't find your car.
TOURIST WOMAN
But you're the police.
Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number.
JAVIER
Call this man, he'll find your car
for you.
TOURIST MAN
I don't get it --
TOURIST WOMAN
How will this guy know who has our
car?
JAVIER
The police will tell him.
There's a beat of confusion.
TOURIST MAN
Why will they tell him but they won't
tell us?
TOURIST WOMAN
(getting it)
Because we pay him, stupid.
(to Javier)
Right?
And he pays the police.
And then our car appears.
JAVIER
Yes.
Better than filling out forms,

The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty.
Javi waves him off.

One wife, HELENA AYALA, 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and
intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out
the window at a small BOY, 5, using a putter as tall as he
is.
Helena is six months pregnant and radiant.
A waiter brings Helena's starter course.
Her friends, NAN
DOBBS, early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy,
STEWIE and ALEX, same League, watch her --
NAN
Duck salad?
HELENA
Mmm.
Nan can't believe it.
NAN
Helena, you never order duck salad.
HELENA
Well, that's true.
I don't.
(re: her belly)
I think someone else is asking for
it.
NAN
Well, he's got good taste.
Isn't it
the most wonderful thing you ever
tasted?
I mean ever.
HELENA
It's delicious --
STEWIE
They're the most marvelous little
creatures.
Canard.
They fly, swim,
walk.
And so cute with their babies
marching along behind.
NAN
Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.
Everyone laughs.
Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd.
ALEX
It's a very fatty bird.
All that
winter insulation.
Just like me.
NAN
You mean all breast, just like you.
ALEX
You're bad --
NAN
(singsong)
Jealous, that's all --
HELENA
I've heard... I can't remember
where... That it's full of that good
kind of fat, the kind you're
supposed to eat --
STEWIE
Unsaturated fat --
TWO WOMEN IN UNISON
Polyunsaturated.
HELENA
And now there's a good cholesterol
and bad cholesterol.
Everything
they tell you completely changes
every other week.
I don't know why
they think we should listen at all.
NAN
What I know is ducks, as cute as
they are, were designed by God to be
eaten.
Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward
also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad.
Helena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat
of her Mercedes.
He won't let go of his putter.
HELENA
I'll put this in the back.
DAVID
No --
HELENA
All the professionals keep them in
the trunk.
DAVID
Not Tiger Woods.
HELENA
Especially Tiger Woods.

Joggers jog

equipment operated by Mexicans.
Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf
club on the lush lawn.
Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional
party planner.
A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway.
DAVID
Daddy!
The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome,
charismatic, second generation American, in expensive,
conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets
his kids.
CARL
Hello.
Hello.
He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage.
David goes back to his game.
Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home
and watch David play with his golf putter.
OUTSIDE THEIR GATE
An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall.
Another arrives and another and another.
OFFICERS in DEA
jackets exit the cars.
There is MURMURING, then SILENCE.
Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.
He doesn't look

HELENA
David, come inside --
Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.
Gordon and
Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl.
CARL
What is this?
What is going on?
GORDON
Mr. Ayala?
CARL
That's right.
GORDON
You're under arrest for violation of
Federal Narcotics laws.
Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion
begin pulling him from his yard.
David is trying to get to
his father.
In a kind of shock.
Helena trails after him.
Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of
the cruiser.
He pushes him down into the backseat.
GORDON
We have a warrant to search your
home, Mrs. Ayala.
Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.
Carl
looks at his wife through the window.
Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house.
Helena is left standing in the street.
NEIGHBORS, who have
appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare

David approaches and holds onto her
leg.

The back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded Francisco
falls onto the ground.
Surrounding him are Javi and Salazar, who watch as two of
Salazar's MEN drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission-

Javi)
I'm curious how you did this with

STEWIE
This is fabulous, Helena.
What a

HELENA
Thank you so much, but I had a lot

Helena circles away.
As Helena leaves, the women speak their
minds --
NAN
It's a turnout because it's a
spectacle.

ALEX

STEWIE
It teaches me a valuable lesson...

Javier and Salazar walk across the base.
Salazar is feeling

SALAZAR
You watch and learn.
I earn his
trust.
Then more pain.
Then I appear
with kindness.
Within a week he
will follow me around like a dog.
JAVIER
But will he be house-trained?
SALAZAR
When he loves me like a father, he
will never tell anyone he was here.
He will freely give the names of his
superiors.
Then we get them and
they too will give us names.
And
eventually somebody will get us to
Juan Obregon and the cartel will
fall.
They enter the barracks.
Adler, Arnie, and Helena push through a crowd toward her
car.
There are several reporters there who ask questions --
REPORTER
Mrs. Ayala, were you aware your
husband is the largest cocaine
smuggler in America?
ADLER
Alleged, people, alleged.
Helena gets into her car and slams the door.
Adler faces
the reporters.
REPORTER #2
Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband
has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz?
Adler is in a role he relishes.
Helena drives away.
We
move up to Gordon, who is watching from the hotel window
across the street.
He speaks into a walkie-talkie, and a
car down below pulls out to follow Helena.

Helena notices David moving away while playing with the man.
She follows, then begins to jog after them.
HELENA

As she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and
abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by
his arms.
David is having fun as Helena approaches.
HELENA

The strange man swings David up so that he's under his arm.
STRANGE MAN
Yeah, this is fun.
HELENA
Please put down my son.
The man holds David.
STRANGE MAN
Shouldn't let your kid wander off

HELENA
Thank you.
That's a valuable lesson.
David, come on.
The strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer
having fun.
He begins to wriggle --
STRANGE MAN
Mrs. Ayala --
This gets her attention --
STRANGE MAN
Your husband owes a lot of money.
Enough that snapping this kid's neck
wouldn't nearly cover it.
David begins to cry.
Helena looks around wildly for help.
STRANGE MAN
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is going to disappear,
and he won't turn up until the evening

He drops David who runs to his mother.
STRANGE MAN

JAVIER
Oh, really.

The dealer looks them over.
He looks behind them down the

Seth and Caroline are suspicious.
They carefully show money

They hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone.
Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps.

Manolo knocks again.
They wait a long beat.
MANOLO

Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing

Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast

Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a

no state money.
They survive on
donations and what they get for
building doghouses to sell to the
U.S.
(beat)
We need lights for the parks so kids
can play at night.
So they can play
baseball.
So it's safe.
Everybody
likes parks.
Everybody likes
baseball.
(beat)
What I'm talking about is I would
like to see somebody take an interest
in Tijuana.
That's what I'm talking
about.
Javi starts to get out of the pool.
HUGHES
Javi, You want to come see us again,
you're going on the box.
No more of
this water-wing bullshit.
A peaceful wooded campus with a unobtrusive sign reading,
"Serenity Oaks Treatment Facility."
Establishing shot of a military helicopter landing on the
roof of an office building in downtown Mexico City.
Caroline ambles alone down a walkway at the treatment
facility.
She looks through the trees that surround facility and notices
cars going by.
CUT TO:
Helena watches David look at the wide variety of plants and
flowers.
All around them a GROUP of 3rd graders, in identical
T-shirts, enjoy a field trip.
FRANCISCO (V.O.)
I love this place.
Don't turn around.
Behind her Francisco Flores takes a photo with an instant
camera.
FRANCISCO
You were followed by the police, but
they won't hear us over the children.
I want to use a bomb.
HELENA
You're kidding.
Can't you shoot him
or something?
FRANCISCO
I don't really like guns.
You shoot
someone in the head three times and
some doctor will keep them alive.
HELENA
When will you do it?
FRANCISCO
I don't know.
Eduardo Ruiz is the
only real witness against Carl.
The
security is very tight.
There may
not be a way.
HELENA
There's always a way.
If people get
to the Pope or the President, you
can get to him.
Francisco laughs.
FRANCISCO
Careful... You're sounding like your
husband, Mrs. Ayala.
CUT TO:

Robert drives through the streets in his Cadillac DeVille.
Gordon and Castro and two other AGENTS escort Ruiz out of
the hotel and usher him into a waiting cruiser.
They pull out in a caravan and move through the streets toward
the courthouse.
The cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot.
Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the
building entrance.
As they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative
grey suit passes them going outside.
The parking lot is empty of people.
The guards at the gate
talk about something distracting.
Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.
Kneeling
down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his
jacket.
He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle,
stands and walks toward the guard gate.
Gordon, Castro, other AGENTS and Ruiz come down the rear
steps of the courthouse and walk across the street toward
the parking lot.
CASTRO
Remember when we sat on that mob
guy, that chef, for like six months?
GORDON
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in
my life.
(to Ruiz)
Why don't you develop a useful skill?
CASTRO
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful
woman.
They reach the car.
RUIZ
Would you mind if today we walked?
It's one block.
I could use the
fresh air.
OMITTED
Francisco steps from the car and mingles in with OTHER PEOPLE
walking along the sidewalk.
He follows them for few yards,
picking his moment.
He closes the distance to Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, pulling a
pistol from inside his jacket.
He takes careful aim from
twelve feet away and is about to shoot Ruiz when a bullet
hole appears in his chest.
He staggers, trying to squeeze
the trigger, Francisco fires the gun once, wildly --
A tourist screams --
Gordon and Castro and Ruiz turn --
Francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the
center of his shirt, uncertain of what has happened --
Gordon shoves Ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick
shots --
Francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street.
Citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an
NRA card coming off a bad week of day-trading --
Gordon and Castro with Ruiz beneath them scan the streets.
CASTRO
Stay here.
I'll get the car.
Castro runs down the street for the court parking lot.
Other
AGENTS are running toward Gordon and Ruiz.
Agents surround Ruiz.
Gordon walks to the body of Francisco lying face down in the
gutter.
He turns him over with his shoe and sees his face.
GORDON
(to the other agents)
I saw this guy at the courthouse.
(beat)
The car --
Gordon takes off running, yelling for Castro.
Castro has reached the car and gets in.
Gordon appears at the gate of the lot --
GORDON
(yelling)
No --
The cruiser EXPLODES.
Gordon hits the pavement.
Parts of the car begin raining
down around him.
CUT TO:
OMITTED
Javi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves.
MAN #1
Turn around.
Javi hesitates before turning.
We're on Javi as we hear the
GUNSHOT.
Javi doesn't flinch.
Manolo's body falls into the
grave.
Javi stands there, waiting.
MAN #1
You got anything you want to say?
Javi shakes his head.
Finally, another GUNSHOT.
After a
beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder.
MAN #1
Sorry about that... we had to be
sure.
They walk back to the SUV.
SOMEBODY ELSE
Are you sure you don't have anything
to tell us?
Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.
We hear a
GUNSHOT.
CUT TO:
An establishing shot of a hi-tech company within shooting
distance of the Salk Institute.
Robert drives through the streets, searching for Caroline.
He doesn't find her.
Helena walks down a nightlife street that is tawdry and stale
in the midday sun.
OMITTED
Javi goes into Mexico.
Pan over to Helena's Mercedes.
Helena pulls into a search bay.
A CUSTOMS OFFICER watches Helena lower her window.
CUSTOMS OFFICER
Please step from the car, Ma'am.
HELENA
I'm in a hurry --
CUSTOMS OFFICER
Step from the car, Ma'am.
This won't
take long from your day.
Helena gets out of her car.
Customs OFFICERS approach Helena --
OFFICER
Ma'am, we have to ask you to come
with us.
She follows them toward the Customs building.
Hundreds of DEA AGENTS, spouses, others stand around a grave
in a leafy cemetery in working class San Diego.
The funeral is over and people are filing back to the cars.
Gordon walks away from the service when he is approached by
a mourning LUCINDA CASTRO, the mother of the deceased.
MRS. CASTRO
Montel... Oh, Montel.
Gordon hugs her.
MRS. CASTRO
You know how much he cared about
you.
You do, don't you?
GORDON
Yes.
MRS. CASTRO
I know if he could have it back
somehow, he wouldn't do it differently
or have it any other way.
He
wouldn't.
He loved his job.
Another AGENT hustles toward him from the other direction,
the direction of the cars.
AGENT
Excuse me, Agent Gordon.
Mrs.
Castro.
(to Gordon)
Helena Ayala left Club Platinum in
Tijuana.
The Obregon Brothers' place.
They stopped her at the border but
she was clean.
She's in San Diego
now.
Gordon runs for his car.
CUT TO:
Helena and David are pushing out the door.
The man walking
the other way past them is Tigrillo from the Tijuana cartel.
As they pass --
HELENA
(under her breath)
Women's room, stall two.
(loud)
Should we stop for ice-cream?
DAVID
Yeah!
Tigrillo disappears into the restaurant.
As Helena pulls out of the Fun Zone parking lot, an unmarked
DEA cruiser falls in behind her.
CUT TO:
Seth and Robert walk to the car.
SETH
Man, I'm telling you.
Don't do this
vigilante thing.
Either the cops
find her or she'll call you.
I
promise.
Robert looks at him, carefully.
CUT TO:
Javier KNOCKS on the front door.
There is no answer.
The
shades are drawn.
The house is darkened.
JAVIER
(calling out)
Anna.
Anna, please.
Let me in.
He KNOCKS again.
JAVIER
Come on.
You can't stay locked in
your house all day.
Finally, the door cracks open.
Anna has clearly not been
out of the house since the last time we saw her.
Seth walks up the steps and into the building.
A beat later
he reappears and continues down the street.
Robert emerges from across the street and follows at a guarded
distance.
Seth walks along the seedy neighborhood street.
He approaches
the Villa Elaine.
He turns up the steps and disappears
inside.
Robert follows him.
It's a reprise of the earlier desert bust... a landing strip
in the middle of nowhere, a plane landing, SUV's approaching.
This time Javi is at the wheel of one of them.
News crews
are trailing behind him.
Javi and Special Agent Hughes stand next to a giant mound of
seized cocaine, the same cocaine, in fact, Javi held briefly
at the beginning.
The same teenagers from the pickup truck
have been arrested.
The news crews get everything.
JAVIER
(to the press)
This seizure is one of the largest
seizures in Mexican history...
It
represents the first bilateral effort
of the American DEA and the Mexican
I.N.C.D.
An outdoor party is going on.
Children and adults arrive
and mingle.
Caterers work the barbecue grill.
Waiters serve
food and drink on the rolling lawn.
Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends.
She looks
past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair
van is parked.
She turns back toward her guests.
Somebody
has raised a cup and everyone is CHEERING.
Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house.
AT THE FRONT GATE
Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive.
He
grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter.
He appears
drunk.
Montel follows Helena into the house.
The guests watch as the guards eject Gordon from the premises.
Near the gate David has stopped playing to watch the action.
Then he goes back to playing with his toy: a Spastic Jack
figure.
CUT TO:
Javi and his convoy of armored SUV's pull up in front of the
beautiful house where earlier he deposited Rosario, Salazar's
former mistress.
Javier opens the front door and Rosario greets him by throwing
her arms around his neck.
They disappear inside.
CUT TO:
A beautiful spring morning.
He walks down to Pennsylvania
Avenue.
He hails a cab and gets in.
The cab pulls away.
The house is dark and silent.
The van is parked up the
street.
A bank of lights CRANKS on.
Then ANOTHER and ANOTHER.
In a wider shot we see an illuminated baseball field where a
children's pickup game is in progress.
In the crowd, Javi serenely watches the game.
