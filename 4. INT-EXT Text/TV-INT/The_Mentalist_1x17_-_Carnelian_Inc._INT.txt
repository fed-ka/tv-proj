      of paper, enters via the double doors, hurries down the 
      hallway and around past the spiral stairs into the BULLPEN, 
      where he pauses long enough to realize he's in the wrong 
      place and hurries on toward Lisbon's office.

      RIGSBY, VAN PELT and CHO are working and JANE is lying on the 
      sofa, doing a Sudoku puzzle really fast.

                    He's from the AG's office.  We're 
                    catching a hot one.

                                  JANE
                    Hooray.  I am about to go mad with 
                    boredom.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Don't say hooray.  Someone's died.

                    If they have, my happiness makes no 
                      difference to them.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nor does catching their killer for 
                    that matter.

                                  JANE
                    True.  But it makes a big 
                      difference to the killer.

                    latitude 35.047 and longitude 116.49, 
                    you will see an arrogant and greedy

                    Some fool let the Governor read the 
                    damn thing.  So he talks to the AG,  
                    the AG talks to Minelli, and 
                    Minelli tells me we need to cover 
                    it, personally.  Rigsby, you're the

                    picnic lunch.

      Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt murmur agreement, 'Yeah that would 
      be a laugh.'  Lisbon sighs.

                    Someone has to stay to answer the

      Van Pelt looks glum.  She's the rookie.

      To receive Lisbon and Jane, Faulk and his execs are arranged 
      around a long table, boardroom style.  As we join them, they

                    Perhaps.  But the threat to your 
                    lives is explicit.  We'll need to 
                    arrange a security plan with the

                    Oh for God's sake, Rand.  Don't be 
                    tedious.

      Faulk gives Sobell a warning look and gesture.  She gives him 
      one right back.  They have a close relationship, obviously. 

      HOLDEN PEARY (50's) is the IT guy.  Sharp, skinny, super-rich 
      techno wizard in architect glasses and Prada.

                    I'm not letting some random lunatic 
                    disturb Carnelian.  This is a test 
                    of our strength.  David would want

      DE SHAUN BRAEMAR (30's) is African-American, ex-military. 
      Charm and a soldierly bearing mixed a little too judiciously. 
      So smooth it feels he's playing you, even when he's isn't.  
      Chief Operating Officer.

                    Yes he would.  Yes he would.   
                    David never backed down.

                    passing to interfere with your 
                    kayaking schedule?

      Braemar smiles very thinly.  Sobell laughs sardonically.  
      Faulk gives Jane a haughty glance.

                    Jane.  This week we spend here is 
                    not a vacation.  This is a test.  
                      A bonding.  A rite of passage.  
                    What we learn here about ourselves 
                    and each other is at the core of 
                      Carnelian's philosophy of success.  
                    There will come an appropriate 
                    moment to mourn our dear friend.  
                    This moment is a time to show 
                    resolve, and courage.  

      Agreement from the others, albeit grudgingly from Sobell.

                    Yes.  The saboteur didn't know 
                    which of you would die.  He felt 
                    that any one of you people here 
                    fits the bill.  Greedy and 
                    arrogant.  How do you feel about 
                    that?  Scary and weird I would

                    We want professional police

                    We control assets of over fifty

                    with the economy the way it is,

                    thousand of those men and women out

                    Two years ago, you sent this letter 
                    to the Carnelian Headquarters.
                          (reads)
                    "You greedy sonsofbitches ought to 
                    know better than to outright steal 
                    from decent American citizens like 
                    myself.  You are no better than 
                    scum in my book.  You better pay up 
                    or there's going to be 
                      consequences."  Do you recall 
                    writing that letter?

                    Like the letter says, which I wrote 
                    in a moment of anger, they stole 
                    from me.  From my family.  And then 
                    when I called them on it, they not 
                    only didn't pay me, they did their 
                    damndest to throw me in jail.

                    I used to work on the line at Grant

                      airliners.  They had a whole

                    costs?  He gets a bonus.  Fifty

                                  JESSIE SKELLING 
                    Because I'm dying.  He doesn't want 
                    to lie to someone that'll be 
                    sitting with The Almighty pretty 
                    soon.  

      Jessie puts her hair back on.

                                  JANE
                    I'm sorry.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING 
                    Stuff happens.  What are you going 
                    to do?  Cody, don't you eat that...

      Jessie jumps up and grabs some kibble from the kid's hand and 
      puts it back in the sack of dog food.  

                                  JESSIE SKELLING (CONT'D)
                          (to the kid)
                    You want something to eat, there's 
                    some peanut butter in the cupboard.

      Coming back to her seat facing Lisbon, Jessie's wig is 
      slightly askew.  Lisbon points at the wig and makes a 
      straightening gesture.  Jessie straightens it.  Lisbon nods.  
      Checks her notes.

                                  LISBON 
                    The night before last, what time 
                    did Lee come home?

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Same as every night, half past 
                    midnight.  My husband did not do 
                    this thing.  If he went to jail, 
                    who would look after the children?  
                    They'd go into care.  He wouldn't 
                    do that to me.  He wouldn't. 

                                  LISBON
                    Thanks for your time, Mrs. 
                    Skelling.

                                  JANE
                    Your wife says you wouldn't do that 
                    to her.  But I don't know.  Maybe 
                    you would if you thought you could 
                    get away with it.

                                  SKELLING
                    When I was working for Grant 
                      Aerospace, Jessie was getting the 
                    best treatment for her sickness.  
                    If I hadn't of bitched and moaned 
                    and made a nuisance of myself, I 
                    would still have a job and health 
                    insurance and Jessie would be okay.
                          (beat)
                    So why did I bitch and moan, right?  
                    Why couldn't I be quiet and keep 
                    the job?  I don't know.  I don't 
                    know.  

                                  JANE 
                    Ego and pride and vanity I expect.  

      Skelling allows Jane a sardonic smile.

                                  SKELLING
                    Something like that I guess.  
                    If I thought I could get away with 
                    it?  Yes, I would kill every last 
                    one of those bastards.  But you 
                    can't kill rich people and get away 
                    with it.  


      Jane and Lisbon head for her office.

                    Oh, can you really.

                    You're thinking Mr. Skelling is

                    That's amazing.  That's what I was 
                    thinking.  How do you do that?  Let 
                    me try.

      He stares at her, making a mystical gesture with his hand.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You're thinking Jane's right, he is 
                    innocent, and we should let him go. 

                                  LISBON
                    No.  I think you just want him to 
                    be innocent because his guilt  
                    would be too simple.  He's got 
                    motive, opportunity, and no alibi.

                                  CHO
                    Will do.

      Cho exits.  Beat.

      FADE IN:


      Faulk asleep, in moonlight.  Footsteps approach, the door 
      busts open and Jane walks in, switches on the light.

      Faulk sits up in befuddled alarm and indignation.

                                  FAULK
                    What the hell!?  What are you

                    kind under your bed. 

      Faulk's eyes go wide.

                                  FAULK
                    Oh my God.

                    No.  I don't think it has a

                    I'm pretty sure it doesn't. 
                    It's timed to go off at midnight.  So 
                    we have plenty of time yet.  If you'll 
                    get up slowly now... We don't want to

                    BOOM.

      To his credit, Faulk doesn't jump in alarm, but simply glares 
      at Jane -- like, are you nuts? -- as he exits the room fast.   
      Lisbon looks at him the same way as they exit also...

                    has to turn this to their PR

                    Yes.  If you know beforehand that 
                    Carnelian is going to be targeted 
                    by Joe Public, because you are Joe 
                    Public, betting against them on the 
                    markets would be easy money. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Couldn't be Lee Skelling then.      
                    He's got no money to bet with.

                                  JANE
                    It's not Skelling.  We know that 
                    already.

                                  LISBON
                    You know that.  We're keeping an 
                    open mind.

      Lisbon looks to Van Pelt, who nods keenly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    On it.  I'll run the market trading 
                    logs.  See if anybody made a 
                    killing, so to speak.

      Van Pelt, a little disappointed to get no laugh, starts 
      tapping rapidly at the keyboard. 

                                  LISBON
                    Any word on Skelling?

                    the parks service are all over it.  
                    We'll get him.

                                  JANE
                    Doubt it.  Skelling is in his 
                    element up there.  This is his 
                      survivalist fantasy life come true.  
                    Probably got a place all prepped.  
                    He'll go to ground like a grizzly

                    Cooby?  The ranch manager?  

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  It all fits.  This is 
                    perfect. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    It is?

                                  LISBON
                    Why would Cooby want to kill 
                    anyone?

                                  JANE 
                    Let's go ask him.

      Jane goes back to Faulk, speaks quietly so the others can't 
      hear.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Faulk, where's Jake Cooby at 
                    right this minute?

                                  FAULK
                    Jake?  In the kitchen probably. 

                                  JANE
                    Thanks.

                                  FAULK
                    Wait.  Why is Jake involved?

                                  JANE
                    The bullet that killed Nadia was 
                    special apparently.  Almost 
                    certainly belonged to Jake.

                    A special bullet?  No.  Jake?  
                    Can't be. 

                                  JANE
                    You know him quite well, don't you?

                                  FAULK
                    Sure.  Been coming here for six 
                    years.  We're friends.  He's a good 
                    man.  Salt of the earth.  This 
                    can't be.

                                  JANE
                    Forensics don't lie.  He never 
                    expressed animosity toward you?

                                  FAULK
                    No.  Never.

                                  JANE
                    Well, he must have some secret 
                    grudge against you.  In the kitchen 
                    you say... 

      Jane turns to go find Cooby.  Has a thought, turns back.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe you can help us. 

                                  FAULK
                    Of course.  Anything I can do.

                                  JANE 
                    Come with me to speak with Cooby.

                                  FAULK
                    Uh...

                                  LISBON 
                    Hold on.  I don't think that's a 
                    good idea...

                                  JANE
                    It's him Cooby's angry with.   
                    Let's use that.  Vex him a little. 
                    Open him up. 

                                  LISBON
                    Might work, but it's too risky.

                                  JANE
                    You can be right outside to shoot 
                    Cooby if things go haywire.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      45.

      Lisbon shrugs, maybe...


      Jane puts a kettle on the stove.  Jane and Faulk have just 
      this minute confronted Cooby.

                                  COOBY
                    You saying it's me?  I shot her?

                                  JANE
                    Yes, and cut Whittaker's parachute, 
                    and planted the bomb that nearly 
                    killed Mr. Faulk here. 

                                  COOBY
                    I surely did not.  Why in heck 
                    would I do all that?

                                  JANE
                    That's what we want to know.

                                  COOBY
                          (stunned)
                    Are you guys for real?  Come on.  
                    How long have you known me Mr. 
                    Faulk?

                                  FAULK
                    Why Jake?  What have I ever done to 
                    you that would justify this?  Help 
                    me understand.

      Cooby's angry now.

                                  COOBY
                    Okay, now see here, I don't know 
                    how, but you got the wrong idea 
                    about me.  

                                  JANE
                    Is that right?  Why was it one of 
                    your prize bullets that killed 
                    Nadia Sobell?    

                                  COOBY 
                    It was?

      Jane opens up the bag at his feet, and pulls out the TIME 
      BOMB that was found under Faulk's bed. 

                                  JANE 
                    And why did you make this clever 
                    thing?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      46.
      CONTINUED:4444

      Cooby's confused by how wrong Jane is.  Faulk is alarmed.  

                                  COOBY
                    Huh?  What?  Is that a bomb?

                                  JANE
                    It's your bomb, Jake.  You made it. 

                                  COOBY
                    No I didn't.  What are you smoking, 
                    man?

                                  JANE 
                    No?  Really?  This isn't your 
                    trigger?

      Jane 'inadvertently' throws the on/off switch on the device 
      as he offers it to Cooby.  The CLOCK starts ticking down 
      TWENTY SECONDS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh.

                                  COOBY
                    Is that...?

                                  FAULK
                    Oh for Godsake! 

      Jane tries to hand the device to Cooby, but Cooby's backing 
      away.  In BG the kettle is boiling.

                                  JANE
                    Okay.  Everybody needs to calm 
                    down.  No problem...

      Jane peers at the device. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Looks like it'll disarm if I pull 
                    the wire out of this red terminal 
                    here... 

                                  FAULK
                    No!!

      Faulk snatches the device out of Jane's hand and deftly pulls 
      out the correct wire to disarm rather than detonate.  The 
      bomb's safe.  Faulk puts it down on the kitchen table.

                                  FAULK (CONT'D)
                    There, you idiot.  What the hell 
                    are you playing at --

      Jane's smile stops him.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      47.

                    Ah ha, as they say.

                                  FAULK
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JANE 
                    You knew how to disarm that bomb. 
                    Because you made it.  You planted 
                    it to divert suspicion from 
                    yourself, ergo it was you that 
                    killed Whittaker and Sobell.

      Faulk affects amusement. 

                                  FAULK
                    I'm sorry to spoil your theory, but 
                    it was obvious how to disarm the 
                    bomb.

      Cooby's in BG fascinated, as if at Wimbledon.

                                  JANE
                    No it wasn't.  I bet you ninety 
                    percent of people would think 
                    pulling this wire here would be the 
                    right thing to do.

      He pulls the wire out of the red terminal and Faulk recoils 
      and screams... 

                                  FAULK
                    Noooo!

      Nothing happens.  

                                  JANE
                    The bomb squad took the explosive 
                    out.  This is Playdoh.  And you are 
                      a wretched, scheming, cold-hearted 
                    murderer.  

      Faulk uncurls from an ignominious crouch, conscious he has 
      truly blown his cover now; morally if not legally.

                                  FAULK
                    You're mad.

      Jane turns off the boiling kettle.

                                  JANE 
                    Mr. Cooby, where do you keep the 
                    tea?

      Cooby points.  Jane finds tea bags.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      48.

                    to come in?

      Cooby exits.  Jane makes his cup of tea.  Faulk's in an 
      unfamiliar game, playing defense.

                                  FAULK
                    You have no legal proof whatsoever.

                                  JANE 
                    Oh legal proof will be found no 
                    doubt.  But personally, I don't 
                    need it.  I just like to know I'm 
                    right.  

      Jane sips at his tea, content.  Lisbon enters.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Agent Lisbon, arrest this man.

                                  FAULK
                    This is absurd!

      Lisbon looks at Jane deadpan, waiting.

                                  JANE
                    Arrest this man, please.

      Satisfied, Lisbon takes her cuffs out.


      Faulk sits.  Jane paces.

                                  JANE
                    I knew it was you as soon as the 
                    bomb under your bed failed to go 
                    off.  Too clever, Randy.  Too 
                    clever. 

                                  FAULK
                    Don't call me Randy.

      Cho enters, sits opposite Faulk, puts a file on the table.  
      Faulk looks at it.

                                  JANE
                    But why would you want to randomly 
                    kill one of your executives?  
                    Didn't make sense.  Then Sobell was 
                    shot and I saw your game, Randy. 

                                  FAULK
                    That's very childish.

                      Whittaker's death was merely 
                      camouflage to disguise Sobell's 
                    death.  She's the one you needed

                                  FAULK
                    I won't say anything until my 
                    lawyer arrives, but suffice to say, 
                    you have no proof.  Nothing.

                                  JANE
                    Question is, what did Sobell have 
                    on you?  What was she going to do?

                    That was a rhetorical question.  We 
                    know everything we need to now.

      Cho opens the file.  Reads.

                    This is an affidavit from Nadia

                    secretly negotiating to join KBT, 
                    your number one rival.  She was 
                    also drafting a sexual harassment 
                    suit against you to coincide with 
                    her departure.  That's why she was 
                    shorting Carnelian stock.  And 
                    that's why you needed to kill her.

                    Because nobody gets on top of 
                    Randall Faulk, do they?  Nobody. 

                                  FAULK
                    Where's my lawyer?

                                  JANE 
                    I have to tell you, the whole Joe 
                    Public ruse was genius.  I couldn't 
                    see how it would profit you to 
                    attack your own company.  But you, 
                    you have vision.  Carnelian reborn 
                    and rebranded.  Everybody loves a 
                    comeback.  Everybody loves 
                      redemption. 

                                  FAULK
                    You have nothing.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      50.
      CONTINUED: (2)4545

                                  CHO
                    We have enough to rip you to 
                    pieces.

                                  JANE
                    And you know it.  Before your 
                    lawyer arrives and ties everybody's 
                    hands, let's make a deal.

      Beat.

                                  FAULK
                    I'm listening.

                                  JANE
                    We'll call Whittaker manslaughter 
                    one, we'll forget about the bomb, 
                    and we won't ask for the death 
                    penalty.    

      This isn't procedure and Cho's about to speak, but Jane gives 
      him a glance asking for forbearance.  Faulk looks bleak.

                                  FAULK
                    In exchange for what?


      On the kitchen table is a RIPPED OPEN ENVELOPE AND A 
      CARNELIAN CHECK.  It's made out to the Skellings in the sum 
      of five hundred grand, and it's signed by Randall Faulk.  Lee 
      and Jessie Skelling do a sort of hug/slow dance. 

      Their raggedy ass kids sit at the kitchen table beaming, at 
      the novel sight of Mom and Dad happy for the first time in 
      who knows how long.  

                                                                        FADE OUT. 


                                        THE END
