      Guests, including Mina, Harker, and Lucy -- all carrying 
      light bulbs -- have gathered around Grayson. Gas lamps cast a 
      warm,  period  glow across everything.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Three months ago, I arrived in 
                    London with some of the world s 
                    best scientists. Men with a vision 
                    of the future. Men determined, like 
                    me, to see that vision become 
                    reality. This is what Grayson 
                    Energy Company is about.

                    Imagine a London sky free of smoke 
                    from coal-burning furnaces. Imagine 
                    a London where 300,000 tons of 
                    manure no longer daily poisons the 
                    air and gets washed into the 
                    Thames. Imagine a London where 
                    people don't quake after sundown 
                    for fear of what lurks out there in 
                    the dark. 

      The lamps all go out at once, leaving the terrace almost 
      completely dark. Guests react with murmurs of unease and 
      controlled panic to the theatricality.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    What Edison dismissed as fantasy, 
                    what Tesla failed to bring to 
                    fruition, I give you tonight. 

      In the garden below, sparks begin to spit. Then blue 
      electricity crackles and arcs between the arms of a 
      magnificent MACHINE that now thrums with energy.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    I give to you... 

      Renfield has appeared beside him holding a light bulb the 
      size of a fish bowl. Grayson takes the giant bulb and lifts 
      it over his head as it BEGINS TO GLOW.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Wireless electrical transmission!

      The guests realize their bulbs are glowing now, too. Some 
      yelp in surprise. A few drop theirs, afraid they ll be 
      burned. The eyes of others boggle. 

      A WIDER SHOT reveals that the once-dark terrace and yard are 
      now aglow, brightly lit by all those light bulbs.

      Mina beams with wonder at hers. Lucy ignores hers, making 
      eyes with a SPANISH COUNT. Harker, unimpressed, speaks up--

                                  HARKER
                      A conjurer s trick, nothing more!

      Mina shrinks with embarrassment at his rudeness. Grayson, 
      however, reacts as if accustomed to hecklers.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Not at all, my friend. It s 
                    science.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

      CONTINUED:

                                  MINA
                          (privately to Harker)
                    And it s brilliant.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (having heard her whisper)
                    Yes, ma am, it is.

      Mina reacts to that, surprised he heard her at such a 
      distance. He regards her for another beat before returning 
      his attention to the rest of his guests--

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    What I'm talking about is free 
                      electricity -- free for all! The 
                    20th Century is upon us, my 
                    friends. The future -- bright, full 
                    of promise -- waits for us! 

      FIREWORKS LAUNCH INTO THE SKY. The crowd, wowed, applaud.

      Grayson accepts the adulation with a great smile, even as his 
      eyes search out Mina again.

      Mina touches her temple, affected somehow by the gaze. 

      Lord Davenport looks at his bulb, worried. Sir Clive and Lord 
      Laurent appear as concerned.

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    Do you think it s possible?

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    If it is, decades of careful 
                    planning will be undone.

      Mina, Harker, and Lucy walk past these men. Mina looks dizzy 
      now, a little wobbly on her feet.

                                  HARKER
                    What is it, Mina? 

                                  LUCY
                    Are you flustered? I am. I don t 
                    usually go for Americans, but I 
                    think I ll make an exception.

                                  HARKER
                    Oh, Lucy, shut up already.

      Lucy stomps huffily off, shifting her attention to the 
      Spanish count now passing by. Harker guides Mina toward a 
      bench and sits with her.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    Here, sit. 

                                  MINA
                    I don t know what came over me. 
                    Like someone walked over my grave.

      Harker rubs her hand lovingly. Mina, meanwhile, lets her gaze 
      drift toward Grayson still enjoying the applause.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We move through thick, dark smoke and emerge over a foggy 
      Victorian London. Continue over the Thames...the Houses of 
      Parliament...a CARRIAGE moving along a lonely street.


      Sir Clive, having just climbed out of his carriage, looks up 
      at the sky (we don't see what he sees) and hisses the last 
      word of Mina s sentence--

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    Bats.

      FROM ABOVE: As Sir Clive turns toward his front door, our 
      flying POV dives out of the sky toward him. 

      Sir Clive reaches for the door knob when an animal s SNARL 
      stops him in his tracks. He slowly turns, nervous.

      A BLACK WOLF with YELLOW-RED EYES, its fangs bared, has 
      appeared on the sidewalk. 

      He spins, reaching for the door knob--

      Suddenly, the wolf bounds forward, leaps off lower steps, and 
      tackles Sir Clive so quickly that we barely see the impact.

      We hear only SNARLING, GNASHING, RIPPING, and SIR CLIVE S 
      CRIES. Then -- SPLAT! -- blood splashes across the door.

                                            ACT 2

      FADE IN:


      A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER prepares a tripod-mounted Kodak to 
      snap a pic. LONDONERS gather around a police cordon, trying 
      to get a peek even as BOBBIES wave them back.

      Harker, still wearing his tux from the party, bow tie 
      removed, stands at the back of the crowd. He moves around the 
        outside...until he finds himself stopped by a BOBBIE s baton.

                                  HARKER
                    Evening, Frank. How s the wife?

                                  BOBBIE
                    She s moved in with me brother now.

                                  HARKER
                      Ahh...well, that will make 
                    Christmas a bit awkward, won t it?

      He holds up a folded bank note, as if this were routine. The 
      bobbie looks right and left, then reaches for the bill--

      MOMENTS LATER, Harker crouches next to mangled hedges, 
      studying something out of frame. His shoe, he realizes, has 
      stepped in blood and so he scoots back -- only to bump into 
      INSPECTOR PETTIGREW (40). Pettigrew, an overly serious man 
      who shares history with Harker, is scowling disapprovingly.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    Too late. I m already here, Jim. 
                    Now be a good mate and tell me 
                    where the rest of this poor sod is.

      Pettigrew sighs. He wants to argue, but is short on energy.

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW
                    There.

      He points to a hedge. A FOOT STICKS OUT OF THE TOP OF IT. 

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW (CONT D)
                    And over there.

      A YOUNG BOBBIE stands from behind the row of greenery with 
      Sir Clive s ARM in hand.

                                  YOUNG BOBBIE
                    I found  is other arm!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

      CONTINUED:

      A WILD DOG jumps up out of nowhere and clamps its jaws on the 
      arm s hand. Begins fighting the bobbie for the appendage. 

                                  YOUNG BOBBIE (CONT D)
                    Let it go, you filthy mongrel!

      A GENTLEWOMAN in the crowd feints at this.

      The young bobbie kicks the dog. It yelps and runs off. 

                                  HARKER
                    Did his wife do it? Tell me she 
                    caught him with a chambermaid and 
                    took an axe to him.

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW
                    No, it wasn t his wife. And it 
                    wasn t a lover, husband of a lover, 
                    wife of a lover, lover of a lover, 
                    or a love child, if that s what 
                    you re asking. 

                                  HARKER
                    Then what happened?

      CUT TO AN ANGLE IN THE CROWD. Someone watches as Pettigrew 
      pulls Harker aside.

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW
                    It was a wolf. Are you happy now?

      BACK TO HARKER AND PETTIGREW. Harker is flummoxed.

                                  HARKER
                    A wolf?

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW
                    That s what witnesses said.

                                  HARKER
                    But London doesn t have any wolves.

      BACK TO THE ANGLE IN THE CROWD.

                                  INSPECTOR PETTIGREW
                    We think it might have escaped from 
                    the zoo. I have Donaghy over there 
                    now, looking into it. 
                          (beat)
                    Don t print this, Harker. You ll 
                    scare the daylights out of people.

      BACK TO HARKER, who looks at Pettigrew like he s an idiot.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HARKER
                    What do you mean,  Don t print 
                    this ? Of course I m going to print 
                    this. There s a bleeding wolf on 
                    the loose. 

      BACK TO THE ANGLE IN THE CROWD. REVERSE to reveal the harsh, 
      Teutonic face of KRUGER (40s). He wears a thigh-length 
      leather jacket cinched at the waist with a beaded African 
      belt. He turns to leave -- and bumps into a man we ll later 
      learn is PROFESSOR ABRAHAM VAN HELSING (50; Dutch accent; 
      lined face full of character).

                                  VAN HELSING
                    Pardon me.

      Kruger, not one for manners, keeps moving. Van Helsing turns 
      to watch him go. Off his face--

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Renfield stands at the garage door, waiting impatiently with 
      his note pad in hand. Grayson brakes just in front of him.

                                  RENFIELD
                    Sir, your dinner appointment.

      As Grayson and Harker disembark from the Benz Velo--

                                  HARKER
                    I ve taken too much of your time.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Nonsense. We can continue this at 
                    the Ascot Races tomorrow, if you d 
                    like. You can even bring your Mina.

      Harker tries not to look excited.

                                  HARKER
                    That would be wonderful.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON
                    We ll get to know each other 
                    better. I may even be able to help 
                    you get things on the right track.

      Harker, thrilled by the prospect of such a friendship, moves 
      away as Grayson s thoughts shift to heavier matters.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The crime scene has long been cleaned up. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jockeys race their horses along a track beneath a slate-grey 
      sky. The leader thunders across the finish line.


      The crowd erupts into cheers and jeers below! Grayson, 
      wearing rose-colored sunglasses, laughs from frustration. He 
      tears up his bet slips and pitches them off the balcony.

      In the next box over, seated with friends, is the EARL OF 
      MARLAND (late-40s; a likeable sort whose face we might 
      recognize from Grayson s photographs). He boasts--

                                  EARL OF MARLAND
                    I told you not to bet against my 
                    Hyperion Dream, Grayson!

      Grayson, the only person in his box, waves a program at 
      Marland, laughing. These are rich men acting rich.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll give you 5,000 pounds for him!

                                  EARL OF MARLAND
                    He s only worth 3,000, but 10,000 
                    wouldn t be enough!

      Grayson lets his sunglasses slide down on his nose, looking 
      at Marland with unobstructed eyes. Grins slightly.

                                    GRAYSON
                    What about 20,000?

      Marland s cheer dissipates. Is Grayson serious? 

                                  EARL OF MARLAND
                    I love that horse too much to part 
                    for something as petty as money.

                                    GRAYSON
                    You should never admit to such 
                    things, John. Attachments could be 
                    seen as weaknesses.

      He senses something odd and turns -- to find Mina and Harker 
      standing in the doorway, having just arrived. He removes his 
      sunglasses and brandishes a great, winning smile.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Harker! It s so good of you to 
                    come.

      He greets Harker with a firm hand shake.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    And this exquisite creature must be 
                    Mina. 

      As he reaches for Mina s hand, TIME SLOWS DOWN again for just 
      a moment. Their fingers touch, then the hands gently clasp. 

                                  MINA
                    We appreciate the invitation, Mr. 
                    Grayson.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Allan, please. Come, come, join me.
                          (waves them in)
                    Your beau and I had the most 
                      stimulating chat yesterday. He s a 
                    very smart man, Mina. There are 
                    great things ahead for him. 

                                  MINA
                    I ve always thought so.

      Grayson indicates that she take the seat beside him. Mina 
      instead sits across from him and Harker beside him.

                                  HARKER
                    Mina, as I told you, is a great 
                    admirer of yours.

                                    GRAYSON
                      I understand you have a keen mind. 
                    Full of questions.

                                  MINA
                    There are, I think, mysteries in 
                    this world that require our 
                      attention. 

      Grayson narrows his eyes, studying her. Smiles.

                                    GRAYSON
                    And you wish to be the one to solve 
                    them.

      Mina looks quizzically at Harker.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HARKER
                    Don t look at me. He has a talent 
                      for...reading people.

      Mina returns her gaze to Grayson.

                                  MINA
                    I would not presume.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Oh, but you should.

      As Mina reacts with silent pleasure at this suggestion--

                                  HARKER
                    Look, Mina, Edelweisses.

      On the table between them, a vase of EDELWEISSES FLOWERS. 
      There are more vases of them around the box.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    They re her favorite.

                                    GRAYSON
                    What an odd coincidence, then. I 
                    specially requested them.

      As Mina draws a stem and smells the flower, Grayson watches 
      her carefully.

                                  MINA
                    I ve never met anyone else who 
                    cared for them.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Someone very dear to me adored 
                    them. She was buried beneath a 
                    blanket of them.

                                  MINA
                    Oh. I m sorry.

      Grayson s eyes, we realize, are locked on hers. Harker 
      notices and shifts uncomfortably.

                                  HARKER
                    Should we continue the interview?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Actually, I was just going to take 
                    a walk down to the paddock. 
                          (to Mina)
                    Would you care to join me?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

      CONTINUED:

      Mina looks at Harker: what does he think? Harker nods 
      uneasily, unwilling to jeopardize his gains with Grayson.

                                  MINA
                    I would love to.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Another race concludes. Instantaneous applause. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      As horses cool down after their races, Grayson and Mina 
      wander. She can t help keep glancing at the sunglasses, hat, 
      and gloves he wears. 

      They stop on opposite sides of a mare. Mina seems hesitant.

                                    GRAYSON
                    You want to ask me something.

                                  MINA
                    Is it that obvious? 

      They begin stroking the mare, moving around it like moons as 
      their conversation continues. Their eyes stay locked on one 
      another unless noted. Grayson answers her unspoken question--

                                    GRAYSON
                    She was my wife.

                                  MINA
                    I didn t mean to pry.
                          (beat, apologetically)
                    Of course I did.

      Grayson smiles, but thoughts of the past clearly haunt him.

                                  MINA (CONT D)
                    What happened to her?

                                    GRAYSON
                    It wasn t a natural end, if that s 
                    what you mean.

                                  MINA
                    Was she...?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                                    GRAYSON
                    In a fire. Some...I suppose you d 
                    call them professional colleagues 
                    disagreed with the way I was 
                      conducting my business.

                                  MINA
                          (horrified)
                    They murdered her to make a point?

                                    GRAYSON
                    For a long time, I stopped thinking 
                    about her. I had to, to survive. 
                    But as of late... 
                          (looks at Mina)
                    ...I can t get her off my mind.

      An awkward silence overtakes them. Then--

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Let s speak of less gloomy things.   
                    How did you and Harker meet?

      At the mention of Harker, Mina brightens.

                                  MINA
                    His father worked at the asylum 
                    with my father. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Ah. Harker s father was a doctor?

                                  MINA
                    No. A, uh, custodian.

                                    GRAYSON
                    There is no shame in that. 
                          (eyes narrow)
                    You love him dearly, I can see it. 

      Mina nods. There s something else, though...

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    But there s something wrong.

                                  MINA
                    Not with him.

                                    GRAYSON
                    With you. You re missing something.

                                  MINA
                    I...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

      CONTINUED:

      Grayson locks his eyes on her. His hand inches toward hers.

                                  MINA (CONT D)
                    I don t know why I m discussing 
                    this with you. We hardly know...

      She can t find the right words. His finger is almost touching 
      hers. Her fingers splay slightly at the thought.

      But then Mina recovers, shaking her head. Breaking eye 
      contact. She steps quickly back from the horse.

                                  MINA (CONT D)
                    I must go.

      Grayson watches her hurry off, trying not to look anguished.

      IN A DISTANT CORNER OF THE PADDOCK, Harker has been watching 
      this exchange. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      TWO DRIVERS watch Lady Jayne s carriage bounce and rock, 
      trying to keep straight faces.

      Harker helps Mina down from a cab and leads her to the top of 
      the stoop. There s an awkward tension between them. He s 
      clearly nervous, his free hand stuffed into his pants pocket.

      Mina notices this. Wanting to assuage his unease, she leans 
      forward and gives him a gentle kiss on the cheek.

                                  HARKER
                    Grayson is impressive, don t you 
                    think? He s, uh, quite the man.

                                  MINA
                          (laughs lightly)
                    You haven t had a reason to be 
                    jealous since William Bates. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                          (surprised)
                    You had feelings for William Bates?

                                  MINA
                    I was ten, Jonathan.

                          (feigning insecurity)
                    Still.

      Mina laughs. His hand still fidgets in his pocket. What s in 
      there? Mina, unable to wait any longer, opens the door. 

                                  MINA
                    Good night, my love.

      When the door is shut behind her, Harker curses himself 
      inaudibly. He pulls a RING BOX out of his pocket -- he was 
      trying to propose, but couldn t work up the balls to do it! 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A BLACK WOLF -- the same that attacked Sir Clive -- moves 
      gracefully along the edge of a roof. It s stalking a carriage 
      below that stops outside a beautiful house. Lord Davenport 
      climbs from it, looking around.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      In the dark yard, the wolf watches, through a window, as Lord 
      Davenport kisses Lord Laurent.

      THWIPP! An ARROW plunges into the wolf s haunch. The wolf 
      yelps loudly and, inside, Davenport and Laurent spin, looking 
      out the window for the sound. As they close the curtains--

      KRUGER leaps over bushes with a crossbow in hand. Across the 
      yard, a NAKED MAN flees into shrubbery and shadows. Kruger 
      tosses the crossbow away and gives chase.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kruger climbs onto the rooftop, using a drain as a ladder. He 
      draws a long knife, preparing for close-quarters combat. 

      Suddenly, the shadowy naked man leaps upon Kruger and, 
      spinning him around, flings him ten feet through the air -- 
      into a chimney that partly crumbles from the impact.

      The naked man limps forward, the crossbow bolt sticking out 
      of his hip, wisps of smoke rising from the wound. 

      Kruger, crawling to his feet, sneers--

                                  KRUGER
                    I dipped the arrowhead in holy 
                    water. I hope it burns, demon.

      And now we see the wincing face of the naked man: it s 
      GRAYSON. He rips the bolt from his hip and flings it away.

      Kruger, with a gunslinger s speed, throws open his coat and 
      grabs a HAND AXE hanging from his hip. In an instant, he s 
      drawing back his arm. As that arm snaps forward, the axe 
      flies from it. We follow it as it flips, end over end, in 
        SLOW-MOTION, right at Grayson s head--

      FADE IN:


      Grayson watches as the axe -- still flipping in SLOW-MOTION --
      flies toward his head.

      Suddenly, Grayson s mouth snaps open -- FOUR FANGS bared -- 
      and his eyes TURN RED. With a burst of supernatural speed, he 
      sidesteps the weapon s path and spins around to attack--

      Only to find Kruger...gone? Kruger anticipated Grayson s 
      attack -- and now plunges a KNIFE into Grayson s lower back. 

      Grayson spins around, arms swinging blindly, as Kruger lunges 
      forward again, a LARGE CROSS in his hand. The cross BURNS 
      INTO GRAYSON S CHEST, sending him stumbling to the ground.

                                  KRUGER
                    You did not think I would make it 
                    easy on you, did you? 

      He kicks Grayson in the ribs, then stomps on the hilt of the 
      knife sticking out of Grayson s back -- driving it deeper. 
      Grayson cries out in agony. Kruger pulls a WOODEN STAKE now.

                                  KRUGER (CONT D)
                    Burn in hell!

      LOW ANGLE on Grayson s anguished face. Above him Kruger lifts 
      the stake high, preparing to drive it into Grayson s heart.

      Kruger brings the stake down -- except, this time, it s 
      Grayson who s vanished. Just as Kruger realizes he s 
      overestimated his victory, FANGS PLUNGE INTO HIS NECK!

      Grayson, jaws now clamped around Kruger s carotid, slams 
      Kruger against the wall and then to the ground. Kruger s 
      struggle lasts but a few moments before life begins to fade.

      OVERHEAD: Sated, Grayson s head snaps back now. SLOW MOTION 
      on splatters of blood flicking from his fangs up at us.

      Kruger, dying, delirious from blood loss, watches Grayson 
      turn to limp away. That s when he sees the tattoo of THE 
      ORDER OF THE DRAGON S STANDARD on Grayson s shoulder blade.

                                  KRUGER (CONT D)
                    You are...one of us?

      Grayson stops, looks back. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON
                    A long time ago. 

                                  KRUGER
                          (realizing)
                    You are...the Fell one. 
                          (horror in his eyes)
                    You are Dracula.

      Grayson doesn t disagree.

                                  KRUGER (CONT D)
                    But...we thought...you were dead. 

      Grayson crouches beside Kruger. After centuries of killing, 
      he still finds death thrilling, intoxicating. His identity 
      revealed, he speaks in THE ROMANIAN ACCENT OF HIS BIRTH--

                                    GRAYSON
                    Your heartbeat is slowing, I can 
                    hear it. You ll be dead within 
                    moments. Before you go: know that I 
                    am going to destroy everything you 
                    hold dear. The Order, all that it 
                    stands for, will be trampled to 
                    dust and forgotten by history. 
                    Nothing but I will remain.

      If Kruger understands, we ll never know. His head lolls 
      forward. Grayson limps off, having only narrowly survived.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Harker, surrounded by fog, prepares to pitch another pebble 
      when the window opens and Mina leans out.

                                  MINA
                    Jonathan, my father--

                                  HARKER
                    Is dreaming thanks to his laudanum.

      MOMENTS LATER, Mina emerges from a door dressed in a thin 
      robe that sufficiently, but not wholly hides her body.

                                  MINA
                    What are you doing here?

      Harker takes her hands. Looks into her eyes, uncertain.

                                  MINA (CONT D)
                    I would say yes to anything you 
                    asked of me.

      She leans forward and kisses him softly, tenderly. He closes 
      his eyes as their lips meet, struggling for courage.

                                  HARKER
                      I realized something yesterday. I 
                    envy Grayson. 

                                  MINA
                    Grayson?

      Something in her eyes speaks to how confused her thoughts 
      about Grayson are. 

                                  HARKER
                    He s everything I want to be. He 
                    has everything I want. Almost. He 
                    doesn t have you, Mina. I do.

                                  MINA
                    I told you, you have no reason to 
                    be jealous.

      Harker looks less convinced of that.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    56.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HARKER
                    I can t give you what you deserve, 
                    not immediately. But one day soon 
                    you ll have everything a woman 
                    could dream possible, I promise you 
                    that. I ll find a way.

                                  MINA
                    All I ve ever wanted is you.

      Harker wipes tears from her cheeks with his thumbs.

                                  HARKER
                    Then marry me, Mina Murray. Before 
                    God, marry me.

      Mina begins sobbing. She can t believe this is happening.

                                  MINA
                    Yes, Jonathan. Yes!

      Harker grabs and kisses her with passion. Passion she has 
      never known from him. Mina can t help but meet it with the 
      same. 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
