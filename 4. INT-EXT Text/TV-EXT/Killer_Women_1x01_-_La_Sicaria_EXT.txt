      quickly crosses toward Peacock Alley; men she passes 
      dislocate their necks trying to cop a glance.  And why not?  
      It s not everyday that 36-24-36 in a skin-tight floral dress 
      walks right on by past the Buckhornsaloon, Riverwalk, 
        courthouse...



      A foot in red heels kicks a can on a string tied to the back 
      of a ROLLS ROYCE. PAN UP TO the car s back window.  On it the 
      words  JUST MARRIED  are soaped. The Hot Latinamoves past 
      the wedding detritus and heads toward the church. Rather than 
      enter, she looks at the bell tower.      KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/143.

      Several armed wedding guests fire at a beat up Camaroas it 
      speeds away.  CLOSE ON...redhigh heels left behind as 
      bullets blow out the car s rear window.



      Molly blasts past traffic.  She handles the truck expertly, 
      leans on the horn, careens around slow moving traffic as she 
      reaches behind the seat for a T-shirt and her ballistic vest.  
      Still steering with one hand, Molly changes out of the salon 
      smock, grabs a double rig gun belt and straps on a SIG239 as 
      she simultaneously retrieves a Bushmaster M-4assault rifle
      from a mount behind her head.

                    Car headed north on I-35.  

      Molly slams on the brakes and spins the car around to head in 
      the opposite direction.  A trained tactical driver, she 
      avoids oncoming cars.



      SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT (SAPD) squad cars are in hot 
      pursuit of the Camaro.  Ahead, TWO UNITS direct oncoming 
      traffic toward an OFF RAMP. Choppers support from the air.



      Molly approaches the highway from a parallel country road.  
      She drives over a grassy embankment and enters...    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/146.



      The Tahoe threads through traffic and clips the Camaro.  The 
      beat up car spins and hits the center divider before rolling 
      to a stop...

                    SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.  SHOW ME YOUR 
                      HANDS!

      The tension is palpable.  SAPD vehicles arrive on the scene, 
      flanking Molly from behind.  From inside the Camaro, no 
      movement and then... the door opens.  A leg hits the ground.  
      Tennis sneakers and jeans as... a 30 year old HISPANIC MAN 
      gets out of the car.  ANGLE ON Molly.  WTF?

      Fifty SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT (SAPD) squad cars are 
      lined up; individual witnesses are being rushed into back 
      seats for transport to Police Headquarters. Fire trucks and 
      EMS vehicles block the entrance to the church.  Press vans 
      already have satellite feed.  

                                    REPORTER
                      Reports suggest a San Antonio

                    shot.  Possibly killed.

      Molly, now in a cowboy hat with a double gun belt holstered
      around her waist, moves toward the crime scene perimeter.

                                    POLICE OFFICER
                      Ma am, you cannot come in here--

      Molly doesn t even slow down.  She simply moves aside her 
        windbreaker to reveal HER BADGE. The cop stutters...

                                    POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    My apologies.  Ma am.  

      Molly smiles faintly as she blows past the perimeter and 
      heads for the church.  Two words printed on the back of her 
        windbreakerexplain the officer s reaction: TEXAS RANGER.  
      And for them, the world still parts.

                    Do you believe him?



      Seasoned, the SWAT team blends with the shadows.  From

      invisible, they move along the upper deck.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1414.

      TWO SWAT AGENTS tap lightly on the door to the room next to

      quickly out.  The family is escorted down the stairs.

      BAM. Two SWAT members kick down the door and drop a flash 
      bang grenade. KABOOM. It explodes. OFF blinding light...



      Molly et al listen as men shout.  GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

      Martina is led out of police headquarters in handcuffs toward 
      a squad car that will take her to jail.  Reporters take video 
      and stills of Martina sPerp Walk as Salazar steps forthto 
      the spotlight. Proud. Molly passes the Lieutenant and in 
      total contrast, avoids the press.  She heads toward a TALL 
      MAN in a jacket, tie, Stetsonand cincopeso badge. He leans 
      against a grey Tahoe.

      Salazar waves.  He heads back into headquarters as Molly 
      reaches RANGER LIEUTENANT, LUIS ZEA, Hispanic and 50s. 
      Without her asking, Luis hands Molly a burrito.

      Molly changes from her evening gown into Ranger gear between 
      the two doors of the Tahoein the parking lot. INTERCUT TO 
      Luis at DPS.Inside the truck. An arsenal of Ranger gear.

                                    MOLLY
                      I think Alvarezis working for the 
                    Nuevo Laredo cartel.  

                                    LUIS
                    They hire hitmen. Not little girls.

                                    MOLLY
                    Not this time.  They chose Alvarez
                      because of her proximity to the 
                    groom and they knew they could sell 
                    this as a crime of passion.

      Molly opens the gun vault, inside, bullets and... clean 
      socks.

                                    LUIS
                    Why does Alvarezgo along with it?

                                    MOLLY
                      I don t know. They ve got something 
                    on her. Something that terrifies 
                    her.

                                    LUIS
                    More than the death penalty?

                                    MOLLY
                      I have no idea why she is so 
                      afraid, but she s served her 
                      purpose.  If we don t get 
                      protection on her. Now. She s dead.

      Molly leaps into the Tahoe.  Hair back, work gear on.

                                    LUIS
                    If you re wrong in this--

                                    MOLLY
                    Yeah, I know.  I m a lone Ranger.

      Molly drives through a barrio just outside the city.  Small 
      shacks, tenement housing. Men on old porches. Watching.  
      Strangers are noticed here.  Especially white ones.

                    down a major ring.  It s a huge win

                      Justice doesn t motivate me into 
                      Mexico.  Neither does your intel.

      Dan slides out of the booth.  Their eyes meet.

                                    MOLLY
                      There s a good chance Alvarez s
                      mother and daughter will be killed 
                      because I didn t let the case close  
                    with SAPD.  I can t forgive myself, 
                    Dan.  I m asking for your help.

      Dan studies her face.  So much anguish in it. Then...

                                  DAN
                    If we go, we go alone. I m not 
                      risking agency assets for this. I

                                    MOLLY
                      I understand.

      Road signs delineate America from Mexico. Dan and Molly cross 
      in silence into Nuevo Laredo.  The street lights switch from 
      bright fluorescent in Laredo to a dim yellow in Nuevo. 



      Dark and danger behind every curtained window.As if on cue, 
      a garage door suddenly opens and Dan drives into a warehouse.  
      In an instant the door closes.  Darkness.     KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1443.



        Nightprovides no warmth to what is basically hell on earth.  
      Dan and Molly are crouched behind a concrete wall in silence.  
      Nearby,tin shacks and utter silence. Nothing moves. A single 
      bulb hangs off a line. Dan watches the distance through night 
        binoculars, then, the sound of dogs barking.  

                                  DAN
                    We ve got movement.

      In the distance, a stream of moving headlights moving away 
      from the barrio.  Dan motions and Molly is on the move.

      Dan and Molly approach the back of a plywood shack. Stooping, 
      Mollyuses a small scope to peer between the sidingwhile Dan 
      uses a silent drill to remove the hinges of a back door.  



      Molly motions.  She has a visual.  FOUR.  Dan nods.  He 
      silently lifts the door off it s hinges and before a 
      floorboard can creek, Molly and Dan are inside.      KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1445.



      Right on plan, Pedro drives through an abandoned rodeo ring 
      toward the shack. He slams to a stop as Molly forces 
      Martina s mother and daughter down behind the front seatof a 
      beat to shitToyota. Dan races to the passenger seat just as
      Kaboom. A shot explodes from a shot gun across the street and 
      Pedro goes down.  Blood seeps into the ground as Dan opens 
      fire and kills the SHOOTER.      KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1446.


      Within seconds, all hell breaks lose as people from the

      Molly leaps onto the backseat to take cover over the 
        grandmother and child as Dan slams the car into gear and 
      speeds backwards.  Bullets blow out the windows.  Molly 
      continues to fire.  A tire is hit. The car fishtails out of 
      control, Dan hits the brakes and spins it around, clipping 
      the side of a propane tank and knocking it off its legs. The 
      tank roles into the center of the street as Molly takes aim.  
      She fires.

      Molly walks up the front steps.  Stetsonand gun holster on.



      Billy exits, beer in hand. In the distance, Molly leans 
      against a fence. Big Boy grazes. 



      Billy joins Molly.  He too leans against the fence.  A 
      posture he assumed many times while they were growing up.
