A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
Vintage.
Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
two empty chairs.
The silence is accentuated by the
merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
the room.
Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
takes his chair.
SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS

DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing
(a)
businessman, wearing full sideburns.
He stares stonily at the last empty
chair, then at Filby with annoyance.
ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,
(b)
impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
lifting his glass of whiskey.
WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen
(c)
black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
his Havana.
Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair
(d)
as
Hillyer glances impatiently at his
(e)
watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
it shut and glares at:
EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT

Conspicuously unoccupied.
GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT

Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
YELLOW CHIMES.
Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
ment.
GROUPSHOT
7
The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
ETC. FADE away.
Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
arm of his leather chair.
DR. HILLYER
I say, this is outright rude of the man!
FILBEY
He's undoubtedly been detained.
That's
all.
Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
thing but is interrupted by
KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
his tight lips)
This is such a confounded waste of
time!
If he's not coming, I've any
number of more important things to do.
All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
door quietly behind her.
With an envelope in her
hand she stands there, hesitating.
DR. HILLYER
Speak up -- what is it, woman?
She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
to Filby and hands him the open envelope.
He
takes his time in extracting the note.
BRIDEWELL
Well...are we or are we not invited
to dinner?
FILBY (reading)
Apparently we are.
(to Mrs. Watchett)
How long has he been gone?
MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
him lately.
He never leaves the
laboratory and comes out only to
nibble at his meals...but he did tell
me days ago about dinner tonight and
left these instructions.
(pointing to note)
FILBY
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.
A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
with that she retreats toward the door.
DR. HILLYER (indicating the
note)
What does it say, Filby?
What's
wrong?
FILBY
Nothing really. - George merely says
that if he is not here by eight we're
to begin without him.
Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
hurriedly.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
open and turns around.
MRS. WATCHETT
Dinner is served, gentlemen!
BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
down)
First sensible thing I've heard all
evening.
He rises and starts for the dining room.
The others
follow.
FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT

As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.
FILBY
This is peculiar.
He is usually very
prompt, precise and punctual.
DR. HILLYER
He's making fools of us by inviting
us here and then not showing up.
It's not the behavior of a gentleman.
KEMP
To say nothing of the waste of
time.
DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
To say nothing of the waste of
time.
Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
others settle down.
This time the chair at the head
of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.
BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
his glass)
One thing I will say for George, he
keeps the best cellar in the south of
England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
finest cook in the world. - I think
I'll drink to that!
The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
All look in the direction of another door across
the room.
THE DOOR - FULL SHOT
9
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
men have come to their feet.
Clutching Filby's arm,
she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
the open door.
MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
There!...there...
All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
clasped in his hand.
CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT
10
We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
the passage.
He is bent with exhaustion and
sways as he moves forward, limping.
The man comes
closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
room strikes first his legs, then his body and
finally his face.
Here he stops.
This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
(for so it will be convenient to speak of him).
At
this instant he is in a sorry state.
His clothing
is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.
For
a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
and then takes another swaying step into the room.
FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT
11
They come to life.
Bridewell, noticing the glass
of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.
FILBY
Good lord! - What's happened?
Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
back at the table.
The Time Traveller, however,
moves forward under his own power.
TIME TRAVELLER
I'm all right...just some food...a
drink...
He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.
With
trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.
TIME TRAVELLER
Are you all right?
A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
Traveller empties his glass.
BRIDEWELL (a delayed
answer)
Of course.
I'm...all right...
Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
like a mother hen.
MRS. WATCHETT (half
apology, half concern)
I didn't recognize you!...it was
so dark...
The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
for him, but he pushes it away.
TIME TRAVELLER
Meat...I'm hungry for meat!
Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.
GROUPSHOT
12
The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
curiously.
Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.
DR. HILLYER
Well, can't you speak, man?
What
happened to you?
Aren't you going
to tell us...
BRIDEWELL
Leave him alone, can't you?
TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
It's all right. - I want to tell.
FILBY
It will keep, George.
Eat, rest a
little.
TIME TRAVELLER
No!
I must tell it now... while I
still remember.
FILBY
Relax, try to relax a bit.
You've
all the time in the world.
CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER
13
As he looks up, amused.
TIME TRAVELLER
You're right, David.
(almost to himself)
That's exactly what I have. -
All the time in the world!...
ever since we were all together
five days ago, the last day of
Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.
Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
CLOCK is heard.
SLOWLY DISSOLVE:
14
(NOTE:
The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
should give the effect of the Ebony Box
emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
There in that box rests the result
of two years' labor.
The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.
The Time
Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
puffing his cigar.
Bridewell and Filby have glasses
in their hands -- Kemp nothing.
All are looking at
the box.
TIME TRAVELLER
(continues)
I wanted to finish the job before
the new century began. - I barely
made it.
BRIDEWELL
Marvelous.
DR. HILLYER (stands up)
What is it?
TIME TRAVELLER
Well, it has to do with time.
DR. HILLYER
(steps to box)
I've always maintained what this
nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
The Navy needs one. The Army needs
one. - For the artillery you know.
KEMP (leaning forward)
Couldn't do better, George.
So
that's why you've been in hiding. -
Clever of you, indeed!
FILBY (studying the Time
Traveller's reaction)
I don't believe George is referring
to a new kind of timepiece.
TIME TRAVELLER
When I speak of time, I'm referring
to the fourth dimension.
A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
Dr. Hillyer registers concern.
Kemp looks troubled.
Only Filby expresses avid interest.
FILBY
Go on, George.
TIME TRAVELLER
Now, as you know, the difficulty
in explaining the fourth dimension
is that it cannot be seen or felt -
it must be thought of.
FILBY
If you don't mind, George, would
you refresh me on the first three
dimensions.
DR. HILLYER
Really, Filby, they must have
taught you something at school!
BRIDEWELL (baiting
Dr. Hillyer)
Suppose you explain it, Doctor.
DR. HILLYER
Certainly!
(he demonstrates
pompously)
When I move in a straight line,
forward or backward, that's one
dimension. - When I move to the
left or right, two dimensions. -
When I move up and down, three
dimensions.
(a bright idea lights up
his face.
At last he can
get ahold of the box, but
Filby interferes before
Dr. Hillyer can get his
fingers on it and he has
to be satisfied with merely
pointing)
For instance, this box has three
dimensions:
length, breadth, and
height.
BRIDEWELL (amazed)
Well, then, what's the fourth
dimension?
DR. HILLYER
Well, that's...that's mere theory!
No one can really say what the
fourth dimension is or even that
it exists.
THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
15
Leaning forward in his chair.
TIME TRAVELLER
On the contrary, Doctor!
The
fourth dimension is as true and as
real a dimension as any of the
other three.
In fact, they couldn't
exist without it.
DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
How do you mean?
TIME TRAVELLER
Well, take that box.
It has the
first three dimensions, as you said.
But what if it didn't exist in Time?
It wouldn't exist at all, would it?
DR. HILLYER
No.
TIME TRAVELLER
So - for an object to exist at all,
it must exist in the fourth dimen-
sion....and that fourth dimension
is duration....Time!
DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
All right!
But what's in that box?
TIME TRAVELLER
I'm coming to that.
But first,
consider!
Why is it that we usually
ignore the fourth dimension?
Because
we have no freedom to move in it.
We
can move in the other three -- up,
down, forward, backward, sideways.
But when it comes to Time, we are
prisoners.
Do you follow me, Anthony?
GROUP SHOT
16
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
KEMP
George!
You've given a most lucid
explanation and all that!
But I
don't think I entirely understand.
TIME TRAVELLER
Look!
There are a lot of things in
the world you don't understand,
aren't there?
KEMP
Of course!
Quite a number.
TIME TRAVELLER
But you don't refuse to believe
in them because of that?
KEMP
Not if I can see the proof with
my own eyes.
TIME TRAVELLER
Good!
All I'm asking you to do
now is to witness a demonstration
of the possibility of movement in
the fourth dimension.
(to Dr. Hillyer)
Philip, will you please hand me
that box?
All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
and takes it to the Time Traveller.
George opens it
with great care and brings forth a mechanical device
[PAGE 13 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]
TIME TRAVELLER
I've told you.
The larger model
can carry a passenger on a journey
through Time. - Not through Space,
mind you, but through Time.
BRIDEWELL
Oh, I say George!
If you start
floating around in the future, aren't
you likely to mess things up for the
rest of us?
DR. HILLYER
The future is already there.
It's
irrevocable and cannot be changed.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
19
He answers thoughtfully.
TIME TRAVELLER
That's the most important question
to which I hope to find an answer.
Can Man control his destiny?
Can he
change the shape of things to come?
[PAGE 16 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
Imagine that this cigar is the Time
Traveller.
Now, this lever in front
of him controls movement.
Forward
pressure sends the Machine into the
future, backward pressure into the
past.
And the harder the pressure
the faster the Machine travels.
GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE
24
All eyebrows are raised.
TIME TRAVELLER
This experiment can be performed
only once.
If it succeeds, I lose
my model forever.
That is why I
need witnesses.
They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
joking or not.
Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
examine the table.
KEMP
Go ahead.
TIME TRAVELLER
You're ready then?
Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
his finger on the lever.
Then he pauses.
TIME TRAVELLER
Doctor Hillyer, would you care
to lend me your hand?
Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
weakly.
INSERT OF MODEL

Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
presses the lever forward.
A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
heard.

The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
and the HUMMING INCREASES.

the mantelpiece.
INSERT OF MODEL

As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
abruptly.
BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE
29
The sudden silence is almost unbearable.
They
stare at the empty table.
The CAMERA PANS.
DR. HILLYER (touches his
cigar pocket)
I'll be damned!
TIME TRAVELLER (almost
to himself)
It worked!
Filby swallows.
Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
reach as he can.
Then, suddenly reversing his
decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.
30 OUT
TWO SHOT
31
Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.
DR. HILLYER
Where did it go?
TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
Go?
Nowhere in the usual sense.
It's still here.
(indicating space where the
Machine stood)
But it's no longer in the present.
It's traveling through time - to
the future, to be precise.
DR. HILLYER
Do you seriously expect us to
believe that?
TIME TRAVELLER
Certainly.
DR. HILLYER
But you just said it hasn't
really moved.
TIME TRAVELLER
That's correct.
DR. HILLYER
Then why can't we see it?
TIME TRAVELLER
Because we're in this room on
December 31st, 1899, while the
model you saw is perhaps a hundred
years away.
This room, or even
this house, may no longer exist a
hundred years from now.
But the
Time Machine is occupying the same
space it did a moment before it went
off on its journey.
Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.
DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
If it occupies the same space, I
should be able to feel it.
TIME TRAVELLER
You must remember that the space
you've just put your hand through
is today's space.
You can't put
your hand into the space of
tomorrow.
DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
Space is space!
It doesn't change!
The same space that is here now should
be here a hundred or even a thousand
years from now.
TIME TRAVELLER
No!
Time changes space.
This flat
ground we're standing on now could
have been at the bottom of the sea
a million years ago.
And a million
years from now it could be the
interior of a huge mountain.
Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.
GROUP SHOT
32
Kemp steps forward.
KEMP
Suppose what you say is true.
Exactly what do you suggest we do
with such a contraption?
TIME TRAVELLER
For my part, I intend to take a
journey into the future. - Unless
someone else prefers to volunteer.
There is no response.
BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
I say, George.
Suppose you go off
and get lost in the fiftieth century!
How will you find your way back?
TIME TRAVELLER (quite
serious)
That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
to take.
Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
air of reasonableness.
DR. HILLYER
Now listen, George!
I don't
know what you take us for, but
we're not fools.
There are a
number of ways of doing a
disappearing trick!
But a man of
your ability should not bother
with such nonsense.
CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT
33
He gets up from his chair.
DR. HILLYER (unable to
resist the temptation for
sarcasm)
There's a war on, you know!
The
Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
fight in South Africa and our
country needs inventors like you.
I can put you in touch with the
War Office if you wish.
He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
with its lid open.
Filby is in the b.g.
TIME TRAVELLER (looks
up at Filby)
What do you think?
FILBY (hesitating
slightly, and then)
I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
George.
Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.
He looks up
and nods.
DR. HILLYER
Now you're being sensible.
I'll
take care of it first thing in
the New Year.
BACK TO GROUP SHOT
34
Everyone rises.
DR. HILLYER
Well, time to go.
KEMP
Yes, we all have our plans for
tonight.
Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.
Bridewell
lingers at the table where the model of the Time
Machine disappeared.
BRIDEWELL (concerned)
Are you all right, George?
TIME TRAVELLER
Of course, I am.
DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
Coming, Bridewell?
Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
by the Time Traveller.
35
While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
grasps the handle.
TIME TRAVELLER
Thanks for coming.
He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
at the rear.
AD LIBS
Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.
Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
reassuringly.
40
The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
back against it, staring into space.
Thinking. - He
spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
one of his guests, and picks it up.
INSERT: NEWSPAPER

He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.
Then more
BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take

He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
strides toward:

The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in

He stands there and even in the darkness

The
light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
across the room to see:

sitting in a chair near the fireplace.
FILBY
I thought I'd better stay.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
You needn't have troubled yourself.
I'm all right.
FILBY
No you're not. - You've been
behaving oddly for over a month
now.
(and then)
I'm not leaving until you tell me
what's on your mind.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
59
Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
the coals.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS.
TIME TRAVELLER
I appreciate your gesture, David,
but if you don't mind I'd rather
you left me alone.
FILBY
You have changed, George.
Enormously.
TIME TRAVELLER
I'm sorry.
FILBY (looks up to him
directly)
Will you answer me one question
honestly?
TIME TRAVELLER
I'll try.
FILBY
Why this preoccupation with Time?
TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
Why not?
FILBY
Don't go simple on me, George!
TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
then calmly)
If you want to know the truth, I
don't much care for the time I was
born into. - It seems people aren't
dying fast enough these days.
They
call upon science to invent new,
more efficient weapons to depopulate
the earth.
FILBY
I quite agree with you.
But here
we are and we have to make the best
of it.
TIME TRAVELLER
You may have to.
I don't.
FILBY (making a half-
hearted attempt at levity)
All right.
Take a journey on your
contraption.
What would you become?...
A Greek?
A Roman?
One of the
Pharaohs?
TIME TRAVELLER
I prefer the future.
FILBY
You're not seriously saying you can
do it?
TIME TRAVELLER
You saw the experiment this afternoon,
didn't you?
FILBY
I saw a toy machine vanish.
But
I'm certain there are a number of
ways of doing that trick.
Any
magician at the Hippodrome could
probably do it.
TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
It was no trick! - Would you care
to see the full-scale model?
FILBY
No, I would not!
I have no desire
to tempt the laws of Providence and
I don't think you should.
It's not
for man to trifle with.
TIME TRAVELLER
Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.
FILBY
There is something in their common
sense attitude to life.
(and then)
George, I speak to you as a friend.
More, as a brother.
If that machine
can do what you say it can...destroy
it.
Destroy it, George, before it
destroys you.
Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.
TIME TRAVELLER
You must have plans for New Year's
Eve.
Don't let me keep you.
FILBY
Mary isn't well.
We decided to
stay home with the baby.
But why
don't you come home with me.
You
haven't seen little Jaime for a
long time.
TIME TRAVELLER
I can't.
FILBY
What's stopping you?
TIME TRAVELLER
I just want to see the old century
out by myself.
FILBY (rising)
Have it your own way.
He goes to the door.
AT THE DOOR
60
Filby stops, then turns around.
FILBY
Will you promise me that you won't
leave the house tonight?
TIME TRAVELLER
I promise you, I won't walk out of
the door.
Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
steps up to him.
TIME TRAVELLER
David!
Please don't think me un-
friendly! - Come over to dinner -
next Friday.
Won't you?
FILBY
Very well.
TIME TRAVELLER
Fine...and will you bring the others
with you?
FILBY (with a warm smile)
Whatever you say, George. - Happy
New Year.
TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
And a very happy New Year to you, David.
Filby pats his arm before he leaves.
The Time Traveller
stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.
Then,
FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
and sits down.
AT THE WRITING TABLE
61
The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
new calendar that reads:
"1900, Welcome New Century."
He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
down the dinner engagement.
At this point Mrs. Watchett,
with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
in the doorway and walks up to him.
MRS. WATCHETT
Will you be having supper in this
evening, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
changing jackets with Mrs.
Watchett's help)
I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.
Why
don't you take the evening off and
celebrate.
MRS. WATCHETT
Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
needing me I think I'll turn in early
and get some sleep...
(indicating revelers outside)
...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.
TIME TRAVELLER
Goodnight.
She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.
TIME TRAVELLER
Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
(as she responds)
I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
to dinner next Friday.
(and then)
Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
MRS. WATCHETT
Happy New Year, sir.
Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.
Once
again the Time Traveller is alone.
He looks at the
old calendar that reads:
"December 3l. 1899," rips
the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
burns.
With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
the old calendar with the new one.
Then, he hastily
scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
places it prominently on the table.
He rises and
mounts the steps that lead to:
62
The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
at the end of the passageway.
Here he pauses momentarily,
removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
the picture.
63
The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
a greenhouse.
Only a few potted plants remain.
The
glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
rows of tall growing plants.
Only the glass skylight
is clear.
Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
the interior a maze of dark shadows.
As the slow mov-
ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
the perimeter.
But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
Time Machine.
It is a duplicate of the miniature model
already seen.
However, its size gives it a majestic quality.
Nickel,
ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.
While
the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
full size Machine has an ominous look.
The wavering
moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
power of movement.

Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.
Here
a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
sparkles like a fine cut diamond.
As he works, his
lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
strains of "The Land Of The Leal."
A clock near him on
the workbench reads:
"9:30."
Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
handle and crosses to the Machine.
He settles into the
saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.
There is no
sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
routine position he has taken before to work on the
Machine.
Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:

Passing clouds.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER

He looks upwards for several moments.
Then his hand
slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
lever. - Gently he urges it forward.
A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
within the Machine.

The luminous dials show:

Then almost
at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the

As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT

Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.
During this we HEAR the:
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
No change; everything exactly as it
bad been before. - But no!
THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
shorter.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
The clock said 9:31 when I started and
now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
shorter by inches.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
72
He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
from his pocket by its gold chain.
It flips open
showing almost "9:32."
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
And yet by my watch which was in the
machine with me, only a few seconds
had passed.
Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
lever, looking off toward the:
WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)

The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
candle down.
The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
gems and the sun starts to rise.

The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-

It was disconcerting to see the sun...

During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
the flowers start to open again.
Light begins to flood
the scene.
In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
the speed of wind streaks away.

A trace of a smile, then apprehension.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
And as yet I was travelling very slowly!

Without a trace of frost or icicles.
The snow has

It became intoxicating.
To see an

So I pushed the lever on toward
even greater speed.
He applies greater pressure on the lever.
The
HUMMING INCREASES.
The alternate flashes of light
become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
follow.
He looks o.s. and sees:

The dim light and the protective sheets covering
the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
ghostly appearance.
Tilted paintings reveal
faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
in the b.g.
Cobwebs are everywhere.
The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
Traveller, coming down the steps from the
corridor, enters the room and looks about.

Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
prized possessions.

Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
door.
It refuses to respond to his attempt to
open it.
Even when he uses his shoulder it does
not budge.
He steps back and flings his full
weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
gives slightly.
Under continued pressure the
nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
daylight illuminates the dusty interior.
The
Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
is now taken over by weeds.

The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps
up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly
shoves the lever forward.

As I went along, I gained experience
in handling the Machine.
I found
that I could stop for a day, an hour,
or even for a second to observe, then
go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I
was able to see the changing world
in a series of glimpses.
Something catches his interest.
He pulls back
the lever to SLOW DOWN.
120
From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.
The Time Traveller
enters and turns his attention to other products
of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
reducing belts, etc.
As his keen mind grasps the
significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
of his fellow man.
His delight increases until he
is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.
He looks
off.
REVERSE SHOT
121
Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
plastic suit.
He also wears an armband and a white
crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
Defense."
MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.
TIME TRAVELLER
(shakes his head)
I can't understand you.
The warden takes off his helmet.
He is David
Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
man.
He is now in his mid-sixties.
WARDEN
(looking at helmet)
Confounded radio in this thing.
Makes more noise than it does sense.
TIME TRAVELLER
(recognizing him)
Filby!
WARDEN
My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
you hear the air raid siren?
TIME TRAVELLER
You mean that horrible screeching?
WARDEN
It wasn't constructed for its
aesthetic values, you know, but to
warn silly young fools like yourself
to get down into the shelter.
Now
go on.
TIME TRAVELLER
But I'm perfectly comfortable and
I find your store magnificent.
What
splendid achievements, what gigantic
strides mankind has taken, what...
WARDEN
(interrupting)
Come on, young man.
We'd better be
going before the mushrooms start
sprouting.
(looks at Time Traveller
with renewed interest)
You do look familiar.
Haven't
we met somewhere before?
TIME TRAVELLER
Indeed we have.
Right here.
Many
years ago.
WARDEN
I was sure of that, but the exact
time escapes me.
TIME TRAVELLER
It was two wars ago, I believe.
Nineteen seventeen.
WARDEN (awed)
Why now I recall.
The chap who
inquired about my father -- and
the house that used to be across
the way.
(stops and stares at
the Time Traveller)
But no...that's impossible.
You
haven't changed.
You're not a day

And your clothes...

I'm afraid it's going to take me
a little time to explain... You see...
There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.

Alarmed,
he runs across the street directly in the path
of the ambulance that threads its way between the
cars left in disorder on the road.
The driver
spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
He stops and
looks startled.

He looks back, desperately.

Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
the once proud city of the future in ruins.
Only
a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
The labor of centuries gone in an
instant.
The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
though the earth were being torn apart.
It zig-zags
down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
of smoke and steam rise.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
violence, responded with volcanic
violence or her own!

The lower parts of the struct-

red flood.
Then the incoming rush of the river
meets the flowing tide of lava.
The two opposite
elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
meet with explosive fury.
The air is rent with the
SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
rock.
Steam whitens the sky.

how many eons must pass before the wind

In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
BREATHING of the Time Traveller.
Then a match flickers.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.

Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time

In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
halts.
He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
ceiling.
Although ancient in appearance, everything
is ultra modern in design.
Sunlight streams through
windows where half the panes of stained glass are
broken.
Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
the walls, and at random about the floor are low
tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
of fruit.
His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
Time Traveller crosses to:

The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
exotic fruit.
Everything looks fresh and clean as
though newly prepared.
Yet there is no indication
of life or sound, either human or animal.
The air
hangs in a deathlike stillness.
Slowly the Time
Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
this strange place.
There is none.
Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
with it on the top of the table.
TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
Anyone here?
But an ECHO is his only answer.
Curiously he re-
traces his steps and leaves the great hall.

Crowded now.
The people of the future are sitting
on cushions around the tables, having their evening
meal.
The glowing orange light of the setting sun
pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-

No one pays attention to
Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
b.g.

A score of attractive young men and young women are
enjoying their dinner.
There is a general atmos-

They don't even look

table.
She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.
He
takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
them in conversation.
TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
Young Man, but meant for the

There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
again.
TIME TRAVELLER
Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
I have come a long way and there are
things I would like to know.
YOUNG MAN (considers a
moment, then)
Why?
TIME TRAVELLER
Because I shall return to my time
and they will ask questions such as
what kind of government rules your
world.
MAN IN WHITE
We have no government.
TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
as though to a child)
You must have a body of men who pass
and enforce laws.
MAN IN WHITE
There are no laws.
TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
then)
How do you get your food and clothing?
The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
They both shrug their shoulders.
TIME TRAVELLER
Doesn't anyone work?
MAN IN WHITE
No.
TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
fruit)
Then where does this come from?
MAN IN WHITE
It grows.
It always grows.
TIME TRAVELLER
But it must be planted, cultivated,
nurtured...unless...
(with mistaken insight as he
observes no reaction to this
last query)
Unless you have an economy so well
organized that you can devote all your
time to study and experimentation.
Am I right?
MAN IN WHITE
You ask many questions.
TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
Yes!
And I'm not ashamed of it.
That is how man has learned and
bettered himself.
I must learn about
you and your civilization.
You have
books, don't you?
YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
half-forgotten word)
Books. - Books!
Yes, we have books.
He rises and beckons.
The Time Traveller's brow
clears.
TIME TRAVELLER
Books will tell me what I want to
know.
Books will tell me all about
you.
He too gets up and follows the Young Man.

The Young Man leading.
He reaches the wall and
seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.
A
cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
curtain falls, almost crumbling.
Shelves and
shelves of books are disclosed.
The books are
old even though many of them have futuristic de-
signs.
The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
brown tatters.
The Time Traveller steps to the
books.

The realization of the true state of affairs shows
on his face.
He is appalled.
Carefully he pulls
a volume from the shelf.
Its binding breaks as
he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
He drops the book.
His voice is a shocked WHISPER.
TIME TRAVELLER
Yes...they do tell me all about you!
With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
shelf of books.
His hand plows through them and
the dust swirls into the air.
He turns back in
anger.
TIME TRAVELLER
What have you done?
Thousands of
years of building and rebuilding
creating and re-creating so that
you can let it crumble to dust.
With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.
TIME TRAVELLER
A million yesterdays of sensitive
men dying for their dreams.
For
what?
So you can swim and dance
and play.
He releases him and leaves.
THE HALL - MOVING SHOT

The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
them for their dissipation.
Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
entrance.
Only Weena jumps to her feet.
Her
former indifference is gone.

196
From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
at them.
TIME TRAVELLER
I am returning to my time!
Not to
tell of the uselessness of the
struggle - not to tell of the
hopeless future - but only so that
I can die among men!
He turns and strides toward the door.

Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
that the Young Man had previously shown him.
She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
corridor.
He follows.

Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
where it veers sharply to the right.
They disappear
around the corner.
234
The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
colored porcelain-like substance.
There are no
windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
of day, illuminate the entire museum.
It is
evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT
235
Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
existent behind plastic.
Some of the cases are
broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.
We recognize
objects and machines, some belonging to the early
part of the twentieth century and still others take
on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
will recognize as contemporary.
Then they pass
cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
comprehension.
Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
case which contains several boxes of golden rings
a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
with minutely spaced grooves.
He picks up the
nearest box and examines its contents.
TIME TRAVELLER
(picking up a ring)
Are these the talking rings?
WEENA
Yes.
TIME TRAVELLER
They speak?
WEENA
Yes.
TIME TRAVELLER
Of what?
WEENA
Things no one here understands.
TIME TRAVELLER
How do you get it to talk?
Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.
INSERT:
WHIRLING RING

A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
surface of one of our records.

Whomsoever chances upon these rings
will probably hear the last recorded
voice of civilized man.
This is the
year four thousand eight hundred and
twenty-nine.

The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
Weena in disinterested detachment.
VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
The war between the East and West,
which is now in its three hundredth
and twenty-sixth year has at last
come to an end.
There is nothing
left to fight with and few of us
left to fight.
The atmosphere has
become so polluted with deadly
germs that it can no longer be
breathed.
There is no place on
this planet that is immune.
The
last surviving factory for the
manufacture of oxygen has been
destroyed.
Stockpiles are rapidly
diminishing and when they are gone,
we must die...
The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
the second ring and spins it.
ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
This is the last day.
We, the last
to survive, have had our final meeting.
We have decided to split into two
groups.
Each man and woman has made
his own decision.
Some have chosen
to take refuge in the great caverns
and find a new way of life far down
below the earth's surface.
The rest
of us have decided to take our chances
in the sunlight, small as those chances
may be.
The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
more.
The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
third and last ring and spins it.
NO WORDS are
heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
had become the masters and the Eloi

The Morlocks main-

only to take them below when they
reached maturity, which explained why
there were no older people along them.
They exit.

It was

into the sphinx to reach my Machine
and to find out what happened to the
little people when they went below.
They leave the Great Hall.
283X1
The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
grotesque shadows.
(NOTE:
DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
scene as well as the following sequence.)
CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT
283X2
Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
moves toward:
283X3
At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
pauses, then slowly enters.
Behind him, across the
cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight
that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
horror.
THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.
283X4
This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
In the flickering light we see stone tables and
scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
carnivorously picked away.
T.T.'S VOICE
So, this was the destiny of the
Eloi.
CLOSE ON T.T.
283X5
His features twisted in horror in the flickering
light of his match.
T.T.'S VOICE
(continuing)
They were being bred like cattle
by the Morlocks who had degenerated
into the lowest form of human
life...cannibalism.
The match dies between his fingers.
Suppressing a
shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
A pale,
spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
descending.
Another in the b.g. does likewise.
MACHINES - FULL SHOT
283X6
Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
the needs of their machinery.
They look up toward the
intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
hide.
STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT
283X7
The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
that hugs the sheer wall.
Meanwhile at the base of
the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
itself.
It silently watches as another Morlock
appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.
Weena and the
Young Man are side by side.
AT THE MACHINES
283X16
The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.
BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT
283X17
He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.
Hugging
the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
point where he can still remain unobserved by the
herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.
He
reaches out.
T.T.
Weena!
But she continues on with complete resignation to her
fate.
Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.
T.T.
(shaking her)
Girl!
(he turns and grasps the
passing Young Man)
Come to your senses!
All of you!
As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
Young Man follows.
FOOT OF STAIRWAY
283X18
Morlocks block the escape.
THREE SHOT
283X19
The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
Man as they are forced to retreat.
AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM
283X20
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
into the chamber of horrors.
One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
Young Man.
He swings his whip.
BACK TO THREE SHOT
283X21
The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
feasting room.
TWO SHOT
283X22
The T.T. tries to protect Weena.
Suddenly a long
lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
about the T.T.'s neck.
He drops his unlit torch
and whirls in pain.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
shoulders.
Finally he grabs the whip from around
his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.
AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM
283X23
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
CRACKING WHIPS.
He crawls in pain into the
chamber of horrors.
GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM
283X24
The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.
The
WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.
Through the
curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.
Then
suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
pocket.
A match flares!
GROUP OF MORLOCKS
283X25
In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
shielding their eyes.
THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)
283X26
The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
and red.
Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
Morlocks' retreat.
Slowly the normal colors
reappear.
BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS
283X27
Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
to close in.
THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)
283X28
Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
room and again lights a match.
A BLINDING FLASH
starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
slaps all the matches except one to the floor.
T.T. - MED. SHOT
283X29
He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
for his lost torch.
GROUPSHOT
283X30
The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
Morlocks away.
Finally he spots his torch and
picks it up hurriedly.
CLOSE ON T.T.
283X31
His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
hension while he applies the dying match to the
intended torch.
TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
Burn, will you!
He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
lower without starting the wood.
In despair he
turns to Weena.
TIME TRAVELLER
Quick, something to burn!
It's
my last match!
BACK TO THE MORLOCKS
283X32
As they are closing in.
CLOSE ON WEENA
283X33
With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
it out.
BACK TO T.T.
283X34
As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
cloth.
It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
dead match.
He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
in this hotter flame it begins to burn.
Once it
starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.
GROUPSHOT
283X35
As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.
A CORNER
283X36
The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.
BACK TO SCENE
283X37
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
T.T.
As they face one another, the fight begins.
[PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]
Eloi below him.
TIME TRAVELLER
Weena!
Weena, get the torch!
CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN
351X5
Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
turns searching for the flickering torch.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
351X6
As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
Morlock swings at him.
He ducks and almost
falls off ledge.
He grabs Morlock, and hangs
on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
head against the rock wall, finally throwing
him off ledge.
At the same time another Mor-
lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
had previously kicked rises to menace him from
the other side.
The Time Traveller jumps across
cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
against the Morlocks.
CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER
351X7
He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.
He
sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
too confused to move.
TIME TRAVELLER
Weena!
Go on!
Go on the
steps!
CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN
351X8
Weena spots the still flickering torch and
starts toward it.
INSERT OF TORCH
351X9
Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
appears facing her.
She screams and jumps back,
watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
her.
MED. SHOT
351X10
The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
Morlocks converging on him.
He tries to fight his
way past them.

Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
Cave.
MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER
351X12
JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
and runs toward her.
FULL SHOT
351X13
The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
from Morlock, knocks him against rock.
In the
meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.
CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER
351X14
Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
help.
CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN
351X15
Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
Time Traveller's silent plea for help.
Slowly
raises his right hand, stares at it as he
gradually clenches it into a fist.
Then, making
up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
lock hard on the back of his neck.
MED. SHOT
351X16
As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
to get his torch.
Several Morlocks try to herd
Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
Eloi resist them.
The Time Traveller runs back
in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.
FULL SHOT
351X17
The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
pushing Weena ahead of him.
They climb up past
Cauldron.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
Traveller's torch.
CLOSER SHOT
351X18
The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
Eloi are all on their way out.
Then turns back
and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
the Cauldron.
FULL SHOT
351X19
The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
the right, which explodes.
The Time Traveller
herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.
MED. SHOT
351X20
Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
flames.
He bumps into the Pipe coming down
the wall, loses his balance and falls into
the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.
PAN SHOT
351X21
Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
at same time as fire - and it explodes.
Morlock
catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.
PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT
352
Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
run toward a circle of light on the floor far
ahead.
CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE
353
Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
that comes straight down from above, and look
up the shaft.
Smoke belches from the passage-
way as he helps her start up the ladder and
then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
sight.
IN THE WELL
354
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.
The light
becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.
FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE
355
Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
through the swirling smoke.
The Young Man is
peering down.
He reaches to help Weena and the
Time Traveller.
SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE
356
Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
soot, near exhaustion.
Far below them red flames
pierce through the smoke.
They each in turn grasp
the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
of the well.
386
Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
radiant features.
Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
starts to fit the lever into place.
REVERSE ANGLE
387
The Time Traveller working eagerly.
A shadow
starts sliding across his figure, moving more
swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
with a CLANG.
OUTSIDE THE PANELS
388
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT
389
The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
to open them.
From without he hears Weena's
POUNDING and CRIES.
Suddenly he senses a living
presence within the sphinx.
For a moment there is
silence.
Then from the right comes a hacking,
weak COUGH.
Another from the left.
Then some-
thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.
He whirls
around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.
Avoiding
them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
the saddle.
The suffocating smoke blinds him as
he gropes for the lever.
Morlocks seize his legs and
try to wrest him off the Machine.
The fire and
smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
bodies.

The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
finally grasps it.

Spinning backwards.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
over the instruments, followed by a burst of
whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
darkness.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
405
Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
the lava.
He reels in the saddle, then coming
from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
daylight returns, we can see that his face is
covered with perspiration.
He looks off to see:
SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)
406
(NOTE:
These shots seen previously are now printed
backward.)
The red hot lava withdraws through the
(a,b,c)
street ruins and the great rents in the
ground gulp it up quickly.
Out of the
ruins building are molded and then
atomic explosions in reverse flash
across the screen.
The SOUND OF
EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.
IN REVERSE

Time Machine.
BLUR TO:
The sun and the moon chase each other

alternately across the sky, gradually
slowing.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
407
INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
he straightens and readjusts the lever.
The
HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.
INSERT:
DIAL
408
It stops on:
"5 January 1900".
409
The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
in the far corner of the room instead of in the
spot where we originally saw it.
In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
fully from the Machine.
Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
on the clock.
It is "8:04".
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT
410
Now showing "9:22".
For a long while only its
MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
from the cacophony of time traveling.
The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
where the five men, their meal finished, are
sitting silently around the table.
Mrs. Watchett
is quietly serving the liqueur.
The Time Traveller
is puffing on his pipe.
Kemp is chewing on his
cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.
DR. HILLYER
It is ridiculous!
Simply preposterous!
Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
silence.
Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
from his brandy.
BRIDEWELL
Well, there's one thing I'll say
for you, George.
You always could
tell a good story.
Best adventure
yarn I've heard for years.
(loudly)
You're a truly fine inventor,
George!
He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
hiccup quickly puts a period to that.
Mrs. Watchett
steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
brandy.
MRS. WATCHETT
I'll turn down your bed for you!
As she exits Kemp looks up.
KEMP
Truthfully, where have you been
for the past week?
Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.
BRIDEWELL
(voice of experience)
Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
Walter.
It's not hard for a man to
lose a week now and then.
TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
I understand your doubt.
Take it
as a lie if you wish.
Now that
I'm back I scarcely believe it
myself.
(a flash of memory)
Except that...
(groping in pocket)
...here are the flowers Weena gave
me.
He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
They are actually less than a day old and fairly
fresh.
FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT

As he picks them up to examine.
TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
A present for you, David.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT

TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
You were always interested in
botany. - Try to match them with
any species known today.
BACK TO FILBY
413
As he looks up, puzzled.
FILBY
I don't think I can.
GROUP SHOT
414
A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
the table, stands up, looks around and then down
to Kemp.
DR. HILLYER
Are you coming, Kemp.
Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.
KEMP
It's getting late and you look
exhausted.
You had better get
some rest.
Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
starts to leave.
COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)
415
The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
from the sky.
The front door opens letting out
the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
the staggering Bridewell.
Filby is the last to
leave.
He pauses at the step of the carriage
looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
motionless in the doorway.
FILBY
Goodnight, George.
AT THE ENTRANCE
416
The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.
TIME TRAVELLER
Thank you, David, for being such
a good friend - always.
With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
the door slowly.
AT THE CARRIAGE
417
Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
Kemp thrusts his head from the window.
KEMP
What do you think, Filby?
FILBY (after a pause)
One thing is certain.
Those
flowers couldn't have possibly
bloomed in the winter-time.
HILLYER (in the b.g.)
You don't really think that story
was true?
Filby reaches a decision.
FILBY
Look, you chaps go on.
It's
just a short walk home for me.
HILLYER (o.s.)
Go on, driver!
The WHIP CRACKS.
THE DRIVEWAY
418
As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
in the falling snow.
He waits until the carriage
disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
door and raps on it.
He pauses a moment, then
uses the heavy knocker.
There is still no answer.
He steps back and looks off toward the:
421
The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
ONCE.
Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
the doorway.
DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.
422
The table is cleared, candles extinguished.
The
pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.
The time is
"9:30".
FILBY - PANSHOT
423
He calls into the darkness.
FILBY
George!...
No answer.
Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
him to stiff attention.
The SOUND INCREASES in
VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
to tremble.
Then a violent gust of wind blows
open the door that leads to the laboratory.
Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
corridor.
AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT
424
Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
and tries the door -- it is locked.
The NOISE
is almost DEAFENING.
He puts his shoulder to
the door and finally bursts it open.
At the
very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
He stops short, gazing aghast.
THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.
425
The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
leaving the present.
Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
corner where we last saw the Time Machine.
It is
not there!
The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
Nor is it there!
A few sheets of paper whirl
desolately in the center of the floor.
CLOSE ON FILBY
426
He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
behind him.
Mrs. Watchett hurries in.
MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
breathless)
Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
(her eyes widen)
FILBY (with finality)
He's gone!
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
approaches the center of the room.
Here, with
squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
floor.
MRS. WATCHETT (to
Filby)
There's something funny here, sir!
Filby steps aside her to investigate.
WHAT THEY SEE
427
The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
front of the sphinx.
They are scratched deep in
the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
where it originally stood.
Here, not only its
imprint, but also the color and finish of the
floor is preserved.
TWO SHOT
428
They straighten.
Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
puzzled.
FILBY
I think I understand. - Look!
LABORATORY - FULL SHOT
429
Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
in the floor where the Machine first stood and
explains.
FILEY (pointing)
See the imprint?
This is where
the Time Machine originally
stood.
(he paces across to the
end of the grooves)
But the Morlocks moved it.
They dragged it across the lawn
right into the sphinx...right
here.
(turns and points)
And Weena was standing there when
he last saw her...the same space -
in a different time. - So he moved
back his heavy Machine from here,
across the room, scratching this
floor...
(indicating the grooves
that lead to the imprint)
So that he can appear outside the
sphinx again and help the Eloi
build a new world...and build a
new world of his own.
MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
sentimentally)
Where he left her!..
Filby doesn't answer.
He looks about the labora-
tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
arm and leads her from the room.
The MUSIC STARTS
THE THEME:
"The Land Of The Leal".
430
Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.
FILBY
But it isn't like George. - To
return empty handed.
To try to
rebuild a civilization without
a plan.
(to Mrs. Watchett)
He must have taken something
with him.
MRS. WATCHETT
Nothing.
She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
on the tightly packed book shelves.
She walks to
them.
MRS. WATCHETT
Nothing except three books.
FILBY
Which three books?
MRS. WATCHETT
I don't know. -- Is it important?
FILBY (smiles)
No, I suppose not. - Only...what
three books would you have taken?
She looks at him, pondering the question as they
leave the library.
431
They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
beside Filby as he opens it.
Outside the snow
is falling softly.
MRS. WATCHETT
Mr. Filby, do you think he will
ever return?
FILBY (quietly)
One cannot choose but wonder. -
You see...he has all the time in
the world!
With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
the night.
Mrs. Watchett looks after him.
She
hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.
Slowly she closes
the door.
