Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping
satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She
moves off briskly.
This is a little Italian funeral parlor.
A red neon sign hangs in the window.
It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A
YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested
in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.
Camera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon.
Loretta walks up the street and enters the store.
It's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one
side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard
where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies.
About a third of the windows in the house are lit.
From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR
SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying
champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes
in.
The first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house.
The front door opens. Close shot of dogs coming into camera
as door opens. The OLD MAN comes out. The Old Man, who is
Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs
out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled
in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless
November morning, he open black umbrella. He walks off down
the block with the dogs.
The Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He
approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already
sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old
Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man
sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING
like mad.
FELIX
It's wrong to just let them go.
OLD MAN
(ignoring Felix)
Good morning, Lucy.
LUCY
Good morning.
FELIX
They run around, they mess up the
whole park.
OLD MAN
What do you want me to do? Pick up
after five dogs? I'm eighty-three
years old. God in his heaven
understands that I cannot pick up
after five dogs.
FELIX
You have too many dogs.
The dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're
killing each other.
OLD MAN
(goes back to ignoring
Felix)
Lucy. There are big things going on
in my house. My granddaughter Loretta,
the only daughter of my son Cosmo,
has engaged herself to be married a
second time.
LUCY
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri
got down on his knees in The Grand
Ticino and proposed to her.
OLD MAN
My son does not like this Johnny
Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
FELIX
You should have one dog. Like Lucy.
Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I
hadda gun, I would shoot four of
your dogs.
The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.
LUCY
Don't fight.
OLD MAN
My granddaughter wants my son to pay
for the wedding. But he does not
want to pay.
LUCY
He should pay.
OLD MAN
I don't know.
LUCY
He owes her a wedding from the first
time when there was none.
OLD MAN
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked
my advice. If he asks my advice, I
don't know what I will say.
The SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again.
FELIX
I won't have to shoot those dogs.
They will kill each other.
OLD MAN
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those
dogs love each other.
The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.
It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an
overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black
Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he
gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and
goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man
approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.
The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.
Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and
son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective
door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the
same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.
Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears
within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.
Chrissy comes out and Loretta follows. They walk around to
an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk. Chrissy
shouts down.
CHRISSY
Hey, RONNY.
The door slides open, revealing ROCCO, a baker missing a few
teeth. He is surrounded by bread.
ROCCO
What!
CHRISSY'S VOICE
Somebody to see Ronny.
Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta
make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters
shut behind them.
Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the
apartment building behind the bakery.
A three-story walk-up above Cammareri's Bakery.
SHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK
The car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss.
She exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty
look and pulls away.
LORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY
Camera is close on Scotch being poured into two glasses.
Loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose.
RONNY
She was right to leave me.
LORETTA
You think so?
RONNY
Yes.
LORETTA
You really are stupid, you know that.
Loretta pours herself another shot.
RONNY
You don't know nothing about it.
LORETTA
I was raised that a girl gets married
young. I didn't get married until I
was twenty-eight. I met a man. I
loved him. I married him. He wanted
to have a baby right away. I said
no. Then he got hit by a bus. No
man. No baby. No nothing! I did not
know that man was a gift I could not
keep. I didn't know... You tell me a
story and you think you know what it
means, but I see what the true story
is, and you can't.
(she pours them both
another drink)
She didn't leave you! You can't see
what you are. I can see everything.
You are a wolf!
RONNY
I'm a wolf?
LORETTA
The big part of you has no words and
it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap
for you. She caught you and you could
not get away.
(She grabs his wooden
hand)
So you chewed off your foot! That
was the price you had to pay to be
free.
(throws his hand down)
Johnny had nothing to do with it.
You did what you had to do, between
you and you, and I know I'm right, I
don't care what you say. And now
you're afraid because you found out
the big part of you is a wolf that
has the courage to bite off its own
hand to save itself from the trap of
the wrong love. That's why there has
been no woman since that wrong woman.
You are scared to death what the
wolf will do if you make that mistake
again!
RONNY
What are you doing!
LORETTA
I'm telling you your life!
RONNY
Stop it!
LORETTA
No!
RONNY
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a
fool!
LORETTA
Because I have no Luck!
RONNY
(pounding on the table)
He made me look the wrong way and I
cut off my hand. He could make you
look the wrong way and you could cut
off your whole head!
LORETTA
I am looking where I should to become
a bride!
RONNY
A bride without a head!
LORETTA
A wolf without a foot!
Ronny stiff-arms everything off the dining table and grabs
Loretta. They kiss passionately. He pulls her up on the table
and over the table to him. They are in each other's arms.
They are on fire. Loretta pushes him away, gasping for air.
LORETTA
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop
again after a long moment. They really haven't breathed.
They both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and
fear and passion.
RONNY
It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm
in the ocean!
They kiss again. When they pull apart again, Loretta is
crying.
LORETTA
I have no Luck!
He picks her up in his arms.
RONNY
Son of a bitch!
LORETTA
Where are you taking me?
RONNY
To the bed.
LORETTA
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about
anything. I don't care about anything!
Take me to the bed.
He carries her away, into the bedroom.
MUSIC: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA", from "La Boheme." The MUSIC
CONTINUES THROUGH THE NEXT SCENE.
Dog whines over exterior.
Over the house is a great big full moon.
Shot of the house with the moon overhead.
Over the house is still the great big full moon. The front
door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs.
The Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking
a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume
of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the
street.
The moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it
and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water.
Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the
Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up
from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs.
OLD MAN
Alright now. Howl. Howl.
The Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration,
howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They
do nothing. He howls at the moon again.
The Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until
WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on
it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now,
cries out.
OLD MAN
How long must I wait? Quanto tempo
devo aspettare!
The Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter
he is, laughs and laughs.
Transition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn.
An Italian specialty store in Little Italy.
Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA
BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if
anybody's looking, and goes in.
WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles
appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back
into the store.
Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much
more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if
she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly
Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.
A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in
the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.
She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.
Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away
down the street.
WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL
SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops
and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and
stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.
Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy,
bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology,
and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop
window.
END OF MUSIC
THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.
Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.
The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA
SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE
FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:
The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the
night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.
But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge
white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights
burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along
the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the
MUSIC PLAYS
END OF MUSIC
LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV
CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created
by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled
with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand
and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House.
Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,
inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous
color.
LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN
The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.
She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights
up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger
jets.
Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher
into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her
eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water,
like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.
FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER
Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for
its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing
quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite
side of the fountain, is Ronny.
He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and
topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises
a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles
brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and
starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the
fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her
attempt at composure from, Ronny.
Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around
the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.
RONNY
Hi.
LORETTA
Hi.
RONNY
You look beautiful. Your hair...
LORETTA
I thought I'd try it.
(qrudgingly)
You look good.
RONNY
Thank you.
He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.
LORETTA
I said I'd go to the opera with you.
Nothing else.
Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they
walk off in the direction of the opera house.
ONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET
Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.
LORETTA
Who painted that?
RONNY
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
LORETTA
Kinda gaudy.
RONNY
He was having some fun. Yeah, well
he's dead.
(he smiles)
Come on, let's go in.
Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.
The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then
FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter
the restaurant.
Rose and Perry emerge from the restaurant.
PERRY
May I walk with you a ways?
ROSE
Sure.
They set off to the left.
The door opens, and the Old Man comes out, in his great coat
and hat, with the Five dogs. He strikes off to the right.
Rose and Perry come around a corner and pass a store. They
pause and look at the Christmas decorations in the window.
They continue walking.
The Old Man and the Dogs have stopped by a big tree. Which
the dogs adore.
Rose and Perry walking. They exit camera left.
The Old Man drags the Dogs away from the tree and sets off
camera right.
Rose and Perry walking to the left.
EXT . STREET II - NIGHT
The Old Man and the Dogs walking to the right.
OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT
Rose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short,
stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them.
The Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before
him.
Perry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs.
In a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to
say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers
his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street,
silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never
move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears.
PERRY
You knew that man?
ROSE
Yes.
Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly
shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house.
They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through
now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be
heard.
ROSE'S VOICE
That's my house.
PERRY'S VOICE
You mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE
Yes.
PERRY'S VOICE
My God, it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE
It's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
What exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE
He's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE
Well. That explains it.
The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up.
NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP
The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver
slightly.
PERRY
Temperature's dropping.
ROSE
Yes.
PERRY
I guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE
No.
PERRY
People home.
ROSE
No. I think the house is empty. I
can't invite you in because I'm
married and because I know who I am.
You're shaking.
PERRY
I'm a little cold.
ROSE
You're a little boy and you like to
be bad.
PERRY
We could go to my apartment. You
could see how the other half lives.
ROSE
I'm too old for you.
PERRY
I'm too old for me. That's my
predicament.
ROSE
Good night.
She kisses him on the cheek.
PERRY
Good night. Can I kiss you on the
cheek, too?
ROSE
Sure.
He kisses her on the cheek.
PERRY
I'm freezing
ROSE
Good night.
She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks
after.
Ronny and Loretta are walking. Their breath is coming out in
long plumes.
LORETTA
It's really cold.
RONNY
Yeah. It smells like snow.
They walk in silence for a moment, then Loretta speaks.
LORETTA
My mother guessed that my father was
seeing somebody and I told her she
was crazy. She looked like a real
piece of cheap goods. But who am I
to talk?
Her eyes are full of tears.
RONNY
What's the matter?
LORETTA
How can you ask me that?
RONNY
You're making me feel guilty again.
LORETTA
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
RONNY
Of what? Only God can point the
finger, Loretta.
LORETTA
I know what I know.
RONNY
And what do you know? You tell me my
life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a
wolf? You run to the wolf in me,
that don't make you no lamb! You're
gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna
sell your life short? Playing it
safe is just about the most dangerous
thing a woman like you could do. You
waited for the right man the first
time, why didn't you wait for the
right man again?
LORETTA
He didn't come!
RONNY
I'm here!
LORETTA
You're late!
RONNY
We're here.
She looks. It's Ronny's building.
LORETTA
This is your place.
RONNY
That's right.
LORETTA
This is where we're going!
RONNY
Yeah.
LORETTA
The deal was if I came to the Opera
with you you'd leave me alone forever.
She looks for his response. He makes none.
LORETTA
I went with you.
(pause, nothing)
Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're
gonna leave me alone.
(pause, nothing)
Right?
(nothing)
A person can see where they've messed
up in their life, and they can change
how they do things, and they can
change their Luck. Maybe my nature
does draw me to you, but I don't
haveta go with that. I can take hold
of myself and say yes to some things
and no to something that's just gonna
ruin everything! I can do that.
Otherwise, what is this stupid life
that God gave us for what?
(pause, nothing)
Ronny? Are you listening to me?
RONNY
Yeah.
LORETTA
I'm really afraid.
RONNY
Why?
LORETTA
I'm afraid of who I am.
RONNY
I was.
LORETTA
And you're not now?
He shakes his head.
LORETTA
Why not?
RONNY
I don't know. Everything seems like
nothing now against that I want you
in my bed. I don't care if I burn in
hell. I don't care if you burn in
hell. The Past and Future is a joke
to me now. I see that they're nothing,
I see they ain't here. The only thing
that's here is you. And me. I want
you to come upstairs. Now. I tried
to take everything last night, like
you told me, but I couldn't. I
couldn't take everything in a hundred
years. It's the way we are. We
compound each other.
LORETTA
Let me go home.
RONNY
No.
LORETTA
Let me go home.
RONNY
No.
LORETTA
I'm freezing to death.
RONNY
Come upstairs. I don't care why you
come. No, that's not what I mean.
Loretta, I love you. Not like they
told you love is and I didn't know
this either. But love don't make
things nice, it ruins everything, it
breaks your heart, it makes things a
mess. We're not here to make things
perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The
stars are perfect. Not us. We are
here to ruin ourselves and break our
hearts and love the wrong people and
die! The storybooks are bullshit.
Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't
try to live your life out to somebody
else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't
try to live on milk and cookies when
what you want is meat! Red meat just
like me! It's wolves run with wolves
and nothing else! You're a wolf just
like me! Come upstairs with me and
get in my bed! Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Loretta follows Ronny into his building.
NOW WE SEE THE STREET
Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in
Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of
the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the
middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted
windows.
NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY
Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks
up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one
slender, slender thread.
MUSIC
It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.
WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING
At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau
reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in
the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long
moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy
shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She
hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks
away down the street.
With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.
Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes
to him.
The cab rushes off into the night.
The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room
windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING
"IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his
luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.
The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.
MR. JOHNNY
Hello. I'm sorry to call so late...
Rose is a little tipsy.
ROSE
Moving in?
MR. JOHNNY
I came right from the airport.
ROSE
Come on in.
She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her
carrying his suitcases. She closes the door.
We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It
begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of
light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright
morning.
THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT
He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries
the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and
disappears.
Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.
She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't
slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the
complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks
great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has
a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is
slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched
in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING.
We follow her as she SINGS and walks.
WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt.
She comes to it again. She kicks it again.
Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and
enters the house.
Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta
just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he
hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown
leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts
to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way,
occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just
muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he
remembers, which is a lot.
WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an
ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize
what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.
They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a
resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other
appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back
to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.
Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and
then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him
in.
