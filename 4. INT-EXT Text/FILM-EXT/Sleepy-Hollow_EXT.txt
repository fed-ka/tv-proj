GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT
An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.
INSERT TITLE:
1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York
THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.
The ugly man glances back again.
His lantern swings wild...
SHATTERS against a tree.
The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
man off his horse...
He hits the ground.
He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.
DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.
The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.
Jagged branches
slit his hands and cheeks.
He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.
He
lifts his bloodied face.
He runs.
IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
underbrush.
HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.
A spur digs into the
snorting steed's already bleeding flank.
The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.
ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.
The shrill WHISTLE of a
SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.
The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
body hits the dirt.
CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
Empty cobblestone streets.
Crooked buildings.
A RAPIDLY
CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.
INSERT TITLE:
New York City
TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
listening.
They rush into an alleyway.
ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.
The BELL is
LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.
No one around.
Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.
CONSTABLE ONE
Where are you?!
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
Here!
Over here!
They hurry to the river's edge.
Down a hill, the MAN,
another constable, stands with his back to us.
He's waist
deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.
MAN
I need your help with this.
Constable Two crosses on the peir above.
Constable One moves
forward, wary.
The MAN grunts, lifting something.
CONSTABLE ONE
Constable Crane?
Ichabod Crane...
is that you?
The MAN turns.
Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.
ICHABOD
Yes, it is me.
But, not only me...
(lifting, struggling)
I found someone here...
He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.
ICHABOD
Someone quite dead.
WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT
The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.
A snobby MAGISTRATE
looks, disgusted.
Constable One and Ichabod wait.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Burn it.
CONSTABLE ONE
Yes, sir.
Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.
Ichabod's dismayed.
ICHABOD
Just a moment... if I may.
It is
possible this man was murdered.
HIGH CONSTABLE
He drowned.
Anyone could see.
ICHABOD
There are surgical ways of telling
how he died... by the water in his
lungs...
Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.
CITY -- DAY
Market town streets bustle.
Filthy.
Pigs roam free.
UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY
TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
burdened horses.
Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
direction.
Ichabod looks out, unnerved.
One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.
There is a dead, worried
look in the man's eyes.
Others stare at Ichabod.
SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY
Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.
He
turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.
Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
limb, twine wrapped round their necks.
SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY
Ichabod walks on with baggage.
The square is empty, a CHURCH
and GRAVEYARD at one end.
The road ahead is bordered by
businesses and homes.
CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.
A criminal sits in
stocks.
A quiet CRYING is HEARD.
Ichabod hears...
He looks for its source.
It's from a window above, LOUDER.
SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.
VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY
ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
with a crow's nest basket atop.
There's a man in the basket
and a huge BELL.
Ichabod ponders this as he continues.
Ahead on a hill: the
grand Van Tassel Manor House.
BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING
The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.
A man climbs
down a rope ladder.
Below, many ARMED MEN gather.
Everyone
grim.
Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.
PHILIPSE
Gather round!
Gather and quiet!
The hour has come to choose for
this night.
Each man's name is
in this box and has been checked.
A box is handed up.
Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
back of the mob.
Ichabod looks...
At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
the forest edge for at least a half mile.
Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.
PHILIPSE
May the Lord watch over him...
(unfolds paper)
"Jonathan Masbath."
Are you here?
JONATHAN (o.s.)
I am.
I take my responsibility.
The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.
His son, YOUNG
MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.
YOUNG MASBATH
No, father.
Wait...
(up to Philipse)
He's already been up once.
Why
does he go again?
JONATHAN
It is a lottery, son.
It just as
easily might have been one of them.
YOUNG MASBATH
Then... I go with you.
JONATHAN
No.
You obey my wishes.
(looks to crowd)
Brom.
Look after him, will you?
Brom steps up, nodding.
Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
then heads to the rope ladder.
Men pat him on the back.
PHILIPSE
Someone leave him a horse.
Young Masbath watches his father go.
Brom coaxes him away.
At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.
ICHABOD
You worry for naught, little man.
Nothing will harm him there.
(looks up, sotto)
It is problems here on the ground
you people need begin to worry
about.
Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.
BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT
The torches burn bright.
ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
Masbath loads a rifle.
THUNDER BOOMS.
Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.
Below, the horse tied at the
base of the tower is spooked.
A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.
Jonathan grips a
rifle, cocks it and moves to look...
At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.
They
sprint past the tower and across the field.
Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.
He crosses back
to peer at the forest.
Bad news...
A thick FOG creeps from the woods.
As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.
All along the
forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...
Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.
JONATHAN
Come out, devil... come....
SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT
... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...
FARM -- NIGHT
... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
sprinting towards his home.
TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
... TOLLS across the deserted square.
Windows go dark.
Shutters are slammed shut.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
... TOLLS.
Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
listen.
Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.
BALTUS
Constable, where are you going!?
... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.
Ichabod chases away.
BALTUS
Come back, sir...
(watches him go)
Madness.
Baltus ushers Katrina back in.
The door slams.
BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT
Ichabod charges across the rocky field.
He slows, awed...
The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.
The horse is
gone.
Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
No sign of Jonathan.
SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT
Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.
It's QUIET... till
HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.
Trees are silhouetted against the sky.
As HOOFBEATS get
LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
touch.
As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.
FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.
WIND begins to BLOW.
BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.
The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
mount.
(No clear view of the Horseman.)
HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.
Jonathan is overtaken.
The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
-- sends Jonathan sprawling.
HOOFBEATS FADE.
Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
through him.
He crawls to retrieve his bow.
Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
and readies it.
Waiting.
A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.
A HORSE SNORTS.
Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.
Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.
The Horseman taps his
sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...
Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.
Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...
THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.
CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
second arrow.
Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!
CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
desperately.
Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
rocks.
CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
face to the dirt.
He closes his eyes.
CLINKING STOPS.
Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
on each side of Jonathan's body.
SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING
Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.
Behind, Ichabod
rides with Magistrate Philipse.
Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.
ICHABOD
The Van Garretts died first; a man
and his son, survived by a wife and
two infants.
And the Widow Windsor
was next...
PHILIPSE
And now Jonathan Masbath.
ICHABOD
(looks back, ponders)
Why would he flee this direction,
with so much open ground to cross
before he reached cover?
PHILIPSE
He would not have gone into the
Western Woods.
No sane man would.
Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
and offers some.
Ichabod declines.
PHILIPSE
Van Ripper there...
Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.
PHILIPSE
... found the body this morning.
(pause)
You do believe now, don't you?
ICHABOD
Believe?
LADY VAN TASSEL
You said yourself.
What mere man
could have downed the Belltower?
ICHABOD
It is a prime tenet of science,
Philipse, that because one thing
appears improbable does not mean
you embrace the utterly fantastical.
PHILIPSE
You need less big words, and more
common sense.
Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.
ICHABOD
What is that you wear?
PHILIPSE
My talisman.
It will, protect
against the Horseman if I show a
brave face.
But, I cannot run.
If
I run in fear, it is worthless.
ICHABOD
Well... so much for common sense.
SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING
Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
boulders.
The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.
BALTUS
Was this Jonathan's?
BROM
Yes.
Seems he panicked across here
and broke two legs.
ICHABOD
Who took the meat?
BALTUS
Must have been the Redman.
A Lenape
Indian lives in the Western Woods.
ICHABOD
These woods of yours sound a bit
crowded, what with all the witches,
ghouls and Indians living there.
Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.
BROM
There's only one Lenape.
He eats
small animals and lost children...
and the occasional constable when he
can get it.
Brom rides.
Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
HORSESHOE.
A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.
Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.
The
doctor and others are there.
Van Ripper waves.
CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY
A coffin in a grave.
Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."
A
CROWD gathered.
Young Masbath broods.
Clergyman Steenwyck
steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.
Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.
Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
In the crowd people whisper.
They steal glances at Ichabod,
who stands with the Van Tassels.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY
Ichabod comes out.
KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.
Doctor Lancaster
peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.
BALTUS
Hail, Constable.
How are you?
ICHABOD
Well enough.
Your gathering does
honor to the deceased.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
(still using spyglass)
We must be a curious sight to him.
ICHABOD
What are you spying on?
DOCTOR LANCASTER
(offers the spyglass)
The Lenape.
He comes to gawk at
civilization from time to time.
ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS
Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...
DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
Do you see the Redskinned bastard?
There he is -- the LENAPE.
A towering savage with misshapen
features covered in tumors.
He ducks away.
BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH
Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.
ICHABOD
He is a behemoth.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
A diseased monster.
BALTUS
If you gentlemen will excuse the
doctor and I... we have financial
matters to discuss.
Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.
KILLIAN
Master Crane, sir.
I'm glad we have
time alone.
You've been told plenty
about the Horseman, I'm certain.
ICHABOD
More than enough, actually.
(tired laugh)
I beg you, no more, please.
KILLIAN
No, sir, no.
If you ask me, I say
you just laid eyes on our murderer
through that glass.
Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.
ICHABOD
Tell me something.
(pause)
What becomes of Young Masbath?
KILLIAN
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
him.
They have children and a good
home and good land.
Ichabod nods.
He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.
In the
DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.
His wife questions his
health, but he holds her off and vomits.
Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.
VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING
Ocher dusk.
Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
ground, miserable.
Young Masbath does not look up.
ICHABOD
Find yourself a place in the servants'
residence and wake me before dawn.
Our first task will be an unsavory one.
Ichabod rides.
Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.
Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.
FATHER STEENWYCK
It is sacrilege!
ICHABOD
I cannot proceed without examining
the previous victims.
Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.
Killian's there.
Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.
FATHER STEENWYCK
Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
stop this.
Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.
FATHER STEENWYCK
I will not allow it.
I will not!
ICHABOD
Protest to my superiors if you like.
FATHER STEENWYCK
Your superiors are two days away!
ICHABOD
Then, you should have left two days
ago, because I have men willing to
help me today.
Ichabod motions.
Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
Steenwyck watches, enraged.
He kicks his horse and rides.
Philipse looks worried.
CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)
A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
exhumed.
Ichabod guides the lifting.
The coffin is put near
the headstone "WINDSOR."
Ichabod looks...
At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
take up the PRAYER.
Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
pried open.
"VAN GARRETT, 1799."
Killian leads the effort
with Young Masbath's aid...
The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
a little BOY.
Young Masbath backs away.
At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
lid.
WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
aghast.
He looks to the men, angry.
ICHABOD
Why was I not told of this?
No answer.
Killian arrives, nods solemnly.
KILLIAN
The Widow Windsor.
ICHABOD
Is that all you say?
Look at her.
KILLIAN
It's not something people speak of
openly.
She did not remarry.
Ichabod kneels, studying.
Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
very far along in a pregnancy.
Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.
He
reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.
He straightens, greatly troubled.
CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING
Ichabod and others restore graves.
Ichabod looks to the
church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.
FATHER STEENWYCK
The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
The Lord will not forgive your sins.
Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
A light glows in Ichabod's window.
LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
bed, fully dressed.
He sits up.
Pause.
He crosses to pick
up "Romeo and Juliet."
He begins to read.
PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK
Ichabod walks with Philipse.
Young Masbath follows with the
horses.
CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.
PHILIPSE
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
a man for stealing a horse.
For
stealing a horse!
And, you dig up
our dead.
ICHABOD
Are you saying I should be frightened?
Is this a message passed on from
Clergyman Steenwyck?
The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.
Young Masbath notices.
PHILIPSE
We are farmers here, not lawyers or
bankers, or even constables.
Every
penny we earn comes from what we
send down the Hudson.
ICHABOD
I know it.
YOUNG MASBATH
Um.... excuse me, sirs...
PHILIPSE
(still to Ichabod)
Because of the Horseman, our migrant
workers flee for their lives.
There
is a danger that our crops will rot.
So, if you are going to help us, you
stop the Horseman.
That is your
task... to kill an undead thing.
Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.
The
sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.
ICHABOD
Listen to what you say....
PHILIPSE
No, you listen!
You may think we are
a pack of superstitious dullards...
ICHABOD
At times I do.
YOUNG MASBATH
Sirs... please!
PHILIPSE
What will it take for you to realize
this is no laughing matter?
The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.
The reins yank
Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.
Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.
A SOUND is HEARD,
distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.
Wind kicks up.
HOOFBEATS
seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.
Philipse looks to the corn field.
A flock of birds alights;
a great sheet of black against the sky.
PHILIPSE
Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...
Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.
HOOFBEATS are
LOUDER, CLOSER.
Ichabod faces the corn field.
The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.
Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.
Ichabod's stunned.
He looks down to draw his flintlock
pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.
A
blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.
The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.
Ichabod follows.
The Horseman draws his sword.
Young Masbath falls in the grass...
Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.
Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.
Philipse has a long way to go before home.
He looks over his
shoulder.
No way he'll make it.
Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.
Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.
The
Horseman is closing, sword held high.
Philipse raises his talisman.
ICHABOD
Philipse!
Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.
The
Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...
Philipse's severed head spins.
His body falls and folds.
Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.
The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.
Daredevil lets out a
SCREECHY CRY.
The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.
Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.
The
Horseman closes.
Ichabod sweats bullets.
FIRES...
The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
rends his uniform without slowing him.
The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.
Ichabod cringes, arms
up... as the Horseman passes.
The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.
With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.
Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
support him, falls, trembling.
THUNDER BELLOWS.
WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.
TOWNSFOLK
are gathered.
Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
Young Masbath, looking up.
BROM (o.s.)
We do not need you, Constable...
Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
sheet under the tree.
Van Ripper's there.
BROM
The men who did this have been taken.
We do not need you here.
Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
horse-drawn cart.
An armed man guards them.
ONE FILTHY MAN
You should thank us.
The killings
will end.
We saved you all!
The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.
BROM
They spend two days in chains.
ICHABOD
Two days... ?
For murder?
FATHER STEENWYCK
For poaching.
Or, would you remake
our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
has given up the ghost?
ICHABOD
Does that look like an animal hanging?
BROM
Looks like an Indian.
Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.
The Lenape
corpse free falls, landing hard.
The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.
Van Ripper and
others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
Ichabod watches, noticing...
The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.
ICHABOD
Wait.
Give me a moment...
Ichabod kneels.
He removes the woven piece, looking across
the diseased Lenape's body.
Something else...
The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.
Ichabod looks
around, finds a twig.
He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.
WINDMILL -- DAY
A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
center post.
Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.
WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY
Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.
The
rotors spin nearby.
Ichabod searches the countryside.
Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.
ICHABOD
What is it?
YOUNG MASBATH
It's payment day.
Loan monies are
given to Baltus the last day each
month.
Almost everyone borrows...
for tools or to hire workers.
Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.
ICHABOD
(points)
Out there.
What do you see?
YOUNG MASBATH
The Western Woods.
ICHABOD
Look again.
A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.
YOUNG MASBATH
Smoke.
Chimney smoke.
Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.
ICHABOD
Are you familiar with magnets?
YOUNG MASBATH
What kind of nuts?
ICHABOD
Not for eating, I assure you.
Watch
here.
Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.
Young Masbath is
amazed, reaching for it.
Ichabod watches him play with it.
YOUNG MASBATH
It's spectacular.
ICHABOD
(smiles, pause)
Yes... I suppose it is.
Keep it.
YOUNG MASBATH
No, I couldn't...
ICHABOD
I have others.
All I need is this.
Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
the straw.
Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.
YOUNG MASBATH
Thank you.
ICHABOD
(nods, almost shy)
Now, hold the bowl steady.
Back to
business.
Young Masbath lifts the bowl.
Ichabod drops in the
needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.
ICHABOD
If the Western Woods are truly the
Devil's Glen, we will see for
ourselves.
YOUNG MASBATH
(uneasy)
Father said witches live there.
ICHABOD
Witches do not exist.
However...
Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.
ICHABOD
Not long ago, I would have said the
same for Headless Horseman.
KATRINA (o.s.)
Constable... !
Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.
KATRINA
I need to speak with you.
Alone.
VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY
Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.
A heated argument.
KATRINA
Why would you do such a thing?
ICHABOD
No stone may be left unturned.
It
may appear harsh...
KATRINA
I have misjudged you I think.
I did
not imagine you were so cruel.
ICHABOD
You are not regarding it in full.
The Widow Windsor had been run
through by a sword.
I followed the
bloodless wound, a wound whose path
I could not comprehend till I had
seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
KATRINA
What are you on about?
ICHABOD
The child she carried was eight
months grown at least... near to
birthing.
The sword had pierced its
tiny heart exactly.
KATRINA
Must I hear this?
ICHABOD
There was no blind stabbing.
This
singular thrust found its target
omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
certain the unborn child died with
its mother.
KATRINA
And this gives worth to butchery?
ICHABOD
It was not butchery.
KATRINA
What is it then?
Scientific method?
How can any of this matter in the
slightest?
ICHABOD
I have no solution for its meaning
yet, but I could not just ignore it.
KATRINA
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
desires, Ichabod Crane.
He follows
with you to avenge his father's death.
That I understand.
But, what do you
want?
ICHABOD
To avenge his father, and the others.
KATRINA
But, why?
Tell me why.
Ichabod struggles for a reply.
KATRINA
You falter with your answer because
you strive without putting the whole
of your heart into it.
Can't you see?
You'll bring dignity to the dead even
if you have to chop them into little
pieces to do it.
ICHABOD
(fed up, growing anger)
If it had been surgery on a living
person, done to save that person's
life, you would not question it.
Not
for a moment.
So, let me be the first
to tell you, dear girl... on the other
side of these sheltering mountains, a
whole world has advanced beyond such
plebeian thinking as yours.
And
someday, no matter how much you fear
it, that world will come to roust
Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Katrina storms away.
Ichabod's already regretting.
BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
loaded for expedition.
At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
slows, looking to the wreckage.
At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.
Ichabod circles the tower.
With a sigh, he rides to join
Young Masbath. They head into the woods.
WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
Dark, dense and creepy.
Ichabod and Young Masbath move
through.
Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.
ICHABOD
What is it?
YOUNG MASBATH
Listen.
ICHABOD
(listens, looks)
I hear nothing.
YOUNG MASBATH
No crickets or cicadas calling.
No
bird songs.
Stark quiet.
Ichabod notes this unhappily.
WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY
Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.
The
needle spins.
The bowl is turned to match notches.
Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.
ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:
A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
they ride, FOLLOWS.
WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY
Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.
They stop, uneasy.
Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.
An ill-fitting door
covers the mouth.
The chimney spews smoke.
ICHABOD
We have apparently arrived.
CAVE HOME -- DAY
The horses are tied to a tree.
Ichabod walks to the cave
door.
Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.
CAVE HOME -- DAY
Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.
Through the
trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.
CAVE HOME -- DAY
Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.
ICHABOD
We are leaving.
YOUNG MASBATH
What happened?
Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
woods, glancing back.
Young Masbath follows.
WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING
No rain.
Dark.
A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.
YOUNG MASBATH
Follow the Indian trail to where the
sun dies.
To the tree of the dead.
(looking back)
Maybe we passed it by.
ICHABOD
How could something named "the tree
of the dead" fail to draw attention?
A BIRD CRIES OUT.
Ichabod's startled, looking up.
The BIRD
is HEARD ALIGHTING.
Leaves float downwards.
ICHABOD
We should not go much further in
this murk.
YOUNG MASBATH
Should we go back?
ICHABOD
We are far from the Hollow.
(dismounts, troubled)
Loath to say it... better to get our
backs against a tree and stay till
morning.
WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT
Horses are tied.
Ichabod is seated against a tree.
A
campfire burns.
Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
his chest, staring to treetops.
Leaves and branches shift in the wind.
Bats fly wildly.
YOUNG MASBATH
What does it mean... climb down to
the Horseman's soulless place?
ICHABOD
"Let loose his silent shrieking."
Who knows, till we work at it?
I
admit not being anxious to find out.
(pause)
"He who holds the Horseman's desire
will guide his reaping hand."
Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
other than extinguishing lives.
A SNAPPING BRANCH.
Ichabod raises his pistol.
ICHABOD
(to Young Masbath)
Do not move.
Ichabod rises.
He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
forward.
Foliage is thick.
CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.
Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
branch.
He tosses the branch to the foliage...
SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.
Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.
ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
moving swiftly at Ichabod...
Ichabod spins, blindsided.
Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!
The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...
The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.
Ichabod comes to stare down.
Young Masbath arrives.
They
both look to the beast, horrified.
The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
one head blown open to brain and gore.
Its living head
lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.
Ichabod step up with pistol.
FIRES.
MEWING STOPS.
ICHABOD
What God-forsaken hell is this?
Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.
Something
catches his eye.
ICHABOD
Christ...
Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.
Distant fire.
WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING
Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
vomiting flame out all orifices.
Ichabod approaches.
Embers swirl everywhere.
The Old
Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.
Headless.
TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT
Much commotion.
A MOB in front of the home marked
"LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."
Steenwyck addresses the rabble.
FATHER STEENWYCK
You all stand idle, while this man
goes about with a book of secrets and
a bag filled with magic.
You all
stand idle, while the shadow of the
Devil falls over our town.
Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.
FATHER STEENWYCK
I say, if you do nothing, you share
in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!
Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
rides to one side of the shouting crowd.
KILLIAN
Listen to me!
Do you want to save
your crops?
Or would you rather see
your farms go to ruin?
FATHER STEENWYCK
How is he saving our farms?
How?
Ichabod Crane has brought into our
midst the soulless, moldering corpse
of a heretic!
TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.
The mob
makes way.
Steenwyck cheers them.
FATHER STEENWYCK
Let her burn!
Let her burn!
Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.
The Crone's
corpse is thrown in the fire.
Cheers all around.
At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
Masbath holds.
Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
book.
Ichabod joins the struggle.
Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.
Other men grab Ichabod.
One punches Ichabod in the face.
Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.
Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.
KATRINA
Stop this!
Leave them alone!
A SHOT RINGS OUT.
Chaos halts.
Everyone turns, quieting.
The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.
BROM
Let them go
(pointing)
Are you going to beat an orphaned
child, imbecile?
Masbath is released, along with the ledger.
Steenwyck moves
forward, pushing people aside.
FATHER STEENWYCK
Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
Brom Bones?
BROM
Only for the moment.
FATHER STEENWYCK
You side with him in this?
BROM
No.
I agree he has only made matters
worse.
But, that will change, if you
listen.
He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.
Brom hefts
the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.
BROM
Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
each day and night to watch over the
Hollow.
We will stalk the border of
the Western Woods and haunt the
Horseman for a change, with rifles
like this... and slugs like this...
Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.
It WHISTLES.
BROM
Hollowed out and filled with powder.
Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.
BROM
Constable Crane is not the only one
who fights with science on his side.
ICHABOD
I fired upon the Horseman and the
bullet did nothing.
BROM
You must have missed your mark.
ICHABOD
I hit him square.
BROM
(to the crowd)
I say... if the Horseman is solid
enough to take the lives of our
people, he's solid enough to feel
this...
Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.
FIRES.
PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.
Smoke wafts.
THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING
Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING
Rain.
Ichabod comes out.
Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
bringing the horses.
LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.)
Good morrow, Constable.
Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Returning to the Western Woods?
ICHABOD
Yes, actually.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Use caution.
ICHABOD
(nods, studies her)
Do you know... I think those are the
first words I have heard from you my
entire time here.
LADY VAN TASSEL
As my husband says, a wife should be
always like an echo, and at the same
time, quite unlike an echo.
(off Ichabod's confusion)
Like an echo, she should speak only
when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
should never try to have the last
word, or, at least that is what he
believes.
Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.
BALTUS
Constable... did you notice anything
out of the ordinary during the night?
Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.
ICHABOD
Um... I... I did not... no.
Why?
BALTUS
Sarah has gone missing... my servant
girl.
Her things are gone.
Damn it.
She has joined the migration out of
town.
(to Lady Van Tassel)
What about breakfast, woman?
Or, am
I to starve to death?
Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.
ICHABOD
I should be going... good day to you.
Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.
Baltus watches from the
porch, disgruntled.
He goes in.
WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
Heavy rain.
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.
YOUNG MASBATH
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
means she was not killed by the
Hessian.
Someone only tried to make
it look that way.
ICHABOD
You grow sharper by the minute, little
man.
It boggles my mind, but I begin
to prefer your company over all others.
YOUNG MASBATH
Well... I'm one of the few people who
likes you.
ICHABOD
(laughs)
True enough.
YOUNG MASBATH
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?
And
why?
ICHABOD
Good questions, deserving answers, of
which we are in short supply.
A SOUND is HEARD.
Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.
ICHABOD
Quicken pace.
Ichabod rides faster.
Young Masbath keeps up.
FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.
Ichabod halts Gunpowder
and climbs clumsily off.
ICHABOD
Ride on.
Young Masbath obeys.
Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
into forest growth, backtracking.
INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.
A
HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.
He pushes through branches...
Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.
ICHABOD
Halt and turn.
I have a pistol aimed
at your head.
The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.
Katrina.
KATRINA
It is only me.
ICHABOD
Katrina.
Why do you follow?
KATRINA
I apologize if I worried you.
ICHABOD
A woman should not be out alone in
these woods.
KATRINA
But, I am not alone, am I?
I only
wished to see what you were up to,
and...
(takes out WHITE ROSE)
To thank you.
Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.
ICHABOD
Come along.
WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY
Raining still.
Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...
A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.
Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
weeds will not grow.
Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.
YOUNG MASBATH
You were right... it does draw
attention to itself.
Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
He circles the incredibly wide trunk.
There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
disgustingly scarred.
Ichabod approaches.
He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.
ICHABOD
Blood.
KATRINA
What did you say?
Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.
YOUNG MASBATH
What is it?
ICHABOD
Stay back.
At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
the suture.
It sounds hollow.
Ichabod begins to chop.
He pulls away loose bark.
The tree drips more blood and a
clear goo.
Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
festering suture.
KATRINA
What are you doing?
ICHABOD
Just... keep where you are.
Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.
Ichabod keeps
chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
bend it.
It's not easy.
Ichabod struggles.
Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.
Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.
Ichabod recoils.
Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.
It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
roots grown around and into the flesh.
Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.
FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
within the dewy innards.
KATRINA
My God... what has happened?
ICHABOD
He... he tries to take the heads...
they will not pass.
He looks to the branches towering above.
ICHABOD
Must be some sort of gateway.
But,
why this place... ?
YOUNG MASBATH
We should go.
ICHABOD
Why this tree?
Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.
Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."
ICHABOD
(to himself)
"Climb down to the Horseman's
soulless place."
(to Masbath)
Bring the shovel.
WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY
Rain.
Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
knees.
He's watching the tree.
Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
pile of mud.
Ichabod hands up the shovel.
KATRINA
Masbath, we've found it.
Young Masbath goes to the grave.
Ichabod pulls at thick
burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.
Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.
ICHABOD
It cannot be true.
WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
uniform.
The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.
ICHABOD
Why is it every grave I open holds
a new mystery inside?
KATRINA
The skull is gone.
ICHABOD
Yes.
I did notice that, thank you.
Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.
LIGHTNING.
THUNDER.
He stares at the bones.
ICHABOD
This is his silent shrieking... and
his desire, to reclaim his head.
Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.
ICHABOD
"He who holds fast the Horseman's
desire will guide his reaping hand."
(pause)
Someone controls the Horseman.
KATRINA (o.s.)
Ichabod!
Ichabod turns, looks...
Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.
Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...
The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.
Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
Young Masbath along as he flees.
At the tree, the suture swells.
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.
A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.
At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
looking back.
From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...
They hit the ground running.
Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.
The Horseman disappears in the forest.
ICHABOD
His next victim is chosen!
(to Masbath)
Give me distance, then guide her
back to the Hollow.
Ichabod runs towards the horses.
YOUNG MASBATH
Constable!
WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.
BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.
FORESTS -- DAY
A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.
THUNDER is
HEARD.
The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
Brom aboard.
Brom looks skyward.
The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.
Distant
HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.
POUNDING.
Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.
The HOOFBEATS grow
LOUDER and PASS, far away.
Brom turns in the saddle and
WHISTLES.
He kicks his horse and rides.
KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY
Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.
At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.
The Horseman ties
the sack to the saddle and leaps up.
Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.
The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.
Brom aims... FIRES!
BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
Daredevil.
Daredevil keeps going.
The Horseman's smoldering
body is left "face down."
Brom halts his horse.
He climbs down, pleased.
The Horseman moves.
Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.
The Horseman gets on his knees.
Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.
He fills the gun
from his powder horn.
The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.
The
blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.
Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.
The Horseman charges.
Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.
The Horseman is on him.
Brom swings the rifle, blocking.
Sparks fly.
The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.
UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.
Brom
goes down, his rifle sent flying.
Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.
Brom flees.
The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...
THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.
The Horseman runs towards Brom.
Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.
Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.
The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.
He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
to skewer...
Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.
AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
horseback.
They hold a moment, watching.
Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
implements propped there.
Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
curved blades, one in per hand.
The Horseman rises.
Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.
The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
free hand.
Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.
ICHABOD
For what it's worth...
FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.
At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.
Brom steps up, scythes ready.
He and the Horseman go at it.
Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.
At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.
Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.
Brom swings the scythes.
The Horseman avoids.
Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.
He swings
the sickle. The Horseman blocks.
The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
countering every strike, METAL RINGING.
Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
off.
Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.
The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.
Ichabod swings the sickle blade...
Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.
The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...
The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.
Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.
He looks up.
The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
pull the blade from his body.
Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.
BROM
We cannot win this.
They head towards the forest.
Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.
He
strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.
RIVERBANK -- DAY
Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.
Brom points.
BROM
There...
They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.
They
jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.
BROM
Go to the front and guide it.
Ichabod goes.
Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.
Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.
The barge lurches, set free.
Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.
it moves swiftly,
caught in rain swollen current.
Brom looks back.
No Horseman.
He leaves the scythe and
moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.
BROM
Let's see him catch us now.
Ichabod looks to the shore.
Horror.
ICHABOD
Look.
LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
bank with Axe and sword.
Daredevil near.
BROM
We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.
Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.
At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...
Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...
SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.
ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
where it will intercept the barge.
BROM
My Christ...
The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.
Ichabod and Brom are thrown.
The barge is trapped.
The Horseman nears.
Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.
Ichabod holds
up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.
The Horseman steps on board.
Ichabod swings.
The Horseman's
axe cracks the pole in half...
The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
clean through.
It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.
The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
out as Ichabod goes...
SMASHING through the ice and under.
UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
above. He's pulled down by undertow.
ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
up, gasping, choking on rain.
He treads water, looking to the barge.
ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER
Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
him, chopping with sword.
Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...
FADES OUT/IN
SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Young Masbath lies awake.
A glint of light crosses the
window.
Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.
THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
the distance.
Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.
VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT
The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
house.
We cannot make out the person.
Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.
He hides against
one tree, leans to look...
The light enters forest.
Young Masbath follows.
TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY
WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.
A CROWD loots the
town's general store.
Provisions are passed along man to man
and loaded on wheelbarrows.
All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
windows with lumber.
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.
ICHABOD
Panic has set in.
They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
of the "NOTARY."
Ichabod looks off...
DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
Much activity there as well.
ICHABOD
Sanctuary.
Or, so they hope.
Families put up tents all around the church within the
bordering wrought-iron fence.
Supplies abound.
People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.
NOTARY -- DAY
Ichabod exits.
All around is the commotion in the square as
before.
No telling who it was who just fled.
CHURCH -- NIGHT
Quiet night.
The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.
MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.
UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.
FOREST -- NIGHT
Lantern light moves, far ahead.
Ichabod follows.
FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT
Ichabod stops, hidden.
He can see the light ahead, but it is
no longer in motion.
He advances.
FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT
A lantern sits on a rock.
On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.
Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.
The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.
His grunts
and gasps are particularly desperate.
He's all over the
woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.
Ichabod swallows, inches closer.
Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.
Ichabod's eyes widen.
Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
deep in her palm.
Blood flows.
She rubs her cut hand over
her partner's arching back, smearing blood.
Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
trailing blood.
The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.
Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING
Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.
BALTUS
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
meeting.
This time he is determined
to have you forced out, or worse.
ICHABOD
How did you hear this?
BALTUS
He came to me.
He promised great
violence.
Said I should cast you out
for my own protection.
(troubled pause)
I must speak honestly.
There is no
reason to think he will not meet with
success.
Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.
The
CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.
BALTUS
That is the meeting bell already
calling.
With the murder of Killian
and Brom, no one sees any good from
you.
If... if you were to leave...
you might be saving your own life.
Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.
They shake.
ICHABOD
I appreciate your concern.
I thank
you, sir.
Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.
He runs.
Masbath runs to him.
Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.
YOUNG MASBATH
(mounting his horse)
What now?
Where is she?
ICHABOD
Things have become complicated.
Katrina is at the mill.
Ride ahead,
find her and bring her to meet me
outside the church.
Find her at all
costs.
Quickly.
They ride, fast.
FOREST -- DAY
A conjuring pile of straw burns.
Gloved hands unfold a paper
filled with clippings of human hair.
The hair is sprinkled
on the fire.
A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.
The figure turns to
remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.
The skull is placed at center in the flames.
It's teeth are
sharp, cut to points.
The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.
CHURCH -- DAY
In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
People inhabit the tents.
THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY
Raining hard.
Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.
BALTUS
Hurry along.
The meeting has most
certainly already begun.
We do not
want Steenwyck as our enemy.
Lady Van Tassel trails.
WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...
Just off the road, a tree falls...
The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.
The horse falls.
Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.
Baltus looks back, halting.
Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.
Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
Daredevil, stops.
Calm.
He takes his axe in hand.
CHURCH -- DAY
Storming.
The meeting is letting out.
Near the churchyard
gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
cart.
Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.
KATRINA
What is so urgent?
ICHABOD
Come with me.
Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.
KATRINA
Why have I not seen your face for so
long?
You look much better.
She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
agreements there.
ICHABOD
Explain these.
I found them secreted
away in the sewing room.
Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.
ICHABOD
Why... why have I scrambled and run
and clawed in all directions, only to
find you against me?
He stares at her.
Katrina stares back, in a small way
defeated.
She looks for an out, but there is none.
KATRINA
I have been reading your journal.
I'm sorry.
I found it too fascinating
to resist.
(pause, ashamed)
I rode to catch up with you at the
Notary, out of curiosity.
Before I
found you though, I overheard what you
were said.
ICHABOD
It was you there?
KATRINA
When... when you spoke father's name
along with accusations, I could not
believe it.
I had to hide these... at
least till I could confront him myself.
ICHABOD
And, what did he say?
KATRINA
He did not do these things.
If you
knew him, you would realize...
ICHABOD
What did he say, Katrina?
KATRINA
I have not been able to face him yet.
ICHABOD
The loans give the land to your father.
It does not matter survivors are still
on their farms.
They could be thrown
off... tomorrow... a year from now.
KATRINA
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
why I hid them.
ICHABOD
What would you have me believe?
KATRINA
(tiring, angry)
If you think I am behind this, say it.
ICHABOD
The name Van Tassel is blackened.
You
share that name.
KATRINA
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
Say it, out and out.
Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.
ICHABOD
Katrina...
KATRINA
Speak the words, Constable.
What is
stopping you?
What has happened to your
ability to transcend sentimentality?
Emotions tear at him.
Rain seems to pound down harder.
KATRINA
Oh, no.
No.
Please... don't dare stand
looking as if you still care for me,
after all that you have said.
If I were
to confess, would that ease your
suffering?
Would that make it easier
for you to hate me?!
A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.
Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.
BALTUS
The Horseman is coming!
He's barely hanging on.
He stops, practically falling off,
running towards Katrina and Ichabod.
BALTUS
Save me...
KATRINA
Father?
BALTUS
He killed her...
Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.
HOOFBEATS are HEARD.
BALTUS
The Horseman has killed her.
Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.
Baltus runs headlong to the church.
KATRINA
Father!
Katrina runs after Baltus.
Ichabod backs away, watching the
Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.
Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.
The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.
Men, women and
children run for cover all along the square.
Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...
The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.
The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
again.
Same result.
Daredevil freaks out.
CHURCH -- DAY
Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
to the ground inside the gate.
The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.
The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.
CHURCH -- DAY
The Horseman circles, under fire.
Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.
Men fire down from the belfry.
Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
rain as slugs hit without effect.
AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
heading to the town square.
CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY
The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
of ROPE off a hitching post.
CHURCH -- DAY
The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.
He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.
CHURCH -- DAY
Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...
Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
his saddle pommel.
The Horseman strides forward, sword out.
Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.
He is held there
awkwardly, gurgling blood.
The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING
It's getting dark.
Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
A few of the Hollow's residents are here.
Young Masbath gets
up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.
Ichabod walks without waiting.
YOUNG MASBATH
She's the one who controlled the
Horseman, isn't she, sir?
Sir?
(no answer)
ICHABOD
I need time for thinking.
Without you
hanging on my coattails for a change.
Ichabod keeps walking.
Young Masbath stops, wounded.
WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT
Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.
The whole area
is bright from the light off a giant fire.
There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
twisted tree.
The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
and through every branch to lick the sky.
FOREST -- DAY
Dawn.
Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.
He stares
at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
Gunpowder is tied to a tree.
BIRDS SING.
The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.
He thumbs pages
absently, just keeps staring off.
FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)
A fire burns in a circle of rocks.
Ichabod's ledger is
thrown in.
The pages catch quickly.
Ichabod watches, then walks away.
He's about to climb onto
Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
digs out a BOOK.
He walks back to the fire, throws it on...
"Romeo and Juliet."
Flames devour it.
WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY
The clearing is silent.
The twisted tree still stands,
smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.
VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT
A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
orchard.
Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.
ICHABOD
Half now.
Half when we reach the
city.
Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.
Van Ripper takes the
baggage.
Ichabod looks to the Manor House.
Only one light
shines, in a second floor window.
Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.
Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.
ICHABOD
This is farewell.
YOUNG MASBATH
Take me with you.
There's nothing
left for me here.
ICHABOD
I cannot.
(bends to Masbath)
You should not worry.
(pause, sorrow)
Van Ripper and his wife will look
after you.
They will.
You will be
well cared for.
Young Masbath hugs.
Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.
ICHABOD
I am sorry.
(quietly)
Forgive me.
I failed you.
Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
unbearable.
He climbs in the coach.
YOUNG MASBATH
Do not go, Constable.
How can you
leave?
INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
his eyes.
He pounds twice on the coach wall.
OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.
The coach starts.
Young Masbath follows.
The coach picks up speed on the long
straight road.
Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.
TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT
Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.
A few people
in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.
THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.
TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT
The coach comes to Lancaster's.
Ichabod climbs out before it
even stops fully, satchel in hand.
He hurries...
CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT
Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.
ICHABOD
Open the door.
Open up, damn it!
(pounds, shouting)
Lady van Tassel is alive.
The Horseman
is her puppet.
Please...
The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
Frightened people peer out from behind.
HUGE FARMER
Aren't we rid of you?
ICHABOD
Listen to me.
Lady Van Tassel has
faked her death.
I need able men...
HUGE FARMER
She's dead, and you have gone mad.
ICHABOD
No...
HUGE FARMER
(steps forward)
Get out!
Isn't it enough that you have
ruined this town?
Go!
Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...
At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.
ICHABOD
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
VAN RIPPER
Yes.
Here...
Van Ripper hold up a rifle.
Ichabod holds out his hand.
ICHABOD
May I see it?
Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.
Ichabod
immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.
ICHABOD
Get down.
Hurry!
Van Ripper climbs off.
Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.
ICHABOD
Sorry.
Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.
FOREST -- NIGHT
In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.
Gloved hands
reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.
A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
heart with an iron nail through it.
Katrina's hair is added
and the pile is lit to burn.
Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
tied behind his back.
Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
nearby.
She looks to Katrina, who stirs.
Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.
THUNDER is
HEARD.
Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.
WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT
The wind tosses leaves in swirls.
The twisted tree opens
wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.
THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.
FOREST -- NIGHT
Katrina sits up, groggy.
Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.
KATRINA
You... you are alive.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Am I?
Or, are you and Young Masbath
dead along with me?
Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.
YOUNG MASBATH
She commands the Horseman.
LADY VAN TASSEL
And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
you say?
It is almost over.
THUNDER again.
Wind starts to pick up.
LADY VAN TASSEL
(of the wind)
He rides tonight.
KATRINA
Father saw you die.
LADY VAN TASSEL
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
looming over me as I fled.
Things I
wanted him to see.
But, as long as
I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
me.
Baltus did not stay enough to
see that.
He ran as a coward,
unfettered by my fate.
YOUNG MASBATH
Then, whose body was it... ?
LADY VAN TASSEL
The precious servant girl Sarah.
I
killed her and kept her body hidden,
till I needed it.
And, when I
return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
version of the truth will come to
pass.
(faking meekness)
I mean, there I was that fateful day,
following Baltus into the woods.
I
did not know what he was up to...
where he was going.
I worried for
his safety.
Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
with, feels a rock and clutches it.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
liason with a common servant.
A girl
who had apparently become his secret
love.
KATRINA
No one will believe your lies, whore.
LADY VAN TASSEL
This whore will see your mouth shut
forever very soon.
But... I am not
going to kill you.
Not me...
She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.
LADY VAN TASSEL
He will have that honor.
WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT
The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.
They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.
LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT
Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.
FOREST -- NIGHT
Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.
LADY VAN TASSEL
(mock sorrow)
Woe is me... that spying on my husband
in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
I wandered in the Western Woods...
dazed... nearly blind from terror.
Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.
LADY VAN TASSEL
And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
having barely survived the elements...
(more emoting)
By sheer luck I found my way back to
the Hollow.
But... what do I find
here... ?
My dear, sweet step-daughter
Katrina is dead.
Why has God forsaken
her?
Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.
LADY VAN TASSEL
(of herself, pleased)
No one will suspect this sad woman who
has been through such an ordeal.
With
only the empty solace of her money and
land to comfort her.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.
ICHABOD
Katrina!
FOREST -- NIGHT
ICHABOD is HEARD.
Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.
KATRINA
Murderer!
Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.
Katrina runs.
Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...
But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
her back to the ground.
Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
forehead, bleeding, pissed.
LADY VAN TASSEL
You've been a naughty girl.
Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.
Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.
They flee.
KATRINA
Ichabod!
Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Little bitch.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT
Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...
KATRINA (o.s.)
(far away)
Ichabod!
Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.
FOREST -- NIGHT
Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.
KATRINA
Ichabod!
YOUNG MASBATH
Here we are!
BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
in no hurry.
Wind kicks hard.
HOOFBEATS are HEARD.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Run, Katrina!
Fast as your pretty
legs will carry you.
It makes no
difference.
ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.
Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Nothing will stop him now!
At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.
ICHABOD
Climb up!
YOUNG MASBATH
Lady Van Tassel...
ICHABOD
I know.
Hold on.
With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
Katrina unties Masbath's hands.
HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Olly-olly oxen-free!
Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.
At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
horseback.
Full speed ahead.
ICHABOD
Christ.
THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.
Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.
KATRINA
Where are we going?
ICHABOD
I do not know.
Away.
YOUNG MASBATH
Here he comes!
Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
Closing fast.
Breakneck pace.
ICHABOD
We might make it to the church.
Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.
KATRINA
Masbath... !
He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
lantern at the Horseman.
It smashes on the trail.
ICHABOD
Damn it, boy, get back here!
Young Masbath slides back.
Katrina helps him.
YOUNG MASBATH
What can we do?
ICHABOD
Take the reins.
Young Masbath takes them.
Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
over his shoulder and starts back.
Katrina grips him.
ICHABOD
Masbath is right.
We must do something.
She releases.
Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
struggling to open a storage box.
Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.
Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.
KATRINA
Ichabod!
Ichabod looks.
The Horseman rides up, swinging...
Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.
The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
other side of the trail... coming along side.
Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.
ICHABOD
Keep him off!
Block him!
Masbath guides the horses over.
The Horseman must fall
behind to avoid the wheels.
The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.
Ichabod bounces, falling...
He hangs off the side of the coach.
Katrina climbs to offer her hand.
Ichabod offers the saw.
ICHABOD
Take it!
Katrina takes the saw.
Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
for better purchase.
He grips the coach door.
It opens...
Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.
He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...
Ichabod pulls himself inside.
BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.
Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.
He climbs.
Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
the Horseman again.
The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
the back corner of the coach.
The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...
Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...
BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.
The
Horseman hangs on with his other hand.
The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
it's now all mush and bone.
Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
taking the saw from Katrina.
ICHABOD
Move forward!
Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.
ICHABOD
Go!
Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.
ICHABOD
Help her.
Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.
The
Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.
Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.
Katrina takes it.
Behind, the Horseman swings.
Ichabod blocks with the saw.
Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
Bareback.
Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.
The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...
Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
life.
His feet drag on the trail.
Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
to kill Katrina.
He raises his sword...
Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...
Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.
He shoves off with his feet.
The Horseman swings.... missing.
The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.
The coach careens out of control.
It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
throwing the Horseman.
The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.
FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.
Young Masbath
and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
clutching his previously wounded shoulder.
YOUNG MASBATH
What now?
ICHABOD
I doubt that's the end.
KATRINA
The church.
ICHABOD
He moves too fast.
Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.
The trail
behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.
KATRINA
What was that?
ICHABOD
His horse.
They start moving.
Ichabod looks around.
He sees...
ICHABOD
There...
Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
seen against the sky.
Katrina and Young Masbath run.
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
heading to the windmill.
Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.
Ichabod looks over his shoulder.
Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.
ICHABOD
He's coming!
The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.
ICHABOD
Hurry!
The Horseman readies a battle axe.
Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
ladder and in.
Katrina next.
The Horseman is almost there.
Ichabod follows Katrina.
He gets in, feet dangling.
The
Horseman dismounts...
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.
UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.
His axe
exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.
WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
Masbath and Katrina come out.
Rotors spin behind them.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...
WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
Katrina helps them onto the roof.
KATRINA
Quickly, close it.
ICHABOD
No.
(takes lantern, points)
Get to the crest of the roof and be
ready to jump.
YOUNG MASBATH
Jump?
Jump where?
WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT
Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
the rotors spin close.
ICHABOD
The blades will carry us to the ground.
Face front and wait for me.
KATRINA
I... I can't do this.
ICHABOD
We have no choice.
Ichabod moves back to the trap door.
Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
long distance between them and the ground.
ICHABOD
Be ready...
Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.
ICHABOD
Now!
WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT
Young Masbath jumps.
Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...
They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.
The
rotor begins its downwards swing.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.
Masbath, Katrina
and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.
BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
lighting up the night.
On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.
Masbath drops.
Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.
They hit the ground.
Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
shoulder.
They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.
ICHABOD
Okay... come on...
Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.
Running.
Lightning flashes across the sky.
THUNDER RUMBLES.
A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...
SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.
The rotors bust apart.
Splinters of
burning wood spin all directions.
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
running.
There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.
IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
burning debris.
His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
something horrible...
In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.
ICHABOD
(as this registers)
Oh, no...
Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...
SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.
Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Should have stayed away, Constable.
Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
to find it empty.
He moves forward.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Keep back, or I kill her.
She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
Katrina ceases struggling.
Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.
Lady
Van Tassel shoots a glance...
LADY VAN TASSEL
See him...
Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.
LADY VAN TASSEL
You cannot kill what is already dead.
ICHABOD
Let her go!
LADY VAN TASSEL
Yes... yes.
I think I will...
Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
against it.
ICHABOD
No!
The cart rolls downhill.
Ichabod moves forward.
Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
missing.
Ichabod backs off.
DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.
The Horseman starts running to meet it.
UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Say goodbye to her.
Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.
Ichabod avoids, puts all
his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.
Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...
The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.
DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...
She lands hard...
The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.
UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.
He runs towards it.
Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.
He falls.
DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.
The Horseman is catching up.
UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.
Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
with the wooden plank.
She's out.
Ichabod scrambles to his feet.
DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
hair as she falls to her knees and screams.
UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.
He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.
DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
by her hair... raises his sword...
UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...
ICHABOD
Horseman!
The skull spins through the air...
The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...
Catches the skull.
Katrina runs.
Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
Together, they back away from the Horseman.
The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
shoulders, to its rightful place.
THUNDER POUNDS.
TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
Horseman's throat and grip the skull.
Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.
The Horseman's reformation continues.
Muscle forms.
Liquids
become solids.
He is made whole once more, the same evil,
human face we saw in Baltus' stories.
He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.
Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.
The Horseman replaces his
sward and climbs into the saddle.
He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
They are so exhausted they fall down.
Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
Horseman does not want him either.
The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.
He rides away with her.
Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.
They look at each other,
then kiss gratefully.
Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.
ICHABOD
How are you?
YOUNG MASBATH
Tired.
Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.
Masbath comes over.
Group hug.
Lightning brightens the farmland around them.
WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT
HOOFBEATS.
The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
on Lady Van Tassel.
Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.
Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.
She turns her
head and looks forward.
She screams.
The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.
Daredevil picks up speed...
Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
striking the Horseman.
For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
OF LIGHT, entering the tree.
Silence and smoke.
At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
sticks out from the tight-shut suture.
The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.
NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
A bright, busy day in New York.
A coach pulls up to
Ichabod's home.
Ichabod is the driver.
He gets off, goes
and opens the coach door.
He helps Katrina down.
Next,
Young Masbath sticks his head out.
Ichabod goes about unloading bags.
Katrina holds Young
Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.
