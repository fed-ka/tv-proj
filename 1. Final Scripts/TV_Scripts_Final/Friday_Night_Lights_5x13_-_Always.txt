      EXT. DILLON - BEAUTY SHOTS - MORNING (D1)11

      Early morning in Dillon.  As we ve never seen it before -- 
      dressed for Christmas.  Dillonershanging their lights;  
      Ray s B.B.Q.all dressed up for the holiday; Buddy s Bar 
      looking merry, at the Landing Strip two strippers dressed as 
      elves stand out front, welcome the lunch crowd.

      CHYRONREADS: 

      FIVE DAYS TO THE TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL STATE CHAMPIONSHIP

      EXT. EAST DILLON FIELD - POPS - MONDAY MORNING (D1)22

    The LIONS sit in directors chairs answering questions from 
    the LOCAL and some NATIONAL TV REPORTERS.  VINCE, LUKE, 
      TINKER, BUDDY JR., HASTINGS.  It feels strangely like a 
      callback to the pilot, except a lot of red replaces the blue. 

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    How do you feel about the shut down 
                    of the East Dillon program?

                                  TINKER
                    It s a conspiracy.

                                  VINCE
                    I don t wanna comment on that.

                                  LUKE
                    I think it s a mistake is how I 
                    feel.

                                  HASTINGS
                    It blows.

                                  BUDDY JR.
                    It sucks.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    How does it make you feel that this 
                    is likely the last game of football 
                    you ll ever play?

                                  TINKER
                    You re a jackass.

      CLOSE ON VINCE -- Hero shot.  Thoughtful.  

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    I was watching the new kid Sterling 
                    -- looks like he s going to make a 
                    helluvaback.

                                  VINCE
                    He s a Panther.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    I m thinking next year.  Rumor is 
                    you ll be quarterbacking the 
                    Panthers.  Best of Panthers combined 
                    with the best of the Lions.  They re 
                    calling it the Superteam.

      Vince sees Tinker, JESS, a few scrubs watching.  They won t 
    be part of the Superteam.

                                  VINCE
                    I don t wanna talk about that.  I 
                    wanna talk about this Friday.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    What about this Friday?

                                  VINCE
                    About how the East Dillon Lions are 
                    going to win state.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    Is that a wish or a promise?

                                  VINCE
                    It s a fact.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    Rumor has it you ll be coaching the 
                      Superteamnext year.

      COACH TAYLOR thinks, chews, then--

                                  TAYLOR
                    No comment.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    No comment?  Really?  Because we ve 
                    heard the offer they made you is 
                    pretty sweet.

      Taylor has no response but we PRELAP:

                    around that often.

      INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - MORNING (D1)33

      Eric hangs a strand of lights over the fireplace.  TAMI is 
      readying for the day.

                                  TAYLOR
                    ... Five years.  That s security.  
                    That s his and her closets.

                                  TAMI
                    What is that supposed to mean?

                                  TAYLOR
                    It means, that house we looked at 
                    couple of years ago?  We could get 
                    a house like that.

                                  TAMI
                    Oh my God, Eric--

                                  TAYLOR
                    You re the one who wanted a house, 
                    now we can afford to--

                                  TAMI
                    It s not fair.  I ve been following 
                    you, Eric.  This whole time.  Now I 
                    have something... somethingI want 
                    to do.  So bad.

                                  TAYLOR
                    We cannot turn our backs on a five 
                    year contract. 

                                  TAMI
                    Sugar?  That contract is from the 
                    people that fired you two years ago 
                    for no reason.  And me a year 
                    later.

                                  TAYLOR
                    That s was McCoy.  The McCoysare 
                    gone.

                                  TAMI
                    You ve said it yourself a hundred 
                    times.  You could coach high school 
                    football anywhere.  This offer from 
                    Braemoreis one in a million.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)FNL 426/513 "Always"         YELLOW       07/15/104.
      CONTINUED:33

      Things here are far from resolved.  There is a knock on the 
      door.  Taylor is thrilled to put a pin in this conversation. 

                                  TAYLOR
                          (heading for the door)
                    Someone s at the door.

                                  TAMI
                    Don t look so happy.

      Taylor opens the door and we re all surprised to see MATT 
      SARACEN looking more nervous and fidgety than usual.  

                                  TAYLOR
                    Well, look what the cat drug in.

                                  SARACEN

                    I see you re in town. 

                                  SARACEN
                    Is uh... hi Mrs. Taylor.

                    Matt...

      JULIE, unseen, stands in the hallway, smiling hearing him 
      there.  Enjoying his nervousness.

                                  SARACEN
                    So I was wondering if Ju... your 
                    dau--Julie was around?  You know, 
                    just thought I d stop by.

                                  JULIE
                    Hello, Matthew.

    He sees her.  She sees him.  It s so obvious these two are 
      lousy in love.  Coach and Tami clock it all.

                                  JULIE (CONT D)
                    Be back soon.

      Julie and Matt leave.  Coach and Tami just look at each 
      other, oh the excitement of parenting a teenage girl.

      EXT. ALAMO FREEZE - DAY (D1)44

      Matt and Julie, stride through the parking lot toward the 
      Freeze.  She play hits him.

                                  JULIE
                    I can t believe you didn t tell me 
                    you were coming back for Christmas.  
                    Why didn t you let me know?  We 
                    could ve planned things -- 

    She realizes he s no longer next to her.  She turns and sees 
      that Matt has dropped to one knee.  Time slows.  She takes in 
      what is about to happen.  Matt is more serious than he s ever 
      been.  He takes out a diamond ring.

                                  SARACEN
                    This is Grandma s.

      Julie is stunned.  Mind moving a mile a minute.  She knows 
      she s going to have to say something really soon that will 
      determine her entire future.  She s shaking.   

                                  SARACEN (CONT D)
                    I just, I ve been thinking about 
                    things.  About you.  Since you came 
                    to Chicago.  That week.  It felt 
                    good.  Real good.  I know we re 
                    young.  But I love you.  And I 
                    know.  I just know.  You know, that 
                    you re the one Julie Taylor.  Will 
                    you marry me?

                    Yes.  I do.  Affirmative.  I ll 
                    marry you, Matthew.

      They throw themselves into each other s arms and kiss.  She 
      screams and jumps up and down.  People stop to watch.

                    I thought you said you were taking

                                  BILLY
                    It was running fine all this time 
                     til you come back.  I think you 
                    pushed it too hard.  And what do 
                    you care anyway?  You re off to 
                    Alaska do drill for oil.

                    Is that right?

                                  RIGGINS
                    I m thinking about putting that on 
                    the back-burner for awhile.

      Billy narrows his eyes, spits.  

                                  BILLY
                    It s cause you got with Tyra.

                    Shut up, Billy.

      MINDY enters holding STEVIE.

                    Tim, stay away from my sister.  
                    It s incest now.

                                  BILLY
                    It isn t incest, there s no 
                    bloodline.

                                  MINDY
                    I know it isn t technically, but 
                    it s just way too weird.

    But we can tell Vince is more than a little ambivalent.  The 
    boy in him wants his Dad to see him play.

                                  LANDRY
                    The whole thing is crazy.  Remember 
                    when we used to hang around the 
                    coffee shop desperately trying to 
                    talk to Julie?  And she wouldn t 
                    ever even talk to us.  That was 
                    like an entire year of our lives, 
                    just trying to get her to look at 
                    us.  And you are going to marry 
                    Julie Taylor.  The amazing Julie 
                    Taylor.

                                  SARACEN
                    She is.  She s amazing.

                                  LANDRY
                    And she could be yours.  There s 
                    only one roadblock.  One 
                    impenetrable roadblock.  He is 
                    going to eat you for lunch.

      Hastings.

    THE BLEACHERS

      Riggins sits alone holding Steviein a Snugli.He s just 
      taking it in.

                    No doubt.  He s a screamer.

                    I think he s hollering a little 
                    extra loud today for his family.
                          (then)
                    You two work things out?

    On cue, Billy looks over -- sees the three most important 
      people in his life together.  Gives a wave.  Tim looks at his 
      brother, lifts his hand, waves back.  Peace offering.

      INT. RIGGINS HOUSE - AFTERNOON (D1)1010

      BECKY comes in from the bathroom with a pillow case full of

                    home this week!

      Becky is trying to sound happy about this.  Mindy is trying 
    to not show how stunned she is.

                                  MINDY

                    Yeah, I know.

      Matt wipes a bead of sweat from his forehead.

                                  SARACEN

                    not saying I m old or anything, but 
                    I m mature.  For my age.  

      Saracen pauses for Coach to acknowledge what he just said.  
      Taylor just stares at him.

                    vans outside?  This is the week of 
                    State - do you think this is

                    Well, Coach...  We don't actually 
                    need your permission.  Asking you 
                    was really just a courtesy.  I've 
                    already asked her, and she's 
                    already said yes.

      Taylor looks at him, takes in this new bit on info, he s 
      chewing his lips a mile a minute.

      INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - JULIE S ROOM - EVENING (N1)1313

      Tami pokes her head in.  Julie sits on her bed.

                    So, I heard the news.

                    Oh, God, did Matt talk to Dad?  Did 
                    Dad freak?

                                  TAMI
                    Yes, and yes he did.

                                  JULIE
                    Mom, look, it was his Grandma s.

      Julie holds her hand to show Tami the ring.  Tami sits next 
    to Julie on the bed, holds her hand, looks at the ring.  

                                  TAMI
                    That sure is beautiful.

                    You should have been there.  Matt 
                    was so adorable.

                                  TAMI
                    Exciting.

      From Tami s tone, Julie gets that Tami isn t aboard the 
      marriage train yet.

                                  TAMI (CONT D)
                    Sweetie?  This is just a little 
                    fast.

                    want to take you and Matt out for 
                    dinner.  

                                  JULIE
                    To celebrate?

                                  TAMI
                    To discuss.

                                  JULIE
                    This sounds scary.

                                  TAMI
                    Honey, if you truly know what 
                    you re doing is right, there is 
                    nothing to be scared about.

      INT. COLLETTE HOUSE - EVENING (N1)1414

      Angela opens the door to see Tim holding Stevie, she 
      immediately takes Steviein her arms.

                                  ANGELA

                    Forget call.  Oh my God, give me 
                    that little baby.

      Tyra comes out, just the slightest bit flustered to see Tim.

                    is the most beautiful baby I ve 
                    ever seen.

      Tyra tries to wrench the baby from Angela, immediately 
      turning all her attention away from Tim to the baby.  Hm.

                    beer.

      Tyra heads to the fridge and Tim follows her there, for a 
      private moment.

                    Thanks.  So, you wanna do something 
                    later?

      Awkward.  Tyra is throwing him a definite negative vibe. 

                                  TYRA
                    Well, I m supposed to go to Buddy s

      EXT. EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT (N1)1515

      Vince walks toward ORNETTE hanging out with some friends.  
      Before Ornette sees him, Vince can hear snippets of his 
      conversation.

                                  ORNETTE
                    Kid was doing a three-step drop, 
                    but I told,  You got an arm, you 
                    gotta use that arm. 

      Ornette notices Vince, immediately feels a little caught 
      bragging about his son.  He s also still smarting a little 
      about his son throwing him out of his own home.

                                  VINCE
                    Hey....

                    I heard you all Westsidenow.

                    Come on, Pops.

      It s with a laugh.  It s a jab.  The friends laugh.  But 
      there s hurt, anger and humiliation underneath.  Vince takes 
    it in stride.

                                  VINCE (CONT D)
                    Can I talk to you a sec?

      They go off aside to talk.  There s a beat.

                    You don t need to come check up on 
                    me, boy.

      That came out harsh, so Ornette pulls back a bit--

                                  ORNETTE
                    I know you got to State.  I live 
                    here.

                                  VINCE
                      I requested a ticket for you.

      Ornette, clearly moved by this, considers.

                    Mom has a ride out with some of the 
                    other parents.  So you d have to 
                    make your way out there on your 
                    own.  We probably wouldn t get to 
                    see you that much otherwise, but 
                    you d be there.

    Too prideful to accept this half invitation...

                                  ORNETTE
                    Gotta lot going on that day.  But 
                    I ll be watching.

      Ornette walks back to his boys.  OFF Vince, realizing the 
      cost of locking your father out of his own house.

                    She probably feels bad is all.

      Becky looks at Tim, surprised and moved that this nugget of 
      wisdom was stored in his beer infused mind.

      MAYHEM as Coach Riggins and Spiveyhand the Players their 
      tickets to the State game for their families.  They call out 
      a few names and the players take their tickets.  Coach Taylor 
      watches from the doorway, enjoying watching their excitement 
      over getting their tickets.

                                  BILLY

                    I only need one, Coach.

      INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING (N2)1818

      Matt and Julie sit uncomfortably across from Coach and Tami.  
    All are more dressed-up than usual - if anyone laughed or 
      smiled, you'd think it was a celebratory meal.  Forks clink 
    on plates.  Coach takes a slug of life-giving red wine, sets 
    it down, and thus begins the "dinnervention."

                                  TAYLOR
                    So you think that you should just 
                    be able to do what you want, 
                    getting married is no big deal.

                    other.  We're not getting married 
                    tomorrow.

                                  TAMI
                    Honey, you just have not had very 
                    much life experience yet, and--

                          (overlapping; taking over)
                    What your mother means is that 
                    marriage requires maturity.

                                  TAMI
                    That's right.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You need to be ready to spend the 
                    rest of your lives listeningto 
                    each other. 

                                  TAMI
                    Yes.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Marriage requires compromise. 

      Suddenly... this strikes Tami as ironic.  

                                  TAMI
                    Mm hm.

                    marry her.  That's it.

      While the simplicity of Matt's words are totally winning to 
      Julie, Coach is irritated.

                                  TAYLOR 
                    Oh, for God's sake.  Are you 
                    listening to me?  Marriage takes 
                    more than love.

                    because your marriage comes ahead 
                    of that.

      Tami's really looking at Coach now.  Starting to get mad all 
      over again, given his dismissal of her job offer.

                                  TAMI 
                    What your father is trying to say 
                    is you need to know that you have 
                    the same dreams together.  How do 
                    you know you re not going to go in 
                    two different directions.  You re 
                    both still figuring out what you re 
                    going to do with your futures.

                                  JULIE
                    Well, things come up, right?  Like 
                    look at you and Dad.  You ve moved 
                    a lot.  You ve had to work things 
                    out and you ve always worked on it 
                    together.  I mean, you two are my 
                    inspiration.  

                                  TAMI

                    best possible life.  You too Matt.  
                    And I think you re a great couple.  
                      A wonderful couple.  But there is 
                    no reason to rush this.  I promise 
                    you, if it is meant to be, you will 
                    know that in a year, or two years, 
                    or five years.  I guarantee that.  
                    And thank you.  What you said.  
                    About us being your inspiration...

      Tami is suddenly flooded with emotion, feeling that her 
      marriage right now feels the opposite of fair and inspiring.  

                                  TAMI (CONT D)

                    talking about compromise in there I 
                    was thinking,  What am I teaching

      Thinks.  The simplicity of it all.  It gets to him.  How much 
    of a dream this is for her.  How much this opportunity means 
    to his wife.  This opportunity that he is standing in the way 
    of.  We are close with Eric.  Buddy keeps talking.

                    So I could stop by the field house, 
                    give you a little time to look it 
                    over and sign before you leave.  
                    Clear your mind.  So you can focus 
                    on State.  

      Taylor looks up from the scribbling.  Sees his wife walking 
      into the kitchen, having no idea the intense life moment 
      Taylor is experiencing right now.

      Taylor looks at his wife.  Her beauty -- inside and out.  
      Takes one more look at the scribbling.

    The Lions in jackets and ties are packed and ready to go to 
      State.  They are all on top of the world.  Taylor stands at 
    his door, taking it all in, his mind still racing.  Vince 
      comes up to Jess who is packing equipment for the trip.

                    Hey, can I talk to you for a 
                    second, Merriweather.  In private?

      Jess looks at him, his intensity.

                    Sure.

      They find a private place.  He moves to her, just kisses her.  
      It s romantic.

                    I didn t want you to be on this

                    But you were right and I was wrong.  
                    I m so glad you re here.  I m so

                    so happy that we re back together.  
                    I love you.  

    He kisses her.  Jess doesn t have the heart to tell him that 
    she is moving away.  And the timing is wrong before the game.

                                  JESS

      GRANDMA SARACEN comes out of the back room holding a yellowed 
      wedding dress.

                    Here it is!  I found it.

      Julie looks at the dress and looks at Matt who just smiles at 
      Julie s discomfort.

                                  MRS. SARACEN (CONT D)
                    Isn t that the most beautiful dress 
                    you ever did see?

                    Grandma, Julie might want a new 
                    dress.

                    Nonsense.  Of course it s gonna 
                    need a good washing.  Let me look 
                    at that ring on you.

      Julie shows it to her.  Grandma Saracen takes Julie s young 
      hand in both of hers and kisses her hand with the ring on it.  
    She loses it a little.

                                  JULIE
                    I love it, Mrs. Saracen.

      Grandma Saracen exits looking for more wedding stuff and Matt 
      looks at her.  Julie looks thoughtful.

                    Coach.  I m leaving.  My dad is

                    Coach, I can t tell you how much 
                    this season has meant to me.  You 
                    changed my life.  You should know 
                    that.

      Taylor just listens, takes it in.

                    By the way, I didn t tell anyone

    Tim and Tyra on Tim's land at magic hour.  In chairs.

      EXT. FAIR PARK - DALLAS, TEXAS - DAY (D5)3333

    The East Dillon bus slowly winds its way down the narrow road 
      that parallels the Midway, flashers on, with a police escort.  
    In October, when the State Fair is going, this place would be 
      alive with noise and energy.  Right now, it s silent.

    But it doesn t matter.

    ON THE AWESTRUCK FACES of our Lions as they peer out the 
      windows - the huge Texas Star ferriswheel, the Hall of 
      State, the cream-colored colossus of a historic football 
      stadium looming into view.  The bus stops near the entrance 
      tunnel, and players climb out.  FAVOR OUR GUYS - Vince, Luke, 
      Tinker, Hastings, Buddy Jr. - as they stare up at a dream:  
    the iconic green letters that read,  Cotton Bowl. 

      Taylor and his staff (including STAN) take it in too.  This 
    is for everything.  This is State.

      INT. COTTON BOWL - LOCKER ROOM - DAY (D5)3434

      Pre-game rituals.  Luke sits on a bench, his knee tapping 
      nervously.  Getting his mind right.

      Tinker has headphones on, bouncing on his toes, eyes closed, 
      getting loose and ready.  A look of steely determination.

      Buddy Jr. standson his crutches, transfixed by worn photos 
    of games and players from bygone eras that hang on the walls.  
      Hastings watches his friend.  Ties his cleats tighter.

      Vince sits on a training table, watching Jess as she wraps 
    the last of some tape around his ankles.  Unspoken bond.  
      Taylor approaches.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You good?

                    am proud of you, son.  

      Something about the way he says this, Vince senses something 
    is different about Coach, but he doesn t know what.

    The simple truth.  Nothing more needs to be said.

      Find our coaches - Stan, Billy, Spivey, Crowley.  Gathering 
    up the team. 

      Taylor walks in, and all heads turn.  This is it.  He eyes 
    his troops for a moment.  Adjusts his cap.  Then:

                                  TAYLOR
                    Alright.  Bring it in.

    The team assembles on a knee.  Everyone holds hands, and bows 
      their heads.  Taylor takes a beat, and begins:

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    Dear Heavenly father, keep us and 
                    protect us tonight...

    As Taylor continues with the prayer, MUSIC BEGINS, launching 
    us into the last football game we will ever see on Friday 
      Night Lights.  It s a poem.  Images, music, atmosphere.  An 
    ode to everything great about the game we love, as we go:

    All THE FANS STANDING, yelling for kickoff.  On the LIONS 
      side - Buddy, Tami, Julie, Saracen, BURNWELL.  *

    THE LIONS ON THE SIDELINE - one last huddle before one last 
      game.  HANDS OF OUR PLAYERS.  The hands all start to come 
      together, all reaching for the sky.  All reaching for the 
      same thing. 

    ON THE THEIR FACES - No jubilation.  No victory without 
      sacrifice.  Eyes wide open.

    ON THE BRIM OF A CAP -- a hand reaches up and adjusts a red 
      ball cap.  Under the cap are THE EYESof COACH ERIC TAYLOR.  
    ON TAMI TAYLOR -- only she knows that this is Coach s last 
      game in Dillon -- wants this win for him more than anything 
    in the world.

      A FOOTBALL IS LIFTED OFF A TEE -- blades of grass dance.

    ON A FACE MASK -- the eyes of Hastings Rucklelooking up into 
      wide blue Texas sky, a ball sailing towards him.

      WIDE SHOT -- TWENTY TWO PLAYERSin a wide open human COLLISION
      called a KICK OFF.  RUCKLERETURNS FOR A GAIN OF 10.

      TIGHT ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE -- looking in between the two 
      sides.  The ball is snapped.  COLLISION.  Vince drifts back.

      TIGHT ON: the FEET of a quarterback.  Like a dance.

    ON ORNETTE AND REGINA-- in separate sections -- their eyes 
      meet.  Pride in their son no matter what else.

    ON LUKE CAFFERTY -- standing in the endzone, arms high.

    ON LIONS PLAYERS AND FANS -- CELEBRATINGa TOUCHDOWN!

      Then... HANDS REACH into the air, the hands seem to hang 
      there forever.  A ball appears.  The hands catch the ball, 
    and a receiver breaks the goal line.  TOUCHDOWN HUDGINS.

      SUPER SLOW MO -- FACES.  PRAYING.  CONCERN.  HANDS OVER EYES. 

      COACH TAYLOR -- HE LOOKS UP AT THE SCOREBOARD -- TIED 14-14  

    ON COACHSRIGGINS -- talking to a player.  The player is 
      crying.  Confused. HANDS ON SHOULDER, COMFORTING.

      A YARD CHAIN -- pulled tight.  FIRST DOWN.  Hudginsrolls.

      LION PLAYERS -- Exhausted.  Defeat written in sweat.

    ON ERIC TAYLOR -- This is bad.  Time running out.

    END ZONE FLAG -- a mass of bodies crush the END ZONE FLAG.

      A REFEREE -- hands go up.  Touchdown Hudgins!

    ON LIONS RALLY GIRLS -- HUDDLED TOGETHER, ready to cry.

      BUDDY GARRITY -- spins his State ring.  A deep breath.

      LUKE CAFFERTY -- RUNNING, legs churning.  Taken down in the 
      back field.  His HELMET HITS THE grass -- his tired eyes.

    ON THE STANDS -- EVERYONE LOOKS UP AT THE SCOREBOARD -- LIONS 
    21 - HAWKS 26.  Time is running out.  This is bad.

      REAL TIME -- Noise.  Confusion.  Battling bands.  Screaming

                    the dream is going to happen, it 
                    has to happen right now. This is

                    You can do this, Vince.  

      They share a smile -- in this moment Coach looks at Vince, 
      looks at his mentor one last time.

                                  VINCE

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (D6)3636

    ... we see what looks like the same ball moving through what 
      looks like the same sky, only when it comes down it lands in 
    the hands of a receiver for the PembertonPioneers.

      CHYRON: PHILADELPHIA.  EIGHT MONTHS LATER.

                    Okay, that was sloppy, gentlemen.  
                    Plain and simple sloppy.  You know 
                    what let s do?  That s right.  
                    Let s run it again.  

      Coach Taylor, wearing green, but still the same Coach Taylor 
      looks up at a group of BOOSTERS in the bleachers giving him 
      dirty looks, like maybe Texas football is a bit overrated.  
      Circle of life.  As we MOVE IN on Taylor we hear...

      Tami Taylor in a power suit walks past a BraemoreUniversity 
      sign through this beautiful campus with two COLLEAGUES who 
      hang on her every word.  She is talking with a passion and 
      vigor.  We see in her eyes and her body language that she is 
      invigorated, alive.  A dream has come true.  

                                  TAYLOR S VOICE
                    I will always remember the feeling 
                    of that hot breeze slapping my face 
                    as I walked onto the field on a hot 
                    Friday night in Texas.

      EXT. HERRMANN FIELD - AFTERNOON (D6)3838

      Vince, in Panther Blue, is going through summer drills led by 
      Coaches Crowley, Spiveyand Riggins.  We see Tinker, riding 
    the bench at the moment, but on the team.  Vince kept his 
      promise.  Also riding the bench, Buddy Jr., cast off, ready 
    for anything.

                                  TAYLOR S VOICE
                    The sizzle of the hot dogs grilling 
                    up at the concession stand. 

      Vince, about to take a snap, stops and turns to see, the 
      arrival of COACH HAYWARD walking across the field for the 
      first time.  We follow him in his Panther jacket like how we 
    met Coach Taylor in the pilot.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)FNL 426/513 "Always"         YELLOW       07/15/1050.

    The coaches head over like a group of ducklings just found 
      their momma, and start talking him up.  Hayward is polite, 
    but has his eyes set on meeting one person in particular.  He 
      walks up to Vince.  

                                  COACH HAYWARD
                    Heard a lot about you, son.

    As he shakes Vince s hand we do that classic Friday Night 
      Lights handshake thing and we see on Vince s hand, a State 
      Championship ring.  I guess someone caught that pass.

      EXT. DILLON BUS DEPOT - AFTERNOON (D6)3939

    As a small crowd of people say their good-byes, we find Luke 
    in a military uniform, kissing Becky good-bye.  He hands 
      Becky his Championship Ring.  As he boards the bus, hold on 
      Becky s hopeful gaze as she tries to glimpse him through the 
      tinted window.

      Meanwhile, East Dillon isn t looking as good.  The football 
      field is being used as Student parking.  Becky gets out of 
    her car, she finally got one.  She meets up with a few 
      girlfriends and walks in.  Behind her, workers are removing 
    the Lions sign from the scoreboard.  A 2010 State 
      Championship Banner hangs nearby.  Ironic.

                    as the crowd first roars.

      INT. MATT'S CHICAGO APARTMENT - MORNING (D6)4141

      Matt and Julie are heading out of their apartment.  Matt to 
    go to work, Julie reaches for her college textbook and we see 
    the engagement ring on her finger.  They bicker lovingly 
      echoing Eric and Tami s relationship.  As they make their way 
    out for the day...

    We pan down the sidelines of an unfamiliar football field, 
      catching glimpses of a squad of Dallas Walker High players.

      Buddy, now the head booster at West Dillon, has laid claim to 
    Joe McCoy's old golf cart, speeds along the field with the 
       Clear Eyes, Full Hearts  sign in back.

    Tim is hammering nails of his own.  Into the foundation of 
    his house.  On the other side of the foundation, Billy is 
      working on the house too. 

                                  TAYLOR S VOICE
                    You are my family.

      EXT. TIM RIGGINS S LAND - MOMENTS LATER (D6)4646

    Tim and Billy sit back in lawn chairs drink a beer, taking a 
      break.  They re tired -- the good kind of tired.

                    Let me tell you something.  That 
                    wasn t half bad, gentlemen.  We have 
                    a long way to go.  But we are right 
                    at the beginning.  The beginning of 
                    something new.  The beginning of 
                    something good.  Gentlemen, clear 
                    eyes, full hearts...

    The players don t have any idea what they re supposed to say.  
    He smiles.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    You ll learn the rest.

      Taylor looks up and sees Tami Taylor coming to pick him up.

                    Go home and get some sleep.  Six

                    a.m. I sure hope to see you here no 
                    later than five-forty.

    The team disperses and Taylor walks the other way to Tami who 
      comes from the other side of the field.  The players now 
      gone, Tami and Eric are two lone figures walking toward each 
      other.  Something so high school about it.  They meet around 
    the 40 yard line.  Kiss.  Look at each other.  No resentment.  
      They have moved on.  Literally.  The power of their marriage 
    the most important thing in either of their lives.  

                                  TAMI
                    You ready to go home?

                    these memories.  Always.  

    The lights power down, and in the darkness, we can just 
      barely make out the ghostly figures of Tami and Eric Taylor.
