My name?

It's my job

I like what I do.
I'm a cop.
In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the
door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.
The police
are waiting.
REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop.
POLICE OFFICER
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
COHEN
Bullshit.
What's the charge?
POLICE OFFICER
Non-payment of federal income tax.
COHEN
Bullshit.

Flashbulbs pop as Mickey Cohen exits and starts down
the steps.
Accompanied by his LAWYERS, bodyguard
Stompanato and mob lieutenants DEUCE PERKINS and NATE
JANKLOW, Cohen ignores REPORTERS' shouts.
REPORTER
How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!
As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their
attention to District Attorney ELLIS LOEW.
A singularly
ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight.
LOEW
Today is an auspicious one for the
city of Los Angeles.
Mickey Cohen
has just been sentenced to ten
years in federal prison for
failure to pay income tax.
As the District Attorney for Los
Angeles County, it is my pleasure
to declare our great city
organized crime free.
It is truly
the dawning of a new day.
The SONG ENDS and so does the MONTAGE.
A stucco job in a row of vet prefabs.
A neon Santa
sleigh has landed on the roof.
Through the front window,
we see a fat guy browbeating a woman.
Puff-faced, 35-
ish, she backs away as he rages at her.
The Packard pulls up out front.
Stensland could care
less.
STENSLAND
Leave it for later, Bud.
We got
to pick up the rest of the booze
and get back to the precinct.

steps to the house.
Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED
CRIES.
Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and
yanks.
The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER
EXPLODING around it.
A beat.
The fat guy runs out to
investigate, trips over Rudolph.
Bud pounces.
Fat guy takes a swing, misses.
Grabbing
fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement.
Once, twice.
Teeth skitter down the walk.
BUD
Touch her again and I'll know
about it.
Understand?
Huh?
Another face full of gravel.
Fat guy's WIFE watches with
apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's
hands behind his back, empties his pockets.
A cash roll
and car keys.
Bud looks over at her.
BUD
You got someplace you can go?
She nods.
Bud hands her the keys and the cash.
BUD
Go get yourself fixed up.
WIFE
(nods, determined)
Merry Christmas, huh?
Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive.
She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.
STENSLAND
You and women, partner.
What's
next?
Kids and dogs?
WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.
Jack and two uniformed
patrolmen wait on the darkened street.
An arc light has
been set up.
Hudgeons creeps back over from the house.
HUDGEONS
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.
JACK
Stand there with your camera.
I'll stop here so you get
Grauman's Chinese in the
backgrouns.
HUDGEONS
I like it!
I like it!
Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck.
Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons
CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA.
HUDGEONS
Cut!
Wrap it!
Windows light up.
Rubberneckers appear.
Jack hands the
kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in
tow.
Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the
walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN.
LYNN
A case each of gin, Scotch, and
rum.
Everything top shelf.
None
of that watered-down stuff you
push on Errol Flynn.
OWNER
(laughs)
Sounds like a helluva party.
Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it
up.
There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.
She
seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie
stars.
Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the
counter.
Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a
moment.
OWNER
You want it delivered?
LYNN
Before five tomorrow.
The Owner spots Bud.
A big smile turns to a frown.
OWNER
I'll be right with you, Lynn.
The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor
into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at
each other.
Bud says the only thing he can think of.
BUD
Merry Christmas.
LYNN
Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
BUD
That obvious, huh?
LYNN
(smiles sweetly)
It's practically stamped on your
forehead.
As the Owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter...
Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.
Something
catches his eye.
A woman in the rear passenger seat of a
new Cadillac.
SUSAN LEFFERTS.
Both her eyes are black.
Bud starts over.
The case on his hip, he motions for her
to roll down the window.
The driver's side door opens
and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.
MEEKS
Get lost why don't you?
Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face.
Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks
around, pats him down.
He finds a .38 in a shoulder
holster.
MEEKS
I got a license for that.
Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.
MEEKS
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a
cop.
BUD
Turner Meeks?
Never heard of you.
LYNN
(exiting store)
We just call him Buzz.
Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.
It comes
down.
BUD
You okay?
Beside her, a man leans over.
Pierce Patchett, seen
before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being
chauffeured.
Like FDR, he smokes his cigarette in a
holder.
PATCHETT
She's fine.
BUD
(menacing)
I'm not asking you.
Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.
As he
stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.
BUD
Somebody hit you?
LYNN
It's not what you think.
Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's
door.
BUD
What is it then?
SUSAN
You got the wrong idea, Mister.
I'm fine.
Susan laughs.
Patchett eases back into the shadows.
LYNN
(getting in the car)
But it's nice to know you care.
Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the
.38 and wallet.
Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get
back in the car.
Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.
STENSLAND
What's going on?
For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes.
BUD
You know him?
STENSLAND
Seen him around.
He used to be a
cop.

END OF MONTAGE
The marquee gushes:
"Today Sgt. Joe Reno:
Badge of
Honor Star Brett Chase."
Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned
towers.
As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Park Rangers report three Negro
youths discharging shotguns into
the air in Griffith Park.
Suspects are driving a late model
purple Mercury Coupe.
As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and
gets out of his car.
Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his
box of stuff into the trunk.
Bud is moody, pensive.
STENSLAND
Don't look so down in the mouth,
Bud.
You nailed him good.
BUD
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of
hours before I have to be at the
Victory.
Want to grab a beer?
STENSLAND
Rain check me, partner.
I got
something big going on tonight.
BUD
What?
That new mystery girl
you've been seeing?
STENSLAND
No.
I'll tell you sometime.
Not
now.
Don't want to jinx it.
But
it could take the edge off that
jail time I got coming.
BUD
What are you talking about?
STENSLAND
It's confidential, Bud.
Like that
magazines Vincennes scams for.
Hush-Hush.
(smiles)
I'll see you tomorrow.
And hey,
if it works out, you'll get a
piece of it.
Stensland gets in the car, drives off.
Bud is left
alone.
Patrol cars.
Blues setting up a crime scene blockade.
Exley pulls up, DOUSES his SIREN.
PATROLMAN #1 runs
over.
PATROLMAN #1
Loads of people down.
Men.
Women.
I stopped for coffee --
Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door.
It's wide
open.
Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber-
neckers.
HORNS BLAST.
Motorcycles run interference for
meat wagons cut off by the crown.
As Ed emerges,
reporters surge, shout questions.
Exley hurries past,
finds Dudley in command and barking orders.
EXLEY
Sir, I took the call.
It's my
case.
DUDLEY
Edmund, you don't want it and you
can't have it.
EXLEY
Yes, I do, sir.
DUDLEY
It's mine.
I'll make you my
second in command.
Exley spots a photographer moving in.
He looks properly
serious as the flash bulb pops.
Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes.
A sign
proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway.
The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence.
Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning
in room 6.
An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out.
They
start forward, but a SCREAM inside 6 stops Exley short.
DUDLEY
With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
Angeles is organized crime free.
The Chief wants it to stay that
way, Edmund.
The means are not
for the weak-hearted.
Exley pulls up.
Bud looks to him.
Really curious now.
A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.
Also last
seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce
Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a
koi pond.
They land in a tight grouping.
As he tees up:
BUD (O.S.)
You must slay 'em at the country
club.
Bud's halfway up the walk.
Patchett sees the cuffs
hooked to his belt.
Patchett is cool as can be.
BUD
Are you Pierce Patchett?
PATCHETT
I am.
Are you soliciting for
police charities?
The last time,
you people called at my office.
BUD
I'm a homicide detective.
Where
were you last night?
PATCHETT
I was here, hosting a party.
Who
was killed and why do you think I
can help?
BUD
Richard Stensland.
PATCHETT
I don't know him.
Mr...
BUD
Officer White.
How about Susan
Lefferts?
You know her?
PATCHETT
(sighs, concedes)
You know I do or you wouldn't be
here.
How did you find me?
BUD
We met outside Hollywood Liquors
on Christmas Eve.
This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
PATCHETT
Of course...
BUD
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
I'm investigating.
Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options.
Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.
BODYGUARD
Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?
PATCHETT
(waves him off)
Fine, Philip.
Thank you.
BUD
Where's the other guy?
Buzz.
PATCHETT
He no longer works for me.
(a beat)
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
I'll give you a handsome reward.
Whatever you desire.
If only Jack had been around to hear that.
BUD
Thanks, but no thanks.
PATCHETT
Against your code?
BUD
I don't have one.
Lefferts looked
beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't
act it.
How come?
PATCHETT
Do you care about criminal matters
peripheral to Susan's murder?
BUD
No.
PATCHETT
Then you wouldn't feel obligated
to report them?
BUD
That's right.
PATCHETT
Then listen closely, because I'll
only say this once and if it gets
repeated, I'll deny it.
I run
call girls.
Lynn Bracken is one
of them and so was Susan Lefferts.
I treat my girls very well.
I
have grown daughters, myself, and
I don't like the thought of women
being hurt.
I sense you share
this feeling.
BUD
(ignores comment)
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
PATCHETT
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket.
She is --
was -- a big doubles fan.
BUD
You wanna go downtown and discuss
this officially?
PATCHETT
Wait.
Our deal still holds?
Bud nods, his patience running thin.
PATCHETT
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill
out my little studio.
BUD
What little studio?
PATCHETT
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,
Turner.
Lynn Bracken is my
Veronica Lake.
I use girls who
look like movie stars.
Sometimes
I employ a plastic surgeon.
BUD
That's why her mother couldn't
I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
PATCHETT
No, Mr. White.
Pierce Morehouse
Patchett.
Now, I sense you're on
your best behavior, but that's all
I'll give you.
If you persist,
I'll meet you with my attorney.
Now, would you like Miss Bracken's
address?
I doubt she knows
anything, but --
BUD
I got her address.
PATCHETT
Of course... this is personal with
you, isn't it, Mr. White?
Bud turns, heads down the walk.
Patchett hits his golf
ball.
It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest.
Ice.
A modern-looking triplex.
A projector's flicker strobes
against the closed curtains.
We hear a PHONE RING.
A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.
A BLACK
BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the
porch.
Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and
Exley till they're almost on top of him.
JACK
Leonard Bidwell?
The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.
Looking
them over, he finally nods.
JACK
How's the left these days?
BOXER
What's it to you?
JACK
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I
like your style.
BOXER
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
JACK
You got a brother up in Folsom.
I
know because I put him there.
BOXER
Till 19-fucking-70.
JACK
How'd you like to make it 1960?
I
know the judge and Sergeant Exley
here is friends with hte D.A.
Exley nods, this is true.
The Boxer's still listening.
JACK
We're looking for three colored
guys who like to pop off shotguns.
One of 'em owns a purple Merc
coupe.
BOXER
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch
jacket?
JACK
You wanna buy your brother ten
years...?
You don't have to say
anything.
Just look at this list
and point.
Here.
Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it
off.
BOXER
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.
Sugar Ray Coates.
Drives a '49
coupe, a beautiful ride.
Don't
know about shotguns, but he gets
his thrills killing dogs.
He is
righteous trash.
Jack and Exley scan the list.
Jack's finger stabs down
on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."
JACK
That's five minutes from here.
Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled
Older Gentleman out the door.
OLDER GENTLEMAN
I don't understand, doll, we just
got started.
LYNN
I'm sorry, but I'll make it up
to you.
I promise.
OLDER GENTLEMAN
Gosh, kitten, I don't know...
As he begins to mash up against her...
BUD (O.S.)
Hit the road, gramps.
Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.
The Older
Gentleman strikes a pose.
He still thinks he's Alan
Ladd.
OLDER GENTLEMAN
Alright.
This time I'll go, but
next time --
BUD
(flips badge)
L.A.P.D., shitbird.
Get the fuck
out of here or I'll call your wife
to come get you.
Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with
Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.
LYNN
I've been expecting you.
Pierce
called.
Told me what happened
to Sue.
An L-shaped walk-up.
Jack coasts the car to the curb.
He leaps out with Exley.
Exley holds up at the sight
of a late model sedan.
He leans down to look in the
window at the two-way on the dash.
EXLEY
L.A.P.D.
JACK
Shit.
Someone beat us here.
VOICES from the carport ahead.
We see a chrome bumper,
the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.
A door slams.
Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.
CARPORT
Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel,
Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.
Jack
and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.
JACK
Hey.
Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.
He very
nearly fires before he sees who it is.
CARLISLE
What the fuck are you guys doing
here?
EXLEY
Think of us as back-up.
JACK
What do you got?
As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.
BREUNING
Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box
of double-ought buck and cash.
Jack spots them.
Three shotguns on the passenger side
floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.
JACK
So long, Vice.
Badge of Honor,
here I come.
CARLISLE
Fuck you, Vincennes.
It's our
collar.
Breuning actually has to restrain his partner.
EXLEY
Quiet.
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team.
End of story.
A four cordon.
They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE.
Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser.
Bud
White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.
BUD
Give me one minute.
DUDLEY
You've got it, Wendell.
STREET
Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley.
Exley
moves to follow, but Dudley cuts him off.
DUDLEY
We're going through the front.
ALLEY
Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.
A screen
door.
Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks
inside.
SCREEN PORCH
Bud heads for a blind-covered door.
Unlocked, he
enters...
A HALLWAY
Light bouncing from side rooms.
We hear the opening
spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left.
Bud wheels into
a...
BEDROOM
A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.
Bound with
neckties.
One in her mouth.
Her eyes grow wide at the
sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room.
Directing him.
Raising the .38, Bud enters...
THE KITCHEN
Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice
Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering
TV.
He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond
it.
Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.
Bud SHOOTS him in the face.
Dead, Fitch just sits there.
Bud moves behind him.
Pulling a spare piece from an
ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's
line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.
We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.
As Fitch slides off
the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on
him.
GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT
The Girl on a stretcher.
Being carried to an AMBULANCE.
Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious
pet pit bull.
The ATTENDANTS get her inside.
One joins
her.
The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.
Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking
the guy's lips with it.
BUD
Get her to the fucking hospital.
One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to
the driver's side.
Exley arrives, steamed.
EXLEY
A naked guy with a gun?
You
expect anyone to believe that?
BUD
Get the fuck away from me.
Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.
Other
cops begin to take notice.
The ambulance pulls out.
EXLEY
How's it going to look on your
report?
BUD
It'll look like justice.
That's
what that fat fuck got.
Justice.
EXLEY
You don't know what the word means,
you dumb bastard.
Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart.
Dudley on Exley.
Four cops genuinely having trouble
on Bud.
And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the
cops on the street.
POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Repeat, three suspects escaped
from the Hall of Justice jail.
The Nite Owl killers:
Raymond
Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry
Fontaine.
They are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.
Descriptions are as follows...
1ST & OLIVE - DAY
Exley and Carlisle pull up across the street from a
four-story Victorian with paint peeling off the clap-
boards.
They jump out of the car toting SHOTGUNS.
Carlisle waits as Exley checks the mail slots:
"R. Navarette, 408. "
A coffin is lowered into the ground.
A WIDOW leans on
the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from
Dudley Smith.
Exley drops a handful of earth on the
casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands.
CHIEF
We mourn the passing of a good
man.
The loss of Sgt. William
Carlisle is the loss of his
wife, his family and the entire
Los Angeles Police Department...
A sea of dress blues.
Jack looks bored, dressed too
flashy for a funeral.
Bud looks grim, rain dripping off
the brim of his cap.
As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is
FIRED...
Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is
buried.
People cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees.
A
banner heralds the future:
"On this site:
The World's
Biggest Amusement Park."
Cartoon characters dance among
the fallen trees.
Rain.
A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps,
knocks on the door.
Lynn answers in an evening gown.
He
gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.
Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan
a look down the street.
Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened
silhouette behind the wheel.
Smiling a bit sadly to
herself, Lynn disappears inside.
This is no stake-out.
Bud watches after her with
yearning.
A horse parade, heavy on the law enforcement contingent,
Out of place in his suit and tie, District Attorney Ellis
Loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek Palimono.
Reporters scribble as the Chief speaks.
Uniforms
everywhere along with Exley and Loew.
Bus sits in the
back.
CHIEF
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a
brilliant record in his seven
years with the L.A.P.D.
Recently
he evinced spectacular bravery in
the line of duty.
It is my honor
to present him with our highest
honor, the Medal of Valor.
Exley steps up.
The Chief hangs a gold medallion around
his neck.
Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.
Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.
The
policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.
Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.
DUDLEY
Your father would've been proud.
Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.
EXLEY
There are loose ends out there,
Dudley.
I --
DUDLEY
There always are.
But there are
also three men and three guns.
Matched forensically.
A few loose
ends don't matter.
EXLEY
Something's wrong.
I feel it
inside.
Doesn't that sound crazy?
Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as
more bulbs flash.
DUDLEY
Breaking a big case sticks you in
a whirlwind.
A little self-doubt?
It's natural.
Just keep it
inside.
Between you and you.
Exley considers his medal.
It is an appealing thing.
In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.
No one's
watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows
pretend smoke off the barrel.
As the song ends...
Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.
The tires
spit gravel as he tears away.
Dudley appears in the
doorway, watching curiously.
As cauliflower continues to
SCREAM...
Jack sits in his car waiting.
He checks his watch...
1:30.
Well past midnight.
JACK
Come on, Sid.
Where are you?
Jack decides.
MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses
the street.
The apartment is dark, the front door a few
inches ajar.
Suspicious, Jack listens.
Dead quiet.
He
enters...
Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.
JACK
It's Vincennes!
Open up!
Hudgeons opens the door.
He's in his pajamas.
HUDGEONS
Jackie!
You got some good scoop
for the Sidster?
JACK
Sid, cut the crap.
I --
HUDGEONS
Give me some Narco skinny.
I want
to put out an all hop-head issue.
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie
stars.
Maybe tie it into the
Rosenbergs.
You like?
Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame.
JACK
Shut up!
HUDGEONS
(confused)
What's wrong, Trash?
HUDGEONS
What happened with the kid and
Loew?
HUDGEONS
You didn't get my message?
It got
called off.
The kid chickened out
at the last minute.
JACK
He's dead.
I was just there.
Somebody slit his throat.
HUDGEONS
Jesus.
Jack, that's a story.
'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'
Let me get my camera.
Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.
JACK
Loew didn't go with him.
You're
sure?
HUDGEONS
I put Reynolds in the cab myself.
The night cost me a hundred scoots
and I got bupkis.
Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.
HUDGEONS
Jackie!
Big V!
Let me get my
camera!
Where are you going?!
Exley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches.
PARK RANGER
I asked my men, Lieutenant.
No
one remembers any colored guys
firing shotguns.
EXLEY
Then who phoned in the report?
PARK RANGER
Not us.
A shingle shack dump.
Bud walks the front steps, RINGS
the BELL.
Hilda Lefferts answers.
She doesn't look so
good.
BUD
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White
with the L.A.P.D.
I'd like to ask
a couple of questions.
MRS. LEFFERTS
Let my daughter rest in peace.
BUD
Five minutes.
That's all.
Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...
CRAWLSPACE
Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.
There's a long burlap sack ahead.
It smells bad.
Bud
rips burlap.
A rat's nest explodes.
Bud sweeps a
forearm at them.
As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked
human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.
Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.
He pats
the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.
Bud checks
the ID.
"Turner Meeks."
Bus knows him by that name and
another.
BUD
Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.
Mrs. Lefferts is there.
She's scared.
MRS. LEFFERTS
Was it... a rat?
BUD
Yeah.
A great big one.
Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks
and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.
BUD
Here.
Compliments of the Los
Angeles Police Department.
Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls
up.
Exley gets up, starts toward her.
She drops the
hose and runs for the front door
Exley cuts her off.
MRS. LEFFERTS
Let my Susie rest in peace!
EXLEY
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
a few questions.
MRS. LEFFERTS
That other policeman already
checked under the house and found
not a thing amiss.
EXLEY
Officer White?
MRS. LEFFERTS
A sweet man.
EXLEY
(thinking
out loud)
Under the house.
MRS. LEFFERTS
All he found were rodents.
No
signs of foul play.
So there.
Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.
He hurries
over, enters nearly flat on his belly.
Mrs. Lefferts
calls in after him.
MRS. LEFFERTS
My daughter was a virgin!
EXLEY (O.S.)
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
A Packard pulls up out front.
Bud gets out, heads
inside.
Another car pulls up across the street.
CLOSE ON JACK
Watching Bud.
Jack gets out, starts across the street.
Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.
It
opens and Bud steps in.
Jack doesn't see who opens it.
LEAVES RUSTLE.
There's movement in the underbrush.
Jack
appears, followed by Exley.
Jack pulls a gun as they
near a window.
EXLEY
What's that for?
JACK
Bud White.
He sees us and we're
dead.
They press up to the glass for a partial view.
Bud White
sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet.
Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.
This isn't
the Bud White they're used to.
A pair of woman's hands
take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.
The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her
policeman.
It may have been a long day, but she's every
inch Veronica Lake.
Only the hair's not over her eye.
They stand, kiss again.
Lynn's gown spills down around
her ankles.
Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of
them disappear into a bedroom.
A long beat before...
JACK
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb
after all.
EXLEY
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and
now Veronica Lake with White.
What the hell's going on?
JACK
Movie star hookers.
Whatever you
desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
EXLEY
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
JACK
High line whores.
With plastic
surgery to look like movie stars.
And who knows what else?
It's run
by this guy Pierce Patchett.
You
want to talk to him?
EXLEY
Yeah.
But first I want to brace
Stompanato.
Exley's Plymouth is parked on the street.
Exley and Jack head for the car.
JACK
Guy's as cool as they come.
A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.
Exley picks up.
EXLEY
This is Exley.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,
Lieutenant.
Says he has your I.D.
EXLEY
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is
coming in to talk to him.
JACK
What are you going to do?
EXLEY
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.
I'll
meet you at the Dining Car.
JACK
Great.
You get the girl, I get
the coroner.
Jack knocks at a darkened house.
The porch lights come
on.
The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his
bathrobe.
DUDLEY
John Vincennes.
It's three A.M.,
lad.
JACK
Two minutes, Dudley.
It's
important.
DUDLEY
Lucky for you that my wife and
four fair daughters are at the
beach in Santa Barbara.
A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath.
As usual, a light burns in room six.
Bud White parks
alongside the other cars already here.
He makes a dash
for the door.
Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with
a ferocious yank.
He tears at the carpeting.
A manila
envelope.
Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley
and Lynn spill out.
Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his
Packard and tearing out of there.
Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.
A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.
She watches as he gets out and starts for the house.
Lynn stands, holds her arms out.
Bud stops short on the
steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.
BUD
Did you talk to Exley?
LYNN
Come in out of the rain.
In the
morning we'll have both our
stories for breakfast.
Lightning flashes.
Bud shakes hs head.
BUD
I want to know about Exley.
LYNN
He's the opposite of you.
He's
more like me.
Cold, calculating.
BUD
How'd you get to know so much
about him?
More lightning.
Lynn looks God-awful sad.
LYNN
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
BUD
You gonna tell me what happened
with you and Exley?
LYNN
We talked.
BUD
So tell me about it.
LYNN
(looking away)
In the morning.
BUD
No.
Now.
(a beat)
You fucked him.
Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.
LYNN
I thought I was helping you.
I
thought --
Bud backhands her, hard.
Lynn faces straight into the
next one as Bud hits her again.
A third time as the sins
of the father are visited on the son.
Bud stops short as
the self-realization slams home.
Lynn waits stoically.
She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back
into the rain.
Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.
Bud pulls his
.38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his
waistband.
EXLEY
You expecting problems?
BUD
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop
muscle.
FRONT DOOR
Exley RINGS the BUZZER.
Looking back, Bud sees a
pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the
grass.
A single ball floats in the koi pond.
Bud's eyes
narrow at the sight.
Not like Patchett at all.
BUD
Come on.
And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges.
A county sheriff's unmarked parked out front.
A DEPUTY
behind the wheel.
Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind.
The
Deputy gets out.
MOVE WITH him as he steps BACK TO
Exley, who's rolling down his window.
EXLEY
Is she inside?
DEPUTY
We took her to Hollywood Station
for safekeeping.
Someone worked
her over pretty good.
She
wouldn't say who.
Exley looks at Bud.
Bud looks down in shame.
EXLEY
Hold her as Joan Smith.
No one
sees her unless I okay it.
DEPUTY
You got it, Exley.
And now we're
even.
As the Deputy moves off.
EXLEY
Ellis Loew.
BUD
What about him?
EXLEY
Jack thought he was up to his neck
in all this.
Exley and Bud exit.
Bud's wheels are turning.
BUD
They never made a match on the
shotgun serial numbers.
What if
Breuning and Carlisle took them
from the evidence room?
Couple of
cold pieces that had been hanging
around a year or two.
EXLEY
We should check the records, and,
we should talk to Lynn.
Bud just stares at him a beat.
EXLEY
You want to talk to her?
Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."
Finally...
BUD
You do it.
I'll check the files.
Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the
Victory.
Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.
Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting
the room.
Two sets of feet shuffling along.
Bud FIRES
the SHOTGUN.
Shrieks as the men go down.
Bud extends
the .38 to fire point blank headshots.
Then...
Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM
6.
Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.
Exley
steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.
The
two of them are bleached white by headlights.
Dudley raises his badge over his head.
DUDLEY
We're policemen!
(winks)
Let me do the talking.
They'll
make you Chief of Detectives.
Exley steps ahead to block his way.
EXLEY
No.
DUDLEY
Why not, lad?
Absolute justice?
EXLEY
Something like that.
DUDLEY
Really?
Would you be willing to
rig crime scene evidence to
support a prosecuting attorney's
working hypothesis?
Exley doesn't answer.
Dudley smiles.
DUDLEY
Would you be willing to beat
confessions out of suspects you
knew to be guilty?
Exley glares.
Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward
the gathering policemen.
DUDLEY
Are you willing to shoot hardened
criminals in the back to offset
the chance they'll --
The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.
Dudley goes down, shot in the
back.
Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his
head.
DISSOLVE TO:
L.A. MONTAGE
"RAGS TO RICHES" PLAYS.
Riding in a convertible, waving to the crowds is the
Grand Marshal -- the new Vice President, a young
Richard Nixon.
A ribbon is cut.
Eager motorists roll down the blacktop.
Ronald Reagan applauds as Jane Wyman plunges her hands
into fresh sidewalk cement.
Hush-Hush is delivered.
The headline:
"Actor Reynolds
in his Final Role:
Conductor of the Night Train to Slice
City."
Exley walks Lynn out.
EXLEY
Where will you go?
LYNN
Bisbee, Arizona.
The air's good
for pensioners and I know where
everything is.
EXLEY
When?
LYNN
Right now, before I back down.
EXLEY
Where is he?
Lynn gestures ahead.
They walk to her car.
She opens
the back door.
Bud's in the back.
Braces on his legs,
head sutured.
Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and
out.
But his hands still look strong.
Bud forces a
smile through the wires, tries to say something, but
can't.
EXLEY
Thanks for the push.
Exley takes his hand.
Bud squeezes till both men wince.
EXLEY
You just did what you did.
No
rank, no glory.
Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.
EXLEY
From me to you.
It'll mean
something if it's yours.
Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.
LYNN
We should go now.
As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.
PARTY noises
drift from upstairs.
Exley looks to Lynn.
EXLEY
Do you think I ever could've been
in the running?
LYNN
Some men get the world.
Others
get ex-hookers and a trip to
Arizona.
A beat.
Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.
She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.
STARTS it.
Exley looks back at Bud.
Bud presses his hands to the
glass.
Exley touches his side, palms half the man's
size.
Hands against hands.
The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on
the HORN.
Exley's all alone.
As he watches them go...
FADE TO BLACK.
