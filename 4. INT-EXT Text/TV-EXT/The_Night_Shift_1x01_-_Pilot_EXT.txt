The chopper has landed.  Emergency vehicle lights flash on 
the road and illuminate a terrible accident.  Sachs&Judah After Hours NBC Draft 8/14/1228.


We see a car that was smashed in the side by a pick-up truck.  
EMT HERNANDEZ escorts TC and Topher to the car. A distraught 
TEENAGE BOY being treated for head cuts and arm lacerations 
screams out to them.
