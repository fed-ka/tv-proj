Benny, Ham, Scotty (sitting by himself) and the other STUDENTS
are clock watching. The BELL RINGS. Summer vacation! The
classroom empties... papers circle to the floor from 35
departing cyclones.
Streams of excited KIDS spill into the corridors - a river of
scrambling tennis shoes and clashing lunch boxes at the
entrance gate.
SCOTTY'S
caught in the mayhem.
6
HE SPIES
the 8 guys forging ahead. He follows them.
NARRATOR
It was a lousy way to end up the 5th
grade, 'cause I had zip time to make
friends before summer. And that's
about where it all started...
A shrine to the pastime. Pennants, magazine pictures, game
programs, baseball cards, a whole section of Maury Wills,
radiating from a picture of Wills caught in a pickle.
NARRATOR
...later, it would become second only
to Cape Canaveral as a command post
for history.
(BEAT)
When I moved in that summer, I'd never
played baseball, but it wasn't too
tough figuring out who these guys'
heroes were. So, after a week of
watching... I figured baseball seemed
like the best way to get in with them.
BENNY'S
in bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's
house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture
of all... a picture of The Babe.
Jr. Chemistry set. Heath Kit gadgets. An unbelievable Erector
Set contraption with little motors and stuff. An autographed
picture of Mr. Wizard. Scotty's pj'd at his erector set table,
bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him.
He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor.
SWITCHES ON
THE CONTRAPTION
a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on
a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and
9
loop-da-loops... lands in a mini-catapult. Another motor
draws it back via a winding string. Boy Scout camping-knife
scissors ratchet in - snip the string - the catapult fires.
THE MARBLE
leaps a little green fence and WONK! Ouuuhhh! beans
HIS MOTHER (HAVING JUST COME IN)
right in the forehead.
BEDROOM
Scotty winces at the shot.
SCOTTY
Sorry, Mom.
MOM
I thought we agreed we'd take this
apart... and not spend so much time in
here.
SCOTTY
(FEELING LOW)
I know - but it's just nighttime.
MOM
Scotty, have you made any friends yet?
SCOTTY
No.
MOM
Why not, honey?
SCOTTY
'Cause I'm still "new."
MOM
Honey, I don't want you sitting in
here all summer fiddling with this
stuff, like you did last summer... and
the one before that.
(BEAT)
Scotty, look at me. I know you're
smart, and I'm proud of you. But you
have to get outside, you have to...
play.
She sits across from him, trying to get through.
10
MOM (CONT'D)
I want you to get out in the fresh air
and make friends. Run around and scrape
your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees
and hop fences. Get in trouble for
crying out loud.
(BEAT)
Not too much, but some. You have my
permission. Now how many mothers do
you think say that to their sons?
SCOTTY
None mothers I guess.
MOM
I want you to make friends this summer,
Scotty. Lots of them.
SCOTTY
I know, but I don't - I'm no good at
anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an
EGGHEAD -
MOM
- and you'll always be just an egghead
with an attitude like that. So promise
me, alright?
SCOTTY
'Kay.
MOM
Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
SCOTTY
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
(BEAT)
Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad -
will teach me to play catch?
MOM
Are you kidding, he'd love it, you
know what an athlete he wasIn high
school.
(ALTERMNATE LINE)
You know what a pitcher he was in high
college.
Scotty slurps a glass of chocolate Quick. Rinses the glass
too carefully. Gathers courage for something. Breathes deep -
starts across the house.
11
Scotty peeks through a slightly open door. BILL moves around
inside, unpacking boxes. Scotty reaches to knock. Stops.
Almost walks away. Then musters the gumption. KNOCKS.
BILL (O.S.)
Yeah...
Scotty takes a few cautious steps into...
...a trophy room. Ribbons, plaques, trophies. Bill must've
been some athlete; but he limps now. Scotty lingers...
gathering more courage.
NARRATOR
My real dad died when I was just a
little kid. My mom married Bill a
year before we moved to the
neighborhood.
(BEAT)
At the time, he and I were still getting
used to each other.
SCOTTY
Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember
you promised you'd teach me to play
catch?
BILL
Um hum...
He dusts a batting trophy.
SCOTTY
Well, could you teach me?
BILL
Sure.
He places a pitching plaque. Scotty waits awkwardly. Waits
for more words. They don't come.
SCOTTY
Okay. Great. Thanks.
BILL
Um hum.
Scotty leaves, bringing the door with him on his way out.
Through the cracked portal he sees Bill set a silver pedestal
on the main shelf. On this he sets a baseball...
12
just a baseball.
Scotty wakes up. Checks his (Theme) clock. 8:30. He bolts
out of bed. Dashes through the house to the front door.
Throws it open and runs down to...
...strips off his cowboy pj's. Redresses. Digs through his
CLOSET
finding a vinyl, "toy" baseball glove. It's still in the
package, with a note attached: "To Scotty Boy - Love, Grandma!"
It's all he's got. He shovels through a pair of Mickey Mouse
ears - a cowboy hat - finds the closest thing he's got to a
baseball cap... a long, duck-billed fishing cap with a big
embroidered trout.
Benny's at the window, clutching a baseball, staring over at
Scotty's house.
NARRATOR
So, the only person that ever felt
sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie
was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.
(BEAT)
Even though neither of us knew it at
the time, we were connected. Like I
had been born for just that one moment,
when I would perform the world's all-
time boner, and Benny would bail me
out.
(BEAT)
Connected as friends... born to meet
for just that one moment.
We DRIFT OFF Benny to his PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS in a pickle.
A PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS on a Post Super Sugar Crisp box.
BILL & SCOTTY
at the table. Bill sifting through mounds of paperwork. Scotty
eating breakfast. Scotty's spoon CLANGS one too many times.
Bill looks up at him.
SCOTTY
Sorry...
Scotty picks up his bowl and cereal, goes into
where his mom is making coffee.
MOM
(QUIETLY)
Well?...
SCOTTY
He's too busy, Mom.
MOM
(ENCOURAGING)
Go back in there and ask. He'll take
the time. Go on.
19
Scotty comes back in. Stops mutely near Bill. Long, agonizing
seconds pass. Finally:
SCOTTY
Um, Da -
Quick look toward the kitchen, then:
SCOTTY (CONT'D)
(so Mom won't hear)
- I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean
could you, like you said - teach me to
catch today?
BILL
Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta
get this done.
It ain't much, but it's something.
SCOTTY
Okay, thanks.
Mom comes in behind Scotty.
MOM
Bill, can't you take a break and teach
him now?
SCOTTY
Mom, it's okay -
(NOBODY'S LISTENING)
BILL
Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm
just under the gun here, ya know?
SCOTTY
Mom, really -
MOM
- How long could it take? You can't
spare a half hour to show him?
Bill drops his pen. Checks his watch. A lost battle here.
BILL
(ANNOYED)
Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove.
Come on.
20
Bill exits past them. Scotty's been "Mom-embarrassed." She
looks at him:
MOM
(CLUELESS)
There. See. Told you so.
Scotty shuffles out back, shaking his head.
Scotty's mom comes unglued.
MOM
Bill! What happened?!
BILL
Well, he -
23
SCOTTY
(PRIDE'S SAKE)
- just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
Scotty's mom pulls his hand away from his eye. Great shiner.
Bill grabs a steak from the fridge, FLOPS it over Scotty's
eye.
BILL
There. Keep that on for an hour.
It'll still be black, but it won't
swell.
(BEAT)
Sorry. We'll try again soon.
Benny grabs a new baseball on the stride, and handful of
bazooka from a jar on the soda fountain counter. He leaves
the money and exits. Scotty follows.
25
Scotty opens a new writing tablet, and titles the page:
"Baseball Stuff to Remember." He writes: "1. The Great
Bambino?" He hasn't got a clue.
A Boy Scout lantern. Professionally built structure. The
gang's got sleeping bags. They're roasting marshmallows over
a Cub Scout camping stove.
36
Ham's brought personal s'mores supplies.
HAM
Wanna s'more?
SCOTTY
Some more of what?
HAM
No. You wanna s'more?
SCOTTY
I haven't had anything yet, so how can
I have any more of nothing?
HAM
You kill me Smalls. Look, these are
s'mores stuff. Pay attention:
(CONCOCTING)
First you take the graham - you put
the chocolate on the graham, Hershey's
of course - you hold the chocolate on
the graham while you roast the mallow-
He does. The mallow flames to life.
HAM (CONT'D)
-then when the mallow's flamin', ya
stuff it on the chocolate and cover it
with the other end.
(BEAT)
Then, you scarf.
Ham does. The junk squirts half way down his shirt.
HAM (CONT'D)
(BARELY INTELLIGIBLE)
Kinda messy... Good though.
Squints turns the lantern down low...
SQUINTS
Alright, listen up.
(TO SCOTTY)
First time DeNunez heard this story he
FAINTED -
DENUNEZ
- Bull, Squints!
BENNY
You did, man.
DeNunez shuts up. It's true.
37
SQUINTS
When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his
pants.
YEAH-YEAH
Shut up, Squints - did not!
HAM
You did, man.
SQUINTS
And when The Ham heard it he barfed up
two bags of marshmallows.
HAM
Liar! It was only one.
SQUINTS
So stay away from the door... you
might fall out. And don't sit on your
sleeping bag... you could shit your
pants.
(SOLEMN)
Now, quiet...
Absolute silence. Kid-reverence equals fright.
SQUINTS (CONT'D)
The legend of The Beast goes back a
long time... before any of us could
pick up a baseball. Back to a place
called Mertle's Acres.
DREAMY DISSOLVE TO:
THE STORY OF THE BEAST:
Blurbling pockets of super-heated muck.
38
BURNED-OUT SHELLS
of twisted vehicles - strewn carcasses. A battlefield.
OLD APPLIANCES
that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses.
SQUINTS (V.O.)
Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place,
that had everything you could ever
imagine.
OTHER STUFF
like savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap
motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a
fighter plane.
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And the stuff was worth a fortune.
So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this
new pup from the pound. They were
glad to get rid of him, on account of
while he'd been there, he'd killed
three dogs bigger than he was.
(BEAT)
That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured
he needed to protect his junkyard,
'cause people kept stealing stuff at
night, when he wasn't around.
WE DRIFT THROUGH
a maze of dark, grimy junk-passageways.
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
So he bought The Beast, and set him
loose in Mertle's Acres.
SOMETHING LOPES BY
at the end of a passage. (NOTE: We never fully see The Beast.)
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The Beast was still just a pup of six
months, but he already weighed a 150
pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.
A TRASH BAG
full of meat hits the ground - disappears. SLIFFTHT! It
spits back INTO FRAME... empty and tattered.
39
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He threw The Beast a trash bag full of
meat every night, and just left him
alone. All alone in the whole place
by himself... to grow.
AN EYEBALL
among a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights.
FLEETING GLIMPSES OF MORE STUFF
like Mannequins, with bite-chunks missing. Plastic flamingoes,
brutally mangled. A decapitated "lawn jockey." A plastic
cow, legs gnawed off. And BREATHING... amongst the artificial
"life" forms.
A GARGANTUAN FOOTPRINT
in the center of an old truck tire.
THE BEAST'S SHOULDERS
moving powerfully - as tall as a burned-out VW.
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And so, in a few months, the pup grew
into The Beast. And he grew big as a
car. And he grew mean, 'cause nobody
liked him, and he didn't like nobody
either.
(BEAT)
And so he only had one thing on his
mind... to kill.
TWO THIEVES in ski-masks. Suddenly, a HEATED WIND strips
their masks. Two elephantine feet come down on their faces.
They SCREAM.
SQUINTS (V.O.)
And he did. And he liked it.
ANOTHER THIEF
suddenly enveloped by a shadow. He's dragged into darkness...
he SCREAMS.
TWO OTHER THIEVES
load their van and take off. They skid. CRUNCH! The van
caves in. The Thieves are dragged out, BLATHERING in horror.
40
FROM HIGH ABOVE MERTLE'S ACRES
The Beast moves like a murderous phantom. WE HEAR ROARING,
and primordial bloodlust.
VARIOUS OTHER THEIVES
are tossed hither and yon... mixed in with fake flamingoes,
and a flying plastic cow.
Ham drools mallow goop. His hands are fisted tight... 'mallows
squirt out twixt his clenched fingers.
REPEAT & TIMMY
have their pillows 'round their heads like bonnets.
DENUNEZ & YEAH-YEAH
stare and shake.
BERTRAM'S
eyes are shut tight, his bottom lip shudders.
BENNY
gulps.
SCOTTY'S
sitting shattered. He checks his pants to see if he's peed
them. His mallow's a briquette. It SPUTTERS and flames out.
SQUINTS
is proud of his story prowess.
SQUINTS
And so... The Beast sits there under
that lean-to, dreaming about the time
when he can break the chain and get
out... dreaming of the time when he
can chase and kill again.
43
THE GANG
BERTRAM
See, man. That's why you can't go
over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody
ever will.
HAM
One kid did, but nobody ever seen him
again.
DENUNEZ
That ain't true -
HAM
- yeah it is! He got eaten!
YEAH-YEAH
Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get
his kite... what was his name?
DENUNEZ
"Boogers" Fleming?
TIMMY
No. It was that guy with the warts on
his face.
REPEAT
Davy "The Toad."
TIMMY
That's what I said.
Solemnity spreads among them. Kid-reverence.
SQUINTS
Davy "The Toad" Stodenrous.
BERTRAM
Yeah, The Toad...
YEAH-YEAH
Yeah-yeah, poor Toad.
SCOTTY
(WEAK)
Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You
guys are just -
SQUINTS
- oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your
head out the window and look down.
44
Scotty goes slowly... He sticks his head out guillotinely,
through the small square opening.
Scotty pulls his head back, scared shitless.
SCOTTY
(HUSHED)
He's down there!
SQUINTS
You bet he is.
HAM
Whatever goes over that fence... stays
there.
SQUINTS
It becomes the property of The Beast...
Forever.
Scotty pours over his "Baseball Stuff To Remember" list: 2.
Maury Wills, 3. Mickey Mantle, 4. Willie Mays, 5. Hank Aaron,
6. Stan Musial, 7. Lou Brock, 8. Luis Aparicio, 9. Brooks
Robinson, 10. Frank Robinson, 11. Bob Uecker. Right Field is
near the green fence. Left Field is in the left. Double play
gets two outs. Triple play is impossible. Single is good.
Double is better. Home run is best. And, ominously, "Don't
get in a pickle or you're dead!" And one entry that's double
question marked: 1. The Great Bambino??
ON THE PROJECTOR SCREEN King Kong rips through the jungle.
THE GANG'S
here with 100 OTHER BOYS at the afternoon show.
Footsteps echo as the gang walks along, alone, in awe.
...Benny who's suddenly here watching a baseball game. The
gang's with him.
YEAH-YEAH
Yeah-yeah, here he comes. He's gonna
steal second.
BENNY
Naw he ain't, not yet.
TELEVISION - STOCK '62 DODGER GAME
Maury Wills on 1st. Taunting the pitcher. Big lead off.
NARRATOR
A guy that would break the stolen bases
record that year that had stood for as
many years as there were baseball's
lost to The Beast.
THE GANG
can't wait for Wills to go.
57
GANG
He's gonna go, Benny. Here he goes,
man. Right now, watch, watch. There,
there!
BENNY
leans forward seriously.
BENNY
No... not yet.
TELEVISION - STOCK '62 DODGER GAME
Maury Wills gets ready to steal.
NARRATOR
Maury Wills became a hero for what he
did.
BENNY
watches intensely.
BENNY
He's... gonna... go... riiiight...
now.
TELEVISION - STOCK '62 DODGER GAME
Maury Wills steals second.
BENNY
smiles to himself.
GANG
(CLUELESS)
How'd you know that? How'd you guess?
How'd ya know?
NARRATOR
Benny... would become a Legend.
Scotty opens the front door, BENNY'S THERE. 4th of July party
inside. All ADULTS.
BENNY
(URGENT)
Get your glove, c'mon.
58
SCOTTY
What's the big deal?
BENNY
Nightgame!
A BASEBALL on a silver pedestal (Bill's baseball). Scotty's
HAND ENTERS FRAME. His indecisive FINGERS almost touch the
ball... then, SNATCH!
Scotty's HAND ENTERS FRAME. Little anxious FINGERS wrapped
around the phony "Babe Ruth" baseball. The second the ball
is back on its pedestal:
78
MOM (O.S.)
Scotty?
DEN
Scotty whips 'round like he's been slapped by a wet mackerel -
Mom's in the doorway.
SCOTTY
Huh?!
MOM
Honey, what are you doing in here?
SCOTTY
Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean
Dad's baseball.
Scotty hurries away from the "autographed" ball.
MOM
You know he doesn't like you touching
his things.
SCOTTY
Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom.
MOM
Has he ever told you about that ball?
SCOTTY
Uh - no, not really, I don't think so -
no, he hasn't at all - I don't know
_anything_ about it.
MOM
It's signed by Babe Ruth...
Sweet mother of - Mom knows! Scotty may collapse.
MOM (CONT'D)
...the greatest baseball player that
ever lived.
SCOTTY
Um... really?
MOM
It sure is. Dad's father gave it to
him. Maybe someday, he'll give it to
you.
79
SCOTTY
(DAZED)
Uh... neat.
NARRATOR
It was salt in an open wound. Even my
own mom, who was only a grown-up girl,
knew who Babe Ruth was.
The gang's all here. Big plans. War conference.
SCOTTY
So, how do we get it back?
SQUINTS
I have no idea.
NARRATOR
I was dead meat. I knew it. They
knew it. We had thought that those
cards Benny had gotten meant that
something great was going to happen.
Now I figured that they'd just meant
my life was over.
SCOTTY
Can't we just hop the fence and get
it?
HAM
Remember Davy Stodenrous.
TIMMY/REPEAT
Poor Toad.
SCOTTY
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
(A THOUGHT)
Hey? Why don't we just go over there
and knock on the door, and ask Mr.
Mertle to get it for us?
Everyone looks at Scotty - the kid just sprouted a dunce cap.
SQUINTS
Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle
is the meanest old man that ever lived!
He's the one that sicked The Beast on
The Toad!
(BEAT)
That's not an option, Smalls. Forget
about it.
80
SCOTTY
Oh. Okay. I will.
Silent moments... not a single blinking idea between them.
Then, suddenly:
SQUINTS
We need to assess the situation!
GANG
(better than nothing)
Of course! Right! Good one, Squints!
Access (sic) the situation! Okay!
BERTRAM
Um, Squints? How do we do that?
SQUINTS
First we survey the enemy's environment,
then we make note of the surrounding
terrain.
HAM
What?...
SQUINTS
(COPPING)
I heard that on "Combat." Let's just
look out the window.
The guys jerk their heads back inside.
TIMMY
He's darin' us!
REPEAT
He's darin' us!
DENUNEZ
He's waitin' for us, man. Just like
he did with The Toad.
GANG
(REVERENT)
Poor Toad.
HAM
We're on his territory now.
BERTRAM
Think he's pissed?
BENNY
Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got
any bright ideas?
THE BIG MONTAGE STARTS WITH:
A tree house debate. Much shouting. Much disagreement.
Many hands miming mechanical contraptions.
NARRATOR
We had absolutely no idea what the
hell we were gonna do. So things
started primitively.
Bertram arrives. Hands "it" over. How embarrassing:
BERTRAM
It ain't mine. I told you, it's my
little sister's!
A Cootie Toy. They
ASSEMBLE THE INSECT
putting a hunk of chewed 'zooka on each Cootie foot. Attach
it to a plastic parachute - ah-ha! Genius. An airborne
assault!
THE GANG
DRIFTS THE
COOTIE N' CHUTE
out the tree house window. It floats silently toward the
baseball. The Cootie lands right on the Babe Ruth. The gum
sticks.
THE GANG
hauls it in.
THE BALL
slowly rises. Suddenly
83
THE BEAST'S JAWS
erupt from 'neath the lean-to and CHOMP the Cootie whole.
The string snaps.
THE GANG
pulls up the frayed end.
Now a War Room. Map of the Badlands: crazed trajectories,
distances to The Beast, etc. Coffee can PBX system. Cardboard
periscope. X's on a calendar counting down "Bill's Return."
The new retreival system:
THREE EUREKA CANISTER VACS
all connected. Ham's catcher's mask bolted to the end pipe
for ball securing.
They throw eureka switch one. WEOHH!
They throw eureka switch two. WEEOOOHHH!
84
They throw eureka switch three! RRRWWEEEOOOHHH!
The gang reels it in. Suddenly, the whole apparatus JOLTS.
The vacuums build pressure fast. WHINE crazily.
THE GANG
leaps from tree house.
SQUINTS
lingers in the trap doorway a second too long:
Flashlight beam at the fore, Scotty crawls with a safety rope
'round his waist. He pokes the cardboard periscope up through
the dirt.
THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
the Badlands from ULTRA LOW ground level. WE SCAN 360 degrees.
Suddenly, the scan stops. The name B A B E R U T H, FILLS
the periscope's lens.
HAM'S
strapped in at the tricycle winch.
YEAH-YEAH'S
dangling over the lean-to.
YEAH-YEAH
(into can phone)
Okay-okay, I'm right over it. Let me
down - slow!
HAM
lets go. Oops. WHIZZZZ!
88
YEAH-YEAH
plummets.
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D)
Ahhhh! Stop! STOP!
HAM
back-cranks.
YEAH-YEAH
comes to a twirling halt four feet off the ground.
YEAH-YEAH'S POV
into the lean-to. Blackness and dust.
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D)
'Kay-'kay, tip me, hurry up. I'm
gettin' the woollies.
Yeah-Yeah reaches... Gets it!
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D)
Okay get me outta here!
HAM
struggles.
HAM
HELP! I'M LOSIN' HIM!
YEAH-YEAH
looks down from the guys on the tree house - back to level -
"4 foot" eye-level with: THE BEAST'S MOUTH!
YEAH-YEAH
(QUAKING)
H - h - help! Help! HELP-HELP- HELP!
(TRYING ANYTHING)
Hail Mary Father who art star light
twinkle twinkle hey diddle diddle -
INSIDE THE TREE HOUSE
hands crank the trike wheel. Yeah-Yeah's to window level in
seconds. He's got the ball!
89
THE BEAST'S JAWS
leap into view.
THE TOW CHAIN
goes taut. The jaws abruptly disappear.
158
According to the calendar - 1 day till Bill's back. Scotty's
got the conch.
90
SCOTTY
I think I know how to get it.
(they're all ears)
Anybody got an Erector Set?
Eyes dart. Brows feint.
SQUINTS
That thing with the nuts and bolts and
tiny wrenches that you can build junk
out of?
SCOTTY
Exactly.
SQUINTS
Never heard of it.
HAM
I used to have one when I was like I
dunno, a little kid.
GANG
(LIARS)
Might have some pieces. Gee, I don't
think so. I'd have to look. Maybe in
the attic. Not in our room though.
The guys re-arrive. Each holding huge arm loads of Erector
Set stuff.
GANG (CONT'D)
Guess I had more than I thought. Forgot
my grandma got me some for my birthday.
It's my little brother's.
Scotty's brought his "Set." A footlocker full of neatly
arranged pieces. Nut and bolt compartments. Electric motor
sections.
BERTRAM
Bitchin'.
SCOTTY
I really like Erector Set.
GANG
(ATTITUDINAL 360'S)
Me too. I was just thinkin' the same
thing. Couldn't agree more, Smalls.
I play with mine all the time.
91
SCOTTY
Let's get to work. Here's the plans -
FURLSNAP! Holy cow! Scotty unfolds them - amazing crayola
blueprints drawn on taped-together grocery bags.
The guys swarm the tree house. Scotty supervises from the
backyard, wearing a plastic hardhat. They build. Scotty
hooks up electric motors. Throws one toggle, and...
Scotty stares up at the ceiling in oceans of worry.
The room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a "baseball-
bat" flashlight. Shines the beam toward his footboard...
illuminating the photo of The Babe.
BENNY
We can't get it back, Babe.
(BEAT)
I'm sorry.
Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT
GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out.
Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't
done this in years:
BENNY (CONT'D)
M - M - Mom?...
The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside
is oddly devoid of color.
BENNY (CONT'D)
Who's there?!
BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way
any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE.
THE BABE
Now don't go peeing your pants or
nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a
hand.
The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of
all the smoke.
BENNY
B - B - But, you're...
THE BABE
...dead? Legends never die, kid.
Benny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him.
BENNY
You're really him. You're The Babe.
The Sultan of Swat. The King -
94
THE BABE
- of Krash and a hundred other dopey
names. Forget about that, we ain't
got much time. I'm here 'cause you're
in some kinda pickle, right?
BENNY
Yeah.
THE BABE
A baseball with my John Hancock on it
went over a fence, and you can't get
it back. Right?
BENNY
Yeah, right.
THE BABE
(clear and simple)
Then just hop over there and get it.
There ya go. Problem solved.
(tips his cap)
See ya, kid.
The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny
grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something
"real."
BENNY
Wait! I can't.
THE BABE
Can't what?
BENNY
Go into that backyard.
THE BABE
Why not?
BENNY
There's a Beast back there.
THE BABE
What kind?
BENNY
A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one
kid already.
THE BABE
Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.
(MORE)
95
THE BABE (CONT'D)
Everybody gets one chance to do
something great. Most people either
never take the chance 'cause they're
too scared, or they don't recognize it
when it spits on their shoes.
(BEAT)
This is your "big chance," and ya
shouldn't let it go by.
(PAUSE)
Remember those cards you got the other
day?
BENNY
Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in
the same pack.
THE BABE
What're the odds on that?
BENNY
About a zillion to one.
THE BABE
More even. Someone's tellin' you
somethin', kid. And if I was you...
I'd listen.
BENNY
Yeah, but what?
THE BABE
You're the one with the rubba legs.
Figure it out.
(BEAT)
You gotta do what your heart tells
you, else you'll spend the rest of
your life wishin' you had.
BENNY
You mean, I should hop that fence -
and pickle with THE BEAST?!
THE BABE
Lemme tell you something... you
remember that called shot homer I hit?
BENNY
Sure, the greatest most famous and
legendary home run of all time.
THE BABE
Yeah, right, well said.
(MORE)
96
THE BABE (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
Well, you think I knew I was gonna
swat that?
BENNY
Sure ya did, Babe.
THE BABE
Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the
way down to first I kept sayin' to
myself, "you lucky bum."
(BEAT)
Think about that, kid. I'll see ya
later.
The Babe disappears back into the closet, then:
THE BABE'S VOICE
Remember, kid. There's heroes and
there's Legends. Heroes get
remembered... but Legends never die.
(BEAT)
Follow your heart, kid, and you'll
never go wrong.
A RACKET in the closet matching:
KNUCKLES on glass. Scotty hurries sleepy-eyed to the window
and opens it. Benny stands outside, holding a shoe box.
BENNY
(WITH PURPOSE)
I had a dream. Get dressed. We're
goin' to the sandlot.
A MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers
a "scooter-pie" in marshmallowy strings.
100
TODDLER
(BEAMING)
Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy!
(BEAT)
Big goggy.
The Mother looks out the passenger window.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Benny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead.
ON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex.
BENNY
comes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under
the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair -
lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of
folding chairs and blasts out the door.
KIDS' HEADS
turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at
THE MOVIE SCREEN
where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T
Rex,
THE BEAST
Leaps through the center of the silver screen - leaves a 6
foot hole - lands 20 feet down the aisle - CRASHES through
the doors and disappears.
Moments pass. Our guys follow.
101
Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr.
Mertle spends most of his time. He leads Benny and Scotty
INTO
THE BASEBALL ROOM
Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the
tabletop.
108
It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and
little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A
picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth.
SCOTTY
You knew Babe Ruth?
MR. MERTLE
Yeah. And he knew me too.
(BEAT)
They never let us play together, but
we were friends. Good friends. He was
almost as great a hitter as I was.
But, he'd of told you he was better.
The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second
greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth."
A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr.
Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct
positions. Mr. Mertle is blind.
MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
(HOLDING BALL)
This the one that went over my fence?
BENNY
Yeah.
Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather.
MR. MERTLE
This is an old ball, boys. Really
old.
(BEAT)
Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't
he?
SCOTTY
(WEAK)
Yes, sir.
MR. MERTLE
You sound upset, son - what's wrong?
SCOTTY
Well, you see... that ball belongs to
my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed
by Babe Ruth.
Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty.
109
MR. MERTLE
Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will
understand.
SCOTTY
I don't think so.
On the RADIO, Wills steals second.
MR. MERTLE
(TO BENNY)
Son, move Maury Wills to second base
for me, will ya?
Benny moves the little figure to second base.
MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
If he steals third that'll be number
100.
(TO SCOTTY)
Helluva pickle you're in, boy.
SCOTTY
Yes, sir...
Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball.
MR. MERTLE
I'll make you a deal. If you boys
come over once a week and talk baseball
with me, I'll trade you balls.
BENNY
Well, that's really nice of you... but
this ball really is signed by The Babe.
MR. MERTLE
(CHUCKLES)
This one really is too... and all the
rest of the '27 Yankees.
He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in
disbelief.
BENNY
Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
As they ogle the ball:
BENNY (CONT'D)
(AWED)
Lou Gehrig...
110
SCOTTY
Babe Ruth.
MR. MERTLE
(SMILING)
They're all there.
Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes
his hand.
SCOTTY
Deal.
On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen
base. Scotty notices the wall clock:
Mr. Mertle sits contentedly behind his little "diamond." The
RADIO ANNOUNCER calls Maury Wills' 104th steal of 1962.
MR. MERTLE'S DIAMOND
HIS HAND moves a wooden figure from 1st to 2nd. This tactile
"playing field" becomes...
...39-year-old SCOTT SMALLS - The Announcer - who returns
"Thumbs Up."
SCOTT
(after a pause)
The Jet stole home! The Jet stole
home!!
