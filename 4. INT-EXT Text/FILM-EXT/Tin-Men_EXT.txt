BILL BABOWSKY ("BB"), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his
mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac. A
SALESMAN follows on his heels.
SALESMAN
She's a beauty.
BB
(looking at Salesman)
Who?
SALESMAN
What?
BB
Who's the beauty?
SALESMAN
The car.
BB
I thought maybe you saw some chick
walking by. I lost my concentration.
Why do they call cars 'she'? They
never say 'he'... always 'she.'
The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.
BB walks around the
Cadillac.
BB
Very nice... very nice.

BB is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the
Salesman, going over the contract on the car.
BB
Now don't try to hustle me here
... you know what I mean. I hate
being hustled. Give me an honest
price, not one of your 'special'
deals... give me an honest price.
Do I make myself clear?
SALESMAN
Now, how much are you willing to
pay?
BB
There ya go... there ya go...
you're doing it... you're doing
one of those hustle numbers.

SALESMAN
I'm just trying to get an idea
how much you're willing to pay.
BB
Four dollars... I want to pay four
dollars a month.
SALESMAN
That's not an honest answer.
BB
What do ya want to hear? That I'd
love to pay three hundred and fifty
a month... is that what you want to
hear? Tell me how much you want me
to pay and I'll tell you how much
I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on
me... I don't like that. How much
do I want to pay? I'd like to pay
nothing!

Tilley's leaving the house with his tie undone around
his white on white shirt. He carries his sports jacket,
and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him.
NORA
You're being unreasonable.
You
don't even want to listen.
TILLEY
I don't know what I did... I got
no idea. If it's my fault, I'm
sorry... I'm sorry. I can do no
better than that. A full
unconditional apology.
Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his
car -- a Cadillac. He gets inside, STARTS the ENGINE and
pulls away. Nora remains on the porch watching the car
... one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of
duplicate houses.

SALESMAN
If you even have the smallest
problem, call me personally and
I'll just shoot you straight into
the service department.
BB
And I get a loaner if the car's
got to stay?
SALESMAN
As we discussed, you get a car if
the car has to be kept overnight.
BB
I get a loaner?
The Salesman nods.

BB gets into the shiny, baby-blue Cadillac, puts it in

BB sees the light is red and starts to back into the
street.

BB backs into the street thinking that Tilley's car is
going to stop.

Tilley's Cadillac and BB's Cadillac CRASH into one
another. The entire right rear of BB's shiny, baby-blue
Cadillac is smashed. Both men are shocked and momen-
tarily confused. After a beat, both Tilley and BB bolt
from their cars. Tilley looks at his buckled hood. BB
races up to Tilley's face.
BB
Are you a lunatic? Can't you see
I'm trying to back out of this
lot? There's a red light, you
shoulda stopped.
TILLEY
Me? What are you, crazy? You
just want to back into the middle
of the street like that. A man's
just driving along and you back
into the middle of the street.
What kind of driving is that?
What kind of driving?

BB
There's a red light, I'm making
a space for myself... that's
what I'm doing, in order to get
into the street... that's
something ya do!
TILLEY
You came out of nowhere... you
bolted out of no place... bolted
out of nowhere.
BB
Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm
bolting into the street! You
schmuck! You schmuck!
He moves toward Tilley.
TILLEY
Back away from me, do ya hear me?
Back away from me.
BB
Back away? You want me to back
away? I'll back away.
He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns
back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car.
TILLEY
You're a fucking lunatic!
He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the
trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and
immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart.
BB
You're a madman! Smashes into
me, attacks me... the man is
crazy!
People continue to pull them apart.
MAN #1
Come on now, calm down, calm down.
He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and
tries to pull him off BB.
MAN #2
Take it easy... take it easy...

TILLEY

Backs in front of me, and
then
kicks my headlight in...
and
I'm crazy. You lunatic!
Tilley makes another jump for BB.
Again, people try
pulling them apart.
BB
You're going to prison. Death!
Death! They're going to give
you death!
BB looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in
side.
BB
Car only has one sixteenth of a
mile, and I've been hit.
He turns back and looks at Tilley.
BB
I'm gonna get even with you,
you son of a bitch... I'm gonna
get even with you. This is no
ordinary traffic accident.
TILLEY
You want to drive a Cadillac,
learn how to drive. You want
to get even with somebody? You
picked the wrong person to get
even with. Nobody backs into
traffic, smashes my car and
says they want to get even.
I'm gonna get even!

Tilley gets out of his car and enters the diner.

We see BB pulling up to a building in his banged-up,
brand new Cadillac. There are three or four nice
Cadillacs parked outside of the run-down building.

BB's Cadillac moves through the neighborhood, and we see
homes that all look to be about 30 to 40 years old.

Slightly run-down.
We're looking THROUGH the LENS of a

BB

She's at the window.
MOE
Yeah.
BB
(in a loud voice)
This is going to be terrific in
Life Magazine.
(even louder)
Terrific in Life Magazine!
(under his breath)
Come on outside, honey.
MOE
(in loud voice)
This should be our single biggest
issue of Life Magazine.
We see the Housewife coming out of her front door.
BB
(quietly)
Bingo!
The Housewife approaches BB and Moe suspiciously.
HOUSEWIFE
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

MOE
Oh, I hope we're not disturbing
you, ma'am. We're with Life
Magazine... we'll be out of here
in just a minute.
BB
(still looking through
camera; to Moe)
Move the tripod another foot...
another foot.
Moe moves the tripod.
HOUSEWIFE
What do you mean, Life Magazine?
BB
(looking up
from camera)
Two minutes, ma'am, and we'll be
out of here. We just need the
picture for Life Magazine, and
we'll be out of here.
HOUSEWIFE
Life Magazine?
I don't understand.
BB
It's very simple. Ya know, we're
doing this layout about the
benefits of aluminum siding -- a
'before' and 'after' kind of
presentation.
HOUSEWIFE
A 'before' picture?
MOE
So they see your house, and another
one done with aluminum siding...
the other house looking so much
more beautiful.
HOUSEWIFE
In Life Magazine?
MOE
It's a special issue on home
improvements and ways to beautify
your home.
(CONTINUED)

BB
A wonderful issue... it's one of
the finest pictorial things we've
done here at Life... the ways you
can improve your house.
(he adjusts the
camera)
We're gonna be out of here in no
time, ma'am.
MOE
It's gonna look very good, BB.
HOUSEWIFE
My house is going to be the 'before'?
Can't mine be like the 'after'?
BB
No, no... we've got a house that
looked like yours and it's been
done in aluminum... it's very
nice.
MOE
Yeah... really shows the contrast
of what a house can look like.
HOUSEWIFE
What does it cost?
BB
What? The aluminum siding? Oh...
I don't know the figures offhand.
Do you have any idea, Moe?
MOE
I think it's fairly reasonable.
HOUSEWIFE
Could my house be the 'after' in
Life Magazine and you get another
house for the 'before.'
BB
You mean have your house as the
'after' and find another house
that looks like your house for
the 'before'?
HOUSEWIFE
Is it possible?
(CONTINUED)

BB
What do ya think, Moe?
Would
that be ethical?
MOE
Well, we didn't sign any agreement
with the 'after' house. We'd have
to move very quickly, ma'am... you
know what I mean?
BB
You'd have to work out an
arrangement with an aluminum
siding company and they'd have
to do the job very quickly for
us to make our deadline...
we've got a deadline, that's the
problem.
HOUSEWIFE
How quickly?
MOE
BB, what do you think? Can we
slide the deadline, or what? Six
or seven days?
BB
Pressing it. Do you think we
could manage it, Moe?
MOE
It's pushing it, BB.
(to Housewife)
What time would your husband be
home, 'cos he'd have to go over
the figures with the salesman...
that's if there's a salesman
available this evening.
HOUSEWIFE
He'll be home at seven.
BB
We might be able to work it.
HOUSEWIFE
That would be wonderful.

BB and Moe approach BB's Cadillac. He sees that all the
windows have been smashed in. Moe looks to BB. Looney
walks up from behind.
LOONEY
What? You got a special bargain
when you bought this car? They
come cheaper without windows?
BB reaches into the car and picks up a handful of broken
glass. He tosses it up and down in his hands.
BB
This guy's looking to play tit
for tat. That's not my game.
I'm gonna play hardball.
BB throws the glass down on the ground.
STANLEY
(to Looney, quietly)
What's going on?
Looney just nods for them to go, and they start to walk
over to Looney's Cadillac.
BB
I'm gonna find
out everything
about this son
of a bitch, and
then I'm gonna
find the one thing
that cuts him
to the quick.
MOE
Let's go inside... make some
calls.
BB nods and they start back inside.

A man sits behind the wheel of a plain-looking Ford.
Stanley, the new tin man, pulls up in his car behind
him, gets out and walks to the other man's car. He
kneels down and talks to the driver of the car. There
seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of
TRAFFIC and the cars passing THROUGH FRAME, we're un-
able to hear what is taking place. Stanley nods, taps
the side of the car, car drives off. Stanley goes back
to his car and drives off.

As the door closes behind Tilley, he goes to where
Sam's car is parked and gets in the passenger seat.
SAM
So, what's the scoop?
TILLEY
We got 'em!
He's very excited.
SAM
You're kidding?
TILLEY
Take a look at this, Sam.
Tilley shows him the written contract. Written across
the front of the contract in big, bold, black letters
are the words: "THIS JOB IS FREE." Sam looks at Tilley.
SAM
Are you fucking crazy? You
just gave them forty-two hundred
dollars in aluminum siding free?!

BB and Tilley
both take off their sports jackets.
BB
(seeing the people
gathering around)
What is this? What is this crowd
here? We're charging admission?
TILLEY
Back away... give me some elbow
room.
BB and Tilley both take up
fighting stances and circle
one another looking to take
a shot. A police car pulls
into the lot. The sound of
the tires on the gravel
catches Moe's attention and
he sees it's the police.
MOE
(quietly to BB
and Tilley)
Police!
Tilley and BB immediately drop their guards and lean
against a car. One cop gets out of the police car and
heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the
car. No one knows quite what to do since the policeman
is so nearby.
TILLEY

against the car;

You're a lucky man... the police

Boy, I tell ya, I bet you could

Too silly-looking.

Why didn't you at least give him

TILLEY
Fuck him! It's on my tab. At
least I've got six hundred in my
pocket right now. It's like
another loan. Sam, you got to

pocket. You know what I'm saying?

Moe are walking to BB's Cadillac parked close to Tilley's
car. They see each other.

Hey, Mr. Marengay went to the
track!
BB
Did you bother to bet, or did
you just hand your money to the
tellers?
TILLEY

The sarcasm's killing me.

I thought you were looking to
get even.
BB
Who's your accountant, mister,

debit side.

Who's stuck with my wife.
You or

You want me to believe that you

BB
What are you, crazy?!
Nora drives the car forward and then backwards again

Then she backs the car up.
BB tries to go around the

BB
It was a lousy thing to do, okay?
It was a lousy thing to use you

It was lousy... it was a
disgusting, terrible thing...

I didn't want to have to come

to ever see you again. I've gone
this far in my life without having
to have this kind of thing happen
to me. I was going through life,
sailing along, pretty good...
doing okay, and I tried to get
even with some crazy guy... and
I'm here.
NORA
The wet becomes you. Gets rid
of some of the slickness.
BB
I don't like the idea that I'm
not in control of this, but if
this stuff's got to happen, I
guess I've got no choice. I
wanna... ya know...

said that... I said it, okay?! I
wanna be with ya! It pisses the
hell out of me, and I'm gonna
tell you that to your face, but
I want to be with you because...
I miss you and I'd like to live
with you... I'd like to marry
you... and that's that!
Nora eyes him carefully. The rain falls on her umbrella

CAMERA PANS to see Nora's car pulling up in front of the
house. Nora turns off the car lights and exits the car.
She starts up the front walk and stops.
NORA
What happened?
TILLEY
The I.R.S... they need my
furniture. They got some living
room somewhere in this country
that needs to be furnished.
NORA
They're taking the furniture?
TILLEY
The furniture, the whole house.
They locked it up... they
confiscated it.
NORA
(yelling up to him
on the porch)
What do you expect? You expect
to get some preferential treatment
... you're some special case?
You've got to pay your taxes just
like everybody else has to pay
their taxes!
Tilley shrugs.
NORA
How many arguments did we used to
have about filing your taxes?
TILLEY
We had a lot of arguments.
Nora starts toward him.
Tilley sits on the steps.
NORA
(as she sits beside him)
There's a responsibility that
you've got to have. It's a long
way from high school, Tilley.
TILLEY
I
was doing pretty good there for
a
while... doing pretty good. Had
my
house, had a wife, a Cadillac...
I
still got my Cadillac.

NORA
Where are you gonna sleep?
TILLEY
I'll stay at Sam's for a couple
of days until I get set up.
(beat)
What're you doing here, anyway?
NORA
There's just a couple of things
you didn't throw out of the house
... a couple of things I didn't
find in the drawer.
TILLEY
I don't know... I did a pretty
good house cleaning number on you.
NORA
Listen, about the divorce. Do you
want to file, or should I file?
TILLEY
I got to be frank with you, this
guy is nuts.
NORA
He told me all about it... all
about how you threw eggs at him.
TILLEY
He told you it was about eggs?
The guy tried to break into my
house. He tried to steal things
from me.
NORA
He was trying to find me.
We had
an argument.
TILLEY
I think you'd be making a big
mistake if you married him.
NORA
It's not for you to make decisions
for me.
TILLEY
I think maybe I should, because I
think you're being misled... I
think you're confused. I think...

NORA
(interrupting him)
I know what I'm doing.
TILLEY
(interrupting Nora)
Nora, listen to me. I know about
guys...
NORA
(cutting him off)
I appreciate your concern, but
it's not for you...
TILLEY
(interrupting her)
But this guy is as bad a choice
as you could make. Bad choice.
NORA
You're a good one to give advice...
you're sitting on the steps,
locked out of your house because
you can't pay your taxes, and
you're going to give me advice on
life?
TILLEY
I'm not giving you a divorce, and
that's it. I'm looking out for
your welfare. No divorce.
Nora looks at him, starts to say something, then stands
up and walks down the steps of the house toward her car.
TILLEY
(yelling to her)
It's for your own benefit, and
you'll thank me for it.
Nora turns toward Tilley and suddenly snaps.
NORA
My benefit! You don't give a
damn about me! You don't give
a damn who I marry. The reason
you don't want me to marry is
because he's the one taking your
wife, and you've got your own
problems with him.

NORA (CONT'D)
You don't care about me... it's
the same bullshit you're doing.
That's what it always is with you,
Tilley. It's always you! The
I.R.S. took your house... your
furniture! You don't say anything
about my things in the house.
I've got things in the house I
worked damn hard for, and things
that belonged to my family... the
headboard that was given to me by
Aunt Josephine, it's got to be at
least a hundred years old... and
the hand-embroidered footstool...
TILLEY
What footstool?
NORA
The hand-embroidered footstool
over by the TV.
TILLEY
I don't remember seeing that.
NORA
It's been there forever... it was
my granny's.
TILLEY
It's been there forever?
I've
never seen it.
NORA
You've never seen it!? You've
never seen it!? You put your feet
on it to watch TV... the
hand-embroidered footstool.
TILLEY
I don't know what you're talking
about. I never put my feet up to
watch TV.
NORA
That's the way you are, Tilley, it
doesn't mean anything to you. You
don't care if they take it all
away. It's all you, Tilley!
That's the way it's always been.

She stands there for a moment, then turns back to her
car, gets in, slams the door and drives off. Tilley
stands on the front steps with a puzzled look on his
face.
TILLEY

He walks over to his car, gets in and STARTS the ENGINE...
shaking his head in disbelief.

Thanks for the lift back, BB.

Tilley drives into the parking lot of the Pimlico -- he
heads for a dark corner of the lot where about eight cars
are parked. As he's about to park his car, he sees Wing
talking to Masters in the car next to his. Tilley's a
bit confused, stays in his car watching them. After a
couple of beats, Wing gets out of the car and heads for
the Pimlico. Masters drives off. Tilley gets out of
his car and catches up to Wing.
TILLEY
Hey, Wing, isn't that the putz
from the Commission?
Points to car driving out of parking lot.
WING
Masters?
Yeah.
TILLEY
What the hell's he doing hanging
around here?
WING
He wants information.
TILLEY
I nailed his ass the other day,
Wing. Can't lay a finger on me.
I was amazing, you should have
been there. I was amazing... I
was respectful, courteous, but I
was slipping and sliding... they
couldn't touch me.

little up the street from the tobacco warehouse which
houses the Home Improvement Commission. He gets out

he realizes that there's an empty space and his car is

Did you have a car parked here?
A Cadillac?
TILLEY
Yeah.
What about it?
KID
A man told me to say they took it.
TILLEY
Who took it?
KID
Man said, the tax man.
Gave me a
dollar to tell you so.
Tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where
his car had been.
TILLEY
Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low
can you get? How low can you get?
He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might
reappear. He mumbles to himself.
TILLEY
They're lowlife. How can people
come and take a man's car?... His
Cadillac?

BB walks down the street, making for his car. He sees
Tilley still standing in the vacant parking space.
Tilley sees BB. BB stops.
BB
Sorry about your license.
TILLEY
Yeah.
You in there?
BB
Yeah.
They got my license as well.
TILLEY
Sorry to hear it.
BB
What are you doing standing there?
TILLEY
This is where my car used to be.
BB
Stolen?
TILLEY
I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits!
Thieving sons of bitches!

showing stacks of houses as the Cadillac drives away.
A MacDonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane
on the horizon line. It's almost as if it's a rainbow
across the far side of town, and the Cadillac will drive
through it.

Believe me, we'll find something.
It's just a matter of time.

I hear it's a beaut.
TILLEY (V.O.)
Maybe I should put in my order now.
BB (V.O.)
What're you talking about? You

TILLEY (V.O.)
Give me the pot... I'll fill it.
