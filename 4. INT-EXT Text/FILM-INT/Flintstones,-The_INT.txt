WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell
hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO
WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,
puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns
and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.
14

Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a
great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe
shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge
GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then
finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper
is thrown without aiming --

THE WOODPECKER

ducks just in time.
It wipes its forehead nervously.
RADIO WOODPECKER
(sotto)
I hate this job... There's not
even a health plan...
He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for
the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not
to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS,
looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating.
Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point
out the window.

Good morning, Bedrock. This is

IN THE BED

The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand
gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the
neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then
the fingers "walk" upwards...
RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
It will be fair and mild through
the weekend, continuing for the
next eight hundred years, followed
by cooling breezes and a protracted
ice age...
Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's
face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his
face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
FRED
(with genuine charm)
Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a
great big good morning kiss for
your Freddy-weddy?
And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is
immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed
and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
FRED
Dino!

By now Dino's affection
attack has knocked both master
and pet to the floor in
a jumble of bedclothes, asses
and elbows. Dino begins
to roll Fred across the room
like a seal playing with
a ball.
FRED
Dino, that's enough -- here, look,
Daddy has a nice dino bone for
you, just please stop it --
Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a
brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS."
Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for
the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes
out.
DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.

Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and

Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under-

WILMA
Fred, stop playing with Dino and

Saying this, Wilma puts

"YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred
cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
FRED

out of dino treats?
WILMA
So is everybody else in Bedrock.
That kibble crisis is getting
worse every day.
She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two
claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of
sight.
WILMA
I'm afraid Dino's going to have to
manage on leftovers from Pebbles

And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.
PEBBLES
(giggling, calming)
I'm still a little scared...
FRED
Pebbles, don't worry. These
stories are very exaggerated.
Like, you know, the boogyman?
There's no such thing as a huge,
inhuman reptile that attacks
without warning --
WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window
and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is
happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the
slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill,
looks out.
FRED
-- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman
is here --
"YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door,
lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against
the door.
Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were
the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the
toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then
looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.

Fred leans out the window, waving his hands.
FRED
Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at

WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams

a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the
kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this
action in time to see --

Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.
WILMA
Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.

He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing
a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred

Come on, kids. Time for nursery

PEBBLES
'Bye-bye, Daddy.
FRED
'Bye, little sweetheart.
(as Wilma clears
her throat)
'Bye, big sweetheart.
Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs,
tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of
course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
STRIKES AGAIN.
Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its
mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but
the voice is that of --
BARNEY
Nice morning, huh, Fred?
FRED
What's nice about it?
BARNEY
Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a
real arm on him, don't he?
Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff
legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the
hedge.
FRED
This is the third ragtop this year

honest with me, Barn... tell me
one thing you invented that
really caught on.
BARNEY
I invented fire.
FRED
(pause)
You invented fire?
BARNEY
I told you that, Fred. But the
coal conglomerate ripped me off.
The case is still in court, but
meanwhile I got lotsa other
ideas --
FRED
Yeah, but did any one of them
ever put bread on the table? How
long are you and Betty gonna live
on those penny-ante royalties you
get?
Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges,
examines it with dismay.
FRED
If you ask me, pal, you're just
blowing smoke up your own
volcano...
BARNEY
Maybe, Fred.
But first...
He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood
from Fred's surprised grasp.
BARNEY
Let me try some of that smoke on
your car.

We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway.
(We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a
bit more, then collapses from exhaustion).
Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and
ends, plus various inventions and scale models in
different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a
number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work).
Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
material.
Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood
into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
BARNEY
(as he works)
-- See, the first step, we make
a mold of the old car hood, smooth
out the dent in the clay --
He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash.
Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of
ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.
BARNEY
-- Add some lava granules... some
woca leaves... juice from two
coo-coo berries...
FRED
(impressed)
Two coo-coo berries?
You made of
money, Barney?
BARNEY
Anything for a pal, Fred -- a
lump of coal... bamboo sawdust...
eucalyptus sap... a touch of the
La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila.
Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it;
satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out
of his skin.

BETTY'S CAR - TRAVELING

The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the
kids' faces are messy again. Working together with
beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the
rear armrests and door handles.
BETTY
(in mid-speech,
driving)
... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining,
Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but...
well, he's just not cut out to punch
a clock. And he's such a dreamer,
you think he ever once picked up a
hammer and chisel and tried to
balance a checkbook?
They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little
nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees
them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un-
load the kids.
BETTY
No, Barney just keeps looking for
that coo-coo berry pie in the sky,
and I don't want to pop his balloon
by talking about the price of
mastodon ribs.
She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma
does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids,
who immediately run into the schoolyard.
MRS. GRANITE
(approaching)
Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I
wanted to thank you personally.
BETTY
You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But
we wipe their mouths every day.

steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma.
MRS. SLATE
I want a nice fresh, juicy
chickensaurus, Morris. And not
one you've had laying around on
the shelf. I mean fresh.
MORRIS
Mrs. Slate, we're kind of busy

MRS. SLATE
I don't care if you're busy. What
I care about is my adorable little

giant chicken-

The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural
model of a large scale construction project. There's
acres of little development houses, then some tall office
buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot-
powered model cars in the model parking spaces.
Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con-
struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks
coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience
to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their
heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer-
curial moods.
LAVA
Uncle, if you'll look at this unit
cost projection... it intersects
here with --
SLATE

intersect with your nose? I've
told you a hundred times, don't call
me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't
arrange your scholarship to Harvrock
University so you could waste my time!
So stop beating around the bushasaurus
and get to the bottom slime!
LAVA
You'll be bankrupt in six months.
Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model.
47
57
Slate stands in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up
from the model and Slate's face.
SLATE
Bankrupt?
Are you crazy?
Lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures.
LAVA
It's all here in hack and slice.
When you committed to this housing
development the price of dino kibble
was a few clams per ton. Since then,
it's gone up a hundredfold.
(indicating the model)
You can't build a project like this
without the heavy equipment dinos,
and we can't afford to feed those
dinos.
Slate glowers, paces around the model.
SLATE
I'm two months behind schedule, my
option's running out on the land
and Donald Trumprock is just waiting
to jump in and steal the whole deal
... meanwhile that damn union's on

Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a

which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams

You see this, Lava? All those

University, and who saves my bacon?
Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill

Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate.
Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with
genuine excitement.

Boys, this is a small step for
Slate Construction... a giant step

Not at all. I'm used to being

And she's sashaying up the path.
Betty and Wilma burn,

Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour!
Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants

MRS. SLATE
Thank you, Marie.
(showing a rock receipt)
I ordered the hors d'oeuvres for
the junior talent show. They were
out of Ceolanth caviar so I got
Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah,
these are my, uh, friends, Wilma

MRS. SLATE

(opening a drawer)
Here is ze application for him. An'

Mrs. Slate takes the parchment application. Meanwhile
the Headmistress looks appraisingly at Wilma and Betty.
HEADMISTRESS
An' your friends perhaps would like
zum school applications for zere

MRS. SLATE
(amused)
Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't
understand --
BETTY
(suddenly)
That's right, you don't understand.
My husband's business manager usually
handles this sort of thing, but I
don't mind.
And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the
parchments.
BETTY
I know Bam-Bam --
(correcting herself)
-- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love
attending your school and performing
in the talent show. Thank you oh
so much.
She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and
sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well.
Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.
WILMA
Let me have one of those, too.

They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney
flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the
back seat are some boxes and bundles.
BARNEY
Gee, Fred, I don't believe it.
Eight hours ago I didn't have a
job and now look -- I got 1/2 of
one percent of the after-taxes
after-expenses net breakage profits
on Fibrerock!
FRED
Just be thankful I was there to go
over the fine print.
(full of himself)
It's like I told you this morning
-- There's something noble about a
man digging in with his hands and
doing an honest day's work. Once
you file those dreams under 'old
business' and put your nose to the
plow, well, the world is your
oyster. And was I right?
BARNEY
No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't
nose any grindstones and you didn't
shoulder a wheel. We just hung out
together and everything that
happened was a total accident.
FRED
(after a moment)
Details, Barney, details...
(smiling)
I just can't wait to see the girls'
faces when we tell 'em the news...

The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands'

It's not like the boys to be so

BETTY
Unless they were forced to go
bowling again. Remember that time
a burglar pointed a gun at them
and said, 'go bowling right now'?
WILMA
Betty, sometimes you're a little
too gullible --
BETTY
Don't tell me. I still can't
believe what I did today...
WILMA
No kidding.
(indicating the forms)
Do you have any idea of what the
enrollment fee is? And get this...
it's non-refundable --
BETTY
I know, I know! I just couldn't
stand that woman's attitude! But
we had to find a new school anyway,
and there we were... the next thing
I knew, I was in over my head...
but why did you jump in, too?
WILMA
Oh, she was getting to me too with
all that mastodon snort about her
little nephew... and...
BETTY
And?
WILMA
And... if a friend can't help you
do something stupid, who can?
Betty smiles, touched.
Then reality intrudes again.

What's wrong with the truth?

Fred and Barney run in
with candy and flowers.
FRED AND BARNEY
Surprise!
Pause.
BETTY
Flowers?
WILMA
Rock candy?
That's nice, but...
why?
FRED
Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly
realized that we had a little spare
change.
WILMA
(sotto)
Not anymore you don't...
BARNEY
(presenting flowers)
Betty, these are for you. For
sticking beside me during the
tough times, and well... for
making a little guy feel like he
was ten feet tall.
BETTY
Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve
these. I did something really
stupid today.
BARNEY
Hey. Fred does something stupid
every day and I still love him.
Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.

Hey, '1'... a good year.
This confuses the girls even more.
WILMA
Fred, there's no easy way to say
this so --
She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on
the table so that Fred and Barney can read them.
Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and
yawn.

They can't believe this.
BETTY
Boys... did you see... the dollar
signs there at the bottom?
WILMA
The non-refundable dollar signs?
BARNEY
Plenty more where that came from.
FRED
We see your dollar signs, ladies...
and...
He tosses his stone contracts on top of the parchment
ones with a THUD.
FRED

Wilma and Betty look at each other, then at the contracts.

neighbors in the whole world.
Barney squeezes back.

The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing,
drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned
ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo.
One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below);
a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the
HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs
again for order.
HERDMASTER
Brothers, your attention!
It quiets a bit. He clears his throat, raises his chin,
and gives a strange mournful bellow.

HERDMASTER

This meeting of the Water
Buffaloes is now in session.
Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any
old business?
Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge
brothers.
BARNEY
Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster.
Tonight we are to hear speeches
from prospective candidates for
Lodge offices, such as good old
Fred and some other guys.
79
PILTDOWN

Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he
immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives
an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier
call to order.

After the CRY ECHOES away:
HERDMASTER
Brother Piltdown: You have given
the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at
the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you
wish to file an objection?
PILTDOWN
You bet I do. How come Flintstone
is 'good old Fred' and me and the
other candidates are just 'some
other guys'?
PYRITE
Yeah, how come?

BARNEY
(rising)
My apologies, Brother Piltdown.
Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we
will hear speeches from a whole
bunch of good old guys...
(pause)
... plus the one and only Fred
Flintstone!
Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of
the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium
as the noise dies down.
81
NEW ANGLE
81
Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up
tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it
to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big
"VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster.
Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does,
Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches
up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it,
continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands
Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each
other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.
Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down,
and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
FRED
(reading, at first
wooden, then
confident)
Brother Buffaloes, honored
Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and
Apprentice Antlers, a great good
evening to you all. Ahem. As you
know, our organization has survived
difficult times that have seen the
extinction of such other lodges as
the Order of Whooping Cranes and
Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But
we here have come through the croo
... the crux...
BARNEY
(hissing)
-- crucible --

FRED
(grateful)
-- crucible with our fur fluffy
and our hooves unscathed. Now,
the future holds many promises and
many problems. As your next
Herdmaster, I would bring to you
the same determination, courage
and -- if I may say so -- bold
thinking that I have brought to
the workplace. Thank you, and
ack ack a-dack.
Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.

Fred passes them...

WIDEN as Barney propels

not all) of these Lodge
members also work at the quarry.

AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER

It descends.
It consists of a bent snout creature which
"cranks" down
a shelf with several monkeys on it. The
monkeys grab
the pins with their tails, straighten them
up. Then the
shelf cranks back up.
85
OTHER END OF ALLEY
85
Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls...
another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc.
The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out
the last frame.
LODGE MEMBER
Congratulations, Fred.
FRED
Hey, when you're hot you're hot...
boys, lemme buy a round of drinks
for everyone.
BARNEY
Thanks, Fred, but here at the
lodge drinks are free.

But the principle is the same,
Barn. Don't forget that.
Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and
Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew?
Fred reaches --

FRED
Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say

week's election!
LODGE MEMBER
Fred, what was all that stuff in
your speech about the workplace?
I thought the only decision you
made there was how many lunches to
eat --
Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into
his pocket.
FRED
Well, Harry, it just so happens
that old Fred is moving up in the
world... Boys, you're looking at
Mr. Slate's new partner.
PILTDOWN
You and Slate? Who are you
kidding, Flintstone? The only
partner you got is hanging over
your belt.
Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.
FRED
Prepare to eat those words,
Piltdown.

He passes them out, and the others take them, curious --

tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close.
BARNEY
Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get

FRED
Barney, it's all part of the plan.
(to the others)
Yes, boys, you see, I went up to
my pal, Mister Slate and single-
handedly made him an offer he
couldn't refuse --

Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near
a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with
a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for
"pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs";
these have only Fred's name on them.)
BARNEY
Fred... what's this single-handed
stuff? I distinctly remember at
least four hands and two of them
were mine.
FRED
(lowered voice)
Barney, we could tell everyone how
you invented this Fibrerock stuff,
how Slate and Lava found out about
it by accident and all, but what
would that be?
BARNEY
The truth?
FRED
This is big business, Barney. We
can't start telling the truth,
it'd create the wrong impression.
Think about all the really big
deals in history -- back to the
beginning of recorded time.
Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
BARNEY
Okay.
FRED
What do they all have in common?
(as Barney is
stumped)
I'll tell you. A front man. A
guy who's out in the public eye
running the point, fighting the
crowds... and meanwhile... back
in the corner is the silent
partner.
BARNEY
I never knew that.
FRED
That's because the silent partner
is always silent.

FRED (CONT'D)
But while you're busy being
silent --

brains in front of the operation.
I'm out here running the guts of
the operation but you got a cut.
It looks like my mind, but you're
really behind.
BARNEY
I get it. I got the brains, but
you just pretend to have them.

He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear-

He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find
it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly
presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is
embossed on it in gold.

to make one more. You've been a
wonderful thug and goon for me.
Now, I'd like to expand your
duties. I want you to become a
provocateur.
PILTDOWN
Gee, Mister Lava, I donno.
I
kinda like girls myself.
LAVA
(patiently)
What I mean, is, I'm going to use
you to double-cross your Lodge and
Union brothers, and make their
lives a living hell.
PILTDOWN
Oh, okay.
LAVA
Good. You and your little pal
will report directly to me and
take orders only from me.

Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at
Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter,
balances it on his palm.
SLATE
Of course I can, Fred. I can lay
them off like --

of public relations to get
Fibrerock off to a good start.
I'm a member of that public,
Flintstone, and I have to say...
this isn't a good start. I'm

Fibrerock. A bad feeling about...
you. You want that feeling to go

How about a disappearing act?

We hear snatches of

Pebbles turns, the decision made.
PEBBLES
Okay. We're gonna sing a song
with Dino.
Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a
straw hat and a cane.
Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam
reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows
it --

MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance
routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac-
ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show
gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock
show. Most importantly, the routine includes the
following:
A)
Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop.

The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire

And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto
his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all
slide down the rope for a big finish.

It's been altered to read "Fred Finkstone." Also added

Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just
left a group of angry Buffalo.
FRED
Barn -- w-what's going on?
BARNEY
They're mad at you, Fred... it's
understandable, I mean, they all
got laid off today --
Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
FRED
Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a
quarry fulla layoffs got to do with
a lodge fulla Buffaloes?
BARNEY
Is that a riddle? Give me a
second --
PYRITE
(stepping forward)
I'll tell ya what! Mosta the guys
in this lodge work for Mr. Slate --
PILTDOWN
-- You mean used to work for him --
until somebody opened their big
mouth --
FRED
Fellas, come on. We're all big
boys here --
He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back
to the little band of brothers here.

Surely we can separate in our minds

HERDMASTER
All in favor, say --
FRED
Wait, wait... Your Antlerness,
please, one second -- !
Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around,
pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands
him up center stage.
FRED
Barney, you gotta tell the other
guys what really happened. Tell
'em the story behind Fibrerock.
The true story.
The room quiets.
Barney clears his throat.
Fred waits,
hopeful.
BARNEY
Well, there's not much to tell.
(trying to remember
Fred's phraseology)
True, I got a cut... but Fred's
got a gut.
FRED
No, no, the rest --!
BARNEY
Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the
mind, but Fred's got the behind.
Right, Fred?
Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.
Fred groans.
HERDMASTER
Thank you, Brother Rubble. The
Buffaloes will now have their
secret vote.

Everyone pulls their horned fezzes down over their eyes.

Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape.
HERDMASTER
All for Piltdown, bellow now!
The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS.
HERDMASTER
All for Flintstone, bellow now!
Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull.
Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around"
desperately, hoping to hear one more snort.
He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades
away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one
more lonely snort...
... from Barney, of course.
HERDMASTER
Order furs!
The fezzes come up.
HERDMASTER
The snorts have it! Brother
Piltdown, it is my privilege to
install you as the new Exalted
Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big
Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come
forward, I will present you with
the tokens of office.
Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium.

FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY

Fred's a broken man.
Barney moves over, puts his arm
around him.
BARNEY
I voted for you, Fred.
FRED
Big deal, after you screwed
everything up in the first
place...!
Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench.
Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.

WIDER

Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon,
smiles at the group.
PILTDOWN
Thank you, Brother Chairman.
Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few
words. It's no secret that most
of our lodge members are also
members of Amalgamated Neolithic
101... which means that most of us
aren't gonna be able to make our
cave payments next month. So my
agenda for tonight... ends right
now. There's a time to be a
Buffalo... there's a time ta be a
brown nosin' double-crossin'
creep...
All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
PILTDOWN
... and there's a time to stand up
and be a man! So let's go down
there and make the Slate shop into
slate scrap... then we'll see how
he gets along without the heavy
equipment operators of Neolithic
101! Meeting adjourned!
With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up.
Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
slapped on. The Buffalo run out.
When the dust clears, we see that only one member has
avoided the herding instinct: Barney.
Now, he turns, runs into --

BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT

Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully
at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he
sees --

Even his childhood shot has been defaced.

He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his
beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.

BARNEY
Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are
heading for big trouble -- !
FRED
No kidding. They rejected the
best candidate --
BARNEY
No, no, not that! Piltdown's got
the guys all worked up and they're
heading down to the quarry!
They're gonna wreck the assembly
line!
FRED
(genuinely worried)
Oh, no! That -- that's horrible!
(pause)
We could end up with half a
percent of nothing!
BARNEY
No, Fred, if they do that they'll
be breakin' the law! Our brother
Buffalo could go to jail!
FRED
Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come

As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and
Pyrite reappear.
PYRITE
Darn that Flintstone and Rubble...
they're gonna screw everything
up...
PILTDOWN
Not if we give 'em a nice long
vacation... in the hospital.
Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some
rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-
aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite
begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while
Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
which he flings below.
145
CLOSE - PYRITE
145
Winds up for another
baseball-type swing -- but as he
follows through, the
ball-shaped light fixture jerks up
on its cable. Unable
to stop in time, Pyrite spins
around, falls on his
ass.
Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from
the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his
free hand.
BARNEY
Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.
Ready
for a curve ball?
Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand,
he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.
69.
146
PILTDOWN
146
Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down
on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again.
Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another
see-saw motion...
... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and
peers under the beam...
147
NEW ANGLE
147
Fred is hanging on the other end.
FRED
Brother Piltdown... can we talk
about this, antler to antler?
Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
FRED
Guess not...
Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed
of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on
Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase
after Fred.
148
BARNEY AND PYRITE
148
Square off in the rafters.
BARNEY
Give me your best shot.
Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW
pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens.
Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...
... but this time the window is hinged in the center and
the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back
and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.
149
FRED
149
Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super-
structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in
an arc in front of him.
FRED
Dare you to cross that line.
Piltdown crosses it.
FRED
That line.
(CONTINUED)
70.
149
CONTINUED:
149
Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown
doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step.
Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a
straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best
cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of
Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute
Piltdown catches a ladder!
150
BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE
150
Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to
form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the
goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise,
and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is
struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the
clay.
151
OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS
151
Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do
their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough:
The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
152
FRED
152
is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.
153
THE FIBRE MOLD

shudders -- and shakes out a Fibre statue of... Fred!

The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting
to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the
mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down
beside him.
155
PILTDOWN
155
Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees
Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off
the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED"
SHATTERS.
156
FRED
156
Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked
Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to
"tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the
clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he
tries to move... can't!
71.
157
PILTDOWN
157
Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug
towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next
one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one...

Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes
aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea,
he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber
stamp.
Pyrite comes around the
corner... Barney's head butts him
in the gut, dodges under
his legs! Then, as Pyrite
stumbles, Barney stamps
his ass with the word "REJECT."
Pyrite looks back, sees
this, reddens... raises his club.
PYRITE
Reject, huh? Whaddya say we
reject your head?
He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and
grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the
club, howls --
159
WIDER
159
The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin
marked REJECTS -- and drops him.
Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and
defective Fibrerock goods.
160
BARNEY
160
Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts.
CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
another of the duplicate Freds.
Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above
the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps
into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the
Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
161
BELOW
161
Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when
Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into
him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor
towards --

162
THE END OF THE BUILDING
162
where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a
dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!
FELDSPAR
All right!
You're all under arr --
Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the
cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete
with appropriate sound.
BARNEY
(sitting up)
Whattya know. Even got the spare
again...
Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has
just fallen off!
Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay
and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself
further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of
the building.
CUT TO:

Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted"
posters of stone are hanging on the walls.
As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by
friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now
clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk.
BETTY
Barney, I don't understand... what
came over you boys?
EXITING BUFFALO

So long, fatso.

FRED
I don't wanna talk about it.
Besides, who cares about a bunch

He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty
look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred
out, puzzled.

Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of
Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its
predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge
office buildings beside it, and then a convention center
beyond that.
LAVA
... As you can see, the Fibrerock
is so light we're using it for
construction, for furnishings...
for everything. You can't stack
a two-bedroom cave this high...
but the sky's the limit with
Fibrerock!
SLATE
'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the
limit'... why, these two buildings,
they... they practically scrape
the sky! We should call them...
Slate scrapers!
LAVA
That's brilliant, Unc... Mister
Slate. In fact, maybe you can
help me with the centerpiece of
the complex...
(indicating the
convention center)
... I wanna call 'em the
FibreSphere and the '____'
something Needle... but I just
can't...
SLATE
(modestly)
How about, 'Slate Needle'?
LAVA
'Slate Need...'
(astonished)
... How do you keep coming up
with these? It's uncanny.
SLATE
(shrugging)
It's a gift...
LAVA

Oh, that reminds me, sign these,

... minor cost problems... that's
it... thank you...

Slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly
listens to what Lava's saying, just runs his stylus
through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile
"framing" the model city in his hands.
LAVA
(heading for the
door)
... Oh, Mister Slate, we're going
to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent
Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle.'
Good for public relations --
Lava breaks off.
He's just looked out the window and
seen --
166
LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW
166
A small figure appears behind some of the equipment,
tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards
the assembly line.
Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on
beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre
hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is
Barney!
167
LAVA
167
Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent
in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get
their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's
golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it.
168
BELOW - PILTDOWN

Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up
to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite
in tow.
169
BARNEY

Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos
bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the
Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the
massive bulk of --
170
PILTDOWN

Barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the
picketing workers of Neolithic 101.
PILTDOWN

Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava,

LAVA
Flintstone, that... that's a slap

Unless, of course, you agree with
Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't
capable of running this operation
... that I'm not capable of
running it?
FRED
(nervous)
Of course not, Mister Lava.
But --
LAVA
Call me Jerry. Sit down, please...
Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE
CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says --
LAVA
(offering one)
... Cigar?
FRED
Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.
LAVA
Fred, let me get to the bottom
slime. Some men -- you and me,
for instance -- we're cut out for
the big time, the big bucks...

Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars.
He puts

type, of --
LAVA
(giving Fred a
playful punch)
You're too kind, Flintstone,
that's what I like about you.
But you're a big guy with a big
decision to make. Are you gonna
keep covering for Barney, keep
pulling his acornsauruses out of
the fire... or are you going to

Lava throws the door open.
Fred's jaw drops as he

Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.
LEACH
'Ello,

Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble
homestead. He shakes his head sadly.
FRED
W-what's wrong?
LEACH
Well, just look at that yard over
there... barbecues and trikes, not
exactly the right image...
FRED
(pointing)
Maybe you could move those plants
to block them out...?
LEACH
Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin'
with those greens.
The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving
the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
WILMA
Fred, this was supposed to be a
'typical evening' at the
Flintstones, and you invited fifty
people I don't even know. Now
what's going on? Where are they
taking my ficus-sauruses?
FRED
It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.
It's
just not the right image...
He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and
trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses
a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good
measure.

BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

BETTY
Yeah... and it's all around his
belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma
I wouldn't give him the Geological
Time --
BARNEY
Trust me, Betty. After the
Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same
old Fred.
Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING.
Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the
yard and see --

THEIR POV - THE FENCE

The television crew has just finished nailing boards up
over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants
are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud
a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off
until Barney and Betty are in shadow.
Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza
dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird
bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.

QUICK CUTS - FLINTSTONE YARD - ANGLE ON "KLEIG LIGHTS"

Inside each one, a little BIRD in hardhat and smoked
visor lights up the arc, gets knocked on his butt when
it catches.
BIRD

I've heard of a flash in the pan,

He's squirming uncomfortably under the attentions of two

Finally, they're done and leave him.
He has been cut and trimmed like a French poodle. He
gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks
out. Then he arches his back, shakes out the hairstyle.

CLOSER ON ROCKIN' LEACH

The MAIN TITLE of the show can be heard O.S.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
And now... the man who brings you
the romance and excitement you
crave... from the casinos of
Monte Carlrock to the glamour of
Hollyrock, here's your guide to
the Rockstyles of the Rich and
Famous, Rockin' Leach!
Leach takes his cue from the director --
LEACH
(INTO CAMERA)
Good evening. Tonight we come
to you live from the ah... charming
pied a terre of the man of the
'our, Fred Flintstone --
Leach pauses, hearing the sound of someone CHIPPING AWAY
at a stone tablet... he looks up at --
184
HIS POV - FRED
184
He has just carved "FREDERICK" into a stone cue card
and points to it.

Now he's carved something grander.
Leach sighs, goes

NEAR THE HOUSE
187
Barney and Betty appear, Bam-Bam in tow. They come out
into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who comes over,
whispers.
WILMA
Thank heaven. There isn't one
person I know here.
BARNEY
You mean beside Fred?
WILMA
I mean including Fred.
They look over at --
188
THE SET
188
Where Leach has pulled Fred on camera. Fred is posing,
fluffing his ascot, etc. We notice a "FVF" embroidered
patch on his jacket.
LEACH
Frederick, of course, is the man
behind Fibrerock -- the invention
that some predict will
revolutionize life in the future.
Frederick, 'ow does it feel to
know that you 'ave personally
brought the Stone Age as we know
it to a long-deserved end?
FRED
(very affected accent)
Well, Rockin', you're right, I
have affected destiny for all
mankind, and it's a sobering
thought. However, if I may add a
personal note at this time, I
myself cannot personally take
all the credit for Fibrerock...
189
WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY
189
react with hopeful expressions --
BARNEY
(sotto, to them)
See?
What'd I tell ya?
85.

BACK TO SCENE

FRED
No, I could never have done it
without the inspiration and
support of a very special person.
I'm speaking, of course, of my
close friend and associate,
Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O.
of Slate Construction...

Barney's face falls.
So do Wilma and Betty's.
CUT TO:

198
The film crew caravan
is already leaving as Wilma, Betty

big spotlight. The house is dark,
forlorn in the fading
twilight.

REAR OF YARD - NIGHT
199
Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party.
Dino comes
over, nuzzles his leg.
FRED
Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah.
That's okay. Man and man's best
friend.
He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes
a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all
the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's
car and drive away.
200
FRED
200
sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF"
patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks
at --
201
THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY
201
202
BACK TO SCENE
202
Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he
grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in
a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters;
the potted plants go flying.
203
FRED
203
His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with
dirt... then he sees --
204
NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE
204
-- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure
sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --
FRED
(disbelieving)
B... Barney?
BARNEY

Hiya, Fred.

tuxedo)
Boy, the rental place is gonna
be mad...

BARNEY
Slimeball? Louse? Jackass?

Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
FRED
(wincing, but
taking it)
Barney... can... can you ever
forgive me for being such a jerk?
BARNEY
(stepping closer)
Sure, Fred.
(smiling)
I've had lots of practice.
FRED
(touched)
Aw, Barn...
And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both
their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two
prehistoric sensitive guys.

FIBRESPHERE & SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
205
Little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level
of the Fibresphere, where they enter a tunnel-like open-
ing labeled "THE WORLD OF FIBRE."
Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino are in one of these.
Now, we FOLLOW them as they chug into --
92.
206
THE FIBRESPHERE "WORLD OF FIBRE" RIDE
206
The cupolas rattle along in Disneyland style, passing a
sign which reads: "FIBREROCK--TRANSFORMING THE HOME."
Here, mechanical figures in an all-Fibre home move
klutzily around the room.
RECORDING (V.O.)
(a la 'The Great
Gildersleeve')
Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous
world of tomorrow... a world
brought to you by Fibrerock!
207
REVERSE ANGLE
207
REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human
family is a veritable family of monkeys, all working the
figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted
microphone is giving the narration.
PARROT (RECORDING) (V.O.)
Here, we see a typical family of
the future, free of the cares and
worries of today... yes, the great
kibble crisis is a thing of the
past when you're living the good
life... the Fibrelife!
208
NEXT EXHIBIT
208
The CARS CHUG past a display of tree trunks, leaves,
bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls
we've come to know... coo-coo berries. Iron bars and
vault-like doors separate the coo-coo berries from the
other items.
ANOTHER PARROT
Here, gathered from the four
corners of the globe, are the
secret ingredients of Fibrerock...
some common, some rare... all
making life easier for you and
yours!
209
THIRD EXHIBIT
209
The little CARS CHUG into an elegant salon, complete with
runway. There's another PARROT here in front of another
megaphone, but this parrot is chic and flamboyant.
FASHION PARROT
But does Fibrerock belong only in
the kitchen, the garage, the
workplace? No, no, no, my
darlings!
93.
210
FASHION MODELS ON RUNWAY
210
As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky
animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath
are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven
in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend
of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro).
FASHION PARROT
Because the clothes of the Stone
Age are as extinct as stones
themselves! Yes, thanks to the
wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world
of high fashion will be totally
transformed... by Fibre furs...
Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations
and Fibreshoes... it's to die
for!
211
FOURTH EXHIBIT
211
Now, we see a display of Fibrerock props of all kinds --
appliances, toys, tools, etc... all of it upstaged by a
choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've
seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh
and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals
all sing in unison --
FIBRE CHOIR (V.O.)

Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and
memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and
are singing.
FRED & BARNEY
'Now it's time to do or die, grab
that rock and kick it high, let's
fight, fight, fight for Bedrock
High!'
They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of
the many old photographs strewn around.
FRED
Boy, those were the days, Barney.
Bedrock High winning all those
games... and you and me right in
the middle of it.
94.

NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO
213
The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and
Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a
sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like
"mascot" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted
head under his arm.
BARNEY
Yeah.
Too bad we never made the
team.
FRED
So what? We made the team spirit.
That's just as important...
whatever happened to those
cheerleader costumes?
BARNEY
You know Betty. She never throws
anything away.
He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.
There they
are.
FRED
(rummaging in it)
Boy.
Talk about memories.
Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins,
pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old
"uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally,
he can zip it up, stern to stem.
FRED
Back then, we thought a pop quiz
was a big problem. We didn't
know how good we had it. No
problems, no worries...
Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like
head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail
behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and
forward.
BARNEY
Speaking of problems and worries,
shouldn't we get on over to
Slate's party?
Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into
place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in
sync.

FRED
(echo-y)
What for? So him and all his
fancy friends can look down their
noses at us?
Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred
steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his
direction.
FRED
(echo-y)
All they've been doing is using us,
Barney. And meanwhile --
Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for
a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge
where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
FRED
(normal voice)
-- Meanwhile all the time they
were laughing at us.
BARNEY
Yeah?
When did you notice that?
FRED
About an hour ago.
BARNEY
Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred.
Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING,
a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall
apart.
Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush
over to the model. It's the interim version we saw
earlier.
214
CLOSER - MODEL
214
The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning
into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube
Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first,
falling like dominoes...

Wha... what's happening?
Barney tries to stop the process, can't.

Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days
are rock solid.

BARNEY
It should be. There's enough
coo-coo berry resin in there to
petrify a brontosaurus --
Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models
to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing
awareness.
BARNEY
(snapping his fingers)
-- The coo-coo berries! Fred,
that's it!
FRED
What's it?
BARNEY
Remember I said the Fibrefoam
tasted funny? It was the coo-coo
sap that was missing!
FRED
But.. why would --
BARNEY
Why? Because coo-coo berries are
as valuable as goldrock! And
we've had tons of 'em delivered
to the plant since we started...
somebody musta got greedy --
FRED
-- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!
BARNEY
(alarmed)
Fred, that sap acts as a fixative
-- it's the glue that holds the
whole formula together -- !

Then... what's happening here...
BARNEY
(finishing it)
... Is gonna happen for real in
the real Slate City!
FRED
Oh no... Barney! Wilma and Betty
-- and the kids -- they're all
there --
With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN
and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story
by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle
is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner
plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.
FRED
(worried)
-- B-barney... what do we do?
Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered
flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.
BARNEY
Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's
our only chance -- their only
chance!
Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they
rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of
the model "Slate City"...

WIDEN FROM a young kid who is drinking a glass of water
and simultaneously singing with a ventriloquist's dummy.
Obviously, the talent show has begun.
In the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident
energy... gives Wilma a big look.

WILMA
Oh?
Is Fred getting promoted?
Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The
ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid
bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the
stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al
steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the
expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing
endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the
distant volcanic ridge.
HEADMISTRESS

waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.
HEADMISTRESS
-- An' now, what better
introduction could we 'ave for
Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran'
nephew... Poindexter Lava!
She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter.
He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins
to play:
POINDEXTER

'Dino of Spain, I adore you
Right from the moment I saw you -- '

QUICK SHOTS - AUDIENCE

Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the
little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their

On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls.

He surreptitiously checks his wrist watch...

is held in a green, scaley claw.
221
ANOTHER ANGLE
221
It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the
exhibits! Now,
the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights
up a cigar.
Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big
toolbox and
tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the
Fibre ride.

Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
FRED
What'll we do when we get there?
BARNEY
We just tell Mister Slate that all
500 acres of his development are
going to crumble into dust any
minute.
(holds up the
flit gun)
Then we zap the stairs and
corridors with some of this
coo-coo sap. I just hope we have
enough to get everybody out --
whoops!
He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun,
the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume,
and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one

BARNEY
Hang on, hang on --
Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred
flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand,
tries to help Fred with the other.
223
232
CAMERA PANS the audience as the accordion recital con-
tinues. Several people look visibly ill. Finally,
CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he
slides forward on his knees.
There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by
Lava and the Slates.
HEADMISTRESS
Sank you, sank you. Our nex'
performance is Bam-Bam, Pebbles...

... an' friend.
She steps aside as a spotlight picks out --
233
PEBBLES, BAM-BAM & DINO

poised in the stances we recognize as the "first
positions" of the "Dino Dance." However, whereas the
previous version of this was done impromptu and
a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw
hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully
costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the
dance is completely choreographed.

who glances over at the judges long enough to see that
they like this a lot better than the accordion act.
Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The
MUSIC DIES.
HEADMISTRESS
Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?
MRS. SLATE
I'll tell you what's wrong! This
'act' is an absolute disgrace!
This is supposed to be a talent
show!
And a pedestrian animal act
like this belongs in a circus!
236
WILMA AND BETTY
236
React, furious, jump out of their seats.
BETTY
A circus, huh? Well, if our kids
belong in a circus with their act,
then your little nephew belongs in
a zoo with his --
WILMA
Yeah -- a zoo where the animals
are dead -- because if they aren't,
they will be!
MRS. SLATE
Why, how dare you! Mrs.
Flintstein, I'll have you know
that my little Poindexter has been
trained by the finest tutors!
Poindexter! Show them! Encore!
The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another
GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK,
and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one
by one.
MRS. SLATE
(alarmed)
Ah... Poindexter... that's enough
... Poindexter...?
The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES.
Then one of the tables collapses.
Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares
at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside.
But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL
SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes.

Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.
Feldspar tenses, but

No sign of the driver...
FELDSPAR

Gravel drops down on one knee, excited.
He shines his
light on Fred's big "clawprints."
GRAVEL
Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep

He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with
the monster head again. Now, he freezes in twin flash-

241
FRED

Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged
house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself,
obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause.
Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact
has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its
hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks
at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.
Quickly, he runs toward it.

Suddenly one of those police DISPATCH PARAKEETS comes
flying excitedly through the window, lands on a perch in
front of the Chief.
DISPATCH PARAKEET
Calling all cars. Calling all cars.
Unconfirmed reports of destruction

Rescue vehicles are on the way.
The xenosaurus has been spotted

Barney starts to help... and then they both notice that
there's another monstrous head in the middle of their
group! There're big "takes" all around, and then the
xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies, treads
air, and runs away!

What the devil's going on here?
FRED
It's real simple, Mister Slate.
Your boy Lava here has been
stealing the coo-coo berries from
the Fibrerock mix and fixing the
books to hide it!
LAVA
That's ridiculous, Flintstone!
Nobody could get that many coo-coo
berries off our premises!

Suddenly the bottom of Piltdown's canvas sack rips
open. Thousands and thousands of coo-coo berries tumble
out.

LAVA

Slaps his hands over his face.

THE SCENE
254
BETTY
(dryly)
These sure look like coo-coo
berries to me --
LAVA
(smoothly)
They're convincing fakes, Mrs.
Rubble -- part of our exciting
display --
PYRITE
Fakes?
(to Piltdown)
Gee, Pilty, I thought the real
ones were gonna be moved up here
for us ta steal -- whatta waste
a time --
PILTDOWN
Pyrite, shaddup --
FRED
(snapping fingers)
Now I remember! These guys were
pulling this xenosaurus act that
night at the plant! What's this,
Lava... 'Plan B'?
LAVA
Uncle! Are you going to stand
there while aspersions are being
cast at the Slate family? This
is absurd --
SLATE
Of course it is! Why, without
the coo-coo berry sap, Fibrerock
would be completely --
(realizing)
-- unstable...
Suddenly the entire building shudders.
Dust falls from
the ceiling. Everyone looks at Lava.

LAVA
All right, all right, I admit it!
I got in over my head in the stock
market... took some big losses...
I had these guys pull jobs for me
all over town disguised as a
monster... but it still wasn't
enough... and when I saw all those
coo-coo berries being delivered
every day, I guess I just lost my
head... I figured with the Woca
sap in the Fibremix, the berry
juice as superfluous...
SLATE
I'll tell you what's superfluous,
Lava... your liver! So why don't
we remove it -- !
He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney
pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give
everyone more pressing problems --
CUT TO:

WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
beside it. He shuts the door.
Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
door... it's locked!
MUSIC (V.O.)
We'll have a yabba
dabba-do time
A dabba-do time
We'll have a gay old time!
FRED
(knocking)
Wilma...?
(another knock)
... Wilma?
CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil-
houette banging on the door.
FRED
Wilma?
Wil-ma --!
FADE OUT.
