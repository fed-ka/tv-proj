                    It doesn t feel real.  


      KATHRYN HAWKES (40 s-50 s) leads Lisbon past an eclectic mix 
      of classical and modern sculpture.

                      A terrible tragedy.  Terrible.

                    Did you know Mr. Lashley well?

                                    KATHRYN
                    No.  Not well.  I knew of him, 
                      obviously.  Poor man.  Very sad.  

                                  LISBON
                    But you think the loss of the 
                    painting is the real tragedy here.

                                    KATHRYN
                    Well, no.  Obviously, a human life 
                    is a sacred thing.  But  The Moro  
                    is a uniquely beautiful treasure.  
                    Beyond precious.   

                                  LISBON 
                    You know the art market.  Who would 
                    be willing and able to steal such a 
                    high-end item?  

                                    KATHRYN
                      Worldwide, there s probably a good 
                    hundred collectors with resources 
                    and passion enough to do this.  But 
                    ah, it s public knowledge, Mr. Caid 
                    outbid Shirali Arlov to get The 
                    Moro.  And Arlov wasn t pleased.  

                                  LISBON
                    Shirali Arlov, the shady Russian  
                    oil baron?

                                    KATHRYN
                    Him. 


      Jane and Van Pelt get out of the Citroen, parked across from 
      the village green.  There s a farmer s market in progress.     
      Jane takes in the Rockwellesque scene...

                                  JANE
                    How cute is this?  Almost 
                      sickening.

                                  VAN PELT
                    It sure doesn t look like the lair 
                    of high-end art thieves.  

                                  JANE
                    But no...

      Jane points to a small, white-shingled building on Main 
      Street.  A SIGN over the door reads:   ROB WALLACE ART 
      GALLERY AND FRAMING STORE.

                    Bingo.

      Van Pelt takes out her badge starts to put it on her jacket 
      pocket as they walk across the street to the gallery...

                                  JANE
                    Don t start with the badge.  Let s 
                    see how the land lies first.  Then 
                    show them the badge.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Well... okay.   

      She pockets her badge.  As they re about to enter the 
      store...

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Don t do anything embarrassing.

                                  JANE
                    What d you mean?  I never do 
                    anything embarrassing.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You know what I mean.

      They enter.

                                  JANE
                    No.  What d you mean?


      Annie and parents leaving the art gallery.


      Rob turns a SIGN around to say that the store s CLOSED.


      SHIRALI ARLOV -- (50 s) scarey, cold-eyed -- makes his way 
      through a spectacularly high-end hotel villa, where a half 
      dozen GANGSTERS sit beside a pool where four or five SLUTTY 
      YOUNG WOMEN frolic, the air loud with BALKAN TECHNO MUSIC.

      INSIDE THE SUITE, another group of gangsters play a VIOLENT 
      VIDEO GAME.  Guns and drugs laying around everywhere.  We 
      find the PORTRAIT of Carlotta Moro hanging on a wall.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      A glamorous swooping BIRDS EYE VIEW of Beverly Hills and the 
      Sunset Strip...


      Jane in back, Rigsby and Cho in front.  Jane taps in a number 
      on his phone.  Cho s PHONE RINGS.  He answers. 

                                  JANE
                    You ready?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     36.

                    Yes.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (doubtful)
                    Are you ready?

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    Ready.

      Jane drops his phone into his pocket, still on the line to 
      Cho.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    What s the signal?

                                  CHO
                     She is beautiful. 

                                  JANE
                    That s it.  Let s go.

      Jane gets out of the car.  He has the fake  Moro  (that he 
      borrowed from Rob Wallace) in his hand, casually wrapped in a 
      towel.  Cho and Rigsby follow at a distance.


      A burly GUARD in a flashy suit stands outside Arlov s door.

      Jane comes down the corridor, carrying  The Moro. 

                                  JANE
                    Hi.  I d like to speak to Mr. Arlov 
                    please.

      The Guard looks at him blankly. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Would you tell Mr. Arlov that 
                    Patrick Jane is here?  I have the 
                    Moro portrait that was stolen a 
                    couple of days ago, and I want to 
                    sell it to him.  

      Jane shows him the wrapped frame in his hand.  The Guard 
      frowns, puzzled.


      Jane leans against the wall, waiting.  The Guard emerges from 
      Arlov s suite.  Beckons to Jane.

                                  GUARD
                    Come.


      Arlov s entourage and other guests shuffle outside, Jane 
      amongst them, painting in hand.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.
