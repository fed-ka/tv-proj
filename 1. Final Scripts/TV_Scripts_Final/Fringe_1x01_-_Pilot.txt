                                         ACT ONE 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
  INT. AIRLINER   NIGHT 
 
  CLOSEUP on a FASTEN SEAT BELT sign, ILLUMINATING as the plan 
  SHUDDERS.  A jumbo jet.  International flight, half-full.  
  FLASHES of an ELECTRICAL STORM through otherwise BLACK windows 
as a tense PA ANNOUNCEMENT is made: 
 
                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) 
                      Das Sicherheitsgurtzeichen wird  
                        belichtet.  Befestigen Sie bitte  
                      Ihre Sicherheitsgurte. 
                              (then, accented) 
                      The captain has turned on  
                      the fasten seat belt sign, please make  
                      sure your seat belts are securely  
                        fastened. 
 
-- and PASSENGERS do.  Even the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS buckle up; 
and when they look nervous, it s never good. 
 
Up in FIRST CLASS, an older couple HOLD HANDS.  A few rows 
back, into coach, an overweight WOMAN looks to the nervous MAN 
  sitting beside her and says: 
 
        WOMAN       MAN 
Ich bevorzuge die Serie.    I don t speak German, I m 
                                                    from Denver. 
 
-- Weil - dieses mein          
  Erstflug ist.          -- I m - I m from Denver. 
 
-- and SHUDDER   the jet DIPS too much  -armrests gripped  - 
  BRILLIANT strobing  LIGHTNING as the plan LIFTS, BANKING one 
  way, then the other.  Further back in the cabin, an angry 16 
  year-old headphone-wearing BOY plays PSP, oblivious to the 
rough ride. 
 
Six rows behind him, a 45 year-old MAN is sweating.  Pale.  
  Distraught.  The TURBULENCE is clearly a problem  - but 
  something says  there s more happening here than just 
  airsickness and anxiety.  We ll give him this name for now: 
  TROUBLED.  Troubled closes his eyes, head back, trying to find 
  relief.  The 60 year-old INDIAN MAN beside him says, 
    comfortingly: 
 
                                      INDIAN MAN 
                      My friend.  It is just an 
                        electrical storm.  This will pass.  2

 
                                      TROUBLED 
                        I understand. 
 
                                      INDIAN MAN 
                              (offering a pack) 
                      Juicy Fruit? 
 
                                            TROUBLED 
                              No. I can t, I m fine.  Thank you. 
 
  Indian Man nods as Troubled pulls a briefcase from under his 
seat.  Opens it.  Goes through his papers -  the plane 
  DROPPING AGAIN as LIGHTNING strikes closer than before  - an 
  AUDIBLE REACTION from many passengers  - 
 
  Troubled pulls out a DOSING PEN  - a pen-shaped syringe for  
the injection of medicine.  Indian Man watches curiously as 
  Troubled finds a small MEDICINE CARTRIDGE and inserts it.  
  Indian Man doesn t really understand what he s watching  - 
and neither will most of the audience, and that s okay. 
 
  Troubled unbuttons the lower half of his shirt   pushes the  
pen against his stomach and TIRGGERS IT: POP!  He s just  
taken an injection.    
 
  Troubled loosens his collar when HOLY FUCK, THE PLANE DROPS  - 
  actual SCREAMS from some  - the LIGHTS IN THE CABIN DIM  - 
the LIGHTNING BRIGHTENS as if they re now flying through the 
  center of the Goddamn storm. 
 
  A GERMAN PA ANNOUNCEMENT from the cockpit doesn t help anyone 
who speaks only English -- and Troubled seems to suddenly be  
in far worse shape -  a sort of atypical PAIN.  Indian Man, 
  watching this, concerned, says:  
 
                                      INDIAN MAN 
                      -- my friend--? 
 
But Troubled is so fucking uncomfortable that he UNDOES HIS 
  SEAT BELT and heads for the bathroom.  He moves down the  
ROUGH and ROCKING cabin.  A dozen rows behind him, a FLIGHT 
  ATTENDANT strapped to her bulkhead emergency seat sees  
  Troubled and calls, in a German accent: 
 
                                      FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                      Sir, excuse me!  You must stay in  
                      your seat! 
 
But he keeps going -  and so she reluctantly unbuckles and 
  stands -  grasping row after row as she moves for him  - he s  3

  well ahead of her, having even more difficulty walking as the 
plane struggles through the erratically blinding storm  -  
 
                                      FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT D) 
                      -- Sir!  You have to sit down! 
 
But Troubled keeps going  - STUMBLING  - we re ONLY ON HIS  
  BACK NOW as he heads away from us -  from her -   
 
                                      FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT D) 
                        Entschuldigen Sie mich., geehrten  
                        Herrn, bitte!  Gehen Sie zu Ihrem  
                      Sitz zuruck! 
 
  Troubled keeps going, steadying himself on the seat backs as  
he moves  - the Flight Attendant gaining.  Practically the  
  only light we get now is from the WILD LIGHTNING and SEAT  
  BELT lights -  and finally she catches up to him -  reaches 
  out, grabs his shoulder -  and she turns him toward her -  
  toward us -  AND HIS FACE IS A THING OF HORROR: HIS FLESH 
  LIQUIFYING   FUCKING MELTING   HIS EYES BALLOONED IN UTTER 
FEAR  - and the Flight Attendant s eyes go wide in a 
  terrifying PRE-SCREAM GASP as Troubled GRABS HER ARM  - and 
she SCREAMS BLOODY FUCKING MURDER --   
 
-- and THOSE WHO SEE HIM DO TOO  - and if this isn t enough, 
  Troubled THROWS UP ON HER   and she stumbles back, SCREAMING 
and the jet momentarily PLUMMETS again!  Troubled FALLS BACK 
as the Flight Attendant gets up, covered in bile and in shock 
and she runs toward the back of the plane as we realize we ve 
  been HEARING SOMEONE ELSE  YELL  - not in English or German, 
but in HINDI.  The Flight Attendant runs past INDIAN MAN -  
WHOSE FACE IS FUCKING MELTING NOW TOO   HE S LOSING HIS MIND 
-  LOOKING AT HIS HANDS   THE FLESH PAINFULLY LIQUIFYING! 
 
-- Indian Man stands  - hurries in a panic toward the front  
of the plane -  passing ANOTHER PASSENGER, who STANDS in  
crazy alarm -  SCREAMING IN GERMAN  - HER FLESH  
    DISINTEGRATING TOO: 
 
                                      GERMAN WOMAN 
                        Helfen Sie mir!  Was?  geschieht!   
                      HILFE! 
 
Indian Man runs PAST  - RIGHT OVER -  the VISCOUS, BONE AND 
MUSCLE CORPSE of TROUBLED as another FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes a 
  frantic call on the service phone -  
 
                                      FRANTIC FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                        Kapitan, haben wir etwa--!

The LIGHTENING STORM IMPOSSIBLY TURBULENT, ANOTHER seated 
  PASSENGER is suddenly SCREAMING  - HIS BODY COMING APART. 
 
  Then ANOTHER  - now the TEENAGER with PSP  - now the  
  OVERWEIGHT WOMAN  - now the ELDERLY COUPLE  - and we PULL  
  BACK AT HIGH VELOCITY, LENS WIDE, WHIPPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE  
AT THE HORROR SHOW OF EVERY SCREAMING PASSENGER, AFFLICTED, 
  GROTESQUE  - lit by BURSTS OF LIGHTENING  - 
 
And we PUSH IN now as the CO-PILOT opens the cockpit door and 
looks back, seeing the plane  - EVERYONE ON THE PLANE  - 
  SCREAMING, MELTING  - DYING  - the Pilot hits AUTO-PILOT,  
turns back, yells: 
 
                                      PILOT 
                        SPRECHEN SIE MIT MIR! 
 
THE CO-PILOT TURNS TO US   HIS FACE ALREADY STARTING TO DRIP 
BLOOD AND FLESH AND OFF THE PILOT S TERROR-SCREAM CUT TO: 
 
EXT. SKY   NIGHT 
 
The jumbo jet, flying in the awful storm.  A sarcophagus, at 
    forty-thousand feet.  The cause of this gruesome event an 
  absolute mystery.  And things are about to get weirder. 
 
And as if to announce this fact, from the VERY EDGES OF  
FRAME, WHITE LETTERS APPEAR  - and CONVERGE NEAR THE RIGHT  
SIDE OF FRAME as the rest of the image, the background, TURNS 
GREY  - and our short but spooky THEME PLAYS as the LETTERS 
TURN BLACK  - AND SPELL, SIMPLY: 
 
                              F  R  I  N  G  E 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
  EXT. TURNPIKE MOTEL   NIGHT 
 
  A cheap-ass motel.  An old neon TURNPIKE MOTEL sign.  The 
  constant SQUEAKING of a flimsy BOX SPRING is HEARD  - and as  
we DOLLY IN, WORDS FADE IN (NOTE: A SIGNATURE OF THE SERIES 
  WILL BE HOW LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED  - WORDS WILL APPEAR 
    THREE-DIMENSIONALLY, AS IF EXISTING WITHIN THE SPACE).  In  
  this case they read:  LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTES , PUSH PAST  
THE WORDS to   
 
  INT. TURNPIKE MOTEL ROOM   NIGHT 
 
  A small motel room.  A WOMAN falls back, into frame, lying on 
the bed.  She s naked. Glistening.  Smiling.  Out of breath.  
She s 32 years old, beautiful, but real.  A deceiving  5

  innocence.  Her name is OLIVIA WARREN.  This is our woman.  
  Suffice to say, the SQUEAKING has ceased. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      & oh my God. 
 
And she starts laughing.  A male VOICE, off-camera, says: 
 
                                    MAN (O.S.) 
                      -- what? 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      This bed is ridiculous.  It s like  
                      the loudest bed in the history of 
                      cheap motel beds. 
 
                                    MAN (O.S.) 
                      -- and you would know this how? 
 
She smiles as he, past her, lies back into frame.  This is 
  Olivia s love.  He is 41.  Handsome.  Tough, but kind.  His 
  name s JOHN SCOTT.  Also out of breath. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      This is so much better than that  
                        policy seminar. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Oh, thank you, a compliment. 
 
He takes her hand, they lie there. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      I was losing my mind, that meeting  
                      was endless.  I kept finding myself  
                        staring at you.  I actually had to  
                      turn my chair to stop. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      We can t keep doing this.  Sneaking  
                        around& 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      The department s not a massive fan  
                      of office romances   as recent  
                        events demonstrate. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Dryden seeing Lynch had nothing to  
                      do with why he was demoted-  you  
                      don t see any irony in what we re doing?

                                    JOHN 
                      Is knowing the assistant manager of  
                      the Turnpike motel by name ideal?   
                      No. Is being with you worth the 
                        subterfuge?  Yes.   
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        I feel like I m living in a  
                        Charlotte Bronte novel.  Which is  
                      now how I envisioned my early  
                        thirties.  I think Charlie knows  
                        anyway. 
 
                                      JOHN 
                      He doesn t know. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        I think he does -  
 
                                      JOHN 
                      If he knew, you d be transferred. 
 
This quiets her.  Then: 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      I like Charlie.  But if there was  
                      ever a by-the-booker, it s him.   
                      He d let Jakes know faster than you  
                      can say  good soldier .  I m not  
                      afraid of transparency - but we re  
                        already working for a Department  
                      that s as unstable and fluid  
                      as they come and somehow?   
                      We found each other.  And in the madness of 
                      what we ve been seeing lately&  
                      I ve taken great solace in being  
                      with you.  Now if that s the kind of 
                        information that makes you back  
                      away, so be it.   Cause this is all  
                        preamble to the kicker, which is 
                      that I love you. 
                              (beat, that was a first) 
                      And the idea of an old boy s club 
                      wonder making the call whether or  
                      not you and I get to live in the  
                      same city is unacceptable to me.   
                      So forgive my&furtive nature,  
                      it s got nothing whatsoever to do  
                      with protocol or decorum or  
                        enjoying the status quo -  this is  
                      about you.  I don t want to lose& 
                      you.  7

 
  Olivia stares.  Taken by his honesty and heart -  and she 
  kisses him -  and it quickly gets passionate again -  and 
  they re definitely going for another round when a CELL PHONE 
RINGS  - they both moan at the interruptus.  Olivia reaches 
over, answers: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Agent Warren. 
                              (listens, sits) 
                      Okay.  Are there any more details \ 
                        than--? 
                              (beat, concern) 
                        Yessir. 
 
  Olivia hangs up. 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                        Incident at Logan Airport, 
                        International flight, Charlie s on  
                      his way. 
 
  John nods, and they re both up, getting dressed. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      Hey, in the spirit of our talk& 
                      you should get there a few minutes 
                      after me.  We arrived pretty close 
                      last time. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      Now you re being paranoid. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Maybe   Logan: access gate at 
                        Runway 15R 
 
CLOSE ON AN OPEN BADGE WALLET on the desk  - a FEDERAL AGENT 
  BADGE.  Olivia, dressed, grabs it -  then moves to John,  
  kisses him sweetly -  about to say something -  but doesn t.  
She grabs her keys and leaves.  John stands there, in the  
  wake of her tornado.  Alone.  Amused.  Then his cell RINGS.   
He answers, already knowing it all: 
 
                                      JOHN 
                      Agent Scott. 
 
  EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT   NIGHT 
 
  PUSH IN, past the (signature, three-dimensional) WORDS THAT 
  FADE IN:  LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT   BOSTON    this is an  8

  access gate  - three POLICE CARS are here, lights BLAZING, 
  FLASHING in the night. 
 
  Olivia pulls up in her black hybrid Lexus, shows her creds. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Olivia Warren, FBI. 
 
  Guards check her ID, squawk walkies, wave her in.  BOOM UP to 
  reveal the JUMBO JET from the opening, a light-show of two 
dozen EMERGENCY VEHICLES, including a CRANE, surrounding it.  
  Olivia parks, gets out  - crosses half a dozen FEDERAL  
  AGENTS, all ARGUING issues of protocol, information, 
    jurisdiction.  An angry, heated fight.  Olivia continues past 
them, met by 43 year-old fellow Agent CHARLIE FRANCIS. 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Inter-agency harmony and 
                        cooperation continues.

                      Who s winning? 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Langley by a nose. 
                              (then, re: jet) 
                        Flight out of Hamburg  - hundred  
                      and forty-seven passengers, towers  
                      lost contact three hours in.   
                        Thought there might ve been some  
                        electrical interference, apparently 
                      they were flying in a hell of a  
                        storm.  They entered our airspace  
                      radio silent -  Navy scrambled two  
                        F-18 s for escort.  They reported  
                        stains on the windows...and no  
                      signs of life aboard the jet. 
 
  This stop Olivia  - she looks up at the jet  - the cabin is too 
  dark for her to see anything.

                       No signs of life  -  who was flying  
                      the plane, auto-pilot?

                        Programmed to land right on  
                        schedule, which it did.  Unlike  
                      every flight I ve ever taken.

                      If there was a decompression the  
                        windows would have frozen solid  - 
                      have they opened the cabin? 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                      White House approved a CDC request  
                      for the jet not to be opened until  
                      they arrive. 
 
  Behind them, a BLACK VAN arrives.  The drive gets out   
  it s JOHN, on a cell: 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      let me assure you, we d be happy 
                      to treat you like family too. 
                              (hangs up, grins) 
                      Good old NTSB.  All like to think  
                        they re cops.

                      Agent Warren. 
 
Their relationship, their secret.  She turns back to Charlie:

                      They must ve looked in through the

                      CIA did.  Whatever the hell s  
                      inside that plan made Special  
                      Agent McNeary throw up in front  
                      of his whole unit.  And he s a  
                      good man, that was embarrassing.  
 
    A finger-to-mouth WHISTLE turns everyone to PHILLIP BROYLES, 
  SPECIAL-AGENT-IN CHARGE from HOMELAND SECURITY.  Broyles is a 
  bureaucratic Hitler, with authority to puppeteer the Federal

Agents on the move, Olivia, disturbed, goes after Broyles:

                      Sir: Olivia Warren, FBI Inter-

                      force.  Gotta love that.  Like 
                        powdered sugar on a glazed donut. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Excuse me, if I m gonna do my job  
                        effectively, I like my information  
                        first-hand -  that s not  
                        redundancy, that s accountability.

                      You want in, Liaison?  Suit up. 
 
And the bully walks off   Olivia watches him go, indignant.

  EXT./INT. JET   NIGHT 
 
  VARIOUS SHOTS as CDC MEDCIAL OFFICERS connect an AIRLOCK to a 
  door outside the plane -  a twelve-foot-long elevated  
  corridor with three clean-room compartments.  A staircase  
leads up to it. 
 
Now there are FOUR CDC OFFICERS in HAZ-MAT suits.  They start 
up the stairs.  Following them are Olivia, Charlie and the  
  rest of the appointed agents, also in HAZ-MATS.  At first, NO 
  MUSIC.  Just the odd collage of oxygen tanks: INHALE&  EXHALE& 
 
The CDC Officer pulls out the recessed jet door handle.   
Turns it.  The HISS of DECOMPRESSION.  TIGHT ON OLIVIA S EYES 
as she anxiously watches the plane DOOR OPEN.  Darkness and 
  mist inside.  Their FLASHLIGHTS come alive: CLICK, CLICK, 
  CLICK, CLICKCLICK.  And they enter. 
 
  Olivia s eyes GO WIDE at what she sees. 
 
                                    CDC OFFICER 
                              (filtered) 
                      &holy God& 
 
    Red/white/blue FLASHES of emergency lights from outside and 
their flashlights the only illumination.  Every passenger  
dead.  Unrecognizable.  Crumple CLOTHES lie in GELATIN,  
BLOOD and BONE.  Tears come to Olivia s eyes   her breathing 
  uneven as she moves through the plane.  Charlie sees this: 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Warren...you okay? 
 
OFF OLIVIA S STARING EYES, answering that question& 
 
  EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT   NIGHT 
 
Where Olivia drove in  - a passing WHITE VAN stops  - all 
  windows TINTED.  Even the front windshield has mild shading.  
The driver s window LOWERS a few inches, we don t yet see the 
  silhouetted DRIVER who asks on of the GUARDS about the POLICE 
  ACTIVITY surrounding the plane on the distant tarmac: 
 
                                      DRIVER 
                        Excuse me  - what s going on?  Some  
                      sort of problem? 
 
                                      GUARD 
                        Nothing you need to know about, sir  
                      -  please keep moving. 
  12

  PUSH IN on the Driver as he leans into the light -  REVEALING 
  THAT HE S THE SAME MAN WE SAW FROM THE AIRPLANE -  THE ONE WHO 
  INJECTED HIMSELF   WHO MELTED FIRST: TROUBLED! 
 
                                      DRIVER 
                      Okay&I ll do that.  Thanks. 
 
And with an eerily satisfied smile, the Driver DRIVES AWAY.  
And as our minds somersault, we CUT TO: 
 
  TELEVISION SCREENS -  DOLLY PAST an array of TV MONITORS of 
  NEWSCASTS all reporting on the plane  - LONG LENS SHOTS OF THE 
  ARILINER on the tarmac, NOW ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  Over this, 
  REPORTERS, some outside Logan, others in newsrooms:

                                      OLIVIA 
                      It freaked me out.  Not because it  
                        doesn t make me happy.   
                              (beat)   
                      I ve been sort of&bad with this.   
                      For a long time.  The alpha girl  
                      thing hasn t always gone over super- 
                      well. 
                              (beat) 
                      Until you. 
                              (beat, sweetly awkward) 
                        I wanted to say I love you, too. 
 
He moves to her.  Kisses her.  Then, faux-romatically: 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      Let s go check the trash together. 
 
She laughs -- and we TIME JUMP to them going through a  
  dumpster -  pulling out a DISCARDED, UNLABELED CHEMICAL 
  CANISTER.  Then ANOTHER.  She opens one: 
 
        OLIVIA       JOHN 
Empty  -       -- acetylene, 
  propane? 
   (sniffs the nozzle) 
-- no  - it s ammonia. 
 
  A look between them.  He turns to the nearest STORAGE UNIT, 
  emboldened, starts PICKING THE LOCK  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        What re you doing? 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      What are you doing?  I m a Federal agent. 
 
SNAP: the lock gives.  He grabs the handle on the roll-up   16

metal door and heaves, it SLIDES UP  - REVEALLING A FUCKING 
  LABORATORY. Shelves filled with GAS CANISTERS, CHEMICAL 
  BOTTLES, COOLING UNITS  - AND LARGE SPECIMEN JARS, FILLED  
WITH DISFIGURED SMALL ANIMALS& 
 
  Olivia and John trade a look: holy shit. 
 
SMASH CUT TO another roll-up metal door SLIDING UP  - ANOTHER 
LAB; VACUUM EQUIPMENT, RADIOLOGICAL SUITS, ELECTRON 
  MICROSCOPES, IMAGE ANALYSIS EQUIPMENT, AND THREE CAGES 
  CONTAINING SMALL, MUTATED, VISCOUS CREATURES. 
 
And then ANOTHER  - and ANOTHER  - all the labs dangerous, 
  lethal - 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      We gotta get a chem transport team  
                      out here now   
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      I m on it. 
                              (but:) 
                      -- no signal  - 
 
She heads away to make the call& 
 
  TIMECUT: A NEARBY FIELD  - Olivia on her cell, moving for a 
better signal  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      We need PPE and emergency  
                        equipment, HAZ-MAT specialists for  
                      site analysis - 
 
WITH JOHN 
 
  Another roll-up metal door SLIDES UP revealing more LAB SPACE  
-  he moves into it cautiously, checking out equipment    
sees a COMPUTER MONITOR -  sees on the screen: PROGRAMS 
  RUNNING, BALANCING CHEMICAL EQUATIONS. TIGHT ON JOHN S FACE, 
eyes wide like he s hit paydirt -  then, behind him, forty  
feet away, another storage unit opens -  a FIGURE APPEARING 
INSIDE  - another LAB behind him -  and HOLY SHIT, IT S THE 
  DRIVER  - THE MAN FROM THE PLANE: TROUBLED! 
 
  John turns  - sees him -  Troubled s eyes go wide -  AND HE 
  RUNS  - John pulls his gun -  runs after him -- 
 
  Troubled is FAST -  turning a far corner in the maze of  
  storage units -  and John runs after him -  pulling out his 
phone and hitting speed-dial  - but he gets NO SIGNAL -  
  17

                                    JOHN 
                      -- damnit - 
 
He tries again -  as we CUT TO: 
 
  OLIVIA running back  - her PHONE RINGS -  she answers  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        John - 
 
As John RACCES through the facility  - reception BREAKIG UP  - 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      I ve got a runner!  He s heading  
for the back! 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      I m on my way! 
 
-- and Olivia runs toward the back as John runs -  and we re 
  MOVING FAST, INTERCUTTING between Troubled, John and Olivia -  
a cat and mouse chase  - 
 
  Troubled -  RUNNING -  pulls out a PHONE, dials a number,  
  hits send, but doesn t bring the phone to his ear  - 
 
  INSIDE THE SHEDS   CIRCUIT DETONATORS MOUNTED ON THE CEILING 
  ACTIVATE, A GREEN LIGHT SNAPS ON -  A SPARK AND FLASH AND 
  SUDDENLTY IT IGNITES, FLAME TRAILS ROCKETING UP THE WALLS  -  
  
OLIVIA running, HEARS GUNSHOTS  - she goes faster -  rounds a 
corner  - sees Scott -  
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                        JOHN!!! 
 
  Suddenly: KABOOOOOOM!!!  THE FIRST SHED DETONATES -- JOHN 
  DISAPPEARS IN A BLAST OF CHEMICAL GREEN  - now the NEXT SHED 
BLOWS   and Olivia s HURLED backwards as the place continues  
to EXPLODE!  CLOSE ON OLIVIA ON THE GROUND  - ULTRA-SLOW  
MOTION as debris rains down -  she s BLEEDING from her scalp  - 
her eyes slowly open wide -  the WHITE NOISE overwhelms us and 
we -- 
 
                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

  INT. MILITARY MEDCIAL CENTER   DAY 
 
  WHIP PAN TO OLIVIA  - still bleeding -  WHEELED IN on a  
  gurney at speed   two EMT s with an ORDERLY who applies 
  pressure to her shoulder wound.  Olivia s in pain  - 
  suppressing tears  - asking questions no one will answer -  
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      -- where s John-  is he okay?   
                      Agent Scott, where is he?!   
                      Is he all right?! 
 
-- a DOCTOR arrives, injecting her IV bag with MORPHINE -  
 
                              OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      -- no - wait-- please&please& 
 
-- and as Olivia begins to pass out, JUMP CUT TO: 
 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY 
 
Olivia STARTS awake   disoriented.  Her head bandaged,  
facial wounds treated.  She realizes she s alone in a strange 
room, machines watch her vitals.  Without much thought, she 
pulls the wires off (ALARMS sound), rips the IV out, stands, 
and in her hospital gown, moves to  - 
 
INT. HOSTPIAL HALLWAY   DAY 
 
She heads down the corridor as a NURSE approaches  - 
 
                                      NURSE 
                      Ms. Warren, you shouldn t be up-- 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      I need to see John Scott-  do you  
                      know what room he s in? 
 
The Nurse just stares at Olivia&whose eyes fill with  
tears.  At a whisper, she asks: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      --what--? What is it? 
 
                                      DOCTOR (O.S.) 
                      Agent Warren  - 
 
Olivia turns  - a 60 year-old Hispanic DOCTOR (DR. REYES)  
moves to her.  Clearly, he has bad news.  19

 
                DR. REYES      OLIVIA 
I m Dr. Reyes.  You were very  
lucky today.  Your wounds  
could easily have been much     --I m looking for Agent 
  more severe--           Scott, he was with me-- 
 
                                    DR. REYES 
                      In addition to the injuries he  
                        sustained from the blast&Mr.  
                      Scott was exposed to synthetic  
                        chemical compounds.  Work that was  
                        apparently being done in those labs  
                      you found. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                              (brace, but tears come) 
                      -- what-  what sort of--? 
 
                                    DR. REYES 
                      We haven t been able to identify  
                      the substance that s affecting him.   
                      The CDC has sent in other  
                        specialists.  But they ve never  
                      seen anything like what s happening  
                      here. 
 
  PUSH IN OLIVIA, her quiet terror, our TENSE MUSIC GROWING. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      &what is happening? 
 
INT. QUARANTINE AREA   DAY 
 
SLOW MOTION as OLIVIA MOVES THORUGH DOORS MARKED  
     QUARANTINE .  A WHITE CORRIDOR.  HEAR THEIR TALK CONTINUE: 
 
                                    DR. REYES (V.O.) 
                      We ve put Mr. Scott in a drug- 
                        induced coma.  His body temperature  
                      has been lowered significantly , to  
                      try and slow the progress. 
 
                                      OLIVIA (V.O.) 
                      The progress of what?  Please& 
 
                                    DR. REYES (V.O.) 
                      One way to describe it is that he s  
                      been infected.  But it isn t a  
                      virus.  It isn t a bacteria.  And  
                      what it s doing&is most  
                        unusual&  20

 
She enters a PLASTIC CLEAN AREA, then a STERILE, REFRIGERATED 
  HOSPITAL ROOM. 
 
  Olivia s BREATH is seen as she emotionally approaches JOHN, 
  unconscious under a separate CLEAR PLASTIC TENT, seriously 
  wounded and barely alive at 37 degrees. 
 
                                    DR. REYES (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                      His tissue is hardening.  And 
                          somehow&clarifying.  His skin  
                        becoming almost glass-like. 
 
She gets close enough -  more afraid and sad with each step -  
sees areas of John s skin, on his chest, neck, face  - have 
become CLEAR -  revealing the MUSCLE and VEINS beneath  - 
  Olivia s eyes widen& 
 
                                    DR. REYES (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                      And it s spreading.  Soon his  
                      organs will shut down.  Unless we  
                      can learn more about what s  
                        infected Mr. Scott -  the compounds  
                      he was exposed to&he ll be dead  
                      within a week.

CUTS as VARIOUS WORDS are TYPED IN:  MEDICAL ,  INFECTION , 
   TISSUE ,  CHEMICAL ,  HARDENING ,  CLARIFYING    and the 
  HUNDREDS OF RELATED ARTICLES that pop up  - 
 
INT.  OLIVIA S OFFICE   NIGHT 
 
She sits at her desk in her darkened office  - has been there 
for hours.  Eyes red, worn, she types with hands that have 
SMALL CUTS from the explosion.  She jots down things that 
  matter.  VARIOUS SHOTS of CLICKING, TYPING, WRITING, 
  RESEARCHING, the related articles that appear ON SCREEN: 
  HOSPITAL RECORDS, PHYSICIAN REPORTS, INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL 
  REPORTS, ARTICLES  - and then a name: 
 
DR. WALTER BISHOP. 
 
TIGHT on Olivia s face -  as she seems to notice something -  
she quickly TYPES  -  DISSOLVE  and  FLESH  -  ENTER    
  another LONG ARTICLE -  CLASSIFIED, FBI, 1982 -  SCROLLS DOWN  
-  finding, once again: 
  21

DR. WALTER BISHOP. 
 
No WAY.  She types more  - PUSHING IN -  her eyes now 
  determined, driven  - and whatever she sees makes her get up, 
  quickly, and move to -  
 
  INT. FEDERAL BUILDING   CORRIDOR/OFFICE   NIGHT 
 
Fast, HANDHELD down the hall  - Olivia turns into an open 
  office door to find Broyles at his desk, haggard and ready  
for an all-nighter.  She knocks as she enters:

                              (drops a file on his desk) 
                        I found a connection between the  
                        Hamburg flight and what s happened  
                      to Agent Scott. 
 
  Broyles opens the file: BLACK AND WHITE PRINTOUT of BISHOP, 
  stamped CLASSIFIED.  A printed PHOTO of him from the early 
  1980 s.  Handsome, 30 s.  Even in this photo, he s ingenious.

                      I saw that.  An assistant of his  
                      was killed in his lab -  rumors  
                      about Dr. Bishop using humans as

  EXT. BAGHDAD, IRAQ   DAY 
 
  PUSH IN as a MILITARY HUMMER passes, revealing a village piazza 
  with an old fortress at one end and a BRAND-SPANKING 
NEW BUILDING at the other.  3D letters appear:  AL-SAREED HOTEL 
    BAGHDAD, IRAQ.  
 
                                      OLIVIA (V.O.) 
                      He s a high school dropout.  IQ at  
                      190, which is fifty points north of  
                        genius.  Misfit.  Nomad.  Hasn t  
                      kept a job longer than two months. 
 
  A TAXI pulls up in front and a MAN gets out.  This is PETER 
  BISHOP.  35, handsome, fit.  A quick glance and you see a 
  swagger.  Drive, confidence.  A closer look shows a sadness.  
    Desperation.  We ll learn more -  but for now, just know  
Peter is our third lead.  He looks up at the building,  
  readying himself. 
 
                              OLIVIA (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                      He s been a wildland fireman, an  
                        Alaskan crab fisherman, truck  
                        mechanic, a cargo pilot and,  
                        briefly, a college chemistry  
                        professor.  He falsified a degree  
                      from MIT, and even managed to get a  
                      few papers published before he was  
                      found out.  Sounds like a massive  
                      pain in the ass. 
 
  INT. HOTEL ROOM   CONTINUOUS 
 
  Sunlight streams onto faded carpets.  The atmosphere as thick 
as it is hot.  Peter sits in a chair facing TWO IRAQI 
    BUSINESSMEN; one wearing an Armani suit and yellow-tinted 
  glasses  - the other, older one, in double-breasted  
  pinstripes: 
 
                                      PETER 
                      My resume is hardly traditional.   
                      But in these parts, traditional  
                      seems increasingly irrelevant.  A  
                        hundred billion dollars sunk into 
                        infrastructure, you re barely  
                        keeping the lights on.  So.  You  
                      need construction oversight of a  
                      600 mile pipeline to carry crude   25

                      from the field at Kirkuk to the  
                      Port of Ceyhan.  A job well outside  
                      the Green zone, I might add while  
                      I m still alive to do so.  You ll  
                      need someone with a handle on the  
                      laws of hydrodynamic resistance  -  
                      heat exchange in oil mixture flow    
                        a working knowledge of mixed  
                        integer programs so you can re-size  
                      the pipes you re gonna use across  
                        uneven terrain, that s if you wanna  
                        minimize construction costs. 
                              (a touch of urgency) 
 
                                      PETER (CONT D) 
                      It s the Wild West here guys, I get  
                      it.  And you need a sheriff.  So  
                      gimme a badge and I ll wear it.   
                      The punch line is, I need this job  
                      as much as you need me to do it. 
 
And there s a creepy pause: the Iragis are impressed but 
  unsure.  Glasses looks to Pinstripes, murmurs in ARABIC.  
  Pinstripes talks Arabic back.  Peter leans in  - 
 
                                      PETER (CONT D) 
                        I speak Arabic too.  And yes, six- 
                        hundred grand all-in sounds fair. 
 
The men look at him, caught off guard.  Peter grins.  PRELAP

INT. HOTEL LOBBY CONTINUOUS 
 
Peter walks out with the gait of a gambler who just won a  
game -  and a reprieve.  It s sweltering, even with all the 
fans in the lobby.  As he heads for the exit:

He turns, fast: OLIVIA approaches.  She shows her badge:

                He s the mane we re looking to speak

                  status&you re the only one who  
                can provide us access. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      What possible help could that man  
                      be?  And what you want me to go

                      Let s out it this way: I d rather  
                      stay here.  In Iraq.  That s how  
                      much I want to see my father. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      You have no obligation to help.  Of  
                        course.  So&I m gonna be you.   
                      One human being to another.  Mr.  
                        Bishop, your father may be able to  
                      save someone who s dying.  Someone  
                        I care about very much. 
 
He almost half-considers, then: 
  27

                                      PETER 
                        Sweetheart, we re all in love with  
                        someone who s dying.  I m sorry.   
                        Excuse me. 
 
And Peter walks off.  She watches him go, as anger as she is 
  heartsick.  Then she says, loudly, strongly: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        I know why you re here. 
 
And Peter stops.

                        whereabouts.  Your call. 
 
  Whatever the hell she s talking about, he s pissed.  Still,  
he suddenly smiles, as if everything been fine all along: 
 
                                      PETER  
                      Hey, what time do we leave?

She hangs up.  Stares off.  Peter then sits beside her.

                        twisted, myopic son-of-a-bitch on

                        flavors.  Back in the day before  
                      gels or cinnamon-vanilla-mint.  I  
                      know that there was an accident in  
                      the lab one night -  a fire.   29

 
                                      PETER (CONT D) 
                      That someone died and my father was  
                        arrested  - the first truly  
                        peaceful period in our time.  And  
                      the last time I saw him.  I know  
                      that while still in custody he  
                        suffered a nervous breakdown and  
                      was thrown in St. Clair s, where  
                      he s been ever since.    
                              (beat)   
                      My gut tells me your friend s life   
                      - the one that hangs in the balance  
                        --isn t going to be saved by a  
                      tube of Pepsodent. 
 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Have you asked me your question  
                      yet? 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Who was he.  My father. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                              (beat, then) 
                      He worked out of Harvard.  But not  
                      on toothpaste. He was part of a  
                        classified U.S. Army experimental  
                        program called Kelvin Labs.  They  
                        considered him a great genius. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Yeah, I remembered  brilliant ,   
                      remember?  Between  abusive  and  
                         twisted . 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      They gave him the resources to do  
                        whatever work he wanted, which was  
                      primarily in an area called Fringe  
                        Science.  He conceived experiments  
                      meant to push the boundaries of  
                        possibility.  And, some would say,  
                        ethics. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Fringe science-  you mean  
                           pseudoscience.

                                      OLIVIA 
                        I suppose.  Things like mind  
                        control.  Teleportation.  Astral  
                        projection, invisibility, genetic  
                        mutation, reanimation, fertility   
 
                                      PETER 
                        Waitwaitwait - stop. 
 
He just stares at her -  taken aback by this -- 
 
                                      PETER (CONT D) 
                        Reanimation.  You telling me what.   
                      My father was Dr. Frankenstein? 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                              (awkward beat) 
                      Maybe this explains some of your  
                        father s behavior.  Knowing that he  
                      was working on things&other than  
                        toothpaste.  
 
                                      PETER 
                      Yeah. Yeah, childhood solved.   
                        Thanks. 
 
And Peter gets up and walks away from her.  TIGHT ON Olivia s 
  face&and our MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES OVER: 
 
  EXT. MASSACHUSETTES ROAD   DAY 
 
  A grey countryside.  3D LETTERS FADE IN:  ESSEX COUNTY, 
    MASSACHUSETTS  and they FADE OUT as Olivia s black car drives 
along  - passing a sign that reads,  ST. CLARIE S   3 MILES . 
 
  EXT. ST. CLAIRE S   DAY 
 
The MUSIC CONTINUES as we find a cold, VA-looking building in 
the midst of beautiful countryside.  A SIGN,  ST CLAIRE S 
  HOSPITAL .  PUSH IN as Olivia s car arrives, she and Peter  
  step out.  Olivia and Peter enter. 
 
  INT. ST. CLAIR S   CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
MUSIC PLAYS as Olivia and Peter are led by an ORDERLY through a 
  SECURITY DOOR, then down a long, tiled hallway.  Peter, pale, 
  STOPS.  Olivia turns to him-- 
 
                                      PETER 
                      You go ahead. 
                              (beat) 
                      I m gonna&wait.  In the lobby.  31

 
Their eyes meet  - he s clearly unable to go through with 
  seeing his father for the first time in seventeen years.  
  Olivia nods, and Peter walks off.  She then follows the  
  Orderly to a solid CELL DOOR, with a wired-glass window.  The 
  Orderly unlocks it.  Peeks in, says to someone we don t see: 
 
                                      ORDERLY 
                      Dr. Bishop.  Special day.  You have  
                        a visitor. 
 
  Orderly opens the door -- Olivia peers inside.  HOLD on her  
for a beat before we CUT to the reverse.  And there he is. 
 
DR. WALTER BISHOP.  Early 60 s.  Long, long beard, straw-grey 
hair.  Sitting on the floor of a padded cell, wearing a 
  charcoal jumpsuit and holding a book.  He looks up at Olivia. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Hello. 
 
And he smiles.  Warm.  You like him instantly.  And he says, 
  with remarkable patience and sweetness: 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        I knew someone would come  
                        eventually. 
 
  INT. ST. CLAIRE S CAFETERIA   DAY 
 
A big shiny, sterile, tile, empty cafeteria.  Olivia sits 
  uncertainly across from Walter, a large plastic cup of water 
  before him.  Sometimes he rocks a little, back and forth; a 
  result of almost two decades of shock, drug and  
    psychotherapy.  Walter often holds up his left hand, his  
thumb playing with his fingers -  an odd nervous habit.  When 
  he s lucid, it s tenuous, like at any moment he ll go off the 
  rails.  The only other person here is the large Orderly, who 
  stands near the door, just in case.  A long beat before: 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      And you said this was&this was  
                      when?  When did this happen? 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      The incident on the plane was four  
                      days ago.  Agent Scott was injured  
                      the next day. 
 
  Walter thinks, hard, then suddenly SNEEZES, three times fast 
and fucking loud. 
  32

        OLIVIA (CONT D)     WALTER 
Bless you--        And is the dermis-  thank you 
                                            -- the dermis already  
                                              indurated?  Translucent?  
                                            Muscular tissue visible? 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      -- on Scott--?  You mean can you  
                      see through his skin?  Yes& 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        That s-  oh, that s not good.  When  
                      you can see through skin.  Tricky.   
                        Advanced.  Like that   tricky. 
                          Tricktricktricky& 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        What s happening to him   can it be  
                        reversed? 
 
  Walter looks off for a long beat, as if something horrible is 
  occurring to him  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      &what is it? 
 
                                      WALTER 
                              (quietly) 
                      They have this&horrible pudding.   
                      Here.  This&butterscotch pudding  
                      on Mondays.  It s dreadful.  Just  
                        occurred to me. 
 
And Olivia s heart sinks: okay, he s crazy.  This may be a 
bust.  She says, deflated: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      &it s Thursday. 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        Oh&that s fantastic news. 
 
He looks at her  - and can see the judgment in her eyes. 
 
                                      WALTER (CONT D) 
                      I - I m sorry.  That I m like this  
                      now. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      -- oh - no, no don t be sorry-  
 
  33

                                      WALTER 
                        I -I m thinking things.  Some  
                        things don t even make it.  To my  
                        mouth.  Some do, though.  
                              (then)  
                      This place& their& choice of  
                        therapies& 
                              (and tears come to his  
                              Eyes) 
                      &have consequ cons con  
                        consequences. 
 
Her heart almost breaks for him -- 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      -- it s okay, really -- 
 
                                      WALTER  
                              (suddenly back on track) 
                      It can be reversed.  What s  
                        happened to your colleague.  Years  
                      ago I used lab animals.  I recall  
                      that some became afflicted -- but  
                      were still saved. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                              (suddenly: hope) 
                      --so -- do you remember what to do? 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      If your colleague has been exposed  
                      to a compound based on my work, two  
                        obvious questions arise. 
                              (long beat) 
                        Neither of which I remember. 
 
Walter picks up the cup and starts to drink.  And he doesn t 
stop -- drinks all of it, which takes a while -- spills some 
  onto his jumpsuit.  Olivia tries to maintain.  Finally: 
 
                                      WALTER (CONT D) 
                      Oh yes -- how.  Access.  How did  
                      this individual, who must have  
                        significant scientific  
                        apprehension, access and then  
                        duplicate my work?  And why?   
                      That s two questions-- one and a  
                      sub-query -- but I do have a third. 
 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Okay& which is..?  Dr. Bishop?  34

 
  He s looking deep into her eyes, as if reading her mind& 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        Before the third question& you  
                      came here today& with my son. 
 
She almost GASPS at this.  How could he know? 
 
                                      WALTER  (CONT D) 
                      I m allowed no visitors, you see.   
                      Save immediate family.  Unless that  
                      order was lifted, it s a simple  if- 
                      then  formula:  if you are here&  
                      then so is he. 
                              (beat, sotto) 
 
                                      WALTER (CONT D) 
                        I would so& very much like to see  
                      him.  So much. 
 
INT. ST. CLAIRE S LOBBY   DAY 
 
Peter stands in the lobby, staring out the window.  A desk, a 
guard.  Olivia comes out -- Peter turns to her. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      He asked for you. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Oh.  Thanks, sweetheart, I  
                        appreciate that -- 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Hey.  I didn t tell him you re  
                      here.  And call me  sweetheart  one  
                      more time, I d really like that. 
 
Peter stares, pissed -- getting it: his father just figured it 
  out.  FUCK.  The last thing he wants to do is see him.   
After a painful beat, reluctantly, Peter walks past her -- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  INT. ST. CLAIRE S CAFETERIA   DAY 
 
Peter enters the cafeteria.  Stops.  Standing across from  
  him, twenty feet away, is his father.  Peter tries to seem 
  impassive, but as he takes in the crazy-grey-bearded older   35

man before him, there s vulnerability in his eyes. 
 
  Walter stares at Peter -- who he hasn t seen since his son  
was 18.  A long beat.  Then: 
 
                                      PETER 
                        Hello. 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      & I thought you d be much fatter. 
 
                PETER       WALTER 
You thought I d be fatter. 
  Excellent.  First words,      -- no, as a boy, you were 
  perfect.      rounder -- 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Yeah, until the summer of my senior  
                      year in high school -- not that I m  
                        surprised you don t remem-- hey,  
                      what are you doing--? 
 
  Walter is MOVING CLOSE TO PETER -- who backs up -- the  
  Orderly, there the whole time -- steps forward, just in case. 
 
                WALTER     PETER 
--can I see something-- ?   --what the hell--? 
 
--and Walter takes Peter s face -- PULLS UP PETER S EYELIDS 
WITH HIS THUMBS -- checking his pupils -- Peter too stunned 
to stop him -- meanwhile behind Peter, Olivia enters, freaked 
out by what she sees -- 
 
                                      PETER (CONT D) 
                      The hell are you TOUCHING me for?! 
 
  Irritated, Peter PUSHES Walter back, who has seen what he  
need to and is satisfied: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      Your pupils are good-- they re good- 
                        - thank goodness. 
                              (then, to Olivia,  
                              immediately) 
                      --the third question is how  
                        advanced is your colleague s  
                        affliction? Something I m not -  36

                        notnot-  unable to deduce in the  
                        absence of first-hand examination  
                      which is to say I must  
                        tergiversate. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        --you-- what? 
 
                                      PETER 
                        --leave-- it s a fancy word for  
                         leave -- 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      --I must see Mr. Scott myself    
                      which I am unable to do under  
                        present law unless signed out by a  
                      legal guardian, which can only  
                      be& 
                              (looks to Peter) 
                      &once again& a relative. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Wait a minute -- what are you  
                        asking me to--?  No. 
                              (to Olivia) 
                        Guardian? No -- forget it. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                              (pissed, to Walter) 
                      He ll do it. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      I will not do it! 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      One phone call, that s all it takes- 
                      - you want me to make it?!  Cause  
                      I ve got a phone in my pocket. 
 
  A fucking staring contest -- she whips out her phone -- a 
threat upon a threat: 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      Now it s OUT of my pocket. 
 
Peter wants to kill her.  He walks off, furiously stopping 
right beside her, saying at an almost-whisper: 
 
                                      PETER 
                      You wanted my father, you got my  
                        father.  This falls into the be   37

                        careful what you wish for category.  
                        Sweetheart. 
 
He walks past her.  Olivia is left there, looking up at  
  Walter.  Bracing herself for whatever s to come. 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        I don t really understand what just  
                      happened. 
 
And off her look, MUSIC STARTS as we show: 
 
OLIVIA 
 
In a St. Claire s office, watching over Peter, who reluctantly 
SIGNS DOCUMENTS of LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP. 
 
WALTER 
 
In a bathroom, the Orderly watching as Walter CUTS HIS BEARD 
with a scissors at the mirror, then uses an electric razor to 
shave. 
 
OLIVIA AND PETER 
 
As they wait in the lobby -- not sitting together -- and WALTER 
steps out, clean  shave, in a too-starched white shirt and 
  khakis.  While looking a little awkward, it s a sudden 
  transformation.  He looks shockingly GOOD.  Walter smiles. 
 
WALTER 
 
As he walks down the steps of the building, toward Olivia s car 
-- first walking around it, looking at its contours, its 
    aerodynamics.  As this happens, the DIRECTOR of the hospital 
comes out -- 68 years-old DR.BRUCE SUMNER. 
 
                                    DR. SUMNER 
                      Excuse me, Miss Warren. 
 
Olivia turns -- faces the doctor, who doesn t extend his hand  
-- but moves close and speaks quietly and directly.  Piercing 
eyes and a lack of humor: 
 
                              DR. SUMNER (CONT D) 
                      I m Dr. Sumner, Director and  
                        Psychiatrist in Chief of St.  
                        Claire s -- I understand you have  
                      the intention to take Dr. Bishop  
                        off-premises. 
 
                                      OLIVIA  38

                      Yes, it s actually a national  
                        security issue-- I m with the-- 
 
                                    DR. SUMNER 
                        I know who you re with, I ve seen  
                      the release documents -- you might  
                      want to go back inside and read my  
                        resume-- my clinical history--  
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      --why would I want to g-- ? 
 
                                    DR. SUMNER 
                      So that when I warn you what a  
                        colossal mistake it is to pull this  
                        patient out of this facility you ll  
                        respect it, you ll appreciate it,  
                      and you ll abide by it. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Dr. Sumner, I can assure you that  
                      he will be in custody, observed, at  
                      all times-- 
 
                                      DR. SUMNER 
                        I assume you know who he is.  The  
                      work he once did.  Your need of him  
                      must stem from that. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      It does.  And yes, I ve read about 
                       Bishop in great detail-- what  
                        exactly is the problem here?  What  
                      are you afraid of? 
 
Dr. Sumner stares at her -- and what we sense really creeps us 
  out:  that he s choosing his words very carefully, that he 
isn t telling her all her knows.. 
 
                                      DR. SUMNER 
                        I will simply caution you.  To be  
                        careful with him.  More careful  
                      than you think necessary 
 
And Dr. Sumner heads back into the hospital.  Olivia watches 
him go, concerned.  Then behind her, Peter, who is like a 
  babysitter watching his father, who still stares at odd angles 
at the car: 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Can we hit the road, please?  39

 
                                      WALTER 
                      This car is spectacular. 
 
                              OLIVIA 
                        Thanks. 
 
And MOMENTS LATER Olivia s car drives away, Peter in the 
  passenger seat and Walter in the back.  And at his office 
  window, Dr. Sumner watches with hard eyes. 
 
  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE   DAY 
 
  Olivia s car SPEEDS PAST CAMERA -- we HEAR A RADIO REPORT: 
 
                                      ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
                        & President s press conference,  
                      where he assured the public that  
                        progress was being made-- 
 
  INT. OLIVIA S CAR   DAY 
 
  Olivia drives.  Peter besides her.  Walter in the back.  He 
looks out at everything, rather wide-eyed.  Childlike. 
 
                                      ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
                      -- in the investigation into Flight 627.

                      Every effort is being made to  
                        understand what happened on that  
                        flight, and who was responsible.   
                      And the President has made it  
                        clear: our response will be swift  
                      and certain-- 
 
  Olivia turns off the radio.  Looks back at Walter. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Dr. Bishop, I was curious&if  
                        anyone else ever had access to your  
                      work? 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        Well&the assistants, they had  
                      bits and pieces.  God, I suppose.   
                      If you go for that.  
                              (beat)   
                        I suppose the only one who really  
                      knew what I was doing was Belly.

                                      OLIVIA 
                        --who? 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        Belly.  William Bell.  He and I  
                        shared the lab. 
 
                OLIVIA      PETER 
  William Bell?      You shared a lab with the  
                                                    founder or Prmetheus? 
 
                                      WALTER (CONT D) 
                        Uh..I - I don t know what that  
                      is.  Prometheus. 
 
                                      PETER 
                              (holy shit) 
                      Oh nothing, just a little tiny  
                        company.  
                              (then, quiet, to Olivia) 
                      One guy becomes one of the richest  
                      men in the world, the other becomes an  
                          institutionalized psychopath. 
 
                                      WALTER 
                        Sometimes-  I don t know if I  
                        mentioned this, but sometimes I  
                      hear someone whistling.  Row, Row,  
                      Row Your Boat, late at night, down  
                      the hall.  Way down, near the  
                        windows.  And I can never be quite  
                        sure&that it isn t me.  You ever  
                      have that? 
 
                                      PETER 
                              (with faux pride) 
                        That s my ward.  My pop. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Hey. 
 
                                      PETER 
                      Just pointing it out. 
 
                                      WALTER 
                              (loud) 
                      OH! 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                -- what - what happened? 
 
  41

                                      WALTER 
                      --oh, I just pissed myself - 
 
                PETER       OLIVIA 
  Excellent.  Good going.      --oh!  Um - do you want me 
                                                  to pull over? 
 
                                      WALTER(CONT D) 
                      No!  No, that s okay!  It was just  
                        a squirt.  I m okay.  It ll dry.   
                      We re good. 
 
  EXT. ROAD   DAY 
 
  Olivia s car comes toward us  - growing  - and passes -  we  
  WHIP PAN to follow it and as it drives off we PUSH IN on the 
  BILLBOARD on the side of the road.  A happy girl, sunlit, on  
  a swing.  The PROMETHEUS LOG and the tagline:  What do we do?  
  What don t we do?  and our EERIE MUSIC BUILDS,  
  portending what s in store& 
 
                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

  FADE IN: 
 
  EXT. MILITARY MEDICAL CENTER   DAY 
 
The MUSIC CONTINUES as Olivia s car arrives  - 
 
  INT. MILITARY MEDICAL CENTER   DAY 
 
Our unlikely trio enters the hospital: Walter takes in the 
  walls, the staff, pens on the counter, EXIT signs, a candy 
  machine, families, soldiers   every detail surprising and  
  new.  Peter annoyed at the whole thing -  Olivia greeted by a 
  DOCTOR who leads them to the QUARANTINE AREA, to& 
 
  INT. JOHN S ROOM   QUARANTINE   DAY 
 
MUSIC STOPS when we see JOHN, under the clear plastic tent.  
Shit, it s getting worse.  His skin s grown even more 
  transparent   now his VEINS, FASCIA and MUSCLES are fading so 
  that we can see through his INTERNAL ORGANS. 
 
  OLIVIA silently GASPS, her heart sinking.  Peter isn t having 
an easy time either; what he sees disturbs him. 
 
     PETER 
     &wow. 
 
He looks to Olivia, who stares down at the man she loves in 
  contained agony.  Peter reads her, for the firs time really 
  feeling for her.  Olivia looks to Walter, desperately hoping he 
has a miracle offer. 
 
But Walter stares at the fucking light fixture overhead, head 
  cocked to one side curiously, analytically.  His eyes flutter a 
  little at the harsh fluorescent bulb. 
 
     OLIVIA 
   Dr. Bishop? 
 
  Snapped out of it, Walter grabs John s chart, flips through  
it -  takes it in surprisingly fast   then, his left fingers 
and thumb playing as they do: 
 
     WALTER 
      Is there ginger ale?  Any ginger  
      ale?  I haven t had some.  In a  
      long time.  Miss it. 
  43

Peter shakes his head: this is nuts.  Bewildered, Olivia  
takes a beat.  Then, to a female Fed ASSISTANT (ASTRID, 24, 
  pretty): 
 
     OLIVIA 
      Uh, can we get some&ginger ale  
      for the doctor?  Please? 
 
     ASTIRD 
   --sure  
 
And Astrid heads out.  Walter turns back to John, moves  
  closer to the plastic tent.  Looks around.  Sees MEDICAL 
  EQUIPMENT on a table, including a SCALPEL.  He pulls on a  
  pair of rubber glove, takes the scalpel in hand -  and Peter  
is on him like a shot, grabbing his arm: 
 
  PETER       WALTER 
Hey - wait a second--     I need a tissue sample  
          you re squeezing very  
         tightly, Peter. 
But Peter won t let go, his grip locked on his father-  
 
  PETER 
    (to Olivia) 
      --does this not concern you? 
 
And while this is hardly an easy decision, she makes it: 
 
     OLIVIA 
    Let him go. 
 
  Dubious, Peter lets go.  Walter goes to work, opening the  
inner tent, angling the knife downward and we go ULTRA CLOSE  
on the skn of John s ARM   THE MIRROR BLADE CUTTING THE  
FIRST THREE LAYERS OF SKIN   MOVIN GON TO THE TRANSLUCENT  
AREA -  AND IT BECOMES LIKE WAX PAPER, THEN PLASTIC, THEN  
GLASS  - unable to cut anymore.  Unfazed, Walter works with a 
  surgeon s precision, slicing the small tissue sample: 
 
  WALTER 
    (glancing at Peter) 
   Petrie dish. 
 
     PETER 
      Hey, I m not your lab assistant. 
 
  WALTER 
   Quick-  please - 
 
 
  44

  Annoyed, Peter glances at a column of PETRIE DISHES among the 
  room s equipment, takes one and hands it to Walter.  Despite 
  everything, they re working together -  for the first time.  
  Walter slips the skin sample into the dish, seals it  - 
 
  WALTER (CONT D) 
      Good-  I ll need to take this to my  
   lab right away. 
 
  OLIVIA 
   &your what? 
 
  WALTER 
      Kresge Building basement   Harvard. 
      We should leave.  I have my sample,  
   let s split. 
 
  Olivia looks to Peter, whose look says:  told ya he was  
  fucking bonkers, good luck.   So, tactfully: 
      
     OLIVIA 
      Dr. Bishop, you realize your lab  
      was shut down after you left. 
 
  WALTER 
      -- it was what?  I m sorry--? 
 
Then, almost cruel, how blunt Peter is: 
 
  PETER 
   Pop, it s gone.  You got that?   
   Wake up.  It s been gone  - just  
   like you   for seventeen years.   
   You have no lab. 
 
And we see Walter s face go read -  almost like a temper 
  tantrum, but in a grown, older man, it s downright scary.   
 
                                      WALTER 
      -- no nononon-  the foundations is  
      a golden rectangle!  I can t be  
      expected to make real progress if I  
      don t understand the proportions of  
   my space!  The work itself won t be  
   consistent - 
 
  OLIVIA 
      -- I - what s a golden rectan--? 
 
   
 
  45

  WALTER 
    (angry, losing it) 
   WHAT S THE GOLDEN RECTANGLE?!  THE  
   PERFECT RECTANGLE! 
 
    -- and Walter has TURNED OVER A MEDICAL TRAY, which CRASHES  
    to the floor.  Walter turns away from them, pissed -  and he 
    PUNCHES the wall, hard  - Olivia JUMPS -  is visibly shaken 
    that, perhaps, Walter is too damn insane to handle.  Peter 
    leans in to her: 
 
  PETER 
      Let s take him back, right now.   
      I ve had just about enough. 
 
Then, past Peter, Olivia sees Charlie arrive quickly in the 
  hallway, through the window. 
 
  OLIVIA 
   Excuse me. 
 
INT. CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
Olivia and Charlie meet in the corridor  - urgent  - 
 
  CHARLIE 
      Got your message-  how s John? 
 
     OLIVIA 
   Bad - worse. 
 
  CHARLIE 
   What about Bishop? 
 
  OLIVIA 
      From left to right: insane and  
      irritating.  And also my only hope - 
                        listen, I need to question William  
                      Bell, could you set that up? 
 
  CHARLIE 
   &William Bell?  Prometheus  
   William Bell? 
 
  OLIVIA 
      He and Bishop used to share a lab - 
      hey, anything from the CDC? 
 
 
 
 
  46

  CHARLIE 
      Zero: their breakthrough is that  
      the Hamburg flight was caused by a  
      synthetic compound.  Which is like  
      saying rain is caused by a wet  
      compound.  They ve run tests on  
      Scott, but haven t come back with  
      anything. Which leads me to this. 
 
He holds out a FILE  - Olivia takes it  - curious  - 
 
  CHARLIE (CONT D) 
      Thought you might wanna see that. 
 
And we PUSH IN on Olivia as she sees this -  eyes widening -  
 
INT. BROYLES  OFFICE   DAY 
 
Only it isn t really Broyle s office -  it s John s.  Door 
opens  - we PUSH IN behind Olivia, who enters, quiet but 
  enraged, closing the door hard behind her.  He s surprised to 
see her back  
 
  BROYLES 
   --Liaison, when d you g--? 
 
  OLIVIA 
      --I need to talk to you. 
 
  BROYLES 
      Yeah, listen, forgive my  
      Insensitivity  - I saw the name on  
      the door.  But I m only here for  
      the duration of this investigation  
      and I don t think Agent Scott is  
      going to be needing his office any  
   time soon. 
 
Olivia resists strangling Broyles.  Stays quiet and fierce: 
 
  OLIVIA 
      What I wanted to talk to you  
      about&is that there s a mole in  
   this department. 
 
And Broyles stops.  Whatever bravado he just had is gone.  His 
eyes fucking lock onto her like he suddenly wants her dead.  A 
long enough beat before: 
 
  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
      -- are you not gonna ask me h  
  47

  BROYLES 
   I KNOW THERE IS.  The question is  
   how YOU know there is. 
 
  OLIVIA 
      Is that why you re really here?   
   Baby-sitting us--? 
 
  BROYLES 
   Start talking right now. 
 
She stares at him   and gets the chills.  Could it fucking  
be HIM?  What do to?  Finally: 
 
  OLIVIA 
      We recovered phone records from a  
      cell phone found at the storage  
   facility. 
 
  OLIVIA 
      There was a call made immediately  
      after the Hamburg flight landed - a  
      call that was routed through this  
   building. 
 
  BROYLES      OLIVIA 
--Who else had access to  
those records?        --Agent Francis and myself- 
  --Anyone else?        --no, no one else-- 
--Did Agent Francis share       --no, he told me only 
he and 
those records with anyone?     I knew about this. 
 
  A beat.  She s getting freaked out here& 
 
  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
      &what the hell s going on? 
 
  BROYLES 
    (beat) 
      The integrity of this office is  
   being handled. 
 
  OLIVIA 
      &what do you know about th  
 
  BROYLES 
      It is neither your job nor your  
      responsibility to get involved  - 
      so I appreciate your bringing the  
      matter to my attention just as I  
      expect you to appreciate the fact   48

      that you work under me. 
    (beat) 
      You re prohibited from discussing  
      this with anyone inside or out of  
      this office, is that understood? 
 
She just stares.  Wants to fucking accuse him right there  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Yessir. 
 
                                BROYLES 
                      I do my job.  You do yours. 
 
                                OLIVIA 
                              (fuuuuuuck you!) 
                      Then it should be noted: I ve  
                        successfully had Dr. Walter Bishop  
                        released from St. Claire s.  And he  
                        requires his old laboratory back. 
 
                                BROYLES 
                      &I m sorry, what? 
 
                OLIVIA       BROYLES 
  Kresge Building at Harvard.     Yeah, congratulations, I m 
  Basement.        Sure the University d be 
     thrilled to welcome back  
                                                    their only tenured

                                      OLIVIA 
                      I m just trying to do my job, Sir,  
                      and that means helping Dr. Bishop  
                      do his.  I believe he will help  
                      bring some answers to these  
                        investigations, which might help  
                      your next report to the National  
                        Security Advisor.  I read the one  
                      you just submitted.  Found it  
                      rather thin. 
 
  Broyles studies her at beat. 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      It would be nice to think that your  
                        tenacity in this case is a by- 
                        product of remarkable and robust 
                          professionalism.  But I can t help  
                      but wonder&if there wasn t   49

                        something going on between you and  
                      Agent Scott. 
 
  Olivia puts up her best poker face, which is pretty fucking 
  good-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      You want answers?  Get the lab for  
                        Bishop. 
 
And she gets up and leaves the office --- OFF BROYLES  
  AMBIGUOUS LOOK -- ally or adversary&?  MUSIC BUILDS UNTIL: 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
    FOOM-FOOM-FOOM -- overheard fluorescents BLINK TO LIFE -- one 
of them FLASH-BURNS OUT.  BOOM DOWN TO REVEAL OUR LAB SPACE, 
  perhaps the real fourth character in our series: build in  
1856, this building -- and the basement in particular -- have 
an amazing sense of significance.  Bricks and columns and  
thick wooden beams -- dust motes dance through sunlight 
  streaming in from high, curved windows at the ceiling (and 
which are ground-level with the campus quad).  A massive 
  FURNACE sits in the corner.  White sheets cover large pieces of 
  storage, cardboard boxes, thick with dust, everywhere.   
  It s quite a space. 
 
At the light switch: WALTER.  Regarding the room with haunted 
eyes.  Rather an awe, he speaks quietly, mostly to himself: 
 
                                      WALTER 
                      &so much& so much happened  
                      here& 
 
And then he turns back to Olivia, and says, with wild, almost 
scary eyes: 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      &and so much is about to. 
 
And on Olivia s anxious face, with Peter resentfully standing 
  behind her, MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO BLACK. 
 
                                    END ACT FOUR

                                        ACT FIVE 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  RESUME SAME MOMENT: Walter, still at the top of the stairs  
  when we find him, braves a walk deeper in&down six steps, 
  passing the old equipment, memories flooding& 
 
And Olivia and Peter, at the door, watch Walter. Astrid (the 
Fed Assistant, remember?) nearby.  For Peter, increasing 
  discomfort: he doesn t like finding reasons to sympathize  
  with this man.  He says to Olivia quietly, mocking Walter: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Wow, here we are.  In the Golden  
                        Rectangle itself.  I m pumped. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      What makes a rectangle&golden? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      It s got a length-to-width ratio  
                      equal to a number called  phi.    
                        Greeks discovered it -- turns up in  
                      math, Renaissance art, music    
                      Dali used it in The Sacrament of  
                      the Last Supper -- Debussy s  
                        Reflections In Water -- nature too:   
                        seashells, branches on plant stems. 
 
He says that so off-handedly, it underscores his casual genius; 
she s sort of quietly stunned by it.  After a beat, she turns 
to the senior Bishop: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Dr. Bishop, I ordered a standard  
                        forensics work package, as you  
                        asked.  Is there anything else you  
                      need? 
 
  Walter touches on of the water-damaged walls. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        There s an unexpected level of  
                        corrosion in the insulating  
                        sheathing.  Drainage planes    
                      vapor barriers -- 
 
                                          PETER 
                      You know, pop, some people just say walls.  51

 
                                          WALTER 
                              (answering her question) 
                      An optical coherence tomography for  
                      flesh study, please.  Two thousand  
                        pounds of silicon-- 
 
  Olivia nods at Astrid, who starts writing this all down. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      --at least five anonymous blood  
                        samples from voluntary donors,  
                        please.  A micro-organism detector,  
                      -- NASA grade, obviously -- there s  
                      still NASA, yes? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Yes. 
 
  Walter pulls a white sheet off a large SALINE ISOLATION TANK.  
He SLAPS it with his hand: KLANG!!! 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      She s still here!  This tank  
                      was the best!  Oh--and a five-year-old  
                        Ankole-Watusi. 
 
                                          ASTRID 
                      -- a what? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      (I m on Mars) 
                      It s a cow.  He wants a cow. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Pure-bred, not cross-bred, this is  
                        important -- with a mature weight  
                      of 1100 pounds and internal fat  
                        average of 2.37. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      -- are you-- is he joking? 
 
                                          PETER 
                        Genetically, cows and humans are 
                        distinguishable by only a few lines  
                      of DNA.  Ethical tests subject. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Where d you learn all this?  MIT? 
  52

Of course, he knows she s fucking with him -- that he faked a 
  degree from that particular institution. 
 
  Bleary, she writes something down as a CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE 
is held out in front of her.  It s Peter, who doesn t look 
  happy, which can sometimes be his way.  She takes the cup. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Thanks. 
 
He sits beside her as she sips the coffee, going back to 
  scanning.  A beat of awkward silence: we sense there s 
  something he wants to ask her.  Finally: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      So what else did my file say.   
                      About yours truly.  How ugly was  
                      it? 
 
She stops.  Looks at him. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m not at liberty to talk about-- 
 
                                          PETER 
                      -- well liberate yourself, because  
                      I came back here, I think I deserve  
                      the truth-- what did the file say? 
 
  They just stare at each other -- and as they do, he fucking 
  sees something in her eyes.  Holy shit& 
 
                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                        &there was no file, was there. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                                (beat) 
                        I needed you back here. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Wait a minute: you were bluffing? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I was desperate. 
 
                                          PETER

                        I could see you were in trouble.   
                        Anyone could see that.  53

 
                                          PETER 
                      So hell, I could ve stayed. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      A car bomb went off this morning in  
                        Kirkuk.  Don t know if you saw  
                      that.  Just about where and when  
                      you were suppose to be working.   
                      We ll never know, but you might  
                      just owe me a thank you. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Well.  I owe a lot. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Yeah, I figured.  How much? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      What I was gonna make in Iraq  
                        would ve covered just about half. 
                               (then) 
                        I feel safer there than I do here. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Mafia? 
 
Peter stares.  Despite the gravity, it s almost funny: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      The guy literally goes by the name  
                      Big Eddie.  I swear to God, I m not  
                        making that up. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      You owe money to a guy nicknamed  
                      Big Eddie? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Nope.  He had his name legally  
                        changed to Big Eddie. 
                              (then) 
                      I was never a gambler.  Never.  But  
                        a couple of years ago?  Just&

                      In  72, during Vietnam, the DOD s  
                        biochem division had us working  
                      on a leprotic contagion for possible use

INT. LAB   NIGHT   LATER 
 
Walter paces, his mind spinning in overdrive -- explains his 
test results to an anxious Olivia and still skeptical Peter: 
 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Trick was it s short shelf life    
                      it self-immolated after peaking at  
                      its most toxic level. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Meaning it leaves no trace it was ever there? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      The idea was to prevent collateral  
                      damage outside of enemy targets.   
                      It s impossible that whatever  
                        affected that plane was derived  
                      from our work -- I ll have to do  
                      more analysis before I can  
                      establish definitive causality. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      What about John? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      What s infecting him isn t a virus,  
                      or for that matter, any other kind  
                      of organism-- it s merely a  
                        chemical reaction.  Which means we  
                      can synthesize a counter-agent. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      So you can help him? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Hey-- wait a minute-- don t give  
                      her false hope, that s-- 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      -- not false, there s no false,  
                      it s real.  I could help, yes, if I  
                      had a precise inventory of what was  
                      in that storage facility when it  
                        detonated, then I can measure the   55

                        quantities of-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      We don t have that.  It all went up 
                      -- everything.  And the suspect    
                      who may have those answers -- got  
                      away.  And John s the only one who  
                      saw his face. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                              (beat) 
                      How long does he have left? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      &at the current rate of 
                          crystallization, cellular  
                        degradation, the slowing of his  
                        natural hematop-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (she SNAPS) 
                      HOW LONG. 
 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      24 hours.  His brain will no longer 
                      be able to oxygenate itself. 
 
  That lands on her, CRUSHING her.  Walter, despite the impassive 
  outward appearance, does his best to console& 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                        I m&I m so sorry.  That I can t  
                      offer you a solution that doesn t  
                      risk your life. 
 
  Olivia nods, stares off.  Then as if just hearing that: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &what do you mean? 
 
                                          WALTER

                      -- no. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Oh: the shared dream state.   
                        Synaptic transfer system - were you  
                      not listening?

                                          PETER 
                        Whatever you think you said, you  
                        didn t say. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      What d you mean shared dreams state? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      The human brain generates a  
                        quantifiable, measurable electric 
                        field. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                        I posited, in 1976, bicentennial  
                      year, that it s possible to  
                        synchronize fields from two  
                        distinct minds, and allow the  
                        sharing of information across an  
                        unconscious state.  Like a string  
                        between two tin cans. 
 
                                          PETER 
                              (to Olivia) 
                      And what s great about that is that  
                      it s insane. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        There s precedence for this: the  
                        Egyptian papyrus of Deral-Madineh,  
                        darting back to 2000BC, holds  
                        stories of pharaohs using dreams to  
                        communicate with each other. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      And did you guys see Goonies?  That  
                      was also good. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      You re saying I could talk to John.   
                      While he s in a coma-- he might be  
                      able to tell me what the suspect  
                      looks like? 
 
                WALTER       PETER 
Oh-- more than that: you 
  could-- 
        (to Peter) 
-- this isn t an exact          (sarcastic seriousness) 
  science--         Of Course, no of course not  
(back to Olivia) 
-- have access to his 
  memories themselves.    57

  Assuming there s no extensive  
brain damage.  Of course,  
you d have to be severely  
  drugged, have an  
  electromagnetic probe  
  inserted at the base of your  
skull and float without  
  clothes in the old tank. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      Have you done this before?

                        technique to extract information  
                      from a corpse.  You can do that, as  
                      long as they re not dead longer  
                      than six hours.

                      Yeah, after six hours, they re  
                        really dead.

                      I d need your help to synthesize

                      No, that would be fun.

                        institution wants to give you an  
                        overdose, stick a metal rod in your

                                          PETER 
                      What the hell would make you even 
                        consider doing something so stupid? 
 
A beat -- the she looks straight at Peter.

                                          OLIVIA 
                        Knowing John would do it for me. 
                              (to Walter) 
                      Set it up.  I ll get DHS  
                        authorization to move John. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Excellent. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      No!  I m not helping-- I m out. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Refuse to cooperate and I ll cite you for 
                        obstruction of justice. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      For refusing to cook LSD for a  
                        Federal Agent?!  Somehow I don t  
                      think that one s gonna stick. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (holds up her cell) 
                      Let s call Fat Eddie.  Huh? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Big Eddie.  And I told you that in  
                        confidence 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      And let s keep it between us, okay? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      This is insane.  And so is he.  And  
                      so are you. 
 
Peter turns and walks away -- as Charlie enters behind him -- 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                        Warren, you got a minute? 
                              (she moves to him) 
                      You re on the next puddle-jumper to  
                      New York -- heard back from Bell s  
                      Office -- he s out of the country.   
                      But Nina Cord, his CEP, said she s  
                      happy to talk to you. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Happy?  Really?

                                        CHARLIE 
                        There s a cow.  What s going on  
                      here? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      We re about to make LSD. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Don t listen to him. 
 
As she turns Charlie away, she shoots Walter a  shhh!  look as 
the cow MOOS. 
 
CUT TO BLACK.

  FADE IN: 
 
  EXT. PROMETHEUS CORP.   NEW YORK CITY   DAY 
 
  A TAXI pulls up to a glass and steel world headquarters 
  building, past 3D LETTERS WHICH READ,  NEW YORK CITY .   
  Olivia gets out of the cab, passes the company logo etched 
  massively in granite. 
 
  INT. HOSPITAL   QUARANTINE AREA   DAY 
 
The HERMETICALLY-SEALED HATCH closes on a CRYP-TRANSPORT TUBE, 
  through a small portal window we see JOHN S FACE -- the 
  translucent flesh, muscles and veins pronounced -- he s  
  almost looking like a fucking VISIBLE MAN MODEL KIT -- the 
frost on the glass making it even eerier to see.  MED-TECHS 
wheel the tube down a corridor, like a gurney&toward a  
  waiting MEDICAL TRANSPORT VEHICLE. 
 
  INT. PROMETHEUS CORP.   CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
We TRACK WITH OLIVIA as she heads down the hall -- passing 
  FRAMED PROMETHEUS CORPORATION IMAGES on the wall.   
  Appliances, Aviation, Electrical Distribution, Finance, 
  Healthcare, Lighting, Oil and Gas, Security, Water -- this 
  company does FUCKING EVERYTHING. 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
As the Med-Techs roll John in the cryo-tube into the lab,  
Peter helping with placement -- 
 
                                          PETER 
                        I guess over here -- Uh -- Walter,  
                      this okay? 
 
Peter looks over to Walter, who mixes solutions, burns 
  chemicals on a Bunsen, prepping the LSD. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Yesyes, good.  And son. You can 
                      call me Mom. 
 
  Walter goes back to work.  Peter shakes his head.  Astrid, 
  meanwhile fills the massive isolation tank with water from a 
hose.  She also pours in a box of EPSOM SALTS. 
 
  62

                                          ASTRID 
                      The whole box, Doctor, you re sure? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Yes, dear, I m sure. 
 
Peter thanks the Med-Techs, who leaves -- Peter moves back to 
  Walter s side -- Walter give him more chemicals to burn -- 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                        I feel normal.  Working. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Yeah, bootlegging smack in the  
                        basement really is the picture of  
                        normalcy. 
 
As he keeps mixing a chemical in a test tube, Walter leans 
  closer, analyzing his son s face -- it s unnerving: 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      I d like to check your blood  
                        pressure. 
 
                                          PETER 
                              (edgy) 
                      My blood pressure s fine, check  
                      your own blood pressure. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Your flesh tone suggests you re  
                        suffering from arterial  
                        hypertension. 
 
He reaches out to touch Peter, who kind of snaps away,  
  kneejerk defensive: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Hey: don t tell me what I m  
                        suffering from   and there are no  
                        visible symptoms of hypertension -- 
 
  Walter has been pouring chemicals -- which suddenly IGNITE    
  a large FIRE ERUPTS -- Astrid blurts a scream -- Walter s LAB 
  COAT IS ON FIRE -  Peter quickly grabs Astrid s HOSE and DOUSES 
  Walter s chest, putting the fire out. 
 
  Walter falls to the floor -- heart pounding, afraid -- 
  breathing heavily -- and Peter is suddenly forced to comfort 
the man: 
 
  63

                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                      -- hey -- pop-- it s okay.  Listen,  
                      you re fine, it was nothing-- 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      --that was careless-- bad form-- 
 
62 
 
                                          PETER 
                      --and I put it out and you re  
                      okay. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      -- I wasn t - I didn t see-- 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Hey: it s okay.  I m here. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      That could ve - been worse-- I m so  
                      sorry -- so sorry -- so sorry -- so  
                      sorry& 
 
And in this odd, heartbreaking moment, Peter is reminded just 
how damaged -- how vulnerable and prepared for the world    
his father truly is.  And he couldn t be less comfortable  
about it. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      It s ok -- it s okay, pop.  You re  
                      okay. 
 
INT. NINA CORD S OFFICE   DAY 
 
An ASSISTANT shows Olivia into the impressive cold office: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Thank you for seeing me. 
 
-- and she s greeted by 66 year-old NINA CORD.  Elegant, 
    sophisticated, brilliant and about as warm as a milk shake in 
an igloo.  They shake hands. 
 
                                          NINA 
                      Not at all.  Dr. Bell is back from  
                      Reykjavik next week-- perhaps I can  
                      help you in the meantime? 
 
They sit before floor-to-ceiling views of the City.

                                          OLIVIA 
                      We ve been looking at the work of  
                      Dr. Walter Bishop.  A researcher  
                      who was at Harvard at the t-- 
 
                                          NINA 
                      Yes, I know of Bishop.  A  
                        contemporary of Dr. Bell s. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      It seems that certain recent events 
                      -- unexplained phenomena, including  
                      what happened aboard Flight 627    
                      might be traced back to his work. 
 
                                          NINA 
                      Dr. Bishop s. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        That s right.  When asked if anyone  
                      else has access to his studies, Dr.  
                        Bishop mentioned the founder of  
                      this company. 
 
                                          NINA 
                        I know they shared a lab space in  
                      the 70 s. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Until 1983, actually.  We re  
                        wondering if Prometheus might be  
                        researching some of these  
                        technologies. 
 
She holds out a file -- Nina takes it.  Starts reading.   
Poker face. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      And if so, we were hoping you might  
                        cooperate with us.  Identify  
                        employees who have access. 
 
                                          NINA 
                        You re suggesting William Bell  
                      stole intellectual property from  
                        Bishop? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m suggesting that, since they had  
                        a common workspace, the focus of  
                      their research might have been  
                        analogous.  Mutually-influenced.    65

 
After a beat of reading, Nina closes the file, hands it back. 
 
                                          NINA 
                        Unfortunately, I m not at liberty to  
                        discuss our companies, their  
                        research or employees.  The  
                        security of our proprietary  
                        information is a very real concern  
                      to us. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Certainly.  As I m sure is national  
                        security.  Can you tell me if any  
                        employees have in the recent past  
                      been dismissed because of suspicion 
                      of espionage of any kind? 
 
                                          NINA 
                        Unfortunately I m not at liberty to  
                        discuss our companies, their  
                        research or our employees. 
 
  Uh&no, Olivia doesn t like her. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      How long have you worked at

                                          NINA 
                      I owe Prometheus my life.  And  
                        that s no exaggeration.   
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &how so? 
 
                                          NINA 
                      I was a runner, for most of my  
                      life.  Always had been. During the  
                       97 Boston Marathon, I felt  
                        strangely tired.  Had a pain in my  
                      upper back that I d never had.  I  
                        assumed it was just another  
                        pleasure of advancing age -- until  
                      one morning at the office -- our   66

                        building at the time was in  
                        Charlestown -- Dr. Bell saw that I  
                      was in discomfort and insisted I go  
                      for a CAT scan.  Which revealed  
                      stage three cancer, two metastases. 
                              (beat) 
                      The cancer had spread so severely  
                      that I had to have my right arm  
                        amputated what week.  
 
  Olivia s confused eyes dart in Nina s right arm -- and hand, 
which she just shook. 
 
  Nina sees this -- reaches into her jacket sleeve and pulls  
out the thin, flesh-colored SILICONE SKIN that covers  
  something remarkable: A COMPLETELY ROBOTIC HUMAN ARM AND  
HAND.  It s skin is translucent; the mechanics clearly visible 
  inside; little GYROS turning, it s sort of the most amazing 
thing you ve ever seen. 
 
                                    NINA (CONT D) 
                      That first scanner that found my  
                        cancer was built by this company.   
                      The robotic-assist tools used in my  
                        surgery and the drugs I took  
                        afterward were developed and  
                        manufactured by Prometheus.  And my  
                        replacement limb& 
 
  Nina lifts both her real and fake translucent hand and wiggles 
all fingers.  It s uncanny. 
 
                                    NINA (CONT D) 
                      &was designed by Bell himself.  
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                                (astonished) 
                        I shook your hand, I couldn t tell. 
 
                                          NINA 
                        Prometheus is a more remarkable  
                      place than you know.   
                        Unfortunately, given our non- 
                        disclosure policy&I m not  
                        allowed to explain why. 
 
  Olivia looks at Nina -- her pro smile -- and just doesn t 
  fucking trust her.  Then her phone rings -- she answers it: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Agent Warren.

  INTERCUT WITH: 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  Walter in the background, Peter, sardonic, is on the phone: 
 
                                          PETER 
                        Honey, your drugs are ready. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      On my way. 
 
She hangs up.  Looks at Nina. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      Thanks again for your time. 
 
Nina extends her robotically-exposed hand.  Olivia shakes it.  
A FIRM SHAKE.  Their eyes meet.  Oddly steely. 
 
INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS as we barely see the muscle-and-veins  
John through the frosted plastic of he cryo-tent needless 
to say, looking worse than ever.  THERE ARE NOW SENSORS  
  ATTACHED ALL OVER HIS FACE AND BODY -- AND A THICK CABLE 
  RUNNING FROM SOMEWHERE AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK. 
 
  Astride sits on a table, eating from a back of chips.  Like 
  it s a show -- and what she sees is Walter, preparing various 
  SYRINGES -- each with a different color drug.  Peter re-
  calibrates two HIGH VOLTAGE PULSE GENERATORS, BIORHYTHM 
  SENSORS, HEART and VIDEO MONITORS.  Unlike the digital, 
  wireless age outside these walls, in here wires snake 
  everywhere, Peter glances at Olivia disapprovingly as she 
  enters, wearing a robe and looking pensive.  Walter moves to 
  Olivia, holding a tangle of SENSORS on wires. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      This may be a silly question.  In  
                      fact, I may have already asked you.   
                      But you re aware of how serious  
                      this is.  The real risks involved. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &yes, I understand.  And yeah,  
                      we had that conversation. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I need to place  
                        these. 
  68

Still sitting, Olivia opens her robe.  She wears a bikini,  
red floral patter.  Some bruises from the storage units 
  accident.  While Walter is all-business, Olivia catches Peter 
  sneaking a look.  Self-consciously: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        I bought it for the Caribbean.  We  
                      never went, though.  So& 
 
Peter forces a smile -- an odd, intimate moment that sort of 
  embarrasses them both.  Walter places the sensors on her chest, 
her stomach, her legs.  Then takes a SYRINGE and moves behind 
  her: 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Tilt your head forward please -- 
 
  Olivia s neck touches her chest.  Walter finds a place at the 
  nape of her neck -- tests it with his fingers -- spreads the 
  skin-- 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      I m giving you some anesthetic. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --okay-- 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --this is asinine. 
 
He INJECTS her twice in the area, which stings a little.  
  
  Then Walter picks up the PROBE he d mentioned -- which is like 
two inch-and-a-half long NEEDLE THIN PINS connected at  
the center by a metal bar.  Wires feed from it to the pulse 
  generators.  Walter moves behind her, ready to  install  the 
  probe-- 
 
                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                      You don t have to do this. 
 
She stares at him -- but then she nods at Walter --- who 
  carefully SHOVES THE PROBE INTO AND UNDER HER SKIN -- all the 
way in.  It hurts only a little -- more pressure than pain. 
 
  Walter makes an adjustment to the generator -- checks the  
vital signs.  All good.  He moves to the tank and opens the 
  door -- A LOUD, LONG CREAK.  It s like a giant, dark metal 
  shoebox, with a large hinged door.  There s a BENCH inside, 
which Walter and Peter help Olivia climb into, and sit on. 
 
  Walter takes the two remaining syringes.  The drugs.  He   69

turns her left arm over, wraps a rubber tube around her upper 
  arm&taps a vein& 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Have you ever tripped before? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (slightly defensive) 
                        I went to college. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Which college? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Maine State. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      No, you ve never tripped.  Not like  
                      this.   
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                        I have other drugs to counter-act  
                      what I m administering.  Help you  
                      come down faster.  If your vitals  
                      start to spike, we ll pull you out.   
                        I can t promise you what s gonna  
                        happen&but at least it should be  
                        interesting.   
 
  Nervous but determined, she nods.  Walter takes on syringe and 
  injects her.  
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      You should start to feel very  
                        relaxed, very shortly. 
 
  Then -- another syringe -- 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      And this&will rip open your  
                        consciousness. 
 
He injects it.  Peter doesn t like this at all.  Olivia then 
  gets into the epsom-salt-laden water.  She s in there.  Lying 
down, wires and probes stuck on and in her.  Walter looks at 
  her, now upside down for her. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                        Listen. In case you don t come  
                      back.  I just want to say, before  
                      we do this, that I so appreciate  
                      what you ve done.  70

 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (drowsy already) 
                        &what s that? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        &there are many things you lose  
                      in a place like that.  The hospital  
                      where I ve been. 
                              (beat) 
                      You lose being trusted. 
                              (beat) 
                      It s strange how important that is,  
                      once it s gone. 
 
On Peter, watching this vulnerable moment from his insane 
  father.  Finally, a small shrug from Walter.  And he closes the 
  hatch, TAKING US TO BLACK.

                                      ACT SEVEN 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  RESUME: Olivia s just gone into the tank.  Peter watches at  
the controls -- VIDEO IMAGES of her face and full body can be 
seen. Walter works controls on one of the generators.  A  
  SINE WAVE is seen on its oscilloscope, moving across the  
  screen again and again.  Under this, the name, written on  
WHITE TAPE:  OLIVIA .  Walter looks back to Astrid --  
 
                                          WALTER 
                      If you want to watch, you can come  
                        closer --- who are you again -- do you  
                      work here? 
 
                                          ASTRID 
                              (moves forward) 
                      Yeah, I m Astrid Farnsworth,  
                        remember?  Junior Special Agent  
                      with the FBI? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        I don t remember at all, but hello,  
                      hi, I m Walter, uh& 
 
 
And he s forgotten. 
 
                      PETER     WALTER 
  Bishop.  You re Walter     -- Bishop.  Yes.  Thank you. 
  Bishop. 
-- don t mention it. 
 
  Walter starts up he other generator.  On WHITE TAPE:  JOHN .  
  Another sine wave. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      See, this is her brain rhythm.   
                      More important than people know  
                        regarding cerebral regional  
                        interaction.  Critical-- massively  
                        important. 
                              (other generator) 
                      And this is his.  Over time, as the  
                      narcotics take effect, the probes  
                      will coax their rhythms into sync    
                      and the electrical signals from  
                      both -- that s what our brains are  
                        electrical routers -- should be  
                      able to be interpreted by the other.  72

 
 
                                          PETER 
                      See?  It s easy, like making taffy. 
 
Astrid smiles.  And if we haven t noticed, she s sort of a 
  stunner 
 
Walter turns on a monitor between the generators -- another 
  screen, showing BOTH sine waves, hers and his, in RED and 
GREEN.  Out of sync.  Walter stares at the screens. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      These are both of their rhythms    
                      when they re in sync&they should  
                      be in the same place.  So to speak. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        &so&now what? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Now?  Chicken salad. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      &what? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                              (to Astrid) 
                      Would you be a doll?  Chicken salad  
                      sandwich, no raisins?  Wheat bread?   
                        Pickles? 
 
                                          Astrid 
                      Yeah, I ll call that in-- 
                              (to Peter) 
                        --anything for you? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      An escape hatch? 
 
She smiles and goes off to make the call.  Walter, at a whisper 
to Peter: 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Now we wait. 
 
Peter watches, pensive.  MUSIC SWELLS and we DISSOLVE TO:  
 
OLIVIA 
 
  Floating, eyes closed.  The muffled WATER NOISES churning as we 
PUSH IN on her face&  73

 
                                                                          DISSOLEV TO:

  WALTER 
 
  Writing on the PAPER PRINT OUT of their vital signs.  Then he 
  brings a chicken salad sandwich to his mouth, taking a big 
bite.  He looks over: the monitor with BOTH of their brain 
waves markedly MORE IN SYNC&

  Walking around John, in his refrigerated containment 
    tent&looking in&then he turns, peaks into the TANK, concerned&

  OLIVIA 
 
TIGHT on her face& hold on it& then suddenly her MOUTH  
OPENS -- a quick INHALE -- SMASH CUT TO: 
 
  EXT. DREAMSCAPE   JUNK YARD   DAY 
 
  Olivia stands in the middle of a junkyard.  She looks around, 
  confused -- turns her head -- 
 
  INT. TANK   DAY 
 
  Olivia turns her head -- as if having a most vivid dream -- 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  Walter sits up  - machine beeps -- Peter and Astrid look on, 
  curious -- 
 
                                          PETER 
                        What s happening?

                      Ooo, look, she s having an episode. 
  74

  Walter goes over to the VITALS -- checks -- he s happy: 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      Blood pressure and heart good. 
                              (glances at the sync  
                              monitor) 
                        &should be any minute. 
 
  INT. DREAMSCAPE -- JUNK YARD -- DAY 
 
  Back to Olivia -- walking through the space, lost.  She s  
  wide-eyed, amazed.  She calls out: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Hello?!  I think I m here--! 
 
  INT. TANK   DAY 
 
-- Olivia, unconscious, in a drugged state -- whispers: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      -- I m here-- 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  Walter quickly circles an area of the vital signs tracking 
paper -- hits a button that BEEPS -- beginning to record the 
  brainwaves -- which are now perfectly aligned on the monitor. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Looklooklook, almost in sync. 
 
  INT. DREAMSCAPE   JUNK YARD   DAY 
 
  Olivia moves through the junk yard -- calling out: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        John?! &John?! 
 
She turns -- JUMP CUTS -- turns, looking, searching -- and a 
SHAPE MOVES behind her -- she turns -- no one is there.  But 
she feels like something just moved behind that massive pile of 
  trash. 
 
  Another part of the junk yard -- Olivia appears from behind a 
  huge mound of junk   walking through -- passing a beautiful  
red cedar WOODEN KAYAK -- fucking FLOATING in the air, ten  
  feet above the ground.  She stares at it, amazed, as she  
walks past.  She says, to no one: 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D_ 
                      -- I know this& that was my   75

                        uncle s kayak.  Why is that here? 
 
  INT. TANK   DAY 
 
  Olivia -- in a dream-state -- whispers -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --why--? 
 
  INT. DREAMSCAPE   JUNK YARD   DAY 
 
  Another SHAPE moves -- disappears behind trash -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      JOHN!  Is that you?! 
 
                                      JOHN (O.S.) 
                        Olivia--? 
 
-- she GASPS and turns-- 
 
  INT. TANK   DAY 
 
  Olivia s body quickly twists, SPLASHING-- 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
Peter stands -- machines BEEPING -- 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Is she okay--? What s happening? 
 
  Walter turns off the machines -- 
 
  WALTER      PETER 
  --she s fine--     --you sure? 
  --she s fine---look-- 
  they re together. 
 
And the monitor with BOTH waveforms looks like just ONE. 
 
  INT. DREAMSCAPE   JUNK YARD   DAY 
 
  Olivia has turned -- breathing heavily -- and stares with  
tears in her eyes at&JOHN.  Who stands there, in a suit,  
  dark tie, looking handsome and confused. 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      &I was thinking about you. 
 
  Olivia moves to him -- reaches out touches his face -- cries. 
  76

                                          OLIVIA 
                        --you re okay& 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      Feels like I ve been here for days,  
                      you know?  Where ve you been? 
 
-- and she KISSES HIM. 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
-- machines BEEP again -- 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --what s that? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Nothing. 
 
Peter stares at the monitors.  He moves to the tank, peeks  
  into the window at her.  Even more insane than the 
    experiment&he can t be feeling&jealousy&can he? 
 
  Olivia, unconscious, smiles  -- 
 
INT. DREAMSCAPE   WHITELAND   DAY 
 
The kiss finishes -- Olivia looks around -- they re in a 
  TOTALLY WHITE space -- massive and bright -- she looks back at 
  him--holding his face, emotional: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        John&you were hurt. 
 
                                          JOHN 
                        I don t remember. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Think.  The storage units -- we were  
                      sent to investigate-- 
 
                                          JOHN 
                        --yes--but&what are you doing  
                      here?  I m feeling cold-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I need you to remember.  I need you  
                      to show me. 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      --show you what? 
  77

                                          OLIVIA 
                        --what you saw.  You told me you  
                      saw him, that you saw his face.  I 
                      need you to show me his face. 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      &why? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (tears) 
                        --so&so I can save you. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                        Please, try -- try and remember    
                      we were at the storage units. 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      You kissed me there, like you did  
                      just now--- 
 
    --amazingly, BEHIND HIM, filling the space, like a giant 
  projected image  - is JOHN S POV AS OLIVIA MOVED TO HIM  -  
AND KISSED HIM -- AND THEN IT ALL GOES BLACK AROUND THEM    
as his eyes closed during the kiss. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --yes-- 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      --and we looked through the  
                        garbage.  And I unlocked the door  - 
                        opened it-- 
 
  Now--behind him--his POV as the door LOUDLY OPENS -- she COVERS 
HER EARS, it s so noisy -- and we see the labs -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --yes!  This is right--- 
 
--and Olivia s standing there, watching now--as if in  
front of a fucking IMAX SCREEN --John s POV, as he turns  -  
AND SEES TROUBLED! 
 
And we re looking at it FROM BEHIND OLIVIA -- WHICH MAKES IT 
  LOOK AS IF SHE IS THERE -- SEEING IT ALL HERSELF.  Wind somehow 
  blowing against her now, she watches with wide eyes --  
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      --I SEE HIM-- 
 
And now we re RUNNING through the facility -- a fast  
  STEADICAM GLIDE, chasing after Troubled -- Olivia almost   78

  losing her balance, feeling like she s free-falling, mouth 
open, overwhelmed -- and we see John s hand come up as he  
makes the call -- 
 
                                      JOHN (O.S) 
                      I ve got a runner!  He s heading  
                      for the back! 
 
And Olivia says -- AS WE ALSO HEAR HER SAY ON THE PHONE: 
 
  OLIVIA   OLIVIA S VOICE 
I m on my way!    (filtered) 
    I m on my way! 
 
-- and we TURN a corner, then another -- John AIMS HIS GUN  
AND FIRES -- HITTING TROUBLED IN THE SHOULDER!  Olivia GASPS -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      --you shot him -- 
 
And then, as we re running -- as John s running, crazy fast, 
  Olivia looks around for him -- where did he go? 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      -- John?! 
 
And she turns, 360 degrees, back to the screen, just as the 
  EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN   and John is suddenly OBLITERATED -- 
 
  INT. TANK   DAY 
 
  Olivia GASPS WILDLY, eyes wide in terror -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I SAW HIM! 
 
INT. LAB   DAY 
 
Peter and Astrid quickly pull Olivia out -- whose body is 
  convulsing -- 
 
                PETER        WALTER 
  --she s having a seizure!       -- hold her down! 
 
And Walter injects her with another SYRINGE  - Astrid wraps her 
in a large towel, her heavy breathing continues  
 
                                          ASTRID 
                      --is she gonna die? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Eventually.  79

 
Peter shoots Walter a look and Olivia s eyes stop rolling back 
    they begin to focus   she s full of adrenaline -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      --I saw his face -- his face, I saw  
                      him -- oh my God-- 
                        (crying now) 
                      --I saw John get hurt&I was  
                        there&I was there& 
 
And Peter stares at her, dubious but also amazed&

  FADE IN: 
 
  INT. FEDERAL BUILDING   BOSTON   DAY 
 
The situation room -- quick CIRCLING AROUND Olivia, pale and 
  desperate, as she works urgently at a computer on a FACIAL 
  COMPOSITE DEVELOPMENT program -- to recreate the face of the 
man she saw   and holy shit, is it close to Troubled -- 
 
  A number of Agents stand around her -- including Charlie -- 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                        --what the hell do you mean you  
                       saw him ?  Where? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      --I told you not to ask me that.   
                      This is him. 
                              (to Agent #3) 
                      This is the suspect we re looking  
                      for -- he looks like this -- 
 
Agent #3 is already hustling to the his desk -- 
 
                                        AGENT #3 
                      -- send me the image! 
 
  Olivia hits buttons -- BAM, the image appears on Agent #3 s 
  screen -- he types, fast.  Quietly: 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      You look like crap -- have you 
                        slept? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I am not crazy.  I saw him.  I saw  
                      the whole thing. 
 
But hell -- as she looks into Charlie s eyes, she sure sounds 
nuts.  Looks it too. 
 
                                        AGENT #3 
                      No primary matches for criminal  
                        record -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Cross-check all states  drivers  
                        license files! 
  81

                                        AGENT #3 
                      On it, checking! 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      -- and send that image to all local  
                        hospitals, that man was wounded   
                      shot in the right shoulder! 
 
But Agent #4, standing by Olivia s computer, having stared at 
the screen since she finished the image, says: 
 
                                        AGENT #4 
                      --I ve seen him before.  I know  
                      him. 
 
Olivia turns to him   galvanized -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --where? 
 
It takes him a moment.  And then, as if he doesn t believe it 
  himself, he hurries across the room, to the IMAGES AND FILES OF 
ALL THE PASSENGERS ON THE PLANE -- he RIPS one off the  
wall.  Looks at it as he moves to Olivia and hands it to her. 
 
The PASSPORT PHOTO AND FILE OF TROUBLED.  She goes white. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      -- oh my God, this is him. 
 
                                        AGENT #4 
                      He was a passenger.  That man was  
                      on Flight 627. 
 
And her mind -- as our had --tumbles -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I don t understand& 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      He couldn t have been at the  
                        storage place.  Maybe y-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --Charlie, I saw him there. 
 
He looks at her, sympathetic, but dubious.  Kindly: 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                        I think you need some sleep. 
  82

And in a moment when Olivia thinks maybe she just might be 
going crazy -- tears come to her eyes -- 
 
                        CHARLIE     OLIVIA 
-- why don t you come to the    --no--no&nonono&I  
  house.  Kathy ll make up the    swear to God, I saw him&I 
guest room, you can stay      saw him there& 
there while-- 
 
AGENT #3 pipes up: 
 
                                        AGENT #3

                      of Steeltown, Pennsylvania, forty-four  
                      years old, has one sibling-- 
 
Agent #3 moves to a laser printer, just finishing printing a 
  page   he pulls it out, holds it up-- 
 
                                  AGENT #3 (CONT D) 
                        Richard Stenson. 
 
Holy shit, it s a different photo&OF THE SAME MAN.  Or is it? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      --he has a twin?

                      Six minutes older. 
 
Olivia stands --re-energized -- on her game, to the room: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      -- so this cements the connection  
                      to the plane ---

                      But what is the connection? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      -- that s right: Richard Stenson  
                      sets up labs in the storage yard    
                      we don t know what the hell he s

                        Whatever he s doing, it s about as  
                        dangerous as it gets. His brother  
                      was obviously a trigger.  But how?   
                      Was he in on it?  Or was he set up?  
                              (something occurs to her) 
                      --do you have medical history?

                              Stenson spiked his brother s  
                              syringe.  Dr. Bishop mentioned that  
                              he d worked on self-eradicating

                                          OLIVIA 
                      We need to ask Richard Stenson that, don t we? 
                              (to Agent #3) 
                        Where s his file?

                      Hot off the press--- 
 
--she GRABS the page that s just coming out.  Reads it.  Cannot 
  fucking believe what she sees.  84

 
                                        CHARLIE 
                        --what? 
 
As she heads out, handing the paper to him, she says: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Richard Stenson s last employer

                        --what--who? 
 
But Olivia is gone -- and CHARLIE looks at the page and: 
 
                                  CHARLIE (CONT D) 
                        &you re kidding me. 
 
INT. PROMETHEUS CORP.   CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
Olivia walks fiercely down the corridor -- PRE-LAP: 
 
                                    OLIVIA (V.O.) 
                      This is our suspect.  I want  
                        everything you ve got on him. 
 
INT. NINA CORD S OFFICE   DAY 
 
Nina Cord holds a photo of Richard Stenson.  She obviously 
  recognizes the guy.  Olivia is here   and Nina s ASSISTANT, 
near the door. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      You want me get a court order?   
                      Or do you want to talk? 
 
A beat -- then, to her Assistant: 
 
                                          NINA 
                      Bring me your files on Richard  
                        Stenson. 
 
  Assistant nods, heads out as Nina says to Olivia -- warmer, as 
if in confidence: 
 
                                    NINA (CONT D) 
                      I want to apologies for our last  
                        meeting.  I wasn t sure I could  
                      trust you before.  Now I know I  
                      can. 
 
 
  85

 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        &meaning what.  You did  
                        background on me? 
 
                                          NINA 
                              (beat, sincere) 
                        I especially appreciate what you  
                      did at Quantico.  Putting those  
                      three captains behind bars was the  
                      best thing that could ve happened  
                      to the US Marines. 
 
  Olivia is quietly stunned to find an ally in this odd, cold 
woman with one arm. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        &thank you. 
 
                                          NINA 
                      The man you re looking for was an  
                        employee for two years in our  
                        weapons systems research lab.  He  
                      was fired three months ago after he  
                      tried to leave the premises with  
                        certain classified materials.  Our 
                        investigators concluded that damage  
                      to Prometheus was minimal&but that  
                      Mr. Stenson may be part of The  
                        Pattern.  Which would be consistent  
                      with your suspicions. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I m sorry, you said part of the  
                        pattern -- what pattern? 
                              (off Nina s look) 
                      --did I miss something? 
 
                                          NINA 
                        I assumed you have clearances& 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (beat, unsettled) 
                        &clearances for what&? 
 
  Nina stares, debates telling her.  Then: 
 
                                          NINA 
                        Suffice to say, we ve reached a  
                      point where science and technology  
                      have advanced at an exponential  
                      rate for so long&that it is far   86

                        beyond our ability to regulate and  
                        control them. 
                              (beat) 
                      You should know what you re getting  
                      into, Ms. Warren.  I would say the  
                      same thing to my daughter.  To my 
                        granddaughter.  Be careful. 
 
  Olivia is struck by this warning.  Then, to punctuate the 
  moment, Nina s Assistant enters, hands Nina a FILE. Nina takes 
it, glances at it, and hands it to Olivia. 
 
                                    NINA (CONT D) 
                        Everything we have on Richard  
                        Stenson. 
 
                                    NINA (CONT D) 
                              (then knowing she ll need it) 
                      Good luck. 
 
And OFF OLIVIA we&

  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  --SPONGE BOB SQUARE PANTS on TV in the lab.  Walter watches, 
  loving it.  Astrid too.  Peter is also here, resenting the 
whole thing. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      And this is a show&for children? 
 
                                          ASTRID 
                      Yeah.  It s huge. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      It s surprisingly profound.  For a  
                        narrative about a sponge. 
                              (to Peter) 
                        Wouldn t you say? 
 
  Before he can answer the PHONE RINGS, Peter answers merrily: 
 
  PETER 
                      Crazy house. 
 
  INT. SEDAN   INTERCUTTING 
 
  Olivia drives at 90 mph -- talks into her headset as she WEAVES 
  between curs: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        I just landed at Logan and I m on  
                      my way to you -- I think we ve  
                        located our suspect. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --wait, what do you mean?  You  
                      didn t find him, did you?  The guy  
                      you saw in the dream you had? 
 
Astrid turns off the TV -- Peter glances over at Walter, who 
just SMILES at him like he cat who ate the canary. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m picking you both up -- I ll  
                      need your father there to question  
                      him, get whatever information he  
                      needs so he can make the cure for  
                      John -- and I ll need you there too,  
                      in case your father s&you know --   88

 
                                          PETER 
                      -- say no more. 
 
  EXT. SOUTH BOSTON TENEMENT   DAY 
 
  BOOM DOWN a row of tenements -- past 3D LETTERS WHICH READ 
   SOUTH BOSTON  -  to a particularly shoddy one as a Flak-
  jacketed SWAT TEAM silently secures the perimeter, fanning  
out -- 
 
 
Peter and Walter sit in the back of Olivia s car.  Peter  
looks at the FILE of Stenson -  company PHOTO, etc&Then he  
  notices that Walter seems particularly uncomfortable watching  
the police activity. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      What.  You okay? 
 
He shakes his head a bit.  Vulnerable. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Reminds me& 
                              (then staring off, shakes his head) 
                        &nothing. 
 
Peter realizes: must be the night he was arrested.  The fire.  
  A beat, then he looks back to the team -- 
 
  VARIOUS SHOTS of Team Members snaking through bushes, around 
  corners -- cordoning off the apartment   moving up to the front 
door. 
 
TIGHT ON OLIVIA who lands next to the doorframe, back to the 
wall, gun drawn.  TEAM LEADER gives the  go  and: 
 
  INT. TENEMENT BUILDING   CONTINUOUS 
 
Dark, dilapidated   the team BURSTS IN shouting  FEDERAL 
  AGENTS!!!  -- Olivia and three Team Members through the main 
door, four others through the back -- VARIOUS SHOTS of 
  DIFFERENT ROOMS in the apartment as the Team Members move 
  through it, gun muzzles panning -- we STAY CLOSE WITH OLIVIA, 
ready for anything, tense as all hell -- and one by one, as 
every room s breached, we hear the refrain: 
 
                                    TEAM MEMBERS 
                      CLEAR! / CLEAR! / CLEAR! / CLEAR! 
 
She moves through the house, pissed, searching -- nothing --
  clearly, the guy s not here -- she STOPS -- NOTICES something:  89

 
The RUG underfoot.  A DISTURBED DUST PERIMERTER, like the rug 
was just moved -- she crouches, YANKS back the rug, revealing A 
  CELLAR DOOR -- SIGNALS to the Team Leader: DOWN THERE. 
 
The Agents converge, weapons back up, Team Leader flips on a 
  MAGLITE as a Team Member RIPS BACK the door -- the agents STORM 
  DOWN into: 
 
  INT. CELLAR   CONTINUOUS 
 
The Team DESCENDS, flashlights sweeping, the cellar s FILLED 
  WITH CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT -- EMPTY -- but the storm window s been 
  OPENED -- 
 
  EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING   CONTINUOUS 
 
  Walter and Peter, alone.  Peter watching outside, anxious. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Thank you for before.  Putting me 
                      out.  When I was on fire.  
 
                                          PETER 
                              (I don t want to be here) 
                      My pleasure. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                              (beat) 
                      It s good to see you again. 
 
Peter look at him, not giving an inch.  Then he sees, past 
  Walter: STENSON emerge from a below-ground FLIGHT OF STAIRS -- 
Peter recognizes his FACE -- THROWS the car door open, starts 
to MOVE, SHOUTING: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      THE ALLEY!  HE S IN THE ALLEY! 
 
  Stenson TURNS -- MEETS EYES WITH Peter -- then RUNS around a 
  corner, down an alley   and fuck, Peter can t let him go so, as 
he gets out, quickly, to Walter  
 
                PETER (CONT D)     WALTER  
--YOU STAY RIGHT THERE, YOU    --what--I can t--can I 
HEAR ME?!     leave the car? 
  --NO!!!  NO, YOU STAY  
  THERE!!! 
 
And Peter SPRINTS after Stenson -- finally the SWAT team s 
  following too, IN PURSUIT -- OLIVIA sees Peter round a corner -
  - SHIT--she runs:  90

 
    A BREATHLESS FOOT CHASE, IMMEDIATE, HANDHELD AND FRENETIC: 
Peter and STENSON -- RUNNING ALL OUT -- pelting down the alley, 
  breathing hard, each in overdrive -- Stenson looks back -- sees 
Peter behind him, gaining-- 
 
Ahead of them a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley -- 
  Stenson hangs a hard left and CRASHES through a wooden gate -- 
Peter whips through the gate a second later, crossing a 
  cluttered BACKYARD -- RUNNING, tripping through toys, a swing 
  set, through a HEDGE and RUNNING LIKE MAD through the narrow 
gap between tenements -- they emerge onto a street -- 
 
  Ahead, a MAN on a BIKE, pulling up to the sidewalk -- Stenson 
  dodges but HURLS bike-man aside, sending him RIGHT INTO Peter -
- the two of them CRASHING, rolling to the pavement, Peter s 
face contorted with pain and just when it looks like Stenson s 
gonna get away -- 
 
OLIVIA SNAPS INTO FRAME, running full-tilt boogie, she s been 
  FOLLOWING THEM, suddenly the chase becomes HERS -- Stenson 
races toward a TRACT HOUSE across the street -- she pulls her 
gun as Stenson runs past a MAN picking up his mail -- RACES 
  THROUGH HIS FRONT DOOR: 
 
INSIDE THE HOUSE: Olivia chases -- a WOMAN doing laundry 
  SCREAMS as they blast past her, knocking her flying    
  through the KITCHEN   KIDS at the table SCREAM TOO as  
  furniture crashes everywhere -- Stenson SLAMS right through  
the back screen door, RIPPING IT off its hinges -- and JESUS, 
we re still following them across the BACKYARD where -- 
 
  A SNARLING DOBERMAN IS SUDDENLY BOLTING AFTER THEM -- gaining -
- a FENCE ahead -- Stenson s the first OVER IT -- Olivia

YELLS IN AGONY but manages to kick free of the dog and pulls 
  herself over the fence, ANKLE BLOODIED -- drops with a THUD  
on the other side just as she looks up to see Peter APPEAR  
OUT OF NOWHERE, TACKLING STENSON HARD -- SLAMMING HIM TO THE 
  OILY CONCRETE   DOGS BARKING, JUMPING behind nearby fences    
  a furious Peter gets the upper hand, PUNCHING STENSON HARD   
AGAIN AND AGAIN -- an adrenaline surge of strength and 
  Stenson s face BLEEDS for it -- but suddenly Olivia is THERE, 
SLAMS her knee down on Stenson s chest and shoves her GUN 
  BARREL in his face -- out of breath:

  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
BANG: the door flies open --- in rush Olivia, Peter and Walter

                      That s not true: all agents are  
                        required to set up a backup blood  
                      supply in case we re wounded-- 
 
                                          WALTER

                      We create the antidote, dissolve it  
                      into Scott s stored blood, then

  SCIENCE MONTAGE: 
 
  A staple of the show -- Walter  - with Peter s help -- use 
  whatever tools and tricks of the trade are needed to build the 
  device, create the compound or jerry-rig the machinery-- 
 
In this case they re FORMULATING THE ANTIDOTE FOR JOHN

  CENTRIFUGE to Peter hanging SALINE BAGS to Walter injecting  
the GREEN COMPOUND -- THE ANTIDOTE -- into the saline    
  Olivia enters with a stainless-steel COOLER -- opens it    
  BAGS OF BLOOD   and now Walter preps the BLOOD TRANSFUSION

  INT. LAB BUILDING CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
  Olivia sits on a bench in the shiny-tile hallway of the first 
floor of the building.  Unknowing college students pass here 
and there.  She sits here, heart heavy&in waiting.  She turns: 
  BROYLES is here.  He moves to her, sits beside her.  Says, with 
    half-seriousness: 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      So I got the lab. 
 
She can t help but smile a little too. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Yeah, I know you did.  Thank you. 
 
He nods.  Then: 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      How s it going downstairs? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        Bishop says it ll be a while.  But  
                      it s actually looking  auspicious .   
                      That was his word. 
 
And she sees he s staring at her. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                        &what.

And when Broyles talks now&he s direct&but warm.  Surprisingly 
  engaged: 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                        You ve done some solid work here.   
                        Locating Bishop.  Getting him out,  
                        finding a way to get him to work  
                      with you. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      His son found a way to get to him to  
                      work, not me.  Brains run in the  
                        family. 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      But you found them.  You did it.   
                        You ve done more in six days than  
                      we have in months. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        &who s  we ? 
 
And so he levels with her: 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      What happened on that plane might  
                      not be an isolated incident.  
 
She s intrigued   as he pulls out a CLASSIFIED FOLDER.  Opens 
it.  There are PHOTOGRAPHS inside. 
 
                                  BROYLES (CONT D) 
                      Most of what I m going to show you  
                      has not been made public. 
 
He shows her one photo: DEAD CATTLE. Dozens of them. 
 
                                  BROYLES (CONT D) 
                      Last April outside Houston, two- 
                        hundred and six head of cattle were  
                      found dead.  Autopsies revealed  
                      they were all missing lungs.  No  
                        surgical marks. No signs of foul  
                      play. 
 
  Olivia is puzzled as Broyles pulls out another IMAGE: a MAN IN 
  A HOSPITAL BED.

                      like.  Battle.  Hostage crisis.

                      it should be any different.  Why it  
                        should affect me any more.  But it  
                      does. 
                              (eyes well up, quietly:) 
                      I m scared.  And I just want to go  
                      back.  To before.

  smiles:

                                          OLIVIA 
                        &John?  Can you hear me, baby? 
 
And Peter records that  unofficial  term. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      --John--? 
 
And John s eyes focus on her beautiful face--he sees her.  His 
voice weak, tears in his eyes too-- 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      &I had a dream&about you& 
 
And she cries and kisses him, holding him so grateful.  Peter 
  watches this scene, incredulous.  He glances at his father, who 
is literally crying at the reunion.  And for the first time, 
Peter sees his father&as something of a hero. 
 
                                                                            FADE OUT. 
 
                                    END ACT NINE

                                        ACT TEN 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY   LATER 
 
  Perhaps an hour later, John is being wheeled out of the lab by 
two MED TECHS.  Looking even healthier now, the trace of veins 
still receding under porcelain skin.  Hey pass by Peter, who is 
on a cell, speaking Arabic: 
 
                                          PETER 
                        I appreciate your patience, I  
                        should be back by Thursday night -- 
 
He walks past Walter, who stands in the middle of the room, 
  keeping a close eye on Peter.  Pensive.  And Olivia approaches, 
  grinning, grateful& 
 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        You re a miracle worker. 
 
It takes Walter a moment to turn to her-- 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Oh.  Yes, nature has its kinder  
                        moments 
                              (then) 
                      I was hoping you might&need me.   
                      For another go.  Another&something,  
                        I don t know. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      They might.  I think they would. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      But I d need Peter.  I don t think  
                        I could do it without my son. 
                              (beat) 
                      And I suspect he wouldn t do it  
                        without you. 
 
  That catches her off-guard; the fact she understand the subtext 
so instantaneously, and might even (in her deepest recesses) 
share the feeling it implies, is something she can t handle 
  yet: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      What --what do you mean?  99

 
                                          WALTER 
                              (beat, smiles) 
                      I m not sure. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                              (smile fades, long beat) 
                      &what are we talking about? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I was &just thank you. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      No need. 
                              (then, quietly) 
                        I meant to ask you.  If you ve  
                      read my file&then you know the truth.   
                      About my son s&medical history. 
 
And we see in her face now, whatever it is he s referring to, 
she does know, and it s troubling.  Her eyes go to Peter across 
the lab, still on the phone.  She just nods. 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      If you d like to thank me&you  
                      could do so by not telling him.   
                        Please. 
 
Their look holds, and we don t know WHAT this is about, but in 
time we certainly will.  For now, there s a silent 
  acknowledgement that yes, it ll stay between them.  She leans 
in, gives Walter a kiss on the cheek.  She walks off&and he 
  watches as she moves to his son. 
 
ON OLIVIA AND Peter: 
 
As she says good-bye: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Your job still waiting for you? 
 
                                          PETER 
                      You bet it is.  Guys as brilliantly  
                      stupid as I am don t grow on trees. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Not in Baghdad they don t. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      No sir. 
 
  100

                                          OLIVIA 
                      Good luck with Big Eddie. 
 
                                          PETER 
                              (beat) 
                        Thanks. 
 
And there s a moment, a look between them -- despite 
  everything, he s actually come to like her.  And she, him. 
 
                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                      This whole freak show went better  
                      than I thought it would.  Thanks. 
 
And their look HOLDS&   
 
  INT. HOSPITAL   DAY 
 
  Through a hospital room window, we see JOHN, recovering, 
  speaking to a NURSE.  He s got BANDAGES on parts of his face, 
  like a burn victim whose skin is still healing.  PULL BACK to 
  find Olivia staring through the glass, DR. REYES beside her, 
still happily surprised: 
 
                                      DR. REYES 
                      His vitals are surprisingly strong. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      How long does he have to stay? 
 
                                      DR. REYES 
                      Until the melanocytes in his skin  
                        regenerate -- but that shouldn t be  
                      more than a week. 
                              (smiles) 
                      He owes you his life. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      We owe each other. 
 
And as she looks back on John, her focus goes elsewhere: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      What room is Stenson in? 
 
  INT. HOSPITAL   SECURE WING   DAY 
 
  Olivia approaches Stenson s room, flashes a BADGGE to the 
  posted DOOR OFFICER   enters: 
 
  INT. ROOM 407   CONTINUOUS 
  101

  Stenson s in bed, shoulder bandaged from John s gunshot, his 
  wrists leather-strapped to the bed s side rails.  She enters; 
cold, intimidating stare; he returns it, unfazed: 
 
                                        STENSON 
                        I told the truth. 
                              (beat) 
                        Didn t I.  I gave you the names of  
                      the synthetics I used in th-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (hating this prick) 
                      Don t worry, our immunity agreement  
                        holds, but there s a lot more we  
                      have to talk about -- like why you  
                        killed your own brother, and who  
                      you were selling your work to. 
 
                                        STENSON 
                      Who says I was selling it? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Right now I only need one thing:  
                      you got help from someone in our  
                        office, didn t you?  We have phone  
                        records.  The calls made to your  
                        pre-paid cell. 
                              (beat) 
                      Who were they from? 
 
He takes a beat, something in his eyes& 
 
                                        STENSON 
                        You ve got it wrong: I wasn t  
                        working with anybody, I was being  
                        threatened.  And if the calls came  
                      out of your office&I m starting  
                      to wonder if you can really protect  
                      me. 
 
She studies him: unsure if he s fucking with her. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I ll remind you the death penalty s  
                      only off the table for your  
                      continued cooperation, Mr. Stenson. 
 
                                        STENSON 
                      --you think I m lying?  I sear to  
                      God, I can prove it.  I recorded  
                      the conversation. 
  102

                                          OLIVIA 
                        --where is the recording? 
 
                                        STENSON 
                      At home.  In my yard.  I buried it  
                      by the back steps&listen for  
                        yourself. 
 
Off Olivia, REACTING to this new, profound break-- 
 
  INT. LAB   CONTINUOUS 
 
  Walter watches impassively as all the new equipment s moved 
  out; the old equipment re-taped.  The cow too, is being readied 
for transport&Walter stares at it, awkwardly pats its head& 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Research suggests bovines are& 
                        gifted with advanced cognitive  
                        abilities, and never forget a face. 
                              (beat) 
                        I hope you ll remember mine.  Good  
                      luck, Gene. 
 
                                      PETER (O.S.) 
                        & Gene?  
 
Walter turns; Peter, behind him, has been watching -- partly 
  amused, partly embarrassed, partly pitying. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                              (as if to say  obviously ) 
                      Our genetic benefactress. 
 
To that, Peter has to smile a little.  Obviously.  There s an 
  unspoken acknowledgement here of what comes next, and suddenly 
Walter grows quietly, painfully desperate: 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      Please don t take me back.  I don t  
                      want to go back. 
 
                                          PETER 
                              ( don t do this to me ) 
                        Listen, um--Walter-- 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      You called me  pop  before. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      And you asked me to all you  Mom . 
  103

                WALTER       PETER 
  --this experience: you woke 
me up again, you can t put me 
back to sleep--        --this was hardly my idea, 
  --whatever punishment you     none of it was-- 
think I deserve, I swear I ve 
  already endured it-- 
  seventeen years--    --STOP. 
 
It gets very quiet. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        &please.  Son. 
 
And we see how much this hurts Peter too, that against every 
  rational instinct, his heart s bleeding for this man.  It s 
  confusing, infuriating -- he doesn t want to connect: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      Maybe the truth is&if you d been  
                      more of a father to me, I d be a  
                      better son. 
                              (beat) 
                      That doesn t just mean staying& 
                      it means not getting into the kind  
                      of trouble I m in already. 
                              (beat, simply) 
                      If I stay here, I die. 
                              (beat) 
                        I don t really have a choice. 
 
And he moves off, leaving Walter standing there, heartsick. 
 
INT. STENSON S TENEMENT BUILDING   DAY 
 
The apartment s taped off, turned into a crime scene.  
  FORENSICS TECHNICIANS bag evidence, dust for prints&Olivia 
moves through, heading toward the back stairs& 
 
HARD CUT TO HER HANDS, DIGGING IN DIRT -- she s on her knees in 
the yard, scrounging for the taps.  Digging, digging, until she 
comes across the corner of a PLASTIC ZIPLOC BAG -- pulls it out 
and holds it up: inside is THE MICROCASSETTE. 
 
INT. HOSPITAL   JOHN S ROOM   DAY 
 
John, in bed, tries to sit up&still feeling weak&but forces 
  himself into sitting position.  Looks determinedly towards the 
door-- 
 
INT. OLIVIA S CAR   DAY 
  104

The glove compartment POPS OPEN -- Olivia rummages through 
  supplies, finds a MICROCASSETTE RECORDER.  Focused, full of 
    anticipation, she slips in the Microcassette, hits  PLAY -- 
HEAVY STATIC  voice FILTERED -- SLOWLY PUSH IN on her as: 
 
                                    STENSON (V.O.) 
                      --who is this? 
 
                                      VOICE (V.O.) 
                      We had a purchase agreement. 
 
                                    STENSON (V.O.) 
                      There have been other bidders.   
                        Today--the airplane--was a  
                        demonstration-- 
 
                                      VOICE (V.O.) 
                      You ve drawn unwarranted attention - 
                        - something we can t afford to be  
                      connected with. 
                              (beat) 
                      I ll make this simple: you re not  
                        selling to anyone else.  You do  
                      that and we will come after you - 
                      I will come after you. 
 
We re still PUSHING IN on Olivia -- CLOSER STILL, an ominous 
  feeling overtaking her -- 
 
                                    STENSON (V.O.) 
                        &you re threatening me?  Is that  
                      wise.  After seeing what I m  
                        willing to do to my own brother?

                      Lemme assure you, we d be happy to  
                      treat you like family too. 
 
AND BY NOW OLIVIA S EYES FILL FRAME, WIDE, HORRIFIED, AS WE: 
 
  MEMORY FLASHCUT: LOGAN AIRPORT, ON THE TARMAC OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
    JOHN S GETTING OUT OF THE VAN AS HE ARRIVES ON-SCENE, TALKING 
ON HIS CELL:

                      Good old NTSB.  All like to think  
                        they re cops.

  BACK TO OLIVIA: we watch the insane, impossible moment of 
  revelation -- the air leaves her chest--almost a whisper: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --John-- 
 
  EXT. STENSON S ROOM   DAY 
 
John, now back in his clothes, approaches the POSTED COP 
  outside Stenson s door, flashes his FBI ID: 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      Need to ask him a few questions&. 
 
  INT. STENSON S ROOM   DAY 
 
  Stenson s ASLEEP.  A SHADOW moves over him then LIGHTNING FAST 
-- A PILLOW JAMS DOWN OVER STENSON S FACE -- he JERKS under its 
force but CAN T MOVE BECAUSE HIS WRISTS ARE BOUND -- his body 
SPASMS HELPLESSLY as we ANGLE AROUND TO JOHN, his face 
  impassive, holding the pillow there with brute force& 
 
INT. OLIVIA S CAR   DAY 
 
Olivia FLOORS IT back to the hospital, on auto-pilot   this 
isn t possible but it s fucking happening -- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                              (into headset) 
                        Charlie, I need two agents posted  
                        outside Agent Scott s room now    
                      nobody goes in or out  til I get  
                      there -- and make sure Stensons s safe! 
 
 
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STENSON S ROOM   DAY 
 
  Charlie runs down the corridor -- flashes his badge as he moves 
past the COP outside Stenson s room -- he bursts in -- FINDS A 
  DEAD STENSON -- EYES WIDE-- 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      --oh God--Livvy, he s dead  
                      Stenson s dead! 
                              (yells out) 
                      WE NEED THIS PLACE LOCKED DOWN! 
 
  EXT./INT. HOSPITAL   DAY. 
 
  Olivia FISHTAILS around a corner -- SLAMMING HER BRAKES, door 
  already open and she s LEAPING from the car -- RUNNING LIKE 
  HELL FOR THE ENTRANCE -- but then she HEARS A SCREECH and turns  106

    John, behind the wheel of a BLACK SUV, pulls onto the road!  
  Olivia runs back to her car -- jumps in and TAKES OFF after 
him-- 
 
TIRES SCREAM AS SHE PURSUES, SHOUTING INTO HER CAR WALKIE: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      This is Warren, Agent ID 52776--in pursuit of 
                      black SUV, license number 5AD672B -- heading 
                      south on Fenway, need immediate assist-- 
 
  EXT. HIGHWAY   DAY 
 
  JOHN -- speeding across the boulevard into a neighborhood of 
  inclined streets and  OLIVIA-- skidding around a corner a 
  second later as -- TWO POLIC ECARS PULL U-TURNS on the road, 
  whipping around to join the chase and John looks back -- SEES 
  OLIVIA IS PURSUING HIM -- 
 
  Pursued by Olivia and two black and whites, JOHN DRIVES, FAST 
up a hill-- CRESTS -- SPARK FLY as he SKIDS A HARD RIGHT  SHIT-
  -Another COPP CAR angels in from the SIDE STREET and JOHN -- no 
choice   FLOORS IT   KNIFING the front end of the cop car and -
- the TWO COPS CARS FOLLOWING are spun back!  CRASHING AGAINST 
  A BUILDING ON THE CORNER   not to mention the COMMUTER CARS -- 
  PILES-UP: 
 
OLIVIA -- swerving to avoid it -- onto the sidewalk--SPARKS 
FROMK THE WALL AS SHE SCRAPES!  Hanging in --- skidding into a 
turn down the hill, catching up--- 
 
JOHN -- pedal down   SIDE-SWIPES OLIVIA S CAR   THEY SKID INTO 
  ONCOMING LANES   A TRUCK!  They re forced to DIVIDE in a  V  as 
the truck PASSES INCHES BEWEEN THEM   John Veers off, onto the 
-- 
 
EXT. CHARLES RIVER ROAD 
 
The two cars on a road running parallel to the Charles River -- 
the road itself divided by a CONCRETE BARRIER -- 
 
Olivia -- recovering   gaining -- nearly pulling level-- 
 
JOHN SWERVES INTO OLIVIA, TRYING TO RUN HER OFF THE ROAD-- 
  SLAMMING INTO HER CAR, AGAIN AND AGAIN! 
 
  ANOTHER SLAM AND HIS BUMPER LOCKS INTO HER FENDER -- HE TRIES 
TO STEER LOOSE BUT SHE HAS HIM NOW -- SHE ACCELERATES: 
 
  SPEEDOMETER: vibrating at 99mph&105mph&up ahead, CRASH DRUMS -- 
she SLAMS her brake, ripping loose, sending John s car 
  FISHTAILING OUT OF CONTROL--  107

 
HIS CAR CAREENS INTO THE DETONATING CRASH DRUMS, SMASHING INTO 
THE CONCRETE BARRIER, SOMERSAULTING OVER THE REINFORCED 
  EMBANKMENT IN A SPINE-SHATTERING COLLISION AND& 
 
  &quiet. Olivia SLAMS her brakes, SKIDDING to a stop. 
 
We stay CLOSE on her.  Eyes wide, in SHOCK.  HOLD for a long 
  beat&the insane turn of events barley registering through the 
  adrenaline screaming through her brain& 
 
  Finally, her eyes track up to the rear view, where she sees: 
the wreck sits motionless, smoke pouring from its hood. 
 
  Somewhere in there is John.  The man who, until minutes ago, 
she loved.  The man who just tried to kill her. 
 
  Weakly, she pushes open her dented door.  Pulls herself from 
the car&stumbles over the wreckage, terrified to face what 
  she ll see&and there he is: 
 
  Bloody, barely alive.  His body crushed, entombed in twisted 
  metal.  And the eerie translucent skin almost makes him look 
  like a vampire dying at dawn&he tries to speak, only GURGLES 
  BLOOD& 
 
Her eyes well, heart shredded, betrayed, watching him die.  And 
in his last breath, he manages to say& 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      &ask yourself&why& 
 
&eyes wet, in shock, she just stares& 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      &why Broyles&sent you&to  
                      the storage facility& 
                              (then) 
                      &why you? 
 
Her mind bends -- is he just fucking with her some more?!  Or 
  does he mean something by this? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I don t understand&why& 
                      who are you working for&? 
 
He COUGHS more blood, fading.  Manages to half-smile, sadly&her 
  eyes well, she s almost pleading& 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Tell me, John. You tell me.  108

 
He just looks at her long and hard.  And then.  He dies. 
 
  Olivia just stands there, mind and heart a jumble, his last 
words echoing in her&holding the ugly promise of what she s 
found herself in the middle of&   
 
                                                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN:  
 
EXT. BOSTON   DAY 
 
  Charlie s government   issued car DRIVES PAST. 
 
INT. CHARLIE S CAR   DAY 
 
  Charlie drives, Olivia sits beside him, in shattered silence.  
Eyes red, numb.  Mind a million pieces.  Charlie looks at her.  
  Speechless. What can he possibly say.  Then, after a long beat, 
almost at a whisper: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I want to go back to the lab. 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      Livvy.  I promised them I d take  
                      you right to the hospital-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        I can t go there.  Please   
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      You need to be checked out-- 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m fine. 
                              (smiles, crying) 
                      I m fine, look at me. 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      Livvy 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Take me back please.  To the lab. 
 
  Charlie looks at her.  Knows he can t say no. 
 
EXT. HARVARD QUAD   DAY 
 
  Charlie s car pulls up -- Olivia gets out.  And she sees, 
across the parking lot, Walter and Peter getting into another 
black government vehicle as passengers.  They see her and stop. 
 
She moves to them.  A shell of her former self.  But somewhere 
-- visible even now -- is a strength forming as a result of 
  everything she just experienced. 
  110

She tries to appear normal in this moment.  Strong.  Better 
  than okay. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      So, uh&I was thinking.  About  
                        everything.  About what we did.   
                      And what we re gonna do next. 
                              (beat) 
                      And I thought&given  
                        everything&that maybe not  
                        sticking together&maybe that s  
                      being a little selfish. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --what are you saying? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m saying that the world s scary  
                      as hell.  And I don t like it.   
                              (beat) 
                      But if we can help...don t you  
                      think we have to? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Yes. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      No. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      I m in. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        You re not in -- you re out,  
                        because I m not in. 
                              (to Olivia) 
                        I can t.  You know I can t. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      You re the only one who speaks  
                        Walter.  What if-- please -- what  
                      if&we take care of it?  What  
                        you&what you owe. 
 
And Jesus, Olivia is just desperate   and Peter can see it.  He 
stares at her-- a mix of suspicion and concern&and, 
    increasingly, heartbreak& 
 
                                          PETER 
                      &what happened? 
 
  111

                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I just think it s the right  
                      thing to do. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --where s John? 
 
And that s it: Olivia starts to cry-- and Peter moves to her--
takes her in his arms.  Holds her.  Not understanding--but at 
the same time, knowing --this is where he needs to be. And he 
says, quietly: 
 
                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                      Of course I ll stay.  Of course I  
                      will. 
 
And as he holds her, she just whispers  
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --thank you& 
 
                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 
 
  INT. LAB   DAY 
 
  --suddenly things are being MOVED BACK IN AGAIN.  Astrid here, 
  helping.  Walter could not be happier, setting up his equipment 
-- pulling the sheets off yet another really intimidating 
  looking device. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        I don t even want to know what that  
                      thing does. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      No you do not. 
 
                                          PETER 
                              (quietly) 
                      You don t even remember what it  
                      does, do you? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      No I do not. 
 
  Then Walter sees something that lights up his eyes: GENE, his 
COW is being brought back in: 
 
                                  WALTER (CONT D) 
                      Gene!  Come this way!  Over here. 
  112

And we find Olivia with Broyles.  While hardly back to her old 
  self&she will probably never be: 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      I m sorry how it happened.  But I m  
                      glad you changed your mind. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        There s a lot we ll need on Monday.   
                      The doctors have a list of  
                        equipment -- and of course they ll  
                      need a place to stay  
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      It s all covered -- all of it  
                      but we can t wait until Monday.   
                              (holds up a file) 
                        There s something I need to show  
                      you now. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        &okay. 
                              (then, loud) 
                        Bishop. 
 
And Walter and Peter BOTH turn. 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      We ve got a briefing. 
 
And Walter and Peter go with Olivia and Broyles toward their 
  office, attached to the lab, but private, with windows and 
  blinds.  Walter and Peter enter -- but before Olivia and 
  Broyles follow, she says, quietly: 
 
                                  OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      And there s a slight, uh& 
                        gambling debt.  That we ll need to  
                        cover. 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                      No problem. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Not slight. 
                              (then) 
                        Massive. 
 
                                        BROYLES 
                              (re: file) 
                      Solve this one and it s done. 
  113

And he s not joking.  They enter the office   and as heir FIRST 
  REAL BRIEFING BEGINS, we PULL BACK, seeing them in the 
  office&and we.. 
 
                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 
 
  INT. WHITE MODERN CORRIDOR   DAY 
 
  --where are we?  Who are we with?  All we see are the wheels of 
  a GURNEY, being pushed down the sterile corridor.  BOOM UP to 
see that a MAN is pushing it.  And the body is COVERED by a 
  sheet.  Finally the Man stops the gurney -- a hand reached out 
and PULLS BACK THE SHEET. 
 
Lying there is JOHN, bloody.  Dead.  And we see who pulled the 
sheet back: it s NINA CORD.  She looks down at the corpse 
  disapprovingly.  A long pause&then: 
 
                                          NINA 
                      &how long has he been dead? 
 
                                          MAN 
                      Five hours. 
 
  A longer beat, as she stares at the dead man.  Then: 
 
                                          NINA 
                        Question him. 
 
And she walks off.  And in a LONG SHOT of the corridor, the 
  PROMETHEUS LOGO on the wall, our EERIE MUSIC CRESCENDOS and we& 
 
CUT TO BLACK. 
 
                                        THE END
