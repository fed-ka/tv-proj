It s the early 1990 s.  Sarah stands with Brian, who s 
eating from a can of Pringles.  Sarah wears an over-sized 
hoodie, a long, sloppy skirt, and Doc Martens.

SARAH
Oh, do you like acoustics?

BRIAN
You know I do.

Sarah grabs the Pringles can and dumps out the chips.  She 
then hikes up her skirt and squats over the can.  Her face 
becomes focused as we hear the amplified TINKLING of pee.

(CONT D) BRIAN
Rad.

The loud TINKLING starts and stops again and again.  



A crime scene is being taped off at a bank.  Nearby, Jay is 
being interviewed by TV news reporter, GRACE BRADLEY.

GRACE BRADLEY
(into camera)
Joining me now is officer Jay McPherson, 
who used words, not bullets, to convince 
bank robbers to surrender.
(to Jay)
So, how does it feel to be a hero?

JAY
Ah, jeez... Mighty Mouse is a hero, I was 
just doing my job.

GRACE BRADLEY
Modesty.  You won t find that on 
Craigslist.  Tell me, Jay, what does a 
strapping man like you do after a big... 
bust like this--

Grace presses her cleavage in close for Jay to inspect.

JAY
Uh-oh.  I m, um, picking up some signals 
here, and they seem to be of a romantic--
(averting eyes)
Okay, I should explain that I have a 
girlfriend, so your breasts there are 
creating a bit of a--



Brian and Sarah are TOTALLY HIGH, hanging out on the swings.  
Sarah leans out of frame with a joint, then returns into 
frame, exhaling a huge cloud of SMOKE.  

SARAH
Seven, one, eight, five, three, two.

BRIAN
What?

SARAH
I don t know.  I couldn t think of words 
so I said numbers.

BRIAN
I think I got the gist of it.  

They both enjoy this stoner moment.6.



SARAH
Hey, you know who s the most amazing 
person in the world?

BRIAN
Wait, I think I know this one.

SARAH
Stymie.  The cook at Romanski s.  He s so 
kind, and so wise.  He nurtures us with 
each meal he prepares... and we never 
thank him!  We have to thank him, Brian!

BRIAN
Dude, you re just really high.  You won t 
believe all of this once you re sober.

SARAH
Oh, yeah?  Well believe this.

Sarah whips out her cellphone and dials on speaker-phone.

SARAH S OUTGOING MESSAGE (O.S.)
...so leave a message at the beep, or 
don t.  See if I care.

SFX: Voicemail BEEP.

SARAH
(into phone)
Sarah, it s me.  This is really 
important.  You must tell Stymie how much 
he means to you.  Yes, you re completely 
high right now, but believe yourself.  
This is real.

Sarah hangs up.  Brian is chuckling.  

BRIAN
That s goofier than peeing in a Pringles 
can.  



Sarah and Brian are driving by the Valley Village city 
limit, enjoying the view.  Sarah exhales a giant plume of 
smoke as Brian drives.  They spot a sign that reads: 
 WELCOME TO VALLEY VILLAGE, MAYOR ELLISON B. WITTELS 

Brian looks inspired.  Sarah hands him the phone.

BRIAN
I dunno.  Feels kinda gay to call myself.

SARAH
You know what?  It does feel kinda gay to 
make the world a better place, Brian.  
Good thing you re gay.    

Brian nods.  He s sold.  He dials on his cellphone.

BRIAN
Hey, Brian, it s you.  Listen buddy, I 
think I m onto something here...11.




We PAN across: first to the Valley Village welcome sign 
again.  REVEAL it has been sloppily altered to read: 
 VALLEY VILLAGE SMELLS BALLS .  

We then PAN to Brian, next to the sign, beaming with pride.  
We WIDEN to include Sarah, who wears a serious expression.  

SARAH
(proud)
You did it, Brian.

Sarah pulls Brian into an earnest hug.  

BRIAN
We did it.

SARAH
No, weed did it.

END MONTAGE.



Sarah and Brian, now SOBER, approach the SchaarCorp 
  tuxedo. a Brian, gown, a in Sarah s  entrance. headquarters

BRIAN
Sarah, even if we are dressed all 
business-y, SchaarCorp isn t gonna just 
let us walk in there and talk to their 
president.

SARAH
Oh yeah?  What about Ellen Brockovich?  
She was just one person with big tits.  
We re two people with big tits.   

BRIAN
You mean Erin Brockovich.

SARAH
Right, I must have been thinking about 
her sister.  So, you ready?

BRIAN
Wait, remind me again why we re so 
enraged at these guys.

SARAH
Huh.  I m a little fuzzy on the details, 
too.  Let s get our minds correct.


Laura walks down the street alone, in despair.  She stops 
to read a missing pet flyer tacked to a telephone pole, 
then begins to sing.  

LAURA
Lost dog slash friend / He wasn t just a 
dog he was also a friend / He wasn t just 
a dog like yours is...  

INTERCUT BETWEEN LAURA AND JAY:19.




 from cue up  it  wrap the gets podium, the at still Jay,
Grace Bradley, as he continues his apology.

JAY
...to any in the food service industry 
whom I offended, to those currently--

Out of nowhere, Laura steps up to podium and stands proudly 
next to Jay.  She takes the mic.  20.



LAURA
Hello.  I m Laura, and I m Jay s 
girlfriend.  And I just want you all to 
know he s got nothing to apologize for.  
Nocturnal emissions are natural, 
biological, and not reflective of the 
real-world intentions of the dreamer.  A 
nocturnal emission doesn t mean you re in 
love.  It just means you re human.
(then)
Thank you.

Jay wraps Laura in a bear hug.  Laura spots Steve in the 
crowd and gives him a thumbs-up.

ANGLE ON: Grace Bradley and Officer Paul.

GRACE BRADLEY
(to herself, touched)
They are so sweet together.  

PAUL
(opportunistic, to Grace)
You made me cream my sheets, too.

Grace s expression sours.

ANGLE ON: Jay and Laura.  They leave the podium, signaling 
the end of the press conference.  The media disperses.   

JAY
 sorry. so I m Laura,

LAURA
It s okay.  We all have strange thoughts 
in our subconscious.  As long as we don t 
act on them, everything will be fine.

JAY
Oh, dumplin  head, I just want to squeeze 
you till your eyes pop out, then kiss 
those eyes and pop  em back in.

LAURA
That sounds wonderful, Jay.  

They hug mercilessly.  Jay s police radio SQUAWKS.

POLICE RADIO (O.S.)
All units!  Kidnapping in progress!  21.




 Sarah s outside gathered have ONLOOKERS many and Police
apartment, as a tense stand-off develops.  

OFFICER PAUL
(loudly, into megaphone)
Sarah and Brian, we have the apartment 
surrounded!  It is time to surrender!



Brian is looking out the window, then starts pacing.

BRIAN
I don t like my name being yelled over a 
megaphone, especially after I ve 
kidnapped someone.

The SchaarCorp President tries to speak, but is muffled, on 
account of the gag in his mouth.  Sarah takes the gag out.

SARAH
Whaaaaat. 

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
Do you two have any idea how much trouble 
you re in? 

SARAH
Uh, for being right?  Last I checked, 
that wasn t against the law.  

Sarah goes to the window and addresses the crowd below.

(CONT D) SARAH
Listen close, people outside my 
apartment.  SchaarCorp are the dicks 
here, not us.  They make potato chips and 
stuff, and it s like they re putting you 
on a hamster thingy... I mean, a wheel--

BRIAN
(panicking)
You re not explaining it right!

Brian leans out the window to address the confused crowd.

(CONT D) BRIAN
It s like when you have diarrhea... and 
the solution is slavery?

The crowd grows more perplexed.  A SWAT team sets up.22.



SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
sign)  ok  the (gives
No really, guys, you re nailing it.

Sarah and Brian look out the window to see: the crowd of 
onlookers has grown, and now includes Steve and Laura; who 
are holding hands, truly worried for their loved ones.  Jay 
is with Paul and the other police officers. 

JAY 
(on megaphone)
Sarah and Brian!  This is Jay here.  
Guys, look, the sooner you surrender, the 
sooner you get out of prison!  

  out. freaking They re  inside. back duck Sarah and Brian

BRIAN
I don t want to go to prison!  I can t 
shower in front of other guys!  
(ramping up)
I should have never gotten high with you, 
Sarah.  This is not how I get high!

SARAH
Sorry I m not an expert stoner like you!  
All I know is we laid this out perfectly 
to President Douchebag, when we were...

SARAH AND BRIAN
(lightbulb)
...High.

 bong, the grabs Sarah  shrugs. sorry   I m exchange They
 a takes She   IDEAS . reads: that it on label a has which
hit (O.S.), then pokes her head back out the window and 
exhales a huge cloud of smoke.  Now she s confident.

SARAH
Strap in, Brian.  Here we go. 

SWAT rifles are trained on Sarah, who addresses the crowd.    

(CONT D) SARAH
I m about to blind you people with the 
truth, so if you ve got sunglasses, 
better put  em on now!
(spotting someone)
Oh, hey Mrs. Ramsey!  When did you go 
bald?

END OF ACT THREE23.



ACT FOUR



The standoff between Sarah and Brian and the police below 
is at its apex.  Among the onlookers, we see Steve 
comforting Laura.  A freshly STONED Sarah is mid-oration.   

SARAH
People, think about this.  Corporations 
are creating the problem and marketing 
the solutions.  Connect the dots... Leaky 
pens, stain removers and pocket 
protectors.  They ve created a Hamster 
Wheel of Necessity!  

Brian pokes his head through the window.

BRIAN
And we re the hamsters!

SARAH
They sell cold floors, slippery rugs, and 
no-slip pads.  Why don t they just make 
the bottom of the rugs out of no-slip 
pads?  Because then they couldn t sell 
you no-slip pads!  

The crowd starts to MURMUR in agreement.  Some ONLOOKERS 
are getting inspired.  

ONLOOKER
It s true!  They also sell marbles, 
crutches and armpit salve!   

ONLOOKER #2
Yeah, and baseballs, bats, and new 
windows!  

ONLOOKER #3
Sad movies, tears, and tissues! 

ONLOOKER #4 
Jets, airline tickets, and other places!

The crowd is starting to enjoy this.  A MAN turns to a GUY. 

MAN
What s going on here? 

GUY
I don t know.  Everyone s saying three 
things. 24.



MAN
Cool.  Mice, cats, and dogs!
