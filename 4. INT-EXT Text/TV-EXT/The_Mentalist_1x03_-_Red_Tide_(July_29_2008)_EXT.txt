      Early morning in Paradise.  Through a LONG LENS it s a 
      perfect California postcard -- bright blue sky, waves 
      crashing up and down the sand.  Hardly anyone out this early, 
      but a few hardy SURFERS out on the water and --

      Two little GIRLS, 7, at tide s edge.  Droopy drawers and 
      clumsily tied bikini tops.  Eyeing something washed up on the 
      sand, we can t see what.  A jellyfish, maybe, or a horseshoe 
      crab.  Their body language clear -- the Taller Girl daring 
      the Blond Girl to touch it.  Gross!  Don t be a chicken!...

      The Blond Girl reaches out, tentative, to touch --

      A DEAD TEENAGE GIRL.  Yellow swimsuit, thin braids tangled in 
      seaweed.  The little Blond Girl SQUEALS for her mom as a wave 
      washes over the body and we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A memorial service out on the water: A circle of twelve or so 
      TEENAGE SURFERS, leis around their necks, bobbing gently on 
      their surfboards.  Amongst them, featured but not focussed on 
        particularly -- Fit, tan, various shades of blond -- are 
      DALE, 16, HOPE, 15, WIN, 15 and ANDY, 16.  (Several other 
      locals watch the ceremony from the beach, including a few 
      SURFERS, 20 s to 50 s.)  

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby walk down the beach, toward this scene, 
      hot and awkward in their suits --

                                  CHO
                    You had the keys in your hand the 
                    whole time.

                                  JANE
                    Nope.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Van Pelt told you beforehand.  

                                  JANE
                    If I tell you how it s done, the 
                    Magic Circle sends a team of 
                    assassins to kill us all.  It s the 
                    law. 

      They arrive at a MAKESHIFT SHRINE in the sand where people 
      have left flowers, candles, teddy bears, handwritten notes. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (pointing)
                    Her body was discovered right 
                    there.  Coast Guard says that would 
                    indicate she was put in the water 
                    somewhere within a half mile north 
                    of this spot and between five 
                    hundred and a thousand yards out 
                    from shore.  Any further along the 
                    coast or out to sea, the current 
                    would have taken her to Mexico.  

                                  JANE
                    How long was she in the water?

                    We re waiting on the coroner to 
                    tell us that.

      The mourning surfers toss their leis in the center of the 
      circle, then they start paddling toward the beach.

      Jane s gaze rakes the beach.  He zeroes in on one of the 
      spectators on the sand.  A surfer, 30's, more like a BEACH 
      BUM.  Stringy braids, unkempt; he seems very upset, pacing 
      and muttering to himself.  Jane starts to move toward the 
      bum, but Hope comes out of the water and tentatively 
      approaches the CBI trio.  Her friend Win kinda scootches up 
      behind her, drawing closer as the conversation continues.  
      Dale and Andy walk away, up the beach with their boards.

                                  HOPE
                    Hey.  Excuse me.  Are you guys 
                    cops?

      Hope turns toward Win.

                    They are cops.

                    thought you were like, men in 
                    suits.  So is it true what they re

                                  JANE
                    It s true.

      Hope and Win are appalled.

                    Duh.  Of course not.  They didn t 
                    ask that.  They asked who she was 
                    hooking up with.  Which would be 
                    Dale.  It s not a big dark secret.

      Rigsby hands Hope his pad and pen.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt emerge.  Lisbon shoves her folder of 
      notes in her bag, more angrily than she meant to.  Papers fly 
      out.  Lisbon curses as she picks them up.

      jammed in the sand behind them.  Jane ambles along, now 
      shirtless with pantlegs rolled up... Grabs a surfboard, puts

      Amidst other surfers (including, we will later realize, the 
      Beach Bum) and other beachgoers, Jane trots out toward the 
      water, the board slung under his arm with casual style.  As 
      he prepares to leap into the surf --


      An ancient trailer in the back row.  From deep inside the 
      dark interior we HEAR the muffled sound of sinister THRASH 
      METAL MUSIC, cranked high.   

      Lisbon and Rigsby cautiously approach.  No guns drawn, but 
      definitely ready for trouble.

      She steps forward and BANGS on the door with authority.

      Makes Jame Gumb s basement look very done, very Hamptons 
      WASP.   The music is BANGING now.  Tension is high.  They

                    He left a while before.  When the

                                  HOPE
                    Because, Dale asked her to come 
                    home with him and she said no.

      Jane looks to Dale who confirms with a nod.

                    You and Chris were lovers weren t

                    You made love.  You were lovers.

      The other kids are amused by Dale s discomfort.

                                  DALE
                    It was no big deal.  We re all

                    Hope too, sometimes.  Doesn t mean

                    Ever hear of a guy named Pops?

      Dale freezes for a micro-second before shaking his head.

                                  DALE
                    Pops?  No.

      On Jane, clocking the freeze.

      Lisbon and Jane walking back toward the gates.

                     Hooking up.   Times keep changing,

                    Yes, they do.


      It will be a multi-million-dollar condo development on prime 
      oceanfront, right now it s just a big clearing.  Waves CRASH 
      as trucks and equipment ROAR, ready to break ground.  A large 
      TROUGH of rainwater.  Heavy chain-link fence all around, No 
      Trespassing SIGNS.

      A CEMENT TRUCK dumps a gooey load of cement down its chute 
      into a TRENCH, filling it up.

      AT THE GATE, Lisbon and Jane are led in by project manager 
      KYLE RAYBURN, 40, who s grumbling --

                                    RAYBURN
                    How long ya gonna be, do you think?

                    Christine Tanner s murder may have 
                    occurred here, Mr. Rayburn.  It

                    I already got the developer way up 
                    my tail-pipe -- we re three weeks 
                    behind thanks to the crappy labor 
                    pool here.

      He and the Cement Truck Driver exchange a glare --

                    An economy like this and people

                    Boggles my mind.

      Jane clocks the remnants of a BONFIRE nearby, a circle of 
      stones and charred wood.  Lisbon looks at the waves crashing.  
      Gorgeous.

                                    RAYBURN
                    Just this week, the night guard.  
                    Walked off the job.  Cement trucks 
                    show up in the morning, they can t 
                    get on the freaking site.  That 
                    alone put me back six hours.

      Lisbon and Jane exchange a glance.  Jane starts to look 
      around more intently.

                                  JANE

                    What s his name, the night guard?

                                    RAYBURN
                    Eddy Garcia.  I got his paperwork

                    Right.  So you think he might have 
                    done this murder?

                    this.

      Lisbon turns --

      Jane is crouched to study a new cement floor.  Lisbon comes 
      over and bends low like Jane.  

                                  LISBON
                    It s cement.  What.

                    You have to let the light hit it 
                    right. 

      She sees what he sees.

                                  LISBON
                    Oh yes.

                    Mr. Rayburn?

      Rayburn comes over and grudgingly bends down to look at the 
      cement floor in the same way.  

      RAYBURN S POV - When the light hits the cement right, out in 
      the middle of the floor, you can see a little pink bump, an 
        imperfection in the smooth surface.  

                                  JANE
                    See that?

                                    RAYBURN
                    What is it?

                                  JANE
                    The tip of Eddy Garcia s nose.

                                    RAYBURN
                    Get outta here.

      Rayburn walks over to the bump, bends down and touches it,  
      screams and falls on his ass. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      The body of Eddy Garcia, encased in a shroud of cement, is 
      lifted by four strong men into the back of the coroner s 
      wagon. 

      Lisbon and Jane talk with Rayburn. 

                                  LISBON
                    How is it you don t notice a nose

                    What the hell is going on here?

      DANE MERRICK - a large rich man - emerges from a black merc 
      that seemed to creep up unseen like a cat.  From the car 
      stereo comes the FAINT THUMP of clearable ROCKABILLY music.  
      Merrick sees Garcia s body.

                                    MERRICK (CONT D)

                    We think so.

      Merrick sighs wearily, pinches his nose.  

                                    MERRICK
                    God help me.  If it s not one 
                    thing...

      He turns on his heel and walks back to his car.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Merrick, Dane Merrick?

      Merrick pauses impatiently, eyeing Jane and Lisbon.

                                    MERRICK
                    OSHA right?  Talk to my lawyers.

                    My son has a lot of friends.    
                    Is this an interrogation?

                            (admonishing look to Jane)
                    No, Mr. Merrick, it s not.  Thank 
                    you for your cooperation.  We may 
                    be in touch later. 

      Merrick tamps down his irritation.

                                    MERRICK
                      I understand you have a job to do.  
                    Please do it as quickly as you can.   

      Merrick goes to his car.  Jane watches him go.  Waits til 
      Merrick is opening the car door...

                                  JANE
                    Hey, Pops.

      Merrick turns automatically.

                    I hear you re good in bed.  What s 
                    the secret?

      Merrick takes a half beat too long to reply, and Jane is now 
      certain he s right.

                                    MERRICK
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about, but you mean to be offensive 
                    I guess.  And you ve succeeded very 
                    well.  I m going to be taking this

      Jane lets that hang, forcing Merrick to step toward him, or 
      risk appearing to back off.

      Merrick stalks over to Jane, gets in his face.

                    eye and tell the truth, you filthy 
                    old goat.   

      Merrick punches Jane on the nose.  Jane goes down like timber 
      and Merrick goes to follow up with a good kick...

      Two UNIS launch on Merrick.  Roaring with anger, he is 
      wrestled to the ground.  Jane crawls onto a cement bag, 
      holding his bleeding nose.  Lisbon watches balefully. 


      (Note:  It s not clear which of the nearby buildings is CBI 
      HQ.)  Jane leans against the CBI sedan, waiting on Lisbon. 
      Dane Merrick walks to a limo with his FANCY LAWYER, enjoying 
      the taste of freedom.  Merrick sees Jane, tells the Lawyer to 
      wait and comes over.

                                    MERRICK
                    Just so you know, I m going sue the

      FADE IN:


      Spooky shadows, the wind wailing.  Dale, Hope, Win and Andy 
      approach the chain-link fence.  Dale in the lead, as usual.  
      Hope, timid, tightly clutching Andy s hand.  The gate is 
      ajar.

      He s right behind them.  The kids jump.  Lisbon joins them 
      from the shadows.

                    murkier and murkier.  Maybe the 
                    guard stumbled across Chris being 
                    killed.  Or maybe it s a love 
                      triangle...

                    No matter who it might be?  What if 
                    the killer is a relative, or a

                    We knew.  We all knew.

      Dale slumps, head in hand, tacitly assenting.  The shameful

      He leads them toward the gate.  There s some kind of light 
      ahead, flickering.  They go through...


      A giant BONFIRE burns, flames licking at the dark.  The CRASH 
      of the surf on the beach.  It s spooky.

                    Who knows?  Maybe something Chris 
                    said.  Maybe a glimpse of somebody 
                    up on the bluff there.  The 
                    smallest thing you recall might be 
                    a vital clue.

                                  ANDY
                    I don t want you messing inside my 
                    head.  No offense.

                                  JANE
                    That s the thing with hypnosis.  
                    I can t mesmerize you against your 
                    will.  It s not possible.  You re 
                    in control the whole time.
                          (a pleading smile)
                    What do you say?  

                                  LISBON
                    Christine really needs your help.

      Off the kids, what else can they do but...


      The kids now sit on a log near the crackling flames.  Jane 
      stalks among them.  Lisbon watches, getting a sense of the 
      showman Jane once was.  CU on Jane s fingers tapping his leg 
      in rhythm, establishing an  anchor  for the kids... He walks 
      behind them slowly --

                                  JANE
                    Close your eyes... Listen, listen 
                    only to my voice... And think of 
                    that night... the bonfire... the 
                    sound of the ocean... The sound of 
                    the ocean.  

      The kids fall into varying degrees of trance.  Andy resists, 
      but Hope is completely under, it seems.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you will recall 
                    of that night, but you will recall 
                    something because it s all there in 
                    your memory and all you have to do 
                    is go back to that night and be 
                    there, and there you are.  

                                  HOPE
                    Aaah!



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     42.

      The others jump out of their trance states.

                                  JANE
                    What is it, Hope?  What do you see?

      Hope, eyes wide open, is still inside her memory.  She points 
      to the bluff.

                                  HOPE
                    I see, I see Dale s father.  There. 
                    By that wall.  

                                  DALE
                    No you don t.

                                  JANE
                    Shhh.  What is he doing, Hope?

                                  HOPE
                    Staring at us.  At Chris.  That s 
                    all.  Staring.  What s wrong with 
                    him?

      Jane touches her shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    Come back now, Hope.

      Hope shakes off the trance state, looks confused.

                                  HOPE
                    What?  What happened?

                                  JANE
                    You re okay.  Well done.

                                  WIN
                    Whoa.  You really saw Dale s dad?

                                  DALE
                    No you didn t.  You didn t.

                                  HOPE
                    Dale, I did.  I m sorry, I can t 
                    help what I saw.

                                  DALE
                    My dad didn t kill Christine!

                    How do you know he didn t?

      Dale splutters, lost for something to say.

                                  DALE
                    Screw all of you guys.

      He stomps away into the darkness beyond the circle of bonfire 
      light.

                                  DALE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    You suck!

      Hope is distraught.  Runs after Dale.

                                  HOPE
                    Dale, wait.  Don t be mad...

      She disappears into the darkness.

                                  HOPE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Wait...

      Leaving Andy and Win and Jane looking at each other.

                                  WIN
                    Dale s mad.  We should go.

                    Eff Dale.  His dad killed 
                      Christine.

      Win glares at Andy.

                                  WIN
                    Yeah, well, it s late anyway.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks for your help boys. 

                                  ANDY
                    No problemo.

      Win walks off into the dark.  Andy scrambling to catch up.  
      Jane and Lisbon are left alone with the ocean and stars and 
      crackling fire.  

                                  LISBON
                    Very cunning.  Now what?

                    Sometimes intense pressure 
                      solidifies a diamond, and sometimes 
                    it just smashes the rock into tiny 
                    pieces. 

                                  LISBON
                    You could have just said,  Now we 
                    wait. 

      Jane smiles with contentment.


      The bonfire... Christine and the others a little loopy, 
      laughing...

      And Eddy Garcia emerges out of the dark.  Angry, yelling.  
      The kids react, scared.

                                  HOPE (V.O.)
                    The guard told us to get out or 
                    he d call the cops.  Dale told him 
                    to step off, his dad owns the 
                    place...

      Dale steps forward, drunk from booze and being 17 and 
      immortal.  An argument, Garcia grabs Dale s shoulder, Dale 
      breaks free, punches Garcia across the jaw with his fist.  
      Garcia goes down --

      A wet THWACK as Garcia s head hits the bulldozer blade.  
      Garcia doesn t move.  A beat and Christine runs to check 
      Garcia.  Starts to cry.  Off Dale, realizing what he s done --

      END FLASHBACK


      Dale still stands over the dead guard.  As the others beg and 
      plead with her not to, Christine takes out her phone and 
      starts dialing.  No way is she going to let a killing be 
      covered up.  Not by anyone for any reason. 

                                  HOPE (V.O.)

                    It was just washing away, because 
                    Chris has to do the right thing.

      Dale has a shovel in his hands as he argues with the 
      implacable Chris.

      END FLASHBACK


      Dale standing over the body of the Guard as before.  He and 
      the others trying to persuade Chris to put away her phone.  

                                  DALE
                    ...I killed the guard all right.  I 
                    did that. It was an accident.  Then 
                    Chris says she s going to call the 
                    police.  We can t cover it up she 
                    says.  It s wrong.   And Hope, I 
                    don t know, Hope just went crazy.  
                    Killed her.   

      Hope snatches the shovel from Dale and with a mighty swing 
      hits Chris over the head.

      Hope s in charge, yelling at the boys and getting them to 
      help drag Christine to the ditch.  

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    Hope made all of you take part, 
                    to make all of you equally guilty.  
                    So that no one remained innocent to 
                    go tell on the others. 

      All four kids hold a feebly struggling Christine down in the 
      ditch-water until she stops moving.
