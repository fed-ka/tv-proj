  FADE FROM WHITE to a bank of STADIUM LIGHTS. In another ONE- 
  SHOT scene, we SWOOP DOWN, SkyCam-style, over the action of 
  a high school football game. The ball is snapped. Shoulder 
  pads crunch. A hole opens. A RUNNING BACK bursts through the 
  line, racing for a touchdown for the Waverly Tigers.

  As the crowd roars, we VEER off the running back, GLIDE over 
  a squad of impossibly buoyant cheerleaders, and into the 
  stands past cheering students, parents and faculty, until we 
  reach --


  THE MARCHING BAND

  playing a VICTORY SONG. We MOVE DOWN a row of the colorfully 
  dressed band to the very end, to find a bored bass drummer 
  named TOM, 17, wearing a headpiece with an ostrich feather.

  TILT UP to two STONERS standing behind a rail.

                                        STONER
                      You guys play any Foo Fighters?

  BACK to Tom, used to this sort of abuse. He keeps playing, 
  face expressionless, eyes front. One stoner leans over the 
  rail and snaps Tom s feather in half, so it flops down.

                                          STONER(cont'd)
                        Oops, I think you need a new 
                        feather.

  They crack up, but Tom doesn t react. The other stoner leans 
  over and dumps beer onto Tom s headpiece. The stoners laugh 
    hysterically. Tom never even flinches. FREEZE and WHOOSH to 
  the wet face of the unflappable drummer. The words appear:

                                      The Killer

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.



  FADE FROM BLACK to a nighttime sky full of stars. TILT DOWN 
  to a 1985 Camaro with mismatched body panels pulling up to a 
  modest two-story house in the San Fernando Valley. Two 
  patrol cars sit outside, light bars spinning a kaleidoscope 
  of colors. NEIGHBORS mill on the sidewalk to see what s up.

  The Camaro stops and a sexy woman, mid-30s, exits in stone- 
  wash jeans. Her lipstick is a touch too red, her roots are 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

  showing, and her tight-fitting NASCAR T-shirt makes no 
  secret of her flat chest. But she s proud of her look. It s 
  the closest thing she has to heritage.

  This is LAPD Detective ANGIE SNOW. She puts on a  LAPD 
  Homicide  cap and pulls a business jacket over her 
  shoulders.


  IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

  Snow steps through the milling neighbors, some of whom are 
  standing on the lawn. She pulls a DIGITAL CAMERA from her 
  coat pocket and turns back to face the onlookers.

                                        SNOW
                        Smile for the camera, please.

  She snaps FLASH photos of the surprised crowd, then gets the 
  attention of two UNIFORM OFFICERS, who are quietly talking.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      Hey guys. Keep  em off the grass, 
                        okay?

                                        UNIFORM OFFICER
                        Sorry, detective. Didn t know this 
                      was part of the crime scene.

                                        SNOW
                        It s not. It s just nice grass.

  As Snow heads up the walk, the officers move back the crowd.



  An ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER leads the muzzled Presa Canario 
  down the front walk. The scene has expanded to include a 
  coroner s truck, two more patrol cars, and a larger crowd of 
  neighbors. None of them stand on the grass. PUSH INTO the 
  upstairs bedroom window until we are --



  CLOSE on Tom, headpiece wet and feather dangling, banging 
  his bass drum. The band marches out of the stadium after the 
  game, 80 pairs of feet tapping the pavement in unison to the 
  hypnotic beat. Behind them, football players shake hands on 
  the field and the crowd files out.



  A beater car, dented and mottled with a grey undercoat, 
  pulls to a stop in front of the park. The rattling engine 
  stops.



  Mrs. Martin, who has now changed into her sexy nightgown, 
  drags the unwilling Presa Canario into the backyard.



  An old Chevy panel van, black and beat up, pulls to a stop 
  in front of the Martin house. The van door opens, revealing 
  red fur on the inside panel, and a 19-year-old Russian buck 
  named ARMAN POZNER steps out.

  He closes the van door with an eager smile. As he walks INTO 
  CAMERA, his wildly oversized belt buckle gets bigger and 
  bigger, until it finally fills the screen, and we SMASH TO 
  --



  Tom and Willie walk down the street. Up ahead, Willie sees 
  the black van.

                                        WILLIE
                      Yo, check out this ride. Stylish.

                        Shag carpet. It s like the Mystery 
                        Machine of love.

  But Tom isn t listening. He s staring at Mr. Martin s house.

                                        TOM
                        This house looks good. We ll hit 
                        this one tonight.

  As Tom grimly pulls on his white band gloves --

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

                                        ACT TWO


  FADE IN:



  Tom and Willie run up to the car, out of breath. Willie is 
  pumped, laughing, high with adrenaline.

                                        WILLIE

  But Tom, taking off his white gloves, seems disappointed.

                                          WILLIE(cont'd)
                        C mon, let s get stoned now. I know 
                        a guy who sells the chronic.

                                        TOM
                      Not for me. That s a wrap.

  Tom puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking away.

                                        WILLIE
                        What are you doing?

                                        TOM
                      My apartment s only a few blocks 
                        away.

                                        WILLIE
                        You re going home? Dude. For 
                        someone who likes to live on the 
                        edge, you can be a total buzzkill.

  STAY with Tom walking off as Willie gets in his car and 
  drives away. Tom turns around to make sure he s gone, then 
  abruptly changes direction and heads back toward Mr. 
  Martin s house.

                                        CORONER (O.S.)
                      We got blunt-force trauma to the 
                        head. Contusions around the neck...



  A gable vent on the backside of the house pops out. Tom s 
  head peers through. Seeing it s clear, he climbs out with 
  his backpack and then sets the vent back into place.

  Tom scuttles up the roof and peeks over to see the flashing 
  lights of police and emergency vehicles. We FADE TO BLACK --



  Tom scrambles down the roof toward the backyard. He stops 
  and glances down, measuring his chances of a successful 
  jump. There s grass to land on but he has to clear a 
  concrete patio.



  The side door opens and Lucas steps out with the two uniform 
  officers we established out front in the teaser.

                                        LUCAS
                        ...look everywhere. Widen the 
                        perimeter to include neighbors  
                        yards.



  Tom gathers his courage -- and leaps outward, barely 
  clearing the pavers. He hits the grass, rolls, and runs into 
  a dark hedge. After a beat, an officer enters the yard to 
  search.



  PICK UP Snow and Vega walking out the front door.

                                        VEGA
                      The attic s clear, he s gone. 
                        Escaped through a gable vent. I 
                        sent a couple of SID guys up there 
                      to gather evidence.

  They stop on the porch when Lucas joins them from out front.

                                        LUCAS
                      We conducted a thorough search of 
                      the surrounding area. Nothing.

                                        SNOW
                      We screwed up. The offender was in 
                      the house while we were 
                        investigating.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                      Not in the house, in the attic. 
                        Don t be so hard on yourself. He 
                      was probably trapped in the bedroom 
                      and climbed up there before we 
                        came.

                                        SNOW
                        Why d he wait so long to escape? He 
                        waited so long he couldn t hold his 
                        bladder.

                                        LUCAS
                      He just took a human life. Maybe he 
                      was too scared to move.

  Snow turns to scan the faces of the milling crowd, which has 
  grown substantially.

  CAMERA ROAMS to find brooding men, a group of stoned teens, 
  Latino youth -- all possible suspects. She reaches into her 
  jacket and takes out her digital camera.


  ON THE SIDEWALK

  FIND Tom in the middle of the onlookers, backpack over his 
  shoulder, watching the police. As Snow raises her camera, 
  Tom turns away in SLOW MOTION and fades into the night, as

  ON THE PORCH

  Snow snaps a photo or two. She turns to Vega.

                        When they re done in the attic, go 
                        ahead and release the crime scene. 
                        I have to stop by the house and 
                        check on my kid.

  We LAND on a two-bedroom starter house in Panorama City. The 
  poor part. Snow pulls into the driveway in her Camaro.



  Her son MANNY, 16, reclines on a tattered couch, feeling up 
  a shirtless girl named CRYSTAL. He reacts with mild 
  surprise.

                                        MANNY

                                (before she can 
                                  answer)
                        Never mind. Go inside and get 
                        dressed.

  Crystal heads into the house. Snow pulls a LAPD-issue 
    breathalyzer from her purse and hands it to Manny.

  Manny gets up off the couch. Snow puts her arm around him.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      Are you and Crystal having sex?

                                        MANNY
                      No.

                                        SNOW
                      You better not be lying, because 
                        I ll polygraph your ass.

  And she means it. As they disappear into the house --



  The sun rises over downtown.



  Tom skateboards down a grungy alley, lined with trash cans 
  and dumpsters. Seeing what he s looking for, Tom hops off 
  his board and picks it up.

  Checking to make sure no one is watching, Tom steps behind a 
  dumpster, unzips his backpack, and pulls out the pillowcase 
  containing the murder weapon. He drops the bundle into the 
  empty dumpster and closes the lid.



  Establish the modern cinder-block and steel building.                                                                                    36.



  Tom and Willie carve walls and grind rails on their boards. 
  Willie has fun, but Tom is tense, working out his 
  aggression. Abruptly, Tom WIPES OUT, taking a bad fall. 
  Willie walks up.

                                        WILLIE
                        Dude. Loserific.

                      I m okay. Thanks for asking.

  Willie sits down next to him.

                                        WILLIE
                      So what s the plan tonight?

                        Point well taken. We ll party with 
                      the band, but we go Creeping 
                        afterward. We never hit any houses 
                      on Mulholland.

                        I lost my gloves last night.

                        I don t know if I ever told you

                        Better than leaving fingerprints.

                                        WILLIE
                        I don t care about fingerprints. 
                        We re minors. What re they going to 
                      do if they catch us?

  As Tom ponders that very real question --



  A stunning patio overlooks the Valley below, with the sun 
  fading in an orange sky. FIND Tom and Willie entering the 
  crowded patio. Instead of partyers, they find clusters of 
  tearful BAND MEMBERS, half of them wearing band jackets, 
  talking quietly with hung heads, comforting each other.

                                        WILLIE
                        Very festive.

  Tom turns to a nearby BAND MEMBER.

                                        TOM
                        What s going on?

                      You didn t hear? Mr. Martin s dead. 
                      He was killed last night.

  Tom turns back to Willie.

                                        WILLIE
                        What d he say? Who s dead?

                      The singing scientist? Tragic.
                                  looks around)(
                      So where s the keg?

  Willie splits off to find the keg. Tom looks around, dazed. 
  Nearby, a girl sobs in the arms of another girl. For the 
  first time, Tom sees the hole he left behind in taking a 
  life.

  He walks to a railing overlooking the city and stares out at 
  the orange sky. Kristi, looking sexy, joins his side.

                                        KRISTI
                      Hey Tom. I m glad you came.

                                        TOM
                      Hi Kristi.

                        Isn t it weird? About Mr. Martin?

                                        TOM
                        Yeah. I can t believe what 
                        happened.

                                        KRISTI
                        I heard his head was crushed.

  Tom looks away to hide the guilt.

                                          KRISTI(cont'd)
                      Did you know Mr. Martin sang in 
                        high school choir? Nobody gets it 
                        worse than the choir queers. He 
                        once told me he was the biggest 
                        queer of all. Not gay, just... 
                        different. I think that s why he 
                        became a teacher. Singing in class. 
                        Just to let everyone know it s 
                        okay.

  It finally hits Tom. What he did. The life he ended. He 
  starts to cry. Kristi mistakes his tears for grief.

                                          KRISTI(cont'd)
                        Hey... it s okay.

  She reaches out and puts her arms around him. Tom wraps his 
  arms around her and they hold onto each other.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                        want him to be alive.

  Kristi s hands find Tom s face and bring it down to hers. 
  She kisses his cheek. His lips. Emotions yield to hormones, 
  and he kisses her back. As they start to make out in that 
  hungry teenage way --

  FADE IN:



  A miserable Willie sits near the keg with a beer in his 
  hand, cornered by a PLAIN GIRL, who s all smiles and 
  giggles.

                                        PLAIN GIRL

                      We totally jam on that song. I can

                        horn. You wanna know what that 
                        makes me? Bisectional.

  She laughs like there s nothing funnier. Willie spots Tom 
  filling two beers at the keg and hurries over to him.

                                        WILLIE

                        long to talk to her. We re going

  Tom eagerly walks off with two beers, leaving Willie 
  hanging.


  ACROSS THE PATIO

  Snow and Lucas enter from the house and look around. The 
  party is rocking now that alcohol is flowing. They pass two 
  DRUNK GIRLS singing to the tune of  My Sharona  by The 
  Knack, while the big-bellied tuba player accompanies them --

                        Whose party is this?

  The band member points to Kristi sitting alone in a corner. 
  Snow and Lucas watch Tom sit down and hand her a beer. The 
  detectives walk over to the couple, who are talking quietly.

                                        SNOW
                        Excuse me, is this your party?

  Tom drops his head. Tries to hide his anxiety. Snow takes 
  note of his behavior, while Lucas looks down at his notes.

  She points to the beefy tuba player. Tom nearly faints in 
  relief. Snow keeps her eye on him.

  Snow senses something up with this kid.

                        Well, we re conducting interviews 
                      on campus tomorrow. If you hear 
                        anything, stop by.

  Tom nods his head. He will. Snow and Lucas walk way. Kristi 
  slips her arm around Tom and nuzzles him, as Tom watches the 
  detectives start questioning the tuba player.



  The marching band practices on the field, with their 
  DIRECTOR on a high ladder. Tom marches with the 
  percussionists. The band is the picture of synchronicity.                                                                                    48.


  MOMENTS LATER

  Everyone splits apart for a break. As Tom removes his heavy 
  drum, Kristi bounds up to him, cute and flirty.

                                        KRISTI
                        Hey.

                                        TOM
                        Hey.

                                        KRISTI
                        I wish I could see you tonight.

                                        TOM
                        Let s hook up.

                                        KRISTI
                        I said I wish I could. My dad only 
                        lets me out on weekends. I can t 
                        wait.

  She kisses him and sashays away. Tom watches her go. Damn, 
  she s sexy. Tom hears his name from a distance. He looks 
  over to the stands to see Willie frantically waving him 
  over.


  THE STANDS - MOMENTS LATER

  CLOSE on a newspaper with a front-page PHOTO of the Martin 
  house. The headline reads: SINGING SCIENTIST MURDERED IN 
  BED.

  Willie and Tom stand over the paper by the stands.

                                        WILLIE
                        Look familiar? It s Martin s house. 
                      We were there the night he was 
                        killed! Remember that black van? 
                      The Russian guy? He was probably 
                      the killer!

                                        TOM
                        This isn t the place to talk about 
                        this.

                                        WILLIE
                      Why not? Everyone else is. The cops 
                      are here looking for witnesses. We 
                        could be, like, the key to the 
                        whole --


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  Abruptly, Willie finds two hands on his chest, driving him 
  under the shadows of the bleachers, where nobody can see.

                                        TOM
                        Residential burglary is a felony, 
                        Willie. You re not talking to them.

                                        WILLIE
                        Yeah, but we could catch a killer, 
                        dude.

  Tom spins Willie to the ground, awkwardly falling on top of 
  him. It s not like Tom knows how to fight, but he knows 
  enough to put a knee on Willie s neck. Willie can t breath. 
  He clutches at Tom, panicking, flailing his arms.

                                        TOM
                        I will not go to jail for you. Do 
                      you understand me?Do you?

  The fear in Willie s eyes says yes. Tom climbs off Willie, 
  leaving him gasping for breath, and starts walking away.

                                        WILLIE
                        What s the matter with you? There s 
                        a psycho out there! There might 
                        even be a reward!

  CLOSE on Tom walking away, realizing Willie is a wild card.



  Tom stands in the now full dumpster, digging for the murder 
  weapon. His terrier eats a food scrap he tosses out. After a                                                                                     52.
  CONTINUED:

  beat, Tom comes up with the pillowcase containing the 
  trophy.
  As he zips the trophy into his backpack, a STORE OWNER comes 
  out a back door and starts yelling. Tom jumps onto his 
  skateboard and takes off with his dog running behind.



  Snow s Camaro parked in the driveway.



  In a MUSICAL MONTAGE, an MTA Orange Line BUS cuts through 
  the heart of the Valley. DIP TO BLACK.



  Tom, wearing white band gloves now, pulls out a hidden key 
  on the front porch and quietly unlocks the door. DIP TO 
  BLACK.                                                                                    56.



  The front door opens. Willie s MOTHER answers. REVEAL Snow 
  and Vega, with Lucas and two UNIFORM OFFICERS behind them. 
  Snow presents the woman with a search warrant. DIP TO BLACK.



  FADE FROM WHITE to Tom marching on field in formation. The 
  band is practicing the Waverly High School VICTORY SONG. Up 
  in the stands, Willie sits on a bleacher playing Gameboy.

  From the field, Tom watches Snow and Vega approach Willie 
  and say something. Tom can t hear what, but from his vantage 
  point he sees two uniform officers closing in from the other 
  side, forming a net around his increasingly agitated friend.

  Suddenly, Willie makes a break for it. Tom watches the cops 
  roughly take down Willie and handcuff him. As Willie is led 
  away, Tom returns his eyes front, playing his victory song 
  with the same impassive expression he had in the teaser.



  A vertical light tree counts down. When it reaches green, a 
  tricked out Acura and old-school Mustang GTO both PEEL OUT. 
  A quick-cut SERIES OF RACING IMAGES establish a drag event 
  taking place. Working-class FANS gather in bleachers at the 
  weekly race, which pits novice drag racers against each 
  other for a nominal entrance fee.

  Manny, wearing a race-approved Snell helmet, sits inside his 
  mom s Camaro, waiting for his turn. It s loud. Engines REV. 
  Snow, dressed like a cool biker chick, leans into the window 
  to give her son a pep talk.

                                        SNOW
                        This is what we did for fun when I 
                      was your age. Better than a 
                        videogame, huh?

                                        MANNY
                        Yeah.

                                        SNOW
                      Of course, it wasn t sanctioned 
                        back then. Fact, this is how your 
                      dad got his first misdemeanor. 
                        After he wrapped his super-charged 
                        Nova around a light pole. But 
                        you re gonna do great! Have fun!

  A RACE OFFICIAL waves for Manny to pull forward. Snow slaps 
  the roof of the car and gives her son a holler.                                                                                    59.


  IN THE STANDS

  Snow moves down a bleacher, past some real REDNECK TYPES, 
  until she finds Lucas eating popcorn. She excitedly sits.

                                        SNOW
                        Manny s next!

                                        LUCAS
                      Are you sure this is what you want 
                        your son to get involved with? I 
                      see a lot of questionable 
                        characters in this crowd.

                                        SNOW
                        They just have a different sense of 
                        style. Don t be fooled by the 
                        window dressing.

  Lucas glances at a huge HARLEY GUY next to him with a fuzzy 
  beard and Hell s Angels jacket. Lucas turns back to Snow.

                                        LUCAS
                        Okay.

                                        SNOW
                      If you came to my house, you could 
                        judge me by what you saw, but you d 
                        totally miss who I am.

                                        LUCAS
                        Like a crime scene. Sometimes the 
                        best clues are the ones that aren t 
                        there.

                                        SNOW
                        That s right...
                                  sudden realization)(
                        Like a dog that didn t bark.

                                        LUCAS
                        Excuse me?

  Snow fervently turns to Lucas.

                                        SNOW
                        Mrs. Martin said her husband s 
                        yelling woke her up -- why didn t 
                      the dog wake her? It was in the 
                        house. It barks at everyone.

  They hear the REV OF ENGINES and turn to see Manny s Camaro 
  at the line, next to a custom Civic, chopped down and beefed 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    60.
  CONTINUED:

  up. The Tree counts down. Snow and Lucas cheer from the 
  stands.
  At green, both cars LEAP FORWARD. The Civic gets the jump, 
  but the American muscle of the Camaro kicks in and overtakes 
  the rice burner to win the race.

  In the stands, Snow jumps up and down, clapping and shouting 
  with Lucas. Amid her wild celebration, Snow yells to Lucas 
  --

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                      Why didn t the dog bark at the 
                        killer?



  A terrier joyfully runs across a field. The dog chases a 
  tennis ball, bounds back, and drops it by a pair of feet. 
  TILT UP to a somber Tom. He throws the ball to his dog.

  The terrier sprints away, but this time another dog joins 
  the chase. It s bigger and faster -- the Presa Canario. It 
  beats the smaller terrier and runs the ball back to Tom.

                                        TOM
                      Hey Skipper. How you been doing?

  Tom scratches behind Skipper s ear, just like he likes.

                                        SNOW (O.S.)
                        That dog likes you.

  Tom turns to see Snow and Vega walking up. Across the field, 
  Mrs. Martin calls for Skipper. Snow gives her a wave to say 
  thanks. Snow steps up to Tom. Vega hangs back.

                                        SNOW
                        I had a feeling. Just wanted to 
                        make sure. See, I was wondering why 
                        Skipper there didn t bark at the 
                        killer, then I remembered that you 
                      and Mr. Martin ran your dogs 
                        together.

  She hands Tom a PHOTO. He looks at the crowd picture she 
  took at the crime scene, blown up. It shows the back of Tom 
  walking away from the murder, backpack over his shoulder.

                                          SNOW(cont'd)
                        I printed that up at home. Pretty 
                        good quality, huh? See how you can 
                        make out the skateboard patches on 
                      the backpack.

  Tom looks down at his backpack by his feet. It s the same 
  one in the photo. Tom looks up, across the field, and sees 
  two UNIFORM OFFICERS spread out, just like they did for 
  Willie.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    62.

                      So you want to tell me how it 
                        happened, Tom? Why d you kill Mr. 
                        Martin?

  SLOWLY PUSH IN on Tom. The world closing in. Tighter and 
  tighter. Tom s face appears beyond hope.

                                        TOM
                      He found my backpack.

  The park behind Tom SWIRLS INTO a green chalkboard. We re --



  Mrs. Martin, with the Presa Canario, pays stoic respect at 
  her husband s burial site. As she lays flowers on the grave 
  marker, DISSOLVE TO --



  The Waverly Marching Tigers in full uniform. They practice
