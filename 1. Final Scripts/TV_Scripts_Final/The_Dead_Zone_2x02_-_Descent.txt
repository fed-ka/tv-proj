  11EXT. CLEAVES MILLS - NIGHT

          WALT and SARAH walk home after seeing a movie. It's a
          rainy, romantic evening. Both seem bound and determined
          to enjoy a rare date night.

                                        SARAH
                                (not at all convincing)
                        That was good.

                                        WALT
                                (not convinced)
                        O-kay.

                                        SARAH
                        What?  I liked it.  It won't be
                        winning Oscars, but it was a
                          diverting hour and a half.  

                                        WALT
                        We could've seen that Italian
                        film.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh no.  Two hours of trying to
                        read dark subtitles on a dark
                          background?  I hate that.

                                        WALT
                          Actually, I'm the one who hates
                        that.

                                        SARAH
                        Fine.  Next time, it's an Ingmar
                        Bergman double feature for you.

          They walk along in silence for a moment, but there's
          tension.  Walt senses something's wrong but he can't put
          his finger on it... but it's been out there for a few
          weeks now, that feeling... he's embarrassed, even afraid
          to bring it up but he has to...

                                        WALT
                        You gonna tell me what's going
                        on?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - TEASER - 10/11/02 PINK            2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing's going on.

                                        WALT
                        You pick a movie starring The
                        Rock for us to go to and you don't
                        think something's going on...

          He stops and looks at her and then away... studying lights
          of the village... this isn't easy for him...

                                        WALT
                        Or the dozens of other little
                        things.  Like the surprise lunch
                        dates in the middle of the week. 
                        And watching an entire football
                        game with me and J-J...

                                        SARAH
                        Well, I'm sorry.  I'll try to
                        make more time to ignore you both.  

                                        WALT
                        ...At the same time, the evening
                        phone calls with Johnny Smith
                          suddenly end...

                                        SARAH
                        I had to marry a cop.

          She takes a beat to frame an explanation, an honest
            dishonest one she can live with.

                                        SARAH
                        We're taking time.  Trying to
                        figure out how we fit into each
                        other's lives... or if we even
                        do.

                                        WALT
                        Funny cause right now, it seems
                        to me you're trying awfully hard
                        to figure out how you fit into
                        our life.

          And this is an achingly low moment.  Walt studies her...
          and a dozen responses rush through her mind in a fraction
          of a second... including telling him the whole truth...
          but it's moot anyway because before she can answer, the
          familiar buzz of his cell phone breaks the spell...

                                        WALT
                                (into cell phone)
                        Bannerman.  Yeah?  Yeah.

  1CONTINUED: (2)1

                                        WALT (CONT'D)
                        I'll be there.

          Walt hangs up his cell phone.  He really didn't need an
            interruption right now.  But he has a job to do.

                                        WALT
                        You had to marry a cop. 

          Walt gives Sarah a kiss.  It's a bit of an awkward moment
          for both of them.

                                        WALT
                        We're not done.

                                        SARAH
                                (smiles)
                        You've got a conversation
                        raincheck.

          Walt gives Sarah the umbrella, puts the collar up on his
          coat and runs into the rain.  Sarah's light-hearted smile
          fades.


  22INT. JOHNNY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Johnny is at work in his "Armageddon Command Center."   
          He has the computer on to a search engine about Sonny
          Elliman... we can see his picture displayed...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reading)
                        '...became an aide to Greg Stillson
                          following a career in the
                          military...'  The military, what
                        branch of the military...? 

          Johnny catches himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay... talking to myself.  That's
                        bad.  Monologues.  Visions of
                          Armageddon.  Obsessive internet
                          searches.  The trifecta of mental
                        health warning signs.

          Johnny self-consciously closes a half dozen windows on
          his computer...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sleep would be good.

          Johnny turns off his computer.  His phone RINGS.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - TEASER - 10/11/02 PINK            4.


    2CONTINUED:2

          He glances at the clock and frowns.  It's two in the
          morning.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (answering with his
                                  caller i-d)
                        You're up late, Walt.  
                                (listens for a beat)
                        I know exactly where it is.  I'm
                        on my way.
                                (hangs up)

          Johnny pulls a cloth cover over his bulletin board,
          covering it from prying eyes.  Again, he can't help but
          see the humor in the way he's acting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And there's the paranoia.

          Exiting...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I'm still talking to myself.


  33EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

          The rain has stopped, but the ominous dark clouds promise
          more to come.

          Walt's cruiser is parked next to an abandoned SUV on the
          side of a rural road.  Johnny joins Walt, using his cane
          to balance on the loose gravel surface.  An older local
          man in a filthy quilted jacket, EDGAR, searches the area
          with two baying bloodhounds.

          Several other squad cars are nearby and we can hear the
          voices of people scouring the woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Walt)
                        So when the dogs fail, you call
                        me?

                                        EDGAR
                        It's not their fault.  They got
                        skunked the other day.

          Walt's not in a joking mood.  And we may notice he's not
          friendly good-old-boy Walt toward Johnny as he carries
          the memory of his interrupted conversation with Sarah
          during the early going here... until the job at hand takes

                        This is Tom Hirsch's SUV.  He
                        left the house this morning with
                        his brother Doug and their
                          girlfriends.  

          Johnny touches the driver's door handle of the SUV, gets
          nothing... moves back to the rear door and as he reaches
          in and touches the latch... RAMP TO HIS FACE and...


44A VISION - SAME LOCATION - DAY  

          Johnny stands observing as the four teens unload gear
          from the rear of the vehicle.  TOM HIRSCH (18), a jock in
            a Cleaves Mills letterman jacket; DOUG (16), Tom's younger
          brother, fresh-faced and likeable; ERIN (17), Tom's
          girlfriend, a cheerleader type; and KATE (16), Doug's
          girlfriend, cute, smart, a serious student.

                                        TOM
                        I used to come out here years ago
                        when I was little... you're not
                        going to believe this place... 

            Laughing, Tom exits the SUV.  Johnny spins just in time
          to let him pass.

          Johnny turns to watch the four teens head off into the
          woods, with Tom and Erin the ringleaders and Doug and
          Kate more cautious.  They're carrying a couple of six
          packs, blankets, and flashlights. 


  55EXT. ROADSIDE CLEARING - NIGHT

          Johnny heads into the woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This way.

          Walt and Edgar follow him.


  66EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Johnny pauses to get his bearings... reaches down to touch
          the ground... and in

  6A6ARESUME JOHNNY

          Johnny leads the way for the others...

          And then, slowly appearing through a break in the trees...


  77ESTABLISH THE HIGHSMITH MINE

            A looming rock ridge with a black gaping entrance.
            Discarded machinery, faded metal trespassing signs and a
          broken chain fence ineffectually bar the entrance.

          An appropriate music cue suggests strange and eerie things
          lie ahead.

          Johnny pauses as he considers the ominous sight.  And we
          don't have to see what he sees as he stares at it and
          says --

                        They went in.  They haven't left.

          Walt has never been here before...

          Johnny looks grim.

                        You could say that.

  88EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          As they move up the hill toward the entrance...

                                        JOHNNY
                        My grandfather owned it, ran it.
                        Copper pennies were still a staple
                        in the thirties.

                                        WALT
                        Did the vein run out?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I guess.  There were accidents. 
                                (still checking walls)
                        I got into a lot of trouble when
                        my dad caught me up here with a
                        girl once... 

          Johnny regrets saying it as soon as it comes out of his
          mouth because that girl was Sarah and Walt is no fool, he
          can figure it out.  The both decide to ignore the obvious. 
          Edgar moves to enter the mine, but his dogs refuse to go,
          kicking up a loud fuss.  They seem scared.

                                        EDGAR
                        Now they're spooked.

                                        WALT
                                (to Edgar)
                        Head back and tell Roscoe to call
                        Terry Collier at County Search &
                        Rescue.

          Edgar heads back the way they came.  Johnny and Walt
          tentatively enter the abandoned mine, Walt shining a high
          powered flashlight.  A DRAFT OF WIND from the depths of
          the mine ruffles Johnny's hair.  A WHISPER seems to drift
          past.  It's almost as though the mine is BREATHING.

                                        WALT
                        Tom Hirsch!  Anyone here?

          Walt's voice echoes -- "Anybody here... here... here." --
          but there's no human response.  Walt frowns, looks to
          Johnny as they move inside...


  99INT. MINE

          As they move in deeper, Johnny walks around the entrance,
          touching the walls and support beams, trying to pick up


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT ONE - 10/11/02 PINK           8.


    9CONTINUED:9

            something on the kids.

          Johnny touches a beam and...


  9A9AAGAIN IN A SPLIT REALITY VISION

          the ghostly four teens walk by him.  One of the girls,
          Kate, balances herself on the same beam Johnny just
          touched.

                                        DOUG
                        Oh man.  This is just like the
                        Indiana Jones ride at Disney Land.  

          Tom puts his arm around Erin, trying to cop a feel.  They
          kiss.  And their images disappear...


  1010JOHNNY

          moves in the direction the kids were going... Walt
          follows... but as they take a few steps... Johnny suddenly
          hears something odd... heavy, trudging FOOTSTEPS coming
          toward them... a lot of them, dozens maybe... he reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You hear that?

                                        WALT
                        Hear what?

          Johnny grabs the flashlight and shines it down the left
          branch of a Y intersection of tunnels...


          POV

          Nothing there... and the light seems to halt the sound of
          the trudging army briefly...


          RESUME

          ...but as he shines the light away from that tunnel, the
            footsteps begin again... and now Johnny looks over to the
          dark space in the tunnel without shining the light back
          there... and reacts as he sees --


  1111P.O.V. - THE DARKNESS SEEMS TO BE MOVING

            Something is materializing.  Johnny stares.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT ONE - 10/11/02 PINK           9.


    11CONTINUED:11

          ANGLE ON LEFT BRANCH: THE DARKNESS HAS EYES.

          PAIRS OF DISEMBODIED EYES seem to be drifting towards
          Johnny.  It's eery as hell.

          And then ancient worklights strung along the shaft wall
          GLOW into life, revealing:

          A LINE OF MINERS trudging out of the left fork.  Bone-
          weary.  Dirty-faced.  And, somehow, silently accusing.

          ANGLE ON RIGHT BRANCH: Simultaneously, the TEENS go down
          the right fork with a flashlight leading the way.  Their
          LAUGHTER is in stark contrast to the miners' grim silence.

          ANGLE ON FORK: These two lines criss-cross each other in
          an eery Busby Berkeley-esque cascade of people entering
          and exiting the mine shaft.  Johnny stands stock-still in
          the middle.

          To Johnny's surprise, a grim-faced MINER with bright blue
          eyes looks right at him.  This is ELI.  And from his
          expression, he doesn't like what he sees.

                                        ELI
                                (nodding)
                        Mister Smith.

          Eli walks by.  A second young miner, about 20, (STENGEL)
          with a distinctive scar under his right eye glares at
          Johnny as do the rest of the miners as they file past,
          anger smoldering in their eyes.


  1212RESUME SCENE

          Johnny looks off balance for a second.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This mine seems to know me by
                        name.

                                        WALT
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wish I knew.

          Johnny motions for Walt to follow him down the right fork,
          the path the kids took.          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT ONE - 10/11/02 PINK          10.


  1313INT. MINE TUNNEL - RUBBLE PILE - NIGHT

          Johnny and Walt walk until a huge pile of rubble blocks
          their way.

                                        WALT
                        This cave-in looks recent.  

          Johnny looks up at the ceiling then bends down to touch
          the rubble -- 


  1414SMASH VISION:

          reverse motion as all the rocks rain upwards to the
          ceiling, as the kids scream, scatter to cover, followed
          by a flash of gas exploding, Johnny's vision speeding him
          to the cause of the flash... Tom about to light a joint...


  1515RESUME SCENE

          Johnny reacts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Natural gas explosion.  The kids're
                        alive but they're separated. 

          Walt takes that in, realizing their job is only getting
          more difficult.

          A sudden RUMBLE sends more dirt and rocks raining down
          from the ceiling.  Johnny and Walt scramble to get out of
          the way.

                                        WALT
                        That explosion probably
                          destabilized this whole place.

          Johnny looks around the mine.  He feels it looking back.
          Again, it seems to BREATHE...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  It's awake alright.  

                                        WALT
                        We gotta get Search and Rescue in
                        here.

          Walt tries his walkie-talkie, it's useless underground. 
          The two men reluctantly head out of the mine.  Johnny
          pauses as he sees seventy-five year old message carved
          into a wood beam.  It says: DEATH TO JOHN SMITH.  Off
          Walt's reaction...

  1616EXT. RESCUE STAGING AREA - DAWN

          Johnny and Walt emerge from the woods.  The gravel parking
          lot is now swarming with activity.  The SEARCH AND RESCUE
          TEAM is unloading their gear from a yellow County EMT
          truck.

                        John Smith, yeah, heard about
                        you.  The old man John Smith closed
                        this mine after the big cave-in
                        of '49.

                        You know, they wrote songs about
                        that day.
                                (off Johnny's curious
                                  reaction)
                        Don't suppose they ever sang them
                        at your house.
                                (to Walt)
                        I knew some of the kids who lost

                        face for Sunbird's new ski trails
                        and this rain's probably made the
                        whole place unstable.

                        There was a cave-in and they're
                        trapped but I don't believe any
                        of them were seriously injured.

          Johnny doesn't know, hasn't seen that future, at least

                        be sometimes.

          He turns to see her... (and for the actors: Johnny hasn't
          been calling Dana for dates for a couple of weeks now so
          there's a vague subtext here but it's not something they
          would address under these circumstances.)

                        More like walking on a graveyard.

          Johnny takes off his helmet and wipes off his forehead. 
          They've been at this a while.

          Johnny sits down on the rail... and as he does, he hears
            a SQUEAK.  It sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. 
          He turns his flashlight up the rail toward the sound...

          Their faces are covered with protective gear.  But their
          EYES ARE UNMISTAKABLY THE EYES OF THE MINERS (One should

                        miners - over twice the usual

                        eight that night, fire broke out.
                        In a matter of minutes, smoke and

          And the CEILING COLLAPSES completely by a falling beam.


  5252EXT. RESCUE STAGING AREA - DAY

          Johnny snaps out of his vision.  Sarah sees his face and
          already knows it's bad.

                                        SARAH
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were buried in a cave-in.

                        You sure you're not seeing some
                        cave-in from the past...?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (certain)
                        This one's the future.  Our future.

                                        SARAH
                        Then you can't go back in there.

          A beat.  Johnny knows how dangerous it is going to be...
          but this is now a matter of lives in the balance: theirs,
          the girl's.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The chamber I saw has an abandoned
                        ore cart, number 47...if we see
                        that cart in time, we have a chance
                        to avoid the cave-in...
                                (beat)
                        But if we don't go, Kate dies for
                        sure.

          There's a silent moment between the three of them.  Sarah
          looks at Johnny and Walt both.  She knows what they're
          going to do.  It's the kind of men they are.

          Walt makes his decision; the one a man like him always
          has to make.

                        on.

          A tear runs down Sarah's cheek.  She hugs Walt tightly. 
          He holds her.  Johnny stands there a beat.  Then walks
          away alone back up the hill toward the mine.


  5353INT. MINE - DAY

          Johnny and Walt work their way through the tunnels, using
          the old map as a guide, always cautious about each turn. 
          Walt's mind lingering back with Sarah and the hug...

                        What.

                        Today, she's got one guy too many. 
                          Tomorrow, maybe none at all.

                        Doesn't help to think like that,

                        Got to think like that.  A husband
                        and a father has to.  I'm asking
                        myself here - is the insurance
                        paid, will it cover the mortgage... 

                                        JOHNNY

                        myself what happens if you make
                        it and I don't...  and I'm not at
                        all happy about that possibility,

                        okay.

          Some dust shifts down from the ceiling...  they flash
          their lights around looking for the familiar signature
          that threatens... it isn't this chamber... they look to

          to the dim light, we see clouds of dust hanging in the
          air.  Johnny moves back into the cavern to find Walt.
          He's partially pinned under the rubble.  He's lost his
          helmet and his head is bleeding.  He does not look good.

                                        WALT
                        I ... changed the future.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, you did, man.  Stay still.

          Johnny tends to Walt as best he can.  He takes out his
          medkit and tries to stop Walt's bleeding head wound.

          Doug helps Johnny clear away the debris trapping Walt.
          Doug finds Walt's smashed walkie-talkie.  Johnny tries to
          get a signal, but it's beyond repair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Damn.
                                (to Walt)
                        We gotta get you out of here.

                                        WALT
                        Go.  Find Kate.  It's okay.

          Walt's in pain... but he forces himself to stay focused.

          FADE IN:

  5959INT. MINE TUNNELS - DAY

          Johnny moves alone through the mine.  He comes to
          passageway marked in ancient letters:  4XCN.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Four Cross Cut North.

          The old wooden posts CREAK as the earth shifts. Water
          DRIPS.  And the air continues to move through the mine in
          pulses, like BREATHS...

          As he braces his hand against rails along the way, he
          hears the voices of the men who died here...

                                        ELI'S VOICE
                        Company orders.  We blast. 

          Johnny walks in the darkness... one step, another... then
          hears (sound only):

                                        MINER'S VOICE
                        Fire in the hole! 

          The mine shakes with the sound of an explosion...

          Johnny turns to see --


  6060VISION - MINERS RUNNING AS SMOKE AND POISON GAS ROLLS
          DOWN THE STOPE 

          Johnny in the foreground as the smoke seems to sweep over
          him and then disappear... the last face he sees before it
          all fades away is Stengel's... with the distinctive scar
          below the eye...


  6161RESUME JOHNNY

          walking... still hearing voices...

                                        BLACK MINER'S VOICE
                        Break through the wall... it's
                        our only chance...

          Johnny moving through the darkness... hears the sounds of
          the men trying to cut through the wall... and now ahead
          he sees --          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - REV. 10/15/02 YEL     43.


6262A VISION - A FLOOD OF WATER RUSHING THROUGH THE WALL ON
          TOP OF MINERS  

          Johnny again in the foreground as they yell... and it
          quickly disappears... leaving him in darkness... but one
          last voice echoes through...

                                        ELI'S VOICE
                        Die John Smith!

          Johnny's eyes narrow.


  6363INT. NEW CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny turns a corner and sees a frightening sight. The
          tunnel just disappears into a mirror-still body of water... 

          Johnny removes his coat.  He grabs a glow stick, snaps it
          on.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (psyching himself up)
                        You'll find air.  This place loves
                        you. 
                                (beat)
                        You're talking to yourself again.

          Johnny wades into the water.  It's freezing.  He takes
          deep, lung-expanding breaths and then... DIVES IN.


  6464INT. FLOODED MINE TUNNELS - UNDERWATER

          Johnny swims through the murky blackness.  It's spooky as
          hell.  There's no light, no sunshine to guide you to the
          top.  In fact, it's hard to tell which way is up.

          Johnny feels along one side of the tunnel to keep himself
            oriented.  The glow stick provides only a weak flickering
          beam of light.  He passes through a low passageway that
          is covered with water...


  6565INT. FLOODED CHAMBER

          And then his head breaks the water's surface. But, it's
          only a small air pocket at the top of the tunnel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate?!

          The only sound comes from water lapping against the edges
          of the cavern.  Johnny treads water to stay afloat as his
          eyes, adjust ...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - 10/11/02 PINK         44.


    65CONTINUED:65

          JOHNNY'S POV: IT'S BLURRY, INDISTINCT. THERE ARE WHITE
          SPOTS AGAINST A BLACK BACKGROUND.

          Johnny reaches out to the one of the white spots and
          touches...


          CLOSER - A HUMAN FEMUR

          He gasps in surprise.  In fact...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          is surrounded by human bones and pieces of skeletons.
          They float in the water and litter the shelves of rock
          nearby.

          And he has disturbed their long slumber. They CLACK
            together, almost as if they're speaking a long-forgotten
            language. There's a lot of them, they seem to be crowding
          the water, pushing him back down under the surface. (Think
          of Marion "attacked" by the skeletons in RAIDERS OF THE
          LOST ARK).


  6666INT. FLOODED MINE CHAMBER - UNDERWATER

          As Johnny struggles to find his way back up, his hands
          brush the bones and suddenly, he's not alone in the murky
          water.  His VISIONS come to eery life (Note: Stengel should
          not be among the dead).


  6767OFF A HIP BONE --


6868A JOHNNY FLASH 

          as he sees a DIRTY-FACED MINER eyes wide open in death
          staring at him underwater... arms floating as though
          reaching toward Johnny...


  6969OFF AN ULNA --


  7070ANOTHER JOHNNY FLASH 

          Another dead wide-eyed BLACK MINER seems to be reaching
          out for him...          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - 10/11/02 PINK         45.


  7171OFF A COLLARBONE --


  7272ANOTHER JOHNNY FLASH

          Eli, wide-eyed in death, seems to reach for him...


  7373RESUME JOHNNY

          as he bursts above the water... gasping for air, very
          close to being drowned... grabbing for anything at all...
          hands slipping on bones...  there is no way out above the
          water line... so his only choice is five back down below...


  7474INT. UNDERWATER - JOHNNY

          swimming below the bones... toward another low passageway
          completely covered in water...  he goes through it...


  7575INT. KATE'S WATER-FLOODED CHAMBER - NIGHT

          Kate is wedged into a corner, looking desperate as the
          water level rises, higher and higher.

            Suddenly, right in front of her, Johnny BREAKS the surface
          of the water, GASPING for air.

          Kate SCREAMS in surprise, but then she reaches out for
          him.

                                        KATE
                        Oh, thank-god...

          Johnny comforts her as best he can in the cramped space.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you hurt?

                                        KATE
                        I can't feel my fingers or toes.

                        This water's pretty cold.

          Johnny reaches out and rubs her hands briskly with his
          own.

                                        KATE
                        Is Doug okay?  We were with his

          Johnny and Kate both have to tip their heads up to keep
            breathing and talking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate, we're gonna have to swim

          She does... he smiles... because he sees a better future

                        gonna be okay.

          She looks at him, curiously.

                          couldn't get out in time.

          Sarah collapses in tears in Johnny's arms.  And then pushes
          him away in anger as though she knows it's wrong to be in
          his arms.

          sees this... and so does...

          but he turns his attention to the happier reunion of the
          kids and their parents by the ambulances...

                                        EMT
                        People, I need you to clear this
                        area, please!

          Johnny follows the orders, moves a few yards out of the
          way... watching them work furiously on Walt... Sarah
          refuses to leave Walt's side... watches with unbelieving
          eyes...

          As we watches this, Johnny's eyes are caught by


  8080MAGGIE TYNER

          holding Kate tight... she looks over the girl's shoulder
          with tears in her eyes.  And there's someone else in
          Johnny's view too... a very OLD MAN in his seventies... 
          standing alone a few yards away... watching the tragic
          events unfold at the mine entrance...


  8181JOHNNY

          reacts as he begins to recognize something about this
          guy...


  8282CLOSE ON THE OLD MAN'S FACE

          He has a distinctive scar under his eye...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Stengel?

          The old man turns to see Johnny next to him...

                                        STENGEL
                        How do you know my name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is John Smith.  You used
                        to work for my grandfather.
                                (eyes narrow)
                          I wonder if you could help me
                        find some of the families of the
                        men who worked here.

          Stengel looks at him curiously and in time they will talk
          more, but for us, all we need to understand is that Johnny
          is going to reach out to these victims of his family's
          past, that he cares in a way his grandfather never did... 
          there's a wide gap to be bridged between an old miner and
          the Smith Family and it cannot all happen in this moment. 
          But we sense this is the first step in a long process.

  8383ANGLE AS THEY SECURE WALT TO A BACKBOARD

                                        EMT
                        Let's go, blood pressure's
                          dropping, he's crashing.

          In the background Purdy addresses reporters...

                                        PURDY
                        We intend to permanently seal
                        this mine after our work here is
                        done.  This will never happen
                        again.

          He stops as he sees the ambulance backing up to the
          backboard.  The EMT is bagging him with an oxygen bag as
          they move him to the vehicle.

                                        EMT
                        Get him inside.

          The Paramedics load Walt in the ambulance.  Sarah running
            alongside the backboard...

                                        SARAH
                        I want to come with him.

                                        EMT
                        I'm sorry.  We need the room to
                        work.

                                        SARAH
                        But I'm his wife.

                                        EMT
                        Ma'am, we'll meet you at the
                          hospital...

          The paramedics close the door and the ambulance ROARS
          off.


          CLOSE ON SARAH

          She's helpless to do anything but watch the ambulance
            disappear in the distance.


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          He's helpless to do anything but watch Sarah as her heart
          breaks.  And on this, we...
