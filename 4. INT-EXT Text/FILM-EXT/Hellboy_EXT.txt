Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.
It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short
tunnel carved into the mountain.
Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside
Broom.
BROOM
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I
have a word??
WHITMAN
(impatient)
What is it?
BROOM
In private, if you don't mind...
They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the
small box. It's full of rosaries.
BROOM
Your men -- They'll need these --
Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ
contemplates the scene from above.
WHITMAN
You are a Catholic??
BROOM
Amongst other things, yes -- but
that's hardly the point.
Whitman locks and loads an automatic.
WHITMAN
Here. You'll need one of these.
BROOM
I abhor violence.
(Whitman moves away)
Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't
think me mad --
WHITMAN
Three days too late for that one,
"professor."
He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has
no eyes.
MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the
move. Broom catches up with Whitman.
WHITMAN
You're wasting our time: There's
nothing on this island but sheep and
rocks.
BROOM
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of
Trondham Abbey. Built on an
intersection of Ley Lines, the
boundaries between our world and the
other --
WHITMAN
(interrupts him)
What a load of crap. Hell, a week
ago I hadn't even heard the word
parabnormal --
BROOM
"Paranormal"
(Whitman moves on)
But -- you read the transmission.
WHITMAN
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German
ghost stories!
BROOM
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
WHITMAN
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he
sees lights.
MATLIN
Sweet Jesus.
Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive
ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS
swarm among thick stone walls and archways.
BROOM
They must be here for the sheep.
OMIT
A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel
MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK
LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.
WHITMAN
The freak in the gas mask --
BROOM
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the
Reich's top Scientists. Head of the
Thule Occult Society.
He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.
BROOM
If he's here, this is worse than I
thought.
WHITMAN
(to the radio man)
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.
RADIO MAN
Londonderry, sir. Forty minutes away.
BROOM
We don't have forty minutes.
Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears
respond!
Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty
metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and
signals for more floodlights to be turned on.
The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone
saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully
extended.
GRIGORY
No matter what happens to me, you
must carry on with the work.
ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes
an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.
ILSA
I will not leave you.
GRIGORY
Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.
ILSA
Never --
He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-
drawn notes and illustrations.
GRIGORY
This will guide you back to me.
He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.
GRIGORY
I grant you everlasting life, youth
and the power to serve me.
He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then
wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation
and a ritual.
VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET
glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket
watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.
VON KRUPT
It's time.
OMIT
Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and
copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.
VON KRUPT
Five years of research and
construction, Grigory. Five years!!
He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella
to shield her master from the pouring rain.
VON KRUPT
The furhrer doesn't look kindly on
failure.
GRIGORY
There will be no failure, General. I
promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll
deliver one.
Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box
containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.
Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with
the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.
The Americans fan out, unseen.
Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid
a German foot patrol.
Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.
Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind
him.
GRIGORI
Tonight, We will open a portal and
awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven
Gods of chaos.
(beat)
Our enemies will be destroyed. In an
instant, all impurity in this world
will be razed and from the ashes a
new eden will arise.
He looks down at the machine and whispers --
GRIGORY
Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.
He flexes his fingers and in response --
-- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central
axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and
pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain
to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.
Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.
ILSA
More Power!! Don't let the level
drop!!
One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the
machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.
A blade of light opens in the air!
Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.
The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN
GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light
tears loose and flies in.
The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD:
seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.
Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie
slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens
a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...
Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.
Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck,
his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.
CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.
It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him
down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.
WHITMAN
Listen to me, you moron: you do that
again, I'll carve you a new --
Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.
The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with
the GOLD CYLINDERS.
BROOM
(fierce whisper, to
WHITMAN)
Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!!
We have to stop them!!!
Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.
Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.
The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But
something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!
The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the
squad of Allies storms the area.
A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun
the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.
VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But
Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.
Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and
grabs a grenade from his belt.
TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel
bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers,
mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors.
The steel chops clean through their weapons.
Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.
CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.
Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after
it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As
his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!
Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where
two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.
Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the
earth right next to MATLIN.
ILSA
Grigory!
Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy,
his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly
implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal
glove, empty and smoking.
As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.
Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen.
Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails,
nothing more.
OMIT
Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.
MATLIN
It's almost over!!
BROOM
No. It's not.
He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer
rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.
BROOM
Cordon off the area. Something came
through.
WHITMAN
From where??!!
Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and
hell.
Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using
flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them
has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.
OMIT
Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman
roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.
MATLIN
Do you believe in hell?
BROOM
There is a place -- a dark place
where evil slumbers and awaits to
return. From there it infects our
dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave
us a glance tonight --
MATLIN
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?
(Broom nods)
Thought they were on our side...
BROOM
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
MATLIN
C'mon -- Rasputin??
BROOM
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.
(beat)
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor,
he was poisoned, shot, stabbed,
clubbed, drowned and castrated.
MATLIN
That makes him more than a hundred --
A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun
as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves,
accompanied by a loud scrape.
Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling
statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!!
Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.
The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail
of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --
MATLIN
(to Broom)
What the hell was that? An ape?
BROOM
No. It was red. Bright red.
WHITMAN
What are you two talking about??
MATLIN
A red ape.
BROOM
It's-not-an-ape --
They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.
MATLIN
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
BROOM
I think that is its hand.
Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone
saint.
WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom
stops him from firing.
BROOM
Wait --
In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden
eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.
Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket.
Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED
THING shrinks back.
Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his
lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark
comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons
around it.
The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with
tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist.
Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the
chocolate.
YOUNG SOLDIER
Jesus! would'ya look at the size of
that whammer!
Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows
the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.
Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers
snatch the candy. Broom smiles.
BROOM
It's a boy. Just a baby boy.
The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin
prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom
smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature,
patting him gently. CLICK!!!
OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
Best photo of my career --
CUT TO:
BROOM
(smiles at the creature)
HELLBOY.
Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes
and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.
CUT TO:
HELLBOY - MAIN TITLE
Montage: Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY
SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc.
TV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts (fist fight
included) feature the show's theme: I WAS HELLBOY'S BRIDE!!
Some blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley.
Much like Bigfoot in the woods.
TOM MANNING (V.O.)
Look at that. That's a costume. These
people amaze me.
In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy
steps of a massive rock formation.
Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.
The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they
reach a DEAD END.
FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and
consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an
illustration in the book.
Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer,
FIGURE 1 breaks through.
PEASANT GUIDE
I will guide you no further.
Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the
guide. Keeps the other one.
The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a
SWASTIKA.
Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated
for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of
Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.
Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward
a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the
door.
Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street
vendor.
In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED,
BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens.
BROOM
(seeing this)
Son...
TV HOST
Mister Manning, what about the "Bureau
for Paranormal Research and Defense?"
The FBI has been known to conceal --
TOM MANNING
That word -- conceal --
TV HOST
from the American public --
TOM MANNING
Phil -- Phil -- hold your little
green horses. Let me tell you and
the American public one thing --
this "Bureau for -- what was it?
TV HOST
Paranormal Research and --
TOM MANNING
-- Defense, right, well -- I'm here
to clear up this once and for all.
(he looks at the camera)
There-is-no-such-thing.
Broom smiles.
OMIT
On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex
rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the
rock below.
SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK,
N.J.
A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate.
Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The
driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old
fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"
A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.
INTERCOM VOICE
Yes?
MYERS
(shivering)
John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from
Quantico.
A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen
scanner pop out.
INTERCOM VOICE
Look at the birdie, son.
Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea
is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers
appear. CLACK! The gate opens.
The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.
The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes
on.
An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments.
A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.
Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN
Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED
POLICE.
Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan
cars are waved through.
BLONDE REPORTER
The NYPD has yet to issue a statement.
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you
name it...
and now here's -- a
garbage truck --
(double take)
-- a garbage truck?
Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a
mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management
Services.
AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.
The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens
of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED
POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.
The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors
are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped
crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.
ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a
mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he
inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills.
Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.
HELLBOY
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One
sheet of glass between them and us.
ABE
Story of my life.
HELLBOY
I break it, they see us, Happy
Halloween. No more hiding.
(nostalgic)
Outside. I could be outside --
ABE
You mean, outside... with her.
Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets,
rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of
stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.
HELLBOY
Don't get psychic with me.
ABE
Nothing psychic about it. You're
easy.
Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD
SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built,
double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable
cannon.
HELLBOY
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I
drive around in a garbage truck
ABE
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
HELLBOY
(hefting the gun)
We don't take hints.
The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.
FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed
cops and securing the doors.
THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate,
sealing off the area.
STONE
All areas secured.
From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.
CLAY
(into a handheld radio)
Seal the doors. Red and Blue are
coming in.
The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the
dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing
HELLBOY and ABE.
CLAY
Okay, boys, let's synch up our
locators.
Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They
BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.
OMIT
-- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage
bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his
mouth
GRIGORY'S VOICE
Child...
Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition,
is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded
by pitch-black sunglasses
GRIGORY
All grown up, I see.
Hellboy's in shock, confused.
HELLBOY
That voice --
GRIGORY
I sang the first lullaby you ever
heard, my child. I ushered you into
this world.
(beat)
I alone know your true calling, your
true name.
HELLBOY
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground.
He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.
GRIGORY
I can see that you're still young
and don't know your place.
(turns to Sammael)
Teach him.
Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --
WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth
like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from
its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.
Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth.
The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's
skin.
Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the
alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER
BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal
SQUEAL!!
Hellboy manages to roll away.
Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover
behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.
HELLBOY
What do you think you're doing??
Myers proudly shows him the gun.
MYERS
Helping you -- I just --
HELLBOY
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too
much.
HELLBOY
Damn -- Okay. Here --
He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his
belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.
HELLBOY
(throws it at Myers)
-- Then load this.
In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.
HELLBOY
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the
pin. Load it.
KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod.
Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.
Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows
like a chemical flare.
MYERS
Jeez... What the hell is that?
He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash,
a big, black stinger is gleaming.
Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe
grape.
HELLBOY
Lemme go ask --
Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue
instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.
BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly
green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then --
BAM!!!!
INSIDE GUN SHOT
The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --
-- Sammael, still in mid-air.
It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!
With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles
after it.
On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.
He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers
lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.
MYERS
Wait! No, what are you doing?
LOADING DOCK / ALLEY
Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full
tilt.
A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A
few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.
WORKER 1
What the hell is that??
Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting
the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.
A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.
Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-
or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.
Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.
3 WORKERS
(chorus)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-
Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab:
CRASH!!!
The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams,
showered by thousands of glass shards.
Myers is a few steps behind.
MYERS
(into headset)
We'll hit the street in a minute.
We're heading towards civilians...
He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The
vendors are yelling at him.
MYERS
Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick
or treat!!
Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps
straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision
as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR
TREATERS scream.
Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as
Myers follows --
He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!
Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers,
holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.
The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with
a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.
Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major
traffic jam.
HELLBOY
Are you okay?
Myers opens his eyes, nods.
HELLBOY
Good. Stay here.
He moves after Sammael.
OMIT
Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At
the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's
gone.
He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.
He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away.
Seated.
HELLBOY
Waiting for me, Sammy?
A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles
and puts away his gun.
HELLBOY
Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard
place --
But Sammael sprints towards it!
HELLBOY
Aw, crap --
Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm,
then jumps at the front car --
OMIT
SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through
one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --
STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR
-- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.
A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is
being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.
Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form.
His radio beeps.
HELLBOY (V.O.)
Myers??? How's your arm?
MYERS
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Myers moves away from the POLICE OFFICERS.
MYERS
(sotto voce)
Where are you???
MYERS
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere --
I gotta go with you --
A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside.
FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges.
A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging
from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music
on picnic tables.
On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer
and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes,
a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.
Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.
Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY
VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...
...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with
barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with
paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden
surrounds the building.
Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his
overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND
FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.
Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging
from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail
of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...
LIZ
Back so soon?
Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat.
His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.
HELLBOY
Uh, I brought beer.
Liz shoots a Polaroid.
LIZ
To wash down my lithium pills?
(beat)
I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm
still a patient.
Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.
LIZ
You better have that looked at.
HELLBOY
Just a scratch.
(shrug)
I wanted to see you.
Liz sighs.
Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.
HELLBOY
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's
crazier every day. And Father's still
mad at me --
(Liz smiles)
Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
LIZ
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been
months since I've had an episode.
And you know what? I'm learning to
control it.
Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms,
crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at
the pale flame.
LIZ
I'm learning where it comes from.
(beat)
And for once in my life I'm not
afraid.
She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.
LIZ
Looks like your ride is here.
The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled
into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the
vehicles.
HELLBOY
The Nanny Squad.
ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS
Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns
to Broom:
MYERS
Sir, may I go first??
CLAY
(to Broom)
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
BROOM
(cuts him off)
Then he should make it his business
to change that.
ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS
Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.
LIZ
Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out
here. If you truly care about me,
don't come back anymore.
Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.
HELLBOY
Goodnight, then.
LIZ
Goodnight.
She doesn't turn back.
HELLBOY
Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --
Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his
feet, a pool of his own blood.
He sees Myers tentatively approaching.
HELLBOY
What took you so long?
MYERS
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
HELLBOY
What are you, a Boy Scout?
MYERS
No. I never was.
HELLBOY
(weak)
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him.
Help him up.
CLAY
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy,
there.
HELLBOY
This -- ? This is nothing. You know
what'll kill me?
(points at the doorway)
Her.
Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over.
A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.
Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their
unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes
inside.

Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang
banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement
courtyard.
ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS
Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone,
a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.
A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps,
carrying a basket of apples.
MOTHER
(to Liz)
Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give
Mummy a hand.
Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated
apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.
BLONDE KID
Freak!
Liz turns to see them.
BLONDE KID
(to his friend)
See? She knows her name.
Liz shies away from them.
BLONDE KID
Go home, you freak. We don't want
you here.
They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses
her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.
Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face.
She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering
the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across,
but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.
A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale
blue flame rings her entire arm.
LIZ
(sobbing)
Not again, please, not again...
Firelight glints off the crucifix.
MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A
heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.
LIZ
Mommy! Mommy!
Mother sees...
DAY
Liz: outlined by licking flames!
LIZ
(panicked)
Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!
Mother screams, horrified.
LIZ
Help meee!!!
She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the
courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then
the rest of the people are --
THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD
-- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches,
people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment
blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.
The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one
figure left standing:
Liz... a little girl, still crying.
FLASH FORWARD TO:
The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window,
showering glass into the streets below.
OMIT
Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen
are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.
Myers arrives in a taxi cab.
Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in
BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the
platform.
HELLBOY
(a whisper)
This time. Stay dead, willya??
He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.
An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her
head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She
passes it to Myers:
LIZ
It feels good to be outside!! It's
been so long...
He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the
bulletproof acrylic divider.
MYERS
Hey!! The music!! Turn down the
music!!
DRIVER
Yeah, yeah, music!!
He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the
same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.
She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.
MYERS
Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe,
Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?
She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers
looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the
other window, hands her the photograph.
MYERS
Nice view --
He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.
MYERS
A smile, huh? That's good.
She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing
Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.
LIZ
Don't get used to it.
Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music.
He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.
Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street.
Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes
his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.
HELLBOY
What are you two talking about. What's
so fascinating?? So important??
Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The
shops are closing.
MYERS
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
LIZ
He's just pushy.
MYERS
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
LIZ
Cocky.
MYERS
Strong.
LIZ
A brute.
MYERS
My uncle used to say... we like people
for their qualities but love them
for their defects.
Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.
MYERS
He -- loves you.
LIZ
I know.
MYERS
What about you?
LIZ
Don't know. Really. I grew up with
him.
(beat)
I've missed him too, but now, every
time I see him, I get confused. Hardly
a day goes by he's not in my mind.
Even now, I feel he's here --
As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof
tops.
Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at
Myers and Liz --
Myers offers her cream and sugar.
HELLBOY
No cream and sugar, moron. She takes
it black.
She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.
HELLBOY
Toldya.
Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz
gestures vigorously. His smile fades.
MYERS
It's freezing, isn't it?
LIZ
Coffee's warming me up.
By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park
near a train track.
MYERS
What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.
She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.
LIZ
You offered me a cup of coffee. I've
got one, so just sit down.
Myers is falling for her.
Hellboy leaps off a building.
Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing,
Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon
coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.
HELLBOY
Hi...
The kid stares at him.
KID
You're Hellboy.
HELLBOY
Shh. I'm... on a mission.
He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.
HELLBOY
Don't tell anyone, huh?
CUT TO:
The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses
of milk and a plate of cookies.
KID
My Mom baked 'em.
He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting
and laughing.
HELLBOY
That's it: she's laughing. I'm done.
Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them
down.
KID
They don't look like spies.
HELLBOY
Come on! Look at him, those shifty
eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
(seeing the last cookie)
You gonna eat that?
Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.
HELLBOY
Oh, the yawning trick. That's so
1950's! Watch his arm --
He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.
MYERS
We all have a side that we try to
hide...
Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back.
Something hits him in the head.
MYERS
Hey! What the hell?
He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.
Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives
him five".
The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains
litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the
distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against
the blood-red sky.
Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons
and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His
horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly
fire.
The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.
The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.
KID
Just go down there and tell her how
you feel!
(Hellboy shakes his
head: no)
My mom says --
HELLBOY
It's not that easy, okay?
(beat)
Plus, you're nine. You're not old
enough to give me advice.
KID
(shrugs)
Who are those guys??
Hellboy turns and sees --
TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.
Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers,
talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.
HELLBOY
Something's wrong --
OMIT
It's raining like hell.
The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's
casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.
The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.
Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain
bounces off his wet overcoat.
Liz observes him, worried.
LIZ'S VOICE
He hasn't spoken to anyone in three
days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he
doesn't sleep...
Super: TOPOCKBA STEEL MILLS, MOSCOW A wasteland of rust and
decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel
watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.
A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security
gates.
A massive CARGO PLANE slices the white eye of a full moon. A
map details the plane's journey over the Black Sea.
Super: RUSSIAN AIRSPACE - BLACK SEA.
Two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered
Soviet roads.
Super:
VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW.
Myers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map.
LIZ
(into a radio)
Sparky to Big Red...
Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the
truck bed.
Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small
breathing holes have been drilled in the sides.
HELLBOY'S VOICE
Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers?
Liz snickers.
MYERS
We're almost there.
Hellboy steps out. Takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the
light.
HELLBOY
Sebastian Plackba #16...
19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE)
Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless
rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage.
Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the
labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a
flashlight and a gun.
DISSOLVE TO:
Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque
funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts --
looks around.
MANNING
Forget it. This is practically a
city. And it stinks, and it's muddy.
We'll go back, check into a hotel,
regroup after breakfast. We'll have
to make a grid, go by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.
He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.
HELLBOY
Let me ask for directions.
The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone
cover and then jumps in.
-- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse
lies in a miserable black suit.
HELLBOY
(whispers)
Animam edere, animus corpus...
He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment,
nothing, and then...
...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters
something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE
on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.
HELLBOY
Sixty feet further, comrades, and
three rows in...
The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly
points, as if in confirmation.
HELLBOY
This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say
"hi" Ivan.
The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.
A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries
open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the
desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.
OMIT
In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above,
pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.
Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon!
The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's
more intense, with ripples and haloes.
OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs
uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the
frame.
