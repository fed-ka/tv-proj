      The tooth-shaped wall clock tells us we re in a dentist s 
      office; old carpet and flickering lights tell us times are 
      tough.  Plastic plants dot shelves.  Bad music mingles with a 
      drill whistling in some back room.  

      The row of waiting patients seem in their dress and 
      exhaustion to be lower income.  There is a KOREAN LADY, a 
      GAWKY TEEN, an OLDER MAN, a MEXICAN GIRL, and an AVERAGE JOE.

      MINDY SPRINGER, the cute receptionist, 28, calls out.

                                  MINDY
                    Joe?  Come on back.


      DR. PETER OLDHAM, DDS, 45, peers into JOE S mouth.  His 
      dental assistant RAUL, 30, observes.  Dr. Oldham picks at 
      Joe s teeth.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    A little pitting in number six.  

      Raul nods.  Oldham is a broad-shouldered guy about 45 years 
      old.  He picks at other teeth.  

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Your gums are retreating.
                          (to Joe)
                    I ll have Mindy give you a softer 
                    brush.


      PAULA, 8, Mexican, is in the chair.  Dr. Oldham has a mirror 
      in her mouth.

                    Looks good, kiddo.  Go ahead and 
                    rinse up.

      Paula fills a cup.  She drinks and swishes.  Dr. Oldham 
      smiles.  A knock at the door.  It s MRS. PENA, 40, Mexican, 
      Paula s mom.  She holds an aluminum tray.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    What is this?

                                  MRS. PE A
                    Tamales, doctor.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Aw, Mrs. Pe a.  They smell awesome, 
                    but I told you, you don t have to 
                    worry.  You pay when you can.  

                                  MRS. PE A
                    Until then, tamales.


      Dr. Oldham walks Paula and Mrs. Pe a out.  They pass a small 
      table off the waiting area.  He places the tamales alongside 
      other gifts: Cards, drawings, knitted things; fruit from 
      backyard trees; bottles of homemade hot sauce; pottery from 
      school; and tubs of baked goods.

                                  MRS. PE A
                    You are a good man, Dr. Oldham. 

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    And you are too kind.

                    Are you an idiot?!

                    Mr. Ferguson, please lower your 
                    voice.

      Dr. Oldham and Mrs. Pe a turn to see a patient, CHASE 
      FERGUSON, 33, a wormy, life-coach type, arguing with Mindy.  
      Dr. Oldham ushers Mrs. Pena and Paula out.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Thanks for the tamales, Mrs. Pena.  
                    Paula -- up and down, not side to 
                    side.

      Mrs. Pe a and Paula exit.  Dr. Oldham turns to Mr. Ferguson.

                    Finally, someone with a brain.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    What s the problem?

                                  FERGUSON
                    Fire this woman.  She has no idea 
                    what she s talking about and she s 
                    wasting my time.  I have clients to

                                  MINDY
                    This is the fourth visit we ve

                                  FERGUSON
                    I m not refusing to pay, I m not

                    He insists the insurance company

                    As I ve explained three times now,

                      additional paperwork for the semi-
                    elective procedures, i.e. my caps 
                    and gold crowns, which she is 
                    clearly too lazy to do... 

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    I ll look into it.

                                  FERGUSON
                    Don t look into it.  Fix it.  I 
                    can t come here every time and 
                    argue with your sub-mental staff 
                    about out-of-pocket compensation.  
                    I have things to do; I can t show 
                    up at my seminar in a filthy car.  
                    That affects business.

      Oldham glances at his clients, adopts a low tone of voice.

                    Again talking like I m five.  You 
                    know, I ve had it with you people.  
                    I could get better dental work in a

                    some Pine Sol.  Leave here needing 
                    a tetanus shot.  

      He walks out.  Oldham and Mindy stand there stunned.


      Dr. Oldham paces, runs his hands over his scalp.  He grabs 
      dental tools off a tray.  They go in his pocket.  He opens a 
      cabinet.


      Raylan is in with Art.  The office is otherwise empty.

                                  ART
                    This morning at eight-forty-five 
                    L.A. time, LAPD got a 911 from a 
                    patient of Dr. Peter Oldham, DDS.  
                    Seems Mr. Ferguson had his back two 
                    molars excised without anesthetic.  
                    In a parking lot. 

      Art swivels his computer monitor to show Raylan a California 
      DMV photo of Dr. Peter Oldham, DDS, aka Roland Pike.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie Pike.  

      A face Raylan has been thinking about for five years.

                    Dentist.   It s got legs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That puts a clock on it.  Cartel

                    He didn t just suddenly give in to

                    something at the boss -- a

                    the eye was unsaveable.  By that

                          (to Jim)
                    Rachel s taking lead on this one.

                                  JIM
                    Oh, thank God.  Now maybe we won t 
                    lose him a third time.

                                  RAYLAN
                    There was just the once.  In 
                      Brownsville.

                                  JIM
                    What about Nicaragua?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He wasn t there.

                          (to Rachel)
                    He tell you about how he lost Pike 
                    in Brownsville?

                                  RACHEL
                    I read the report.

                                  JIM
                    Ah, but the report lacks all the 
                    flavor and nuance.  
                          (to Raylan)
                    You want me to tell her or you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I want to get to work.

                                  JIM
                    We knew Rollie was probably headed 
                    for the border, so Ray-Ray went to 
                      Brownsville and staked out a bar 
                    where people go to buy paper.  
                    Rollie walked in.  Raylan made his 
                    pitch, told Rollie he was looking 
                    either at a short life on the run 
                    from gun thugs like Tommy Bucks, or 
                    he could get him into WitSec, get a 
                    new identity.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He gave me his word.  

                                  JIM
                    Oh, yeah.  I always think a 
                      fugitive s word is better than 
                      handcuffs.

      Raylan shrugs.

                                  JIM
                    He went to get an ice cream!
                          (to Raylan)
                    And the next time you saw his face 
                    was what, on your computer this 
                    morning?

        Receptionist Mindy comes out of an office door, holding a 
      cardboard box, walks up to them.  (Wardrobe note: Mindy has a 
      nice watch, maybe a ladies  Rolex.)

                                  MINDY
                    Excuse me.  I m guessing you re 
                    gonna shut the office down, and I 
                    was wondering if I could take 
                    these, so they don t go bad?

                                  JIM
                    What are they?

                                  MINDY

      Jim looks in the box.

                                  MINDY (CONT D)
                    Want one?

                                  JIM
                    No, thanks.

      She offers them to Raylan and Rachel.  They shake their 
      heads.

                                  MINDY
                    Your loss.  They re real good.

                          (off notes)
                    Mindy Springer.

                                  RACHEL
                    You interviewed her?

                                  JIM
                    We interviewed everyone.

                                  RACHEL
                    Anyone have any idea Dr. Oldham was 
                    really Roland Pike?

                                  JIM
                    No.  They all seem pretty stunned.  

      In the b.g., an FBI AGENT goes with Raul into the exam room 
      Mindy came out of.  

                                  RACHEL
                    How did he pass himself off as a 
                    dentist?

                                  JIM
                    He wasn t passing.  He got a  
                    degree from a dental school in 
                    Panama.  Came here, kept his head 
                    down, worked the fringe -- 
                    illegals, people without insurance.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Never saw him as a dentist.  
                          (off their looks)
                    I always imagined him sitting on a 
                    beach in Belize or Brazil.

      The FBI agent comes out of the exam room.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Uh, we may have a problem.


      Raylan, Rachel, Jim, the FBI agent and TWO OTHERS are with 
      Raul, looking at a drawer with a heavy lock, part way open.

                    Smart.

      Inside the box: a hundred packets of DENTAL-GRADE GOLD.

                    No, it was exciting.  But there 
                    were a lot more people than I 
                    expected.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I pulled two teeth without 
                      anesthetic.  Or permission.

                                  MINDY
                    But why would they send out twenty 
                    guys?  That time my cousin s 
                    trainer beat him with his weight 
                    belt?  Two cops.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Yeah, well, I ve got a lot of 
                    unpaid parking tickets.  

      Rollie puts the box in the back seat.

                    We turn the gold into cash, get a 
                    new car, new ID s.  Once we re over 
                    the border, we cruise down to 
                    Belize, where they speak English 
                    and it s almost impossible to be 
                      extradited.  We set up shop and 
                    start fixing kids  teeth again.  
                    That sound good?

                                  MINDY

                    think it d go over if I came in to 
                    work one day wearing a cowboy hat?  
                    You think I d get away with that?

      Raylan thinks about that, shrugs -- she has a point.  He 
      looks at her.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You want to try it on?

      Rachel gives Raylan a hard look.  On they go.

      At the counter, a TEENAGER gets his tray of food, moves off.  
      Rollie and Mindy move up.  The counter man, HEC, 60, waits

                    many years.  

                                  MRS. PENA
                          (cut the crap)
                    And we are Mexican.

                                  ROLLIE
                          (simply)
                    Yes.

                                  MRS. PENA
                    I can t help you.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Mrs. Pena, Mindy and I are in 
                    danger.  

                                  MINDY
                    Please...

      Suddenly the TV turns off.  Don Jaime speaks.  

                                  DON JAIME
                          (in Spanish)
                    Rosa, leave us alone.  

      Mrs. Pena shoots him an angry look.

                                  MRS. PENA
                    This is my house, and my decision.

                                  DON JAIME
                          (in Spanish)
                    Who bought you this house?  

      Mrs. Pena hesitates, then walks out.  Don Jaime faces Rollie 
      and Mindy.  Now he speaks English.  

      Mindy feels her stomach.  Something is not sitting right. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    36.

                                  DON JAIME (CONT D)
                    Doctor, you ve been good to this 
                    family.  To my granddaughter.  I 
                    will try to help you.  

      Rollie exhales -- thank God.

                                  MINDY
                    Uh, may I use the bathroom?


      Mrs. Pena picks up the wall-phone, dials.

                                  911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                      Nine-one-one, what is your 
                      emergency?

      Mrs. Pena is about to speak when Mindy crosses through 
      quickly for the bathroom.  Mrs. Pena smiles at her, waits for 
      her to clear.  The second she s gone, the smile goes.

                    I want to talk to the police.

      Raylan and Rachel watch the FBI talking to Mrs. Pena and Don 
      Jaime in the living room.  Don Jaime s head hangs low.  He 
      nods, sighs.  He says something and the FBI SAC starts 
      talking to his men.


      Rollie and Mindy are on a freeway.  Mindy feels her gut go.

                                  MINDY
                    Uh-oh.

                                  ROLLIE
                    What?

                                  MINDY
                    My tummy.

                                  ROLLIE
                    You gotta go again?

                                  MINDY
                    I think so.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Make a fist. 

                                  MINDY
                    Make a fist?  

                                  ROLLIE
                    We have to keep to our schedule.

                                  ROLLIE
                    But we re making good time!

                                  MINDY
                    You want me to go in the car?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Okay, okay!  I ll pull over.  But I 
                    just want to know one thing.  Who 
                    the hell orders ceviche off a taco 
                    truck?

                                  MINDY
                    You know, Rollie, when I woke up I 
                    had a nice job, a nice car and a 
                    nice boyfriend who was a dentist.  
                    Now I m on the run with a former 
                    drug kingpin and I could really use 
                    one kind word before I poop and 
                    puke for the fourth time!

      The FBI has finished with Don Jaime.  They are on the move.  
      Jim goes to Raylan and Rachel.

                                  JIM
                    The old man set Pike up with a 
                    coyote.  Supposed to meet him at a 
                    Home Depot off the 805.

      Jim hurries out.

      Rachel starts to go with.  Raylan stays where he is, watching 
      Don Jaime.  

                                  RACHEL
                    Shall we?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just a sec.

      Raylan waits for the last of the FBI to clear out of the 
      house.  Raylan goes into the living room and up to Don Jaime, 
      takes off his hat.  Rachel hangs back, watches.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Se or.

      Don Jaime looks up.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    May I sit?

      Don Jaime shrugs.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I m sure you were hoping to put all 
                    this disruption behind you.  I can 
                    imagine it s jarring to have 
                    strangers asking questions.  I hope 
                    you ll permit me to ask just a few 
                    more.
                          (beat)
                    See, I understand your connection 
                    to Dr. Oldham.  I myself have a 
                      connection of a different sort.  I 
                    never baked him any food, like your 
                    daughter did, but you could fairly 
                    say I feel a sense of obligation to 
                    the man.  
                          (beat)
                    I know you understand this 
                      obligation.  Which is why I think 
                    you misled the men who just left.  

      Don Jaime doesn t react.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    I don t intend to tell them.  It s 
                    okay by me.  But you should know 
                    that without the proper 
                      information, bad men will find your 
                    dentist friend before I can.  
                          (beat)
                    They will kill him and they will 
                    kill the girl and I will do 
                      everything I can to keep that from 
                      happening.  Do you understand? 

      Now Don Jaime looks at Raylan. 

      Rachel looks at Raylan, too.  Surprised.  


      Rachel is on her cell with Raylan.

                                  RACHEL
                          (into cell)
