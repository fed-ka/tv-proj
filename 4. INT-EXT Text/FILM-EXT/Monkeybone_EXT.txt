A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES
HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the
way down to the street.
SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.
He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.
STANLEY
Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a
good shrink.
MONKEYBONE
Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you
how to stop sucking your thumb...
MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off
into the sunset.
STU, JULIE, and HERB in the parking lot. A small safari of FLUNKIES is
loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STU's beat-up car -
stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,
team jackets and more! STU groans at the sight of it...
HERB
They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look
at 'em before you say no...
(scanning the streets)
If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're
expecting a couple more trucks.
STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE.
HERB
Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go.
A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry
to the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:
It's His World. We Just Live in It!
MONKEYBONE
Sunday Nights This Fall
TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR
idles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy
LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...
His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The
asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,
lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this
SWERVED...
...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a
TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up
like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for
the prom - seem to be okay.
STU
Hey! Are you guys all right in there?
TEENAGE GIRL
We're fine.
STU
That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my
windshield - it practically killed us all!
(to JULIE)
God, Julie, if anything had happened to you -
JULIE
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
STU
I'd better go report this...
He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he
plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with
both hands.
JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is
glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.
JULIE
Dad's car?
The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.
Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,
like nails on a blackboard...
TEENAGE GIRL
What was that? Did you hear that?
The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the
TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it
TOPPLES. Directly toward...
JULIE
STU!!
ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH
He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.
STU
Operator? I want to report an accident.
Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming
down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes
widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...
CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE
A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which
STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an
insane, almost macabre grin.
The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a
DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...
STU'S POV: ON JULIE
He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,
working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.
JULIE
Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love
you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -
All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if
SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the
floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:
JULIE (V.O.)
I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...
And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down
through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing
SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...
An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes
close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:
A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of
an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a
vast black VOID...
...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not
unlike a disembodied FIST.
And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -
turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the
town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...
The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -
stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION
PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's
stranded - alone.
STU
Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?
(beat)
PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.
Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: "PSYCHOLOGICAL
BAGGAGE CLAIM." There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He
examines the TAGS. They all belong to him!
He sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...
- A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;
- An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the
Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;
- A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled "STU M. - GEOGRAPHY," its
inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;
- Transparent plastic models of "THE VISIBLE MAN" and his mate, "THE
VISIBLE WOMAN," with a couple of spare organs that young STU never
quite found a place for;
- A vinyl LP of "BREAD'S GREATEST HITS," which STU quickly slips back
into the suitcase lest anyone see it.
As he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...
RACCOON (o.s.)
Carry your bags, mister?
A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on
STU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated
pelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes
slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...
SNAKE
Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!
STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.
RABBIT
Wanna meet my sister?
These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the
tire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.
A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY
CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a
sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:
D RK TOWN
A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part. A SPOTLIGHT hits the
SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE! They rise up on their hind legs, put
on boater hats. One of them blows a note on a kazoo...
SINGING SPHINXES
Weeee...welcome you to Dark Town
And while you're in your coma
This odd amusement park-town
Will be your Home Sweet Homa -
STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES, with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his heels.
The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage.
It's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the
festive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect
and decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,
and given up halfway through.
STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small
group of OTHER HUMANS...
STU
Help me. Please. There's animals. They -
The humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches
one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.
VOICE
Pony ride, Mister?
He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The
COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!
The characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE
OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could
be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as
street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.
STU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:
- JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -
JOE CAMEL
Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?
- a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.
The marquee reads:
LIVE! NIGHTMARES! LIVE!
First-Run - Continuous Performances - Popular Prices
Rated NR-H - Not Recommended for Humans
- A CYCLOPS working as a barker at the Penny Arcade;
- A VIDEO RENTAL OUTLET - "BAD DREAMS VIDEO," offering your favorite
nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. A THREE-HEADED
DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and
recognizes STU, much to his horror.
HEAD #1
Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?
HEAD #2
We're big fans.
HEAD #3
Could we have your autograph?
Reduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above
the door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini
glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are
replaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.
The COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway.
It's a "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine - the kind where you slam down a
mallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and
storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE
- NO ADMITTANCE.
EARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the
entrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and
CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky...
All around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of
swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a
PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center.
The "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where
the bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL
MAN lifts its enormous mallet...
...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL
ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky. DING!! The SEAT hits the
BELL, but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP...
Then, with a distinct POP, he's gone. Over the rainbow...home.
STU
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How
come he goes back and I stay here?
MONKEYBONE
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
STU
(turning abruptly)
HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
STU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - who's climbing onto
his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with
him. MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.
STU
He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get
to wake up??
MONKEYBONE
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
STU
I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody
had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna
- I'm gonna kick ass!
MONKEYBONE
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
MONKEYBONE practically swoons. But the REAPER just stares at STU:
REAPER
SORRY, BUD. OFF-DUTY.
The REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway.
STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION.
MONKEYBONE
Stu? Stu? Let's calm down, talk things over. How
about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus
walks into a gay bar...
STU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside. They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the
Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a
baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER.
The ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!
STU/MONKEYBONE
(in unison - impressed)
Damn.
MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up.
MONKEYBONE
Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your
behavior...is disturbing me.
The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as
the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him!
The REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of
the "fingers" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the
end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING.
STU
That's right. Run! And don't come back unless
you've got my e-ticket!!
The REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb.
STU
Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of
here. I'll never see her again.
Just then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a
CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops...
MESSENGER BOY
Miley? Stu Miley?
STU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER
finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION:
YOU Are Invited to a
PAJAMA PARTY
at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY
Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp
"If You Snooze, You Lose"
STU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off.
STU
Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what
this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to
hear my case. I'm going home!
DISSOLVE TO:
CAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up,
up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of
the building...
...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES.
In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints.
Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight. Then the MAN
breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the
field, where a picnic blanket is waiting.
CLOSEUP - STU
HIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt.
STU
That - that's me.
CYCLOPS
Nice shirt, dude!
Paisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two. Toasts his beloved - who
is, of course, JULIE, the dreamer of the dream.
He pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her. But when she
tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS.
Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together
through the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy.
JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize...
that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER.
She looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her
MORPHS suddenly into...
The still-muttering REAPER wheels LULU toward the entrance to Dark Town.
The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance.
STU
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So
all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!
(beat)
Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
MONKEYBONE
Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be
Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
The REAPER approaches the GATES. He presses a remote-control BEEPER and
the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass
through.
STU realizes they've only got an instant to make their move. He DIVES
through the gates at top speed. As soon as he's on the other side, he
hears a nasty CLANG behind him...
MONKEYBONE is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and
out among the meshing teeth! STU gives him a good hard YANK, and he
slips out like a strand of fettuccine.
They hear RUMBLING on the tracks outside. A CAR is arriving!
The REAPER loads LULU into the little roller-coaster and climbs aboard.
The car begins to move. STU and MONKEYBONE get there just in time to
jump onto the LUGGAGE RACK in the back!
ON ROLLER-COASTER - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
They peep over the back of the car at the REAPER and wonder what to do
next. MONKEYBONE spies a TOOL KIT mounted under the rack - opens it, and
pulls out a big, nasty MONKEYWRENCH.
The boys nod in agreement. MONKEYBONE clambers over the back of the car
and hoists the wrench. STU covers his eyes. WHANG!
STU looks up - sees a confused MONKEYBONE alone in the car with LULU.
Now he clambers into the car as well.
STU
Where'd he go??
MONKEYBONE
I don't know.
There's no trace of the REAPER - except for a rumpled shroud, a
wristwatch, and a St. Christopher's medal on the floor of the car. The
boys exchange a puzzled shrug. MONKEYBONE tries on the watch.
DISSOLVE TO:
The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. Behind them, REAPERS
are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which
reads: "PROCESSING - THIS WAY."
By the time they can dust themselves off, an ALARM starts blaring.
REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time!
Nearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they
race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,
YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.
STU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with
it. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -
- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: "CYCLE REPAIR."
STU pedals onto the central turntable area. The BATWINGS on the rear of
the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly.
MONKEYBONE looks over his shoulder. A small ARMY of REAPERS, anned with
scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them.
MONKEYBONE
Stu...Stu...
STU
IT'S NOT WORKING.
MONKEYBONE
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
MONKEYBONE fiddles with the ignition switch. A BLACK CLOUD OF EXHAUST
belches violently from the rear of the bike, almost pitching them off
their seat. The batwings start to flap faster...
SPUT. BLAP. The engine BACKFIRES and DIES. STU fiddles with the switch,
but it's no go.
MONKEYBONE
Stu...LOOK!
STU
What?
MONKEYBONE
Isn't that Lulu?
LULU is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks, eyes
crossed, mouth agape. MONKEYBONE waves brightly. Then a mob of REAPERS
appears on either side of LULU's car, swarming out onto the tracks! STU
starts pedaling for his life.
He makes for the TRAIN TUNNELS in the far wall of the station.
ILLUMINATED SIGNS over the tunnels read: Calcutta...Hong Kong...Waco, TX
...and directly ahead...
Dark Town!! By now they're well out onto the turnaround. STU pedals
frantically, BOUNCING over tracks and ties. MONKEYBONE bites his
fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of REAPERS
pursuing them onto the tracks.
The boys are almost at the Dark Town tunnel. The REAPERS, on foot, will
never be able to catch them. But as they pick up speed for the stretch
run, the GROUND begins to move beneath them!
DEATH has activated the TRAIN TURNAROUND - the rotating platform at the
end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction. Before they
know it, they're doing a full 180!
The boys continue to bounce down the tracks - but the tunnel entrances
seem to be SPINNING before their eyes. Before they know it, they're
pedaling directly TOWARD the mob of ANGRY REAPERS!!
MONKEYBONE
Weren't we just here?
STU jerks the handlebars HARD RIGHT and JUMPS THE TRACK he's on. He
WINCES IN PAIN as the bike BOUNCES over a series of rails...
MONKEYBONE
What'd I tell you? You go to the Land of Death,
wear a jockstrap!
The REAPERS are SPREADING OUT around the turntable - encircling it! STU
rides around the periphery of the great turning platter, but there's no
getting off. They're completely surrounded!
MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear. But STU is rattling the
ignition switch, making ONE LAST EFFORT to get the bike aloft...
THE ENGINE CATCHES. Trailing black fumes, the BICYCLE RISES! The REAPERS
converge in its path, and RAISE THEIR SCYTHES...
But the bike JUST MANAGES TO CLEAR the tangle of scythes - leaving the
REAPERS slicing at empty air!
MONKEYBONE is sitting on STU's shoulder, facing backward, thumbing his
nose at the REAPERS. STU glances back as well, laughing, unable to
believe his own good luck.
Since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the
sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH.
It's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the
closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -
- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING
STU against the ground underneath!
STU'S DREAMSCAPE
No bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table,
with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF-
FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing
their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS...
Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a
canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand...
MONKEYBONE
This ain't my nightmare!
MONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled
canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE
DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them
to ribbons.
An exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last
stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the
bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have
all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder...
STU
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've
made it without you.
MONKEYBONE
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
STU
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like
there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's
gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay
when I'm gone?
MONKEYBONE
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
STU
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure
wish I could take you home with me.
The gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind
a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him
a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT.
MONKEYBONE
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well,
there's a new twist.
STU
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I
really do love y--
He turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU
crumples in a heap...
MONKEYBONE
Love you too. Boss.
Laughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF
DOWN THE MIDWAY!!
STU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his
feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet,
STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!!
STU
Stop! Monkeybone! Please!!
The STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's
the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is.
MONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the
receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers...
As STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and
TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him -
forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE.
STU
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET!
HE'S GOT MY -
HYPNOS
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got
big plans for that body of yours!
The familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky
overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him
look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR-
STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride!
ONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The
tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART-
HELMET strikes the black hole dead center.
STU WATCHES HELPLESSLY as MONKEYBONE penetrates the veil of the sky and
VANISHES. He's still SCREAMING when the cackling DARKTOWNERS drag him
out of the plaza by the heels...
STU
NO! JULIE! NO-O-O-O!
AERIAL SHOT - ON MONKEYBONE
ROCKETING UPWARD through the clouds in his dart-helmet, a look of SHEER
EXHILARATION on his simian face. Somewhere a CLOCK begins to chime the
hour...
STU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk
of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat.
KIMMY
I just couldn't stand the thought of you
suffering. I love you so, I would never have...
forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me.
STU-BONE
Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If
anything ever happens to you, I'll be right
there to return the favor.
(baring his teeth)
So drive carefully! From now on.
He climbs out. KIMMY is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car
parked in front of her. She PEELS OUT with the hand brake still on.
JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway.
STU
How was it? I don't recall.
JULIE
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind
his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his
balance and topples down the stairs O.S.
DISSOLVE TO:
SUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a
corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL
GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of
A Hard Day's Night, only more so.
A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy
intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE.
He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF
behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief
and MOPS SWEAT from his brow.
Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY
HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they
scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes.
Suddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal
with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move
anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...
...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of
him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the
frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style.
HYPNOS
You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS
THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your
booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make
nightmares!!
STU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL.
HYPNOS
Now find that nightmare juice and get to work.
'Cause you may be a free man during the day...
but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine!
He winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE.
Laughter and back-slapping as STU-BONE walks his guests to their cars.
STU
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo
benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with
Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.
HERB
A piata. That's a great idea!
STU-BONE
You guys don't know it, but you just saved my
ass!
With a big grin, he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass, in obvious
imitation of the doll, and then gives the thumbs-up sign. The unnerved
EXECS gape at him as he goes back inside - he's developed an odd, loping
gait, and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks.
BURGER GOD EXEC
Interesting fellow.
HERB
Head trauma.
STU-BONE steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl - BUSTER is
giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence. STU-BONE's eyes
light up with inspiration.
STU-BONE
C'mere, boy...c'mere, ole buddy...
BUSTER is apparently ALONE now - he's pacing in circles under a HIGH
TREE BRANCH, staring up and GROWLING. Someone throws a PINE CONE at the
picket fence. BUSTER'S HEAD TURNS, just for an instant -
STU-BONE
KREEEGAHHHH!!!
- and STU-BONE plunges out of the tree, DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE DOG! The
two of them GRAPPLE, rolling around on the grass.
For a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way. Then
STU-BONE gets on top of BUSTER, STRADDLES HIM, shoves the ASS of the
Monkeybone doll up against his muzzle...
FOONT! A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face. The dog
goes limp. His eyes roll back in his head. He starts to TWITCH.
STU-BONE
Sweet dreams, you little bastard!
Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with
both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR. Lights go on all over the
neighborhood. ANGRY NEIGHBORS poke their heads out the windows.
CAMERA TRACKS IN on the twitching face of BUSTER, and we see
BUSTER'S DREAM (BLACK & WHITE)
A German-expressionist nightmare, all low angles and heavy shadows.
We're in some kind of OPERATING ROOM, where a struggling PATIENT is
being wheeled in on a tall, creaking GURNEY. Four ORDERLIES in surgical
masks are holding him down.
The PATIENT is BUSTER. And the ORDERLIES...are CATS.
A CAT SURGEON draws the sheet back. Looks at the spreadeagled BUSTER.
And brandishes a big nasty pair of GARDEN SHEARS.
STU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a
crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup.
HERB
You're really gonna pop the question?
STU-BONE
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as
they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and
it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
HERB
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the
center of attention. Now you're proposing, in
public, at a benefit.
STU-BONE
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity
now, do I really want to get married? But on the
other hand, if you're married, they can't
testify against you.
HERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle.
LIVERIED WAITERS scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit. ZOO
WORKERS set up tables and chairs underneath a giant CANOPY.
STU-BONE watches with satisfaction as the last of the DOLLS is loaded
into a giant piata in the shape of STANLEY.
WIPE TO:
GUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and
habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON.
The BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a
tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He
sputters and coughs...
Then he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them
chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in
her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification.
O.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in.
O.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit -
barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along!
A BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws
everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU.
As HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his
face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off
...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement...
POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION
The nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at
once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!!
JULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the
food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA.
JULIE
Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it.
CLARISSA
That's not true, Julie. It's not true.
ALICE
This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could
be innocent people in danger.
CLARISSA
He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu.
(beat)
I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
day he pinched me on the butt.
ALICE
I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you
have to tell the police.
JULIE
Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete.
All I have is a feeling.
All of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the
reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED
MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.
CLARISSA
Oh my God, we've got a flasher.
JULIE
That...that's Herb!
The GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and
CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC:
HERB
CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working
together. All of them. Shirts...pants...
ENSEMBLES...!
The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.
BUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will
carry him, in pursuit of the BUS.
She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD.
JULIE
Please. Where did you take that man...?
The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering
out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet...
JULIE
Who are you? Why did you say those things?
O.D. STU
Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land
of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he
got my body, see? All they had left for me was
this corpse!
JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.
O.D. STU
Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give
people nightmares!
(no response)
Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They
were pulling the plug - I called out to you -
and you heard me. Remember?
This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single
tear rolling down her cheek. And then...
JULIE
BUSTER?!?
The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van,
barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns -
JULIE
Stu...how?
O.D. STU
I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you
this.
THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's
antique ring.
O.D. STU
I meant to give it to you before. The night we
crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to
remember me like that, okay? Not like this.
She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS
WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise.
JULIE
What's wrong?
O.D. STU
I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm
all dried up.
JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just
arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over.
ALICE
Detective, please let this man out of the van.
The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PIATA,
which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good
hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear...
STU-BONE
Okay, folks, it's piata time - you know the
rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's
all for the benefit of our friends the animals!
(eyes brightening)
Oooooh! This one's on me!
The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces
her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat.
STU-BONE
Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up!
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in
tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -
- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as
the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS...
ORGANIZER
I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit.
Surely this can wait until -
COP
Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on
a most urgent matter.
JULIE
Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered
with. They're toxic!
O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED
DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley
figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE.
O.D. STU
MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK.
The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE
clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.
O.D. STU
I mean it this time. Back in the pack.
STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the
moment as O.D. STU approaches.
STU-BONE
Stu...I can explain...I was sick of being a
figment, see? It's awful being a figment. It's
degrading! And I never really wanted to give
people nightmares. I just told 'em that so
they'd help me get a body.
O.D. STU
Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you simian
shitbird!
The COPS are tres confused by all this -
COP
Ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going
on here?
- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out. Now STU-
BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled
crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this.
STU-BONE
Laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the
happy little monkey. He doesn't have any
feelings. He's just a figment of your
immagination!
He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE -
STU-BONE
GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT!
He wails on the piata like Ken Griffey Jr. O.D. STU tries to stop him,
but it's too late - the piata BURSTS, and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground!
An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up. The
COPS swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back...
COP
HE'S GETTING AWAY!
STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN
JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant
MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above!
O.D. STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE -
O.D. STU
I LOVE YOU!
JULIE
STU!!
STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. Now
freed, the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR, CARRYING HIM ALOFT!
O.D. STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift
away. He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past.
And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search
of O.D. STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON
THE END OF THE ROPE!
HEAD SURGEON
LOOK! IT'S HIM!
They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's
additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the
ground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the
balloon!
STU-BONE
Let...go...you...dingleberry...
As he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the
balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR.
For about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a
heap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a
WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws
snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook.
As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length
of the rope.
He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to
push him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE...
...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's
midsection! He tries to pull himself together...
A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL.
Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he
knows, the SERVER is DRENCHED!
The SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the
punchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY!
HEAD SURGEON
Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved!
One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes.
BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR
WIRE atop a tall storm fence.
They clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate.
They're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are
LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them!
As O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out...
It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he
can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL
TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but
a TIGER gets the other end -
- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending
the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The
HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver...
HEAD SURGEON
Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved.
ANGLE ON BALLOON
STU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision
...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both
ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP...
The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean
punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful
when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the
table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base...
...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in
punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END...
...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the
SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE
CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES
DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...
... at a pair of COPS who are over by the piata, loading CONFISCATED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off
their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!
The COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE
underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing
GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs.
The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got
BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.
HEAD SURGEON
Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved!
COPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full
of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes
ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT...
WATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them
around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds!
ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE
The balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward,
toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically!
A COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon.
COP
I think I can bring 'em down.
ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
BLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass.
With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE
snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air!
ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL
AT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of
the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN...
THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE
...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a
hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up
fast!
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.
ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING
...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the
parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.
Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...
AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT
...and the fight continues - even into the afterlife! As they plummet
down through the heavens, they REVERT to their true personae. It's STU
vs. MONKEYBONE, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out - like a
couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!
DARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead.
They're placing bets, rooting their favorites on. Then...
THE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all
directions, DIVING for the nearest hiding place. They seem to know what
this mighty rumbing signifies.
The E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air -
and a COLOSSUS appears beneath it! A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in JAPANESE
CEREMONIAL ARMOR, he TOWERS over Dark Town, so mighty and enormous that
he can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat!!
ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING
STU lands a HAYMAKER, and the two of them break loose of each other -
ON ARMORED COLOSSUS - THAT MOMENT
- LANDING in the upturned palms of the COLOSSUS! STU watches in
disbelief as a PANEL pops open in the giant's CHEST, revealing...
STU
DEATH!!
DEATH
I dress up when I want to make an impression. -
So how'd it go?
STU
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye,
everything's gonna be okay.
(shrugging)
I guess I'm yours now.
MONKEYBONE
Death, I'd like to point out that none of this
was my fault. The roots of this tragedy go back
to a callous, uncaring society that -
DEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together.
Man and monkey are surely squished. But when DEATH opens his hands, STU
is still there, cupped safely in his palms.
STU
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
DEATH
Back in your head, where he belongs.
(beat)
No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda
vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without
him.
STU
Back? You're sending me back?
DEATH
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of
yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus"
guy instead.
STU
Death! Thank you!
DEATH
Thank me next time you see me.
He sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD INTO THE STRATOSPHERE with a single flick
of his finger. Then he turns...
DEATH
Ohhhh, Hypnos??
A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the
middle of the town square.
HYPNOS
Death! So nice to see you. I can explain -
He looks up tremulously. A GIANT SHADOW falls across him...followed by a
GIANT ARMORED FOOT.
JULIE SOBS in a POLICEMAN's arms at the exit to the zoo.
JULIE
I don't know what happened. All I know is...he
was in a coma...and then he came back...and now
he's gone again.
They wander out. Behind them, a squad of COPS are confiscating
MONKEYBONE DOLLS from squawling children as they file out.
The TWO CORPSES, on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the
police ambulance. The SURGEON and his team come wandering up.
SURGEON
Excuse me. We lost a corpse - we saw him heading
this way...
DRIVER
I got a couple of fresh ones in the back. Help
yourself.
The SURGEON pulls the sheet off CORPSE #1 - aka O.D. STU.
SURGEON
I'll be. It's him all right. Still dead...
The SECOND CORPSE sits up abruptly. His sheet falls away, revealing STU
...the real STU...now back in his own body! The SURGEON and his TEAM run
away from the ambulance SHRIEKING.
BUSTER barks like a maniac. JULIE turns and sees an IMPOSSIBLE VISION
ambling toward her...STU, alive and kicking. She can't believe it's him
until he grabs her and pulls her close.
JULIE
Is it you? Is it really you this time?
He pulls her close and kisses her long and hard, quelling all doubts.
JULIE
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
STU
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
They wander off, arm in arm. STU TUGS at the seat of his pants.
JULIE
What's the matter?
STU
My tail itches.
He DOES A TAKE as he realizes what he's just said - but JULIE smiles,
and he shrugs it off. Johnny Mercer's "DREAM" comes up underneath as the
reunited lovers walk off into the moonlight, and we
FADE OUT.
