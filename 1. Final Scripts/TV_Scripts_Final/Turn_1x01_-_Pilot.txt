 ACT ONE

EXT. CONNECTICUT COAST - AERIAL - DAY

Skimming the waves of the Atlantic toward a sandy beach, a
green coastline.  Rising up above the trees to look out across
raw, untouched land that stretches for miles.   

AMERICA before it was ours.  

We FLY over forest, over farmland.  Massive, GREEN, sun-
kissed.  Bursting at the seams with promise.

EXT. CLEARING - AERIAL - DAY

We GLIDE above the treeline, like God inspecting his good
work.  The FOREST drops away to reveal a pastoral clearing. 
Green grass turned Rust Red with spilled blood.

23 DEAD MEN lie scattered below a HILL.  We slow our flight
and circle the massacre.

CLOSER - the dead are soldiers in blue coats, light breeches,
knee-high black boots with silver spurs.  CONTINENTALS.

Morning FOG mixes with powder smoke still fresh in the air. 
A KILLER moves along the fallen like a grim reaper, shoving
a bayonet in each one to make sure they're dead.  He's dressed
in a green double breasted coat with dark brown leggings.  A
SCOTS BONNET on his head.  A QUEEN'S RANGER.

STAB.  On to the next.  STAB.  That body groans.  STAB STAB. 
On to the next.  Like raking leaves.

RACK FOCUS to a corpse ten feet away.  Its eye OPENS.  Sees
the Ranger coming this way.  STAB.  Walk.  STAB.  Walk.  

Face still pressed to the ground, the eye looks up to the
HILL, where figures of MEN sing in the smoke of cook-fires.

The eye closes, playing possum.  The RANGER STABS the corpse
next to us.  Then walks to us.  Moccasins on his feet. 
Looming over, he casts a shadow.  Raises his bayonet.  STABS-

As this corpse TURNS - the bayonet drives into the earth, as
ANOTHER BLADE DRIVES UP INTO THE RANGER'S GROIN.  He doubles
over, wheezing in shock, coming face to face with BENJAMIN
TALLMADGE, 23, very much alive.  Ben pulls his bayonet free
and JAMS IT through the Ranger's chin, piercing his vocal
cords.  Blood runs out his mouth and down Ben's wrist.  

The Ranger hits the ground next to Ben, who stays down.  Ben
begins to wrestle his own blue coat off, and grab for the
Ranger's green one.  He looks quickly back to... 2.

ATOP THE HILL

Where FORTY RANGERS clad in Green and Brown relax after the
battle, paying no attention to the clearing below.  Not a
man among them has been wounded in the skirmish.  In addition
to their muskets, they carry TOMAHAWKS and KNIVES.  

CAMERA finds their leader, ROBERT ROGERS, 43, weathered muscle
over an alchoholic's gut, eyes that you never want to look
directly into.  The ultimate hunter/killer.  He lights a
steatite pipe, listens to his men singing songs. 

A rough-looking Ranger walks to slope, looks down the hill.  

The man among the dead is walking to the treeline.  

RANGER
Welsh!  Welsh!

IN THE CLEARING 

Ben freezes, his back to the hill.  He's wearing the Green
Coat and the Scots Bonnet and carrying the bayoneted rifle. 
He turns slightly to regard the figure atop the rise.     

RANGER (CONT'D)
You done yet?!

Ben makes the universal gesture for "I'm hurrying already,
shut up!"  He looks down at a fallen comrade, grits his teeth
and STABS the already-dead body to ensure his cover.  

Walks to the next.  A 20 year old boy with lifeless eyes. 
Ben STABS him in the chest, tears in his own eyes.  Moves on
to the next - STAB - working his way to the treeline through
a hell he will never forget... 

ATOP THE HILL

The rough-looking Ranger walks back to the cook fire.

RANGER (CONT'D)
Fool starts from the center and works
his way out.  Takes double the time.  

Chuckles around the camp.  Robert Rogers does not smile.  

He puts his pipe in his mouth and walks to the slope.

Sees a figure in the fog, heading for the treeline.  

Rogers watches him.  Then WHISTLES loudly.  Ben turns back. 
Rogers knows.  He shoulders his musket, pipe still in mouth.3.

Ben RUNS, enters the forest.  Rogers FIRES.  His men TURN. 
The round whistles through the branches and CLIPS Ben on the
shoulder (even at this range).  Ben stumbles, keeps running.

RANGERS stream down the hill past Rogers as he reloads.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Ben RUNS through the forest, breathing hard, branches whipping
at him as the foreground blurs and the sound drops away...

BEN (V.O.)
They were waiting for us.  They knew
where we'd be.

GENERAL SCOTT (V.O.)
They couldn't have known.

BEN (V.O.)
They were waiting.  

CUT TO:

INT. COLONIAL HOUSE - NIGHT

Ben, his shoulder wound dressed, but dirt still on his face,
stares defiantly at his superior, GENERAL CHARLES SCOTT,
territorial and traditional.  

Scott sits across a simple dining room table converted into
a desk.  He does not react to Ben's emotion. 

GENERAL SCOTT
How.

BEN
These weren't Tory Militia, or
Regulars. 

With his good arm, Ben rustles up the Green Jacket and Bonnet
and dumps them on the table.  

BEN (CONT'D)
They were Queen's Rangers, and this
was an ambush planned in advance.

Scott feels the wool bonnet.  Disturbed by this revelation.  

GENERAL SCOTT
Robert Rogers? 
(Ben nods)
It was luck, then.  Bad luck, that
you ran into him.  4.

BEN
Luck had nothing to do with it.  

Beat.  General Scott begins to fill out a commission.  

GENERAL SCOTT
After you see to that shoulder, I'll
assign you new men, new horses. 

BEN
No, Sir.  

Scott stops his quill, looks at Ben.  

GENERAL SCOTT
You're resigning your commission?

BEN
I won't head another reconnaisance
south of Westchester.  I have no
wish to quietly lead more men to
their death.  

GENERAL SCOTT
You think that's my aim? 

Scott angrily draws out a letter from his drawer.  Reads it. 

GENERAL SCOTT (CONT'D)
"I earnestly entreat you to spare no
effort to come at early and true
intelligence regarding British troop
strength, supply levels, naval
reinforcements..." 
(slams letter down)
These are orders.  From General
Washington.  

BEN
The truth on the ground is that
scouting runs are suicide.  We need
to do better.  Sir.

GENERAL SCOTT
Define better.

BEN
All I need to begin with is one man,
to serve as courier between myself,
and a friend in New York.   

GENERAL SCOTT
New York.  After Washington has burned
it to the ground upon our retreat.  5.

The General scoffs.  This kid doesn't know what he's talking
about.

GENERAL SCOTT (CONT'D)
Captain Tallmadge... you want the
truth on the ground?

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - DAY

GENERAL SCOTT (V.O.)
You have no friends in New York.  

The SUN RISES over well tended fields of green.  A FARMHOUSE
sits in the distance, chimney smoking.  Cool blue dawn.  

SUPER: INK SCRIPT writes across the bottom left of the screen:

Setauket, Long Island


Along the planted rows of cabbage and kale, ABRAHAM WOODHULL,
22, plays with his one-year-old son, THOMAS.  Abe is a tall
and lean farmer, intelligent and humble.  

Right now he's on all fours, just like Thomas, who hasn't
learned to walk yet.  Abe stands up, acting a bit wobbly,
and takes a few steps, hoping Thomas will do the same.  

ABE
See?  It's easy.  You just... walk.

Thomas stares at him, transfixed.  Then laughs.

THOMAS
Jus' ba!

Abe patiently smiles, properly chastised for his efforts.  

INT. WOODHULL HOUSE - DAY

MARY WOODHULL, 20, cooks breakfast.  A BRITISH REDCOAT walks
into the kitchen, fastening the buttons on his jacket.  He
nods to Mary, respectfully.  She returns the nod, which is
directed at an iron urn.  The Regular pours his own coffee.   

They maintain the unique distance, posture, and tension of
someone living in your house who is neither friend nor family.

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - DAY

The Redcoat, BAKER, exits the house and walks through the
field with his rifle and haversack, on his way to duty.

Abe's smile fades.  He picks Thomas up into his arms.  

Thomas happily CALLS OUT to the Redcoat, and waves to him.  6.

The Soldier waves back.  As he disappears around the bend,
Abe sets Thomas back down, to get him to try again.    

Mary walks up, wiping her hands on her apron.  

MARY
Sure you want him to walk so soon?  

THOMAS
He's almost a year old.  

MARY
Faster he learns to walk, the sooner
he learns to march.  

ABE
Good point.  

Abe lies back on the soil next to Thomas. 

ABE (CONT'D)
You're a smart one, Thomas.  Just
like your Ma'.  

Thomas happily crawls on to Abe.  Mary smiles at her men.  

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - LATER

Later in the day, Woodhull tends to his crop, along with two
AFRICAN SLAVES.  

One of the Slaves shows him a head of cabbage that is being
devoured by MAGGOTS.  Abe, worried, looks out over the field -
about half of his crop seems affected.  

Abe nods, ruefully accepting this fate, and then explosively
HURLS the head of cabbage as far as he can throw it.  

EXT. SETAUKET - EVENING

A small coastal town halfway out on Long Island.  Abe drives
his wagon past the central feature - a Presbyterian Church
converted into a military barrack.  The graveyard has been
overturned and the building fortified with an earthwork topped
with sharpened wooden poles, built to withstand a frontal
attack.  Swivel guns are set in the church windows.  REDCOATS
DRILL in a march outside.  

EXT. ROE TAVERN - EVENING

Abe brings his wagon to a stop outside of a white two story
house converted into a tavern.  He can hear laughing inside.

Abe takes a deep breath, steels himself for what he must do.  7.

INT. ROE TAVERN - EVENING

Several rough tables are set up.  A staircase leads to the
second floor, where there are rooms to let.  

BRITISH REGULARS mix with TORY TOWNIES at one table, getting
drunk and sharing stories.  One of the Tory farmers, WILL
ROBESON, walks away laughing and approaches the kitchen where
the drinks are served.  Waiting there is SELAH STRONG, 30,
quick tempered and proud, the owner of this Tavern.

ROBESON
Mr. Strong.  Four ales, please.

SELAH
Four shillings, please.

ROBESON
Be a good man and put it on Captain
Joyce's account. 

He nods to the Redcoats behind him.  CAPTAIN JOYCE is rosy
cheeked and holding court.  Selah watches them, silent.

Robeson grins and takes the now free drinks, singing his way
back to distribute them.  Selah glares after him. 

Abe enters the tavern.  Eyes turn to him.  He removes his
tricorne hat and nods politely to the guests.

He makes eye contact with Selah, who registers surprise and
suspicion at Abe's presence.  Abe crosses to him, hat off. 

ABE
Good evening, Selah.  

SELAH
I thought you didn't drink. 

Abe slides a burlap pouch across the bar.   Selah, wary,
peeks inside - it is filled with a mishmash of various
currencies - British pound sterling, Spanish and Portuguese
coins, German guineas.

SELAH (CONT'D)
What's this?

ABE
I said I would repay my debt.

SELAH
We're only halfway through the
season...  8.

ABE
This is only half of what I owe.
(beat)
And all that I can do for now. 

Selah stares at Abe.  The table of British bursts into
laughter (at some other joke - they can't hear Abe).  Selah
ignores them, fixing his stare.  Abe looks down. 

ABE (CONT'D)
Harvest isn't coming in as I hoped.

SELAH
Loopers?  Or Maggots?

ABE
I just need more time.  

SELAH
(considering)
More time.
(as if it's a new
concept)
More time.  Why don't you just wait
till next season?  Perhaps by then
Major Hewlett will have confiscated
the rest of my plantation, and signed
it over to your father.  Then you
could just... pay me back with my
own cauliflower.

Before a stung Abe can respond...

ANNA (O.S.)
Abraham?  

Both men turn.  Descending the stairs is ANNA STRONG, 22,
Selah's wife.  Time seems to stop for Abe as Anna's radiant
smile traps him where he stands.  Selah looks frustrated.    

ANNA (CONT'D)
To what do we owe the pleasure?

SELAH
(edged)
Abe and I were just discussing
maggots.

ANNA
Maggots?

CAPTAIN JOYCE (O.S.)
Mrs. Strong!  Here!  Here!9.

The Redcoats and Robeson TOAST to Anna.  She smiles and nods
her hospitality, while under her smile she sweetly asides-

ANNA
I hear they've been dethroned as
Setauket's reigning pests.
(louder, to Redcoats)
Your rooms are ready, Gentlemen!

Abe smiles at her, then catches Selah looking at him.

ABE
I should be off.

ANNA
Now, wait.  We hardly see you anymore. 
How is Mary?  And Thomas?

ABE
They're well, thank you.  I...

ANNA
You should come for dinner.  At our
house.  The three of you.

SELAH
Anna-

ABE
That wouldn't feel right.

Anna's smile retreats to quite alarm, as if she fears what
Abe will say next.  

ABE (CONT'D)
I owe your husband a great deal of
money, and would be shamed for you
to cook for us while I'm in arrears.

Now it's Selah's turn to look surprised - didn't expect Abe
to admit that.  Anna turns to her husband, taken aback.

ANNA
I didn't know about this.

SELAH
It's a private matter.

ROBESON cries out, standing on his chair, drunk.

ROBESON
A poem!  I have written.  
(MORE)10.

ROBESON (CONT'D)
I should like to dedicate it to the
brave Patriot commander, on the eve
of his retreat, pardon me, his charge
into northern New Jersey.

The British laugh.  Selah fumes.  Robeson reads from a paper.

ROBESON (CONT'D)
"Where are the rebels now?  Pulled
back from the line, a most propitious
sign, for Mrs. Washington, that sow!"

Selah stares at Robeson, furious.  The Redcoats laugh, all
except one.  LT. SIMCOE, black hair, dark eyes, quietly stares
at Anna.  She shakes off the chill, looks away.  

ROBESON (CONT D) (CONT'D)
"Alas, before his return, dear Georgie
must discern, in what place will he
sheathe his saber; I ll dare to opine,
that many months from now - nine,
the evidence will be found in
another s 'labor'; Now a whole army
could be made from this bastardized
Kingdom.  But surely you must all
know; that the joke of it all, is
that his scabbard calls for any puff s
sword he can stow!"

The Redcoats pound the table.  JOYCE laughing the hardest.  

SELAH
(dark, to Anna)
Go upstairs.

ANNA
Selah, don't...

Selah crosses the tavern to Robeson.  

SELAH
Get out, Robeson.

ROBESON
I'm sorry, did I offend your sensitive
liberal twat?

SELAH
You offended my wife.  And you offend
me.  Now leave.

CAPTAIN JOYCE
Come off it, man.  We're celebrating
your King's victory in New York.11.

Robeson jumps down from his chair, gets in Selah's face. 
Abe tenses, steps in front of Anna.  

ROBESON
Though we understand how that might
upset a certain delegate to the
Provincial Congress-

SELAH
Drunk.

ROBESON
Whig. 

His breath wafts into Selah's nose.  Selah grabs his wrist,
crumpling the poem.  Robeson swings with his beer clutching
hand and Selah bats it away.  The beer SPILLS onto Joyce's
lap, staining his breeches.  Joyce goes red in the face.

The Redcoats chuckle, taunting their comrade.

SIMCOE
(in an official voice)
Uniform soiled: twenty lashings.

Joyce EXPLODES out of his chair and grabs Selah by the collar,
pulls him close.  Selah SHOVES Joyce with BOTH HANDS.  He
falls back onto the table.  

Robeson swats at Selah who turns and PUNCHES his teeth out.

The table stands.  Joyce flies into a rage at Selah, charging
him.  He knocks Selah off his feet.  Selah lands hard.

Joyce draws his CAVALRY SABER.  It sings out of his sheathe
with the sound of no turning back.  Anna SCREAMS.  

Joyce rears his elbow back to run Selah through.  Just then
he is GRABBED from behind by ABE.  

ABE
He's down!  He surrenders!

Abe pins his arms back and Joyce grunts in pain, dropping
his sword.  Captain Joyce struggles but Abe pulls his arms
tighter, draws him away from the fight.  He backs right into
a PISTOL pointed at the back of his head.  Held by SIMCOE.

SIMCOE
Release the Captain.  Please.

Abe does.  Captain Joyce turns and gut-punches Abe.  Simcoe
looks disappointed - he might've blown Abe's head off if
given another moment.  Joyce throws Abe to the ground. 12.

Abe locks eyes with Selah.  Joyce begins to kick the shit
out of Abe as the Redcoats and Robeson CHEER AND ROAR.  

CUT TO:

EXT. SETAUKET - DAY

A noose is thrown over a tree, and the rope is fastened to
the trunk by Will Robeson and three other TORY TOWNIES.

Behind them, a horse and RIDER canters into the village green. 
The rider wears a black coat, is a stern looking man in his
forties, with deep set eyes and the bearing of a Dean or
Professor.  This is JUDGE MAGISTRATE RICHARD WOODHULL.     

The Tories stop what they are doing and nod respectfully to
the Judge.  Richard fixes Robeson with a withering stare. 
He continues on toward the church.   

Richard approaches the REDCOAT GUARDS at the church doors.

RICHARD
Is the Major in?

One of the Guards nods, but gives a signal to wait.  We
recognize this man as the one who was billeted at Abe's farm.

INT. SETAUKET CHURCH - DAY

The pews and pulpit have been torn out so that horses may be
stabled inside.  MAJOR HEWLETT himself is calmly disciplining
Captain Joyce, who stands at rigid attention.  Hewlett is
37, confident in his intellectual superiority.

HEWLETT
Law.  Order.  Authority.  We are the
beacon of authority in these colonies,
Captain.  And we bear the burden of
that authority.  

CAPTAIN JOYCE
Yes, Sir.

HEWLETT
"Because authority, thought it err
like others, hath yet a kind of
medicine in itself that skins the
vice o' the top."  Do you understand?

CAPTAIN JOYCE
(not at all)
Yes, Sir.  

Hewlett sagely nods.  Self-satisfied.  Then, briskly:13.

HEWLETT
Conduct Unbecoming.  One hundred
lashes.  Drunk and Disorderly.  One
hundred and fifty lashes.  Colonel
Price shall administer the discipline. 
Dismissed.  

Joyce looks straight ahead, imagining the public humiliation.  

EXT. SETAUKET CHURCH - DAY

Joyce exits quickly past Judge Woodhull, who is allowed entry.

INT. SETAUKET CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Major Hewlett is attending to his dappled gray horse as
Richard enters and removes his hat.  

HEWLETT
I knew you would come.

RICHARD
I just wished to offer my assistance,
for whatever it may be worth.

HEWLETT
This is not a matter for the
provincial court.  One of my men was
assaulted, and this must be redressed.  

RICHARD
Without question.  But by the look
of Captain Joyce just now, I can
tell there's more to the story.  I
thought I might be able to shed light
on a few facts, in the service of
clarity. 

Hewlett respects Richard, considers him a near equal.  He
also knows why Richard is truly here.  He sighs.

HEWLETT
You weren't there, Richard. 

RICHARD
True.  Direct evidence and testimony
matter most.  But I thought I
should... disclose what I know no
matter how circumstantial or
embarrassing it might be.   

HEWLETT
Embarrassing?  14.

RICHARD
Well, it involves some social history
of Setauket.  Provincial ephemera,
and the passions of young people. 
Probably worthless--

HEWLETT
What history?

Richard, a subtle manipulator, hesitates before moving on,
letting Hewlett get more and more hooked on his lead.

RICHARD
Anna Strong, the wife of Selah Strong,
was engaged three years ago to marry
Abraham Woodhull, when her name was
Anna Smith...

HEWLETT
You mean Abraham your son.  

RICHARD
(moving right past it)
Yes they were childhood friends, you
see.  And the Smiths were also good
family friends.  Until Joseph Smith's
patriot politics drove us to
disagreement.  Anna, unfortunately,
took her father's views to heart,
and so broke the heart of my son,
who was raised to love the law above
all else.
(beat)
"Love will not be spurred to what it
loathes."

Richard waits.  Too far with the Shakespeare?

HEWLETT
So then why would he rush to the aid
of her husband?  A suspected patriot?

Richard sucks his tooth.  This is the embarrassing part.  

RICHARD
Abraham has a... dreamer's heart.  A
romantic heart.  His mother's heart,
to be honest.  And he keeps room in
there for Anna, in spite of her
betrayal.  

Hewlett nods, finding kinship with that kind of character.

HEWLETT
Chivalry.15.

RICHARD
The passions of young people.

HEWLETT
Alas, that love, so gentle in his
view...

RICHARDHEWLETT
...Should be so...Should be so tyrannous
tyrannous and rough inand rough in proof.
proof.  

Not too far.  Just right.

INT. ROE TAVERN - CELLAR - NIGHT

Abe and Selah are bound with rope, under guard.  

The cellar door opens and boots stomp down.  It is SIMCOE.

SIMCOE
Your room is ready.

EXT. ROE TAVERN - NIGHT

Abe and Selah are marched out by four Tories.  Suddenly, Abe
is stopped, and Selah is pushed on.

Simcoe pulls a knife and walks behind Abe.

ABE
What are you doing?

Simcoe cuts through his binds.  Abe spins and backs away,
but Simcoe just ignores him and follows the men marching
Selah off into the night.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Where are you taking him?

SIMCOE
It's past curfew.  Run home to your
father. 

Selah looks back at Abe with a terrified glance as he is
pushed away into darkness.

END ACT ONE16.

ACT TWO

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - NIGHT

Abe walks home under the moonlight.  Candles flicker in the
windows of his house.  He holds his bruised rib cage.

Rain starts to patter on the cabbage leaves.

INT. WOODHULL HOUSE - NIGHT

Abe's wife Mary and his father, Richard, turn as Abe enters. 
Rain begins to hit the window panes.

MARY
Let me see you.

Mary stands and quickly crosses to Abe.  She impatiently
checks Abe's damage as if inspecting a sick horse.   

ABE
I'm alright.
(to Richard)
What are you doing here?

RICHARD
I heard you'd been arrested....  

ABE
How did you find out?

RICHARD
Mary sent for me.  Should I not have
come? 

Abe grunts in pain as Mary presses on his ribs. 

ABE
I said I'm fine. 

MARY
I don't know how you're going to
work in this condition.  

ABE
(to Richard)
You didn't speak to anyone?  Major
Hewlett, perhaps?    

RICHARD
I spoke to your wife.  She told me
about the problem with your crop,
and the way you chose to solve it.  17.

Abe looks at Mary, angry.  She returns his look, righteous
and unapologetic.  Abe needs to sit down.  

He sags into a chair.  Mary quickly goes to the stove and
takes off a plate of warm food and puts it on Abe's lap.

MARY
I warned you about Selah Strong. 
He's choleric by nature.  

ABE
He was defending Anna.  He was
defending his wife.

MARY
I don't know why a woman would be in
that house, at that hour...

ABE
The Strongs own the Tavern.  It's
her tavern. 

Mary makes a shrug, judgmental, infuriating to Abe.

ABE (CONT'D)
It's her Tavern.

RICHARD
Abraham.  You should have come to
me, if you needed specie or credit.

ABE
'Neither a lender nor borrower be.'

RICHARD
I wouldn't have lended.  You would
have worked.  I know butchers on
York Island who'd buy my hogs at
double the market value.  All I need
is someone to run the product into
the city for me... 

ABE
That's your farm.  This is mine.  
(beat, softens)
Besides... I already owe you
everything.  

Richard notes his powers of deflection have been passed on.

THOMAS (O.S.)
Da da?

Thomas, hearing Abe's voice, has crawled into the room.18.

Richard smiles, delighted to see his Grandson awake.

RICHARD
You've been paying me back with
interest.

Mary picks Thomas up, who calls for his Dad.  Richard moves
to hold him.  Mary hands him over.  Thomas WAILS in his
Grandfather's arms, reaches for Abe.

Abe stands with a pained grimace.

ABE
Here.

He takes Thomas from his father.  Thomas throws his arms
around Abe's neck, holds him tight.  

MARY
He must've heard your voice.  He was
asking for you earlier.  

ABE
Bed time.  Bed bed time.

Thomas groans, having gotten what he wanted, transfers back
to Mary, who exits to put him down, leaving the other father
and son to face each other.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Tell me what's happening with Selah
Strong.  

Richard sighs.

RICHARD
Insurrection is a serious charge.

ABE
Even without evidence...

RICHARD
More serious is assault on an Officer. 
That is a matter for military court,
I won't be involved.

ABE
Assault?!  The Captain was drunk. 
He attacked Selah.  

RICHARD
There were witnesses. 

ABE
I witnessed it.  And I'll testify.  19.

RICHARD
No.

ABE
No? 

RICHARD
No.  You will stay as far away from
this as you can.  

ABE
The hell I will. 

RICHARD
I've already come to an understanding
with Hewlett.  

There it is.  As Abe suspected.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
They want Strong.  They'll overlook
your involvement.   

ABE
What understanding?  

EXT. SETAUKET - NIGHT

RAIN POURS DOWN.  Selah is locked into a wooden stockade,
shivering to the bone.    

He hears a faint splash behind him.  Someone coming.  

SELAH
Who is that?  Who's there?

Abe appears, clothes soaked.  He kneels before Selah.

SELAH (CONT'D)
What are you doing?  There's a sentry-

ABE
He's staying dry.  Listen well, we
don't have much time.  They are
planning to charge you with
insurrection.  

SELAH
I struck a Redcoat.  That's all that
matters.

ABE
Not if you plead guilty to the first
charge.  
(MORE)20.

ABE (CONT'D)
Everyone knows Joyce is a brute. 
They don't want to hang anyone in
Setauket.  Not in "secure territory." 
They'll send you instead to the Jersey-

SELAH
The Prison Ship?

ABE
Where you have friends.  You know
others who have gone, and others who
have gotten out.  If you bribe the
right person-

SELAH
Is that why you came here?  To tell
me this?  

ABE
I came to warn you.  

SELAH
And to have me forgive your debt, no
doubt.

ABE
I will repay my debt.  In full.  

SELAH
How?  How when your crop is half
dead.

ABE
The London Trade.  Cabbage is in
high demand.  

SELAH
On the black market?!

ABE
I've already made arrangements with
someone I trust.  

SELAH
It's too much risk.  

ABE
Not your concern.  

SELAH
Yes, it is.  I'll make you a new
deal.  
(swallows)
Take care of her for me. 21.

ABE
What?

SELAH
Take care of Anna when I'm gone, and
I'll forgive you your-

ABE
I don't need your forgiveness.  

Silence.  The rain pours.  

ABE (CONT'D)
You are her husband, Selah.  And I'm
going to repay my debt.  

Abe walks off.  Selah hangs his head.  

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - NIGHT

The rain has ceased.  Water drips off cabbage leaves. 

A sawing sound brings us to Abe, who cuts cabbage heads from
their stalks with a harvest knife.  He inspects the blade in
the moonlight, breathing through his nose. 

We begin to hear the chorus of a SPIRITUAL HYMN.

EXT. WOODHULL HOUSE - DAY

Mary's eyes flutter open.  She sits up in her bed.  Thomas
sleeps beside her.  

Abe's side of the bed is empty.  The AFRICAN HYMN continues.

EXT. COVE - DAY

Abe pushes out in a boat across the Long Island Sound.  It
is a beautiful morning.  His boat is stuffed with cabbage
under a tarp.  The AFRICAN HYMN continues.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

AFRICANS work the field.  JORDAN, 25, walks up slowly to
something in the tall grass.

As soon as he gets a good look, he reacts and runs.

Captain Joyce lies in the grass, eyes staring at nothing. 
His throat is cut and maggots swarm around the wound.  

The African Hymn swells to an apex as we...

END ACT TWOACT THREE

EXT. BROOKLYN HARBOR - DAY

Several large WARSHIPS from the greatest naval power on Earth
tilt like giants in the fog off the Sound.  SUPER inks out:

Brooklyn Harbor, New York


On the dock, a trunk of money escorted by two Redcoats is
inspected by Robert Rogers.  He nods, and it's hefted by two
Rangers up a gang-plank to the HMS VULTURE, an armed sloop.  

One of the Redcoats whispers to Rogers, nods to a nearby
alley.  Rogers almost rolls his eyes, and struts over there. 
Tomahawk, powder horn and pistols rustling on his belt.  

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Rogers materializes from the fog, mud and blood clinging
from his clothes.

A British Officer, MAJOR JOHN ANDRE, distractingly handsome
in an immaculate uniform, waits patiently down the alley.

ROBERT ROGERS
This is all very secret.

JOHN ANDRE
This is war.  You never know who's
listening.  

ROBERT ROGERS
Some intelligence for you, John?  
(loud whisper)
England controls the Harbor.  Bunch
of blokes in red out there.  Big
Navy behind them.  

JOHN ANDRE
Thank you.  This is why you're worth
every penny - no matter what General
Clinton says. 

Andre hands him a note.  

ROBERT ROGERS
What's this?

JOHN ANDRE
A test.

ROBERT ROGERS
Not for me. 23.

JOHN ANDRE
For my source within the rebel camp. 
It's the location of a secret store
in Connecticut.  A safehouse.  We'd
like you to give it the treatment
you gave the Continental Dragoons.

Rogers hands the address back.

ROBERT ROGERS
Scraps.  Feed it to your Regulars.

He turns to leave.

JOHN ANDRE
If the intelligence proves true, I
can trust his word on targets with
higher value.  Like Washington.  

Rogers considers this.  Something personal there.  

ROBERT ROGERS
Who is this mythical source of yours? 
Someone I know?  

Andre is silent, enigmatic.

JOHN ANDRE
You won't do it?  

ROBERT ROGERS
For double we will.  Recompense for
the last test.    

JOHN ANDRE
Recompense?  You lost one man.

ROBERT ROGERS
And a coat.  And a bonnet.

No love lost between the Officer and the Mercenary.

EXT. CONNECTICUT INLET - DAY

Abe guides his little scow into a nondescript inlet.  A
WHALEBOAT, sort of like a reinforced canoe with a collapsible
mast, is already "docked" on the shore.  SUPER inks out: 

Connecticut  Coast   


Abe splashes aground, drags his boat up.  He whispers.

ABE
Caleb?...  Caleb?24.

Nothing.  Abe tries to whistle... which is cut off as he is
roughly grabbed from behind, a KNIFE on his throat.

CALEB
Give us a kiss.

Abe struggles to get free, but he s being held by a much
larger man.  The man laughs, and releases Abe.  Scrambling
around, he sees CALEB BREWSTER, 25 - burly, hair slicked
back by salt water.  A permanent grin plastered on his face.

ABE
Never do that again.

CALEB
You always enjoyed a good laugh.

ABE
You don't know me that well, Brewster.

CALEB
I've known you your whole life,
Woodhull!  Never figured you for a
black marketeer, though...  

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

CALEB
Well, then let's see what we have.

He tears back the tarp on Abe's boat. 

CALEB (CONT'D)
Cabbage!
(tears off a piece)
Mmm.  Fresh.  Heavily rationed. 
They'll pay top coin for this in the
Bowery.  All that fine china and no
healthy greens to set on 'em. 

ABE
That what you have?  Fine China?

Abe gestures to Caleb's whaleboat cargo.

CALEB
Oh, ho.  A challenge.  Witness...
(pulls back his tarp)
Gloucester Cheese.  Ceylon Tea. 
Cathay Silk, by way of London...

ABE
You said top coin, not top silk.  My
haul's worth twenty pounds sterling.25.

CALEB
That's funny, you don't look like
King George.  Do I look like King
George?

ABE
There are other buyers...

CALEB
Ten.

ABE
I have a whole bushel!  

CALEB
I can pay you double that in
Continental Dollars.

ABE
And I'd be the only idiot to take
it.  Pounds, Caleb.  Fifteen-

CALEB
Twelve.  When did you get so vicious?

ABE
Twelve, and that silk.

Caleb tosses him the silk, counts out the money from a purse.  

CALEB
Silk for the missus, eh?  How are
things back home?

ABE
Thomas is almost starting to walk.  

They start loading cabbage into Caleb's boat.

CALEB
How old is he now?

ABE
It will be one year, next month.

CALEB
Is he bothered by all the new guests
in town?

ABE
No.

CALEB
They still maintain a full garrison? 
In Tallmadge's old church?26.

Abe is silent.

CALEB (CONT'D)
How many stationed there?

ABE
I keep my eye to my crop.

CALEB
When you're not smuggling it.

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

CALEB
I'm just making talk.  I miss our
old stomping ground, is all.  Don't
like the idea of those bloody-backs
stompin' on it.  

ABE
They're no trouble.  

Caleb watches Abe...

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The area around Joyce's body has become a crime scene of
sorts.  Major Hewlett stands by, supervising.  An ARMY
CHAPLAIN kneels over the body, administering last rites.

Richard Woodhull approaches Hewlett and Lieutentant Simcoe.

RICHARD
Jonathan Lewis is the owner of this
field.  Claims he heard nothing. 
He's loyal to the crown.  I believe
him.

Hewlett looks down at the corpse with disappointment.  

HEWLETT
Captain Joyce led many successful
raids, but had a reputation for
brutality.  He was an obvious target
for assassination.  

SIMCOE
Sir, don't you wonder if this may be
linked to the incident at the Tavern?

RICHARD
Perhaps if Selah Strong was a suspect,
but he was locked in the stockade
all night.  His wife, howev-27.

SIMCOE
I didn't ask you.  
(to Hewlett)
What about the farmer, who was also
there?  Woodhull. 

RICHARD
Another question may be, what was
Captain Joyce doing out of his barrack
in the middle of the night?

HEWLETT
Thank you, Judge, but this is a
military matter.  You may return to
your duties. 

Richard nods respectfully, fits his hat on his head and walks
away.  We TRACK WITH him, as he grows worried - knowing that
Abe is nowhere to be found at the moment.  

Hewlett turns to Simcoe.  

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
Captain Simcoe, any suspicious persons
are to be brought directly to me. 
Is that clear?

SIMCOE
Captain...?

HEWLETT
Unless you wish to remain Subaltern.
(nods to Joyce's corpse)
There is a vacancy.

SIMCOE
Yes, Sir.  

Hewlett mounts his horse.  Simcoe stares down at Joyce.

EXT. CONNECTICUT INLET - EVENING

Abe waits for nightfall, chewing on a piece of contraband
cheese.  He watches the sun dip behind the horizon.

Abe gets up and begins to unmoor his sailing scow.

EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND - ABE'S SCHOONER - NIGHT

Abe runs the Sound, the only sound is the water splashing
against his hull.

He spots a shape out on the water.  Dark.  Hulking.  A SLOOP.  
Sails snapping in the night.28.

Abe swallows and turns his tiller slightly, tacking to the
dark and silent shore.

The Sloop is moving the other direction.   Hundreds of yards
away.  Passing like, well, ships in the night.

And then it is fully past him.  Abe exhales.

And then it begins to turn.  Shit.

Abe heads into the wind and trims the sail to try and catch
some speed.  But the bigger boat is gaining, quickly, aiming
straight on his stern.

A sound on the wind... a yell... faint... Abe ignores it.

A SPARK from the Sloop.  CRACK!  A HOLE is punched in Abe's
sail.  It begins to luff like crazy.  

The armed Sloop pulls up next to him, its hull knocking his
with bullying confidence.  A LANTERN on board backlights
THREE MEN pointing muskets down at him.

ABE
I'm not armed!

MEN
Identify yourself.

ABE
Abraham Woodhull.  From Setauket.

MEN
Nice night for a sail, Woodhull?

ABE
I thought so...

MEN
What's under the tarp.

Abe hesitates.  Knows he is screwed.  Fuck it.

ABE
Can I interest you gentlemen in a
bolt of silk?  

They throw him a rough rope.

MEN
Yer under arrest, by order of the
Continental Congress.  Charge is
illegal trade. 

Abe has run straight into the Continentals. 29.

EXT. STRONG MANOR - DAY

The largest estate in town.  A plantation surrounds a colonial
manor house, which has been converted into soldier's barracks.

A REDCOAT rides his horse up the path to the manor.

EXT. STRONG MANOR - BACK LAWN - DAY

A giant black KETTLE boils with soap.  Anna Strong pulls
some soaking shirts out of it, doing laundry.  

In a series of CUTS, she lays the shirts out on a long wooden
table.  She takes a washing stick (like a cricket bat) and
begins to beat the laundry on the board.  Anna is all
business.  No emotion.

What begins as a rhythmic beating becomes more intense as
she pounds the stains out.  She grits her teeth, pouring her
anger into the task.  THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK.  

We hear a voice from somewhere, but it's not clear.  We are
close on Anna's face, as she fights back tears while beating
the hell out of Selah's clothes.  THWACK THWACK THWACK.  

SIMCOE (O.S.)
Mrs. Strong!

Anna turns, startled, to see SIMCOE standing there.   She
tries to catch her breath, bat the tear off her cheek.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Are you alright?  

ANNA
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I didn't hear
you.  

SIMCOE
Captain.
(off her look)
I've purchased Captain Joyce's
commission, in the wake of his death.

ANNA
Death?

SIMCOE
His body was found this morning, on
the Lewis property, with his throat
slit.  

Shock, confusion, and relief course through her in waves.  
Simcoe catches every note.30.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
You haven't heard?   

She sets the laundry bat down.  

ANNA
I... I was here, in my bed.  Where
else would I be?

SIMCOE
Have you seen Abraham Woodhull? 

ANNA
What?  No... not since the tavern. 
Why are you asking me this?

SIMCOE
An officer in his majesty's army is
dead, following an altercation with
your husband and Mr. Woodhull, and
Mr. Woodhull is nowhere to be found.

Anna stares at him, trying to process this.  Selah gone to
prison.  Joyce murdered.  Abe vanished. The implications
overwhelm her.

She turns away, begins to break down.  Simcoe fidgets.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Ma'am, I meant no...

She waves her pardon, and moves to retreat to her house.  He
stops her.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Wait.  Accept my apology.

Still choking up, she nods her assent but still tries to
move past.  He stops her again, tight grip on her arm.

Simcoe is close to her now, intimate.  She looks down, keeping
her eyes on the grass.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
I didn't mean to...
(beat)
I know how you must feel.  With your
husband gone.  In your house alone. 
I can only imagine your distress.

Anna looks up into his eyes.  He is giving her the same
disturbing look that he did at the Tavern.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
You need someone to protect you. 31.

ANNA
Captain, I beg you.  If you are a
gentleman, let me attend to my house,
in peace.  

He can only press, or let her go.  He lets her go, proving
he is a gentleman, and hating every second of it. 

ANNA (CONT'D)
Thank you.  

She heads off.  Simcoe is now cold. 

SIMCOE
I shall have my laundry ready for
you at week's end.  

Anna stops.  Turns back to look at him, confused.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
This is my house, too.  I'm to be
quartered here by order of Major
Hewlett.  I have already chosen which
room. 

His tone is flat.  Inevitable.  If he added "and no one will
hear you scream" we wouldn't be thrown.  He nods formally,
then walks off.  Anna watches him go, shaken.  

INT. COLONIAL JAIL - DAY

Dark, claustrophobic.  Iron-barred windows set in solid brick. 
Shafts of light strike through dank must, finding Abe on a
bed of hay inside a jail cell.  Miserable.  

A KEY works a lock.  A door opens, more light stabs in.  Abe
squints at the silhouette of man in a metal helmet with white
horsehair plume sprouting from its crested peak.  

VOICE (O.S.)
You look thin, Mr. Woodhull.  Is the
harvest that bad?  

Abe recognizes the voice.

ABE
Ben?  

A face emerges from the dark.  Ben Tallmadge, our survivor
from the opening.  In full Dragoon battle dress.     

ABE (CONT'D)
Tallmadge, thank God it's you!

Ben gives him the sign to pipe down.  32.

BEN
Your name came through on a dispatch. 
I set out immediately from camp.

ABE
Can you get me out of this?  Of course
you can, look at you... 

Ben takes off his helmet.  

BEN
Slow down.   

ABE
Ben, you know me.  I'm no smuggler. 
This is the first time I've ever...

BEN
I know.

ABE
Even attempted...

BEN
I told them you were a man of
integrity, and that you would make
every effort to cooperate. 

ABE
Thank...
(beat)
Cooperate?  

BEN
They need to know who your contact
was.  To make sure you weren't giving
aid to the enemy.  I told them that
you would never- 

ABE
The enemy?  Who is the enemy?  The
families in New York who are starved
for fresh produce or the farmers
outside who are starved for...

BEN
Fresh silk?  I hope that's for you
wife...  

ABE
Oh, come on Ben, you know both sides
close an eye to this trade.  Trust
me, the "enemy" did not benefit here.  33.

BEN
I do trust you, Abe.  And I can get
you out.  Just tell me who your
contact was at Frog's point.  

Abe stares at Ben, grows suspicious.  Paranoid.  

ABE
What's your true purpose here?  You
didn't ride all this way just to get
me out of trouble...

Ben produces a sheaf of paper.  Oh, yeah?

BEN
This is a pardon, for your release. 
Signed by Governor Trumbull, who I
convinced that you were a friend. 

ABE
If I tell you who I traded with.  

BEN
This shouldn't be a negotiation.  

ABE
Good.  Because I'm not giving the
name of someone who's just trying to
get by.  And who doesn't deserve to
be thrown in a cell by the same
Congress that declares for our
freedom.   

Ben regards Abe, then nods to himself.  Satisfied. 
Calculating.  Abe can tell he's keeping a secret.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Tallmadge.  Why are you really here?

BEN
As I said, I have a permit signed
from the Governor, for you to return
home.  He signed it after receiving
word from General Washington himself.

Abe sits back.  What the hell is going on here?  Ben notes
his reaction, and leans closer to the bars.  

BEN (CONT'D)
We're of the mind that if you can
smuggle cabbage, you can smuggle
something more valuable.  Information.  

ABE
You've come to enlist me?  34.

BEN
To recruit you.  Congress doesn't
just declare for your freedom, they
fight for it.  I fight for it.  And
men die for it.  

Abe sees the real Ben now, his anger and pain.

ABE
I don't ask anyone to fight for me.

BEN
I ask you.  We grew up together,
Abe, and I remember who you are,
even if you've forgotten.  
(off Abe's look)
I remember three summers ago, sitting
with you and Anna on the bay and
watching you rage like a lawyer
against the bloody Stamp Act.  You
went straight for two hours.  No one
can speak the way you did and not
believe in the cause.  I ask you to
fight for what you believe in.  

Abe is silent.

ABE
I don't know what information I could-- 

BEN
Military.  Number of men, number of
cannons.  Naval transports, whether
they're moving.  If so, where.  What
arrivals.  Whether with men, or
provisions-

ABE
Ben-

BEN
You won't have to risk crossing the
Belt again.  Instead, you'll signal
for a courier.  I have a system worked
out.

ABE
Have you worked out how to explain
my absence?  I was supposed to be
back yesterday, with no one knowing
I was gone.  

BEN
Use the truth.  You were on the black
market.  Both sides close an eye...35.

ABE
I'll need proof of that.  The silk. 
And the twelve pounds.    

Ben stares at Abe.  Then stands, UNLOCKS Abe's cell, and
tosses the money purse at his feet.  It lands with a RATTLE.

ABE (CONT'D)
So that's it?  

BEN
(pointed edge)
You're free.

The door stays wide open, but neither man moves his stare.

END ACT THREE36.

ACT FOUR

EXT. COVE - DAY

Abe lands his boat, splashes out.  Looks down at his
clothes... and then SUBMERGES himself under the water.

A beat later, ABE EMERGES from the cold water, soaked through.

TIME CUT TO:

ABE feverishly digs a hole in the sand near the reeds, drops
his MONEY SACK in there, and begins to cover it up again.  

Abe then pulls off his boot, stuffs the shimmering bolt of
silk into it, struggles to pull it back on.  

He stands, shivering from the cold water, working up his
courage.  What the hell is he doing?    

Abe pulls out his knife, grits his teeth, makes a tentative
CUT into his forehead.  Blood runs down.  He winces.  Holding
his hand to the cut.  

EXT. SETAUKET - VILLAGE GREEN - LATER

Will Robeson, the Tory farmer, walks through the village
with a net of clams over his shoulder.  He slows as he sees-

Abe Woodhull limping up the way.  Soaked, bleeding, fucked
up.  And he leans into it, acting dazed.   

ABE
Robeson... help... 

Robeson's eyes go wide, and he backs up, turns and RUNS.  

Abe hesitates for a moment, doubting.  That wasn't the
reaction he expected.

He keeps walking, rounds a building, and sees Robeson leading
a brace of REDCOATS his way, Simcoe among them.  Robeson
excitedly points to Abe.  The Soldiers hustle toward him. 

SIMCOE
Stand fast!

Abe sure does, surprised and beginning to panic inside. 
Simcoe walks up to him.  

ABE
I... I've been mugged...

Simcoe slams Abe against the building.37.

SIMCOE
And now you'll be hanged.  

INT. SETAUKET CHURCH - DAY

Richard sits across a desk from Major Hewlett, as they go
over a ledger together.  Hewlett points to a name.  

HEWLETT
Floyd.  To Colonel Floyd we should
give at least ten.  He's always first
to volunteer service. 

RICHARD
Ten... 
(checking a list)
There are only fourteen field hands
at Strong Manor.  Plus two house
boys and two Maids.  

HEWLETT
So?

RICHARD
So if we're to divide up property
amongst friends, we must be fair and
even in the giving.  No favorites.

HEWLETT
I suppose that's wise... 

RICHARD
We also need to leave some labor to
work the confiscated property.

WHAM.  The door guard, BAKER, hurries in.  

BAKER
Sir, Captain Simcoe at the gates. 
With a Prisoner, Sir.  Related to
Captain Joyce... er... 

HEWLETT
(to Richard)
We'll finish this over dinner.

Richard nods, rolls up the ledger.  Hewlett motions to Baker.

Simcoe marches in with Abe and four Redcoats.  

Richard rises from his chair, stunned.

SIMCOE
We found him wandering.  Looks like
he's been in a fight.  38.

HEWLETT
(dubious)
From three days ago?

RICHARD
Abraham, where have you been?  I've
been looking all over for-

SIMCOE
We'll ask the questions, Judge.

HEWLETT
I'll ask the questions.  
(to Abe)
Captain Joyce was found murdered
this Tuesday morning.  And you haven't
been seen since...

He looks to Simcoe.

SIMCOE
Monday evening, when he was released
from holding.

HEWLETT
Can you explain your absence?  

ABE
Captain Joyce is dead?

HEWLETT
I'll ask once more.  Where were you?  

ABE
With the Americans, Sir.  

Surprise all around.  Richard goes pale.  Somehow this is
worse than admitting to murder.  Abe hangs his head.

ABE (CONT'D)
I set out early Tuesday, before dawn,
to cross the Sound with a cargo of
cabbage from my field.  I aimed to...
barter on the London Trade, and did
so for twelve pound sterling and a
bundle of cathay silk.  On my return
that night, I was overtaken by a
brig sloop off the coast.  The crew
claimed they were Patriots, and that
I defied the authority of Congress. 
Their justice was to beat me, rob
me, and throw me overboard.39.

SIMCOE
Seems they also robbed you of any
proof of your tragic tale.

Abe takes a beat, then begins to reach for his boot.  The
Redcoats close in.  He pauses.

ABE
With your permission, Sir?

Hewlett nods.  Abe painfully takes off his boot, reaches in
and pulls out the long stash of silk.

ABE (CONT'D)
I concealed it before they boarded
my scow.  The money they took.

Richard bows his head in shame.  An Ensign walks the silk to
Hewlett, who inspects it.  Simcoe glares at Abe.

HEWLETT
Why not just sell your cabbage direct
to stores on York Island?  The market
for healthy greens favors the seller
tremendously.

ABE
Because the prices are even higher
on the black.

RICHARD
You damned fool.  Given to greed,
and deserved what you got.  

Abe can't meet his Father's eyes - not because he's ashamed,
but because he's pretending to be.

Baker enters again, breaking the tension.

BAKER
Sir.  Marked dispatch just arrived
for you. 

Hewlett grunts.  Busy day.  He nods, distracted.  A COURIER,
red-faced from his ride, but buttoning up his exhaustion,
walks across to Hewlett and hands him a sealed dispatch. 
Hewlett's eager to read it, but first... 

HEWLETT
Did you take note of the identity of
your assailants?

ABE
I know some of them...40.

Hewlett holds up his hand.  Abe shuts up.  

HEWLETT
Smuggling is a crime, and you will
answer for it.  But more pressing
are the activities of these
privateers.  

RICHARD
Major...

Richard whispers something low to Hewlett, who nods.

HEWLETT
(to Abe)
Return to your home, see to your
family, then report to your father's 
at seven o'clock.  There we'll discuss
names, and other details.
(to Simcoe)
Captain, escort Mr. Woodhull out of
the fort.  Unmolested.  

SIMCOE
Yes, Sir.

Simcoe walks Abe out.  Abe looks at Richard who looks away.  

Hewlett sits down and slices open the dispatch.  He reads it
with interest (we may recognize it as the same piece of paper
that Andre tried to hand Robert Rogers in the alley).   

EXT. SETAUKET CHURCH - DAY

Simcoe marches Abe out of the fortified Church, and across
the green.  Curious NEIGHBORS mill about with raised eyebrows. 
Simcoe speaks casually to Abe.

SIMCOE
Very clever, but all really you did
back there was prove you're a
criminal.  

ABE
Pardon?

SIMCOE
Just 'cause you confess to smuggling
doesn't give you an alibi for Joyce.

ABE
I've never killed anyone.41.

SIMCOE
I have.  Plenty just like you.  May
have fooled the Major, but not me.  

Simcoe stops, and lets Abe walk on.  Louder, for everyone
else, he call out...

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Travel safe.

STAY with Abe as he walks on, his desperate mood now matched
to his ragged appearance.  

EXT. SETAUKET BAY - DAY

STRONG MANOR as seen from the shimmering water of the Long
Island Sound.  The brilliant white colonial home looks
peaceful and private at this distance.  

Several colorful lines of laundry in the back lawn bob in
the wind off the bay.

EXT. STRONG MANOR - BACK LAWN - DAY

Abe hides in the trees ringing the perimeter of the vast
estate.  He watches a Soldier heading for the ice house, a
small octagonal shed on the manor grounds.  It's a hot day.

Abe finally spots Anna.  She is too far away to signal or
yell to without attracting attention.  He watches her for a
moment, as she scoops water from the ewer and splashes her
face.  The Soldier enters the ice house.  

Abe cups his hands over his mouth, and mimics a raven call.

Anna slows, then stops, wondering if she heard what she did. 
Abe smiles to himself, does it again.

She turns, knows exactly where to find him.  He keeps his
eye on the ice house as she crosses the grounds to the trees. 
She finds him in the thicket underneath the tree shadows.

ANNA
What are you doing here?

ABE
Giving you this. 

He presses the purse into her hands.  It's dirty from where
he dug it up.  She looks inside, gasps.

ABE (CONT'D)
It's what I owe Selah.  You could
use it to buy his parole.  I have to
go.  42.

ANNA
Wait.  I can't take this.  

ABE
Yes, you can.  

ANNA
I can't take this, he'll find it!  

He's halfway gone.  He turns back.

ABE
Who?

ANNA
Simcoe.  The Welshman.  The one who
put a pistol to your head.

Abe begins to nod.  He knows him.  Too well.  

ANNA (CONT'D)
He's been billeted here, and...

ABE
What's he done to you?

ANNA
He... I can hear him outside my door
at night.  And he's been in my room
when I haven't, I'm certain of it. 
If he finds I'm hiding silver you
took off a dead soldier, then he--

ABE
Wait... dead Soldier?

Anna searches his eyes.  Abe registers what she's thinking. 

ABE (CONT'D)
Anna you don't think I killed Captain
Joyce?
(she doesn't answer)
Also, what soldier do you know carries
twelve quid on his person? 

ANNA
None.  And no farmer, either.  Where
did you get it?    

He looks at her for a long beat.  

ABE
Caleb Brewster is running a shop out
of his whaleboat, on Devil's Belt.43.

ANNA
Caleb?  
(her face lights up)
You saw him?  How is he?  

ABE
Giant.  Crude.  The same.
(beat)
I saw Ben Tallmadge, too.  

The truth comes as a relief to him.  Anna is excited.  

ANNA
They were together?

ABE
No.  No, Ben's a Connecticut Dragoon
now.  Shiny helmet and all.  Tried
to recruit me for a secret mission.  

ANNA
Against the British?

ABE
Don't worry, I won't do it.  

ANNA
Why not?

That takes him by surprise.  Anna presses, quietly outraged. 

ANNA (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for?  What more
do they need to take from us?  

The "us" is raw, intimate.  Abe stares at her.  THUNK-

The Soldier exits the ice house, cold wisping out after him.  

Abe presses the money back into her hands.  Then quickly
darts out the way he crept in.

Anna watches him go, then looks down at the money purse. 
Biting down on her anger, she finds a hollow in the tree and
stuffs it in there to conceal it.  

EXT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A Two Story Colonial.  Candles flicker in the windows.  TWO
REDCOATS stand guard outside the front door.   

INT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Major Hewlett, Richard Woodhull, and Abe are finishing dinner
(roast pork).  Abe has cleaned up, wearing a black coat, 44.

black breeches, and a lace band at his throat.  He stares at
his plate.  Hewlett pushes back from the table as a HOUSE
SERVANT pours from a cask of Madeira wine. 

HEWLETT
Excellent, as always.

RICHARD
Credit goes to Aberdeen.  I merely
raise the pork, she performs the
alchemy.  

HEWLETT
(to Abe)
You've hardly touched yours.

ABE
Hard to eat on a guilty stomach, I
suppose.  My apologies.  

A glance is exchanged between Richard and the Major, who
nods "let me take this."  He leans forward, paternal.   

HEWLETT
Abraham.  This is what I could not
say earlier from my... pulpit, as it
were.  I view your crime as a mere
symptom of a more serious disease
afflicting these colonies.  Anarchy.  

ABE
You mean self-rule?

HEWLETT
I mean chaos.  Masquerading as
freedom.  An excuse for criminal
activity, and every-man-for-himself.

RICHARD
Well said.  And it is an illusion. 
Because if these upstarts were truly
concerned for your liberty they
wouldn't encourage smuggling with
one hand and then roll you with the
other.  

Abe nods along.

ABE
We all must pay a tax, the question
is just who will collect.

Hewlett wonders if he should like that response.  Richard
takes a gulp of wine, looks out across the room.    45.

RICHARD
'O God... that one might read the
book of fate, and see the revolution
of the times make mountains level. 
And the continent, weary of solid
firmness, melt itself into the sea...'

Hewlett smiles.  

HEWLETT
Your father is the only man I can
find here with an affection for the
humanities.
(to Richard)
Did you pass your trivium onto your
son?  

RICHARD
Abraham had to concern himself with
the business of our land, after his
Mother passed, and his brothers...

Richard trails off.

ABE
No man is above the law.
(to Richard)
That's what you taught me.
(to Hewlett)
And I'll gladly accept whatever
punishment you deem fit for my
forgetting it.     

HEWLETT
I doubt you can afford to pay the
fine.  It pains me to recommend
imprisonment, but...
(to Richard)
We must have no favorites. 

Not a dig.  More of a "help me out here."  Richard ponders.

RICHARD
There may be a... temporary salve.  
The Carlisle Commission has decreed
all those who swear an oath to their
sovereign will be pardoned after
Congress' defeat.  Which appears
imminent.  

HEWLETT
A public oath.  Yes.  That is ideal.

Abe looks at his father, who smiles genuinely.46.

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
And when it's made clear your
cooperation assisted in the capture
of the enemy, any doubt among your
neighbors will be put to rest.  

ABE
Sir?

HEWLETT
The names.  Of the men who attacked
you.  Remember?

Hewlett beckons to a servant, who brings him paper, and quill
and ink.  Richard nods his encouragement to Abe. 

ABE
They were boys from Hempstead. 
Presbyterians.  They used to trade
at Betts Tavern near the Jamaica
Pass.  Matthew Mitchell, William
Washburne, Daniel Taylor.  And then
another one they called... Simon, I
didn't catch his family name, but he
was a fat one.  Mean.  With his head
shaved to the scalp.   

While Abe reports, Richard's smile slowly fades, as he
realizes that his son is lying.  He alone is attuned to what
that sounds like.  Hewlett is busy scribbling down the names.

HEWLETT
Excellent.  I shall pass this on to
Captain Simcoe, with instructions
that if he should encounter these
men on his raid, he will give them
no quarter.    

Both Abe and Richard are surprised.

RICHARD
Raid?

Hewlett sits back and swirls his wine.  

HEWLETT
The dispatch I received today was
from headquarters.  Intelligence
regarding a rebel safehouse across
the Sound, where the insurgents are
launching their attacks from.  

Abe starts to feel sick as Hewlett goes on, excited.  47.

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
We'll cross at night, just like your
attackers.  Silent approach, bayonets
fixed.  Give them their own medicine.  

RICHARD
Are you alright, son?  Not feeling
true?

Abe looks at his Dad.  Knows that he was lying.

ABE
Just exhausted... from the whole
ordeal.

HEWLETT
Recalling it can't be of help.  Why
don't you get home to your bed?

Abe nods his thanks, queasy.  Maybe he better.  Richard
watches him shuffle out, saying nothing.    

EXT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Abe trudges down the porch steps under watch of the Redcoat
Guards.  We can still see the dining room, lit up.  

Abe shuffles down the path into darkness.  When he is farther
down the path, he straightens up - not sick at all - and
darts to the side, keeping low, and circles around the back
of the house.  

EXT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - BACK - NIGHT

Abe creeps to the side of his Father's house, below the
windows.  He feels along the house, as if from memory, and
finds a loose sideboard.  He pries it back a bit, and removes
a rusted old CALIPER TOOL.  

He smiles.  Hasn't had to use this since he was fourteen.

Abe approaches a dark window, and uses the Caliper to access
a well-worn hole just below the latch.  

If there's one place Abe has experience breaking in and out
of - it's his old childhood bedroom.  He slides up the sash,
stashes the Caliper, and climbs in the house.   

INT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - ABE'S OLD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abe sets down lightly into his childhood room.  His old bed
is still here.  He sneaks through, and then stops.  

Stares at a few TOY SOLDIERS on a dresser, along with a
CHESSBOARD.  He has a sudden pang of guilt.48.

INT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - HALLWAY

Abe peeks out into the hallway.  He can hear the conversation
between his Father and Hewlett from down the hall.  They're
still in the dining room, now onto dessert.  

Abe steps out carefully, then snaps back as a SERVANT crosses
through the hall on the way to the kitchen.   

Now he creeps down to his Father's room...

INT. JUDGE WOODHULL'S HOUSE - HEWLETT'S ROOM

...Which has now become the Major's room, as Richard has
moved upstairs.  The Major's wardrobe is in trunks.     

Abe crosses to a desk, pulls the drawers.  Finds the DISPATCH. 
He carefully opens it, and moves to the window, unfolds it,
begins to read and memorize it by the moonlight, eyes
searching out the details...

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. TREES - NIGHT

Abe is a shadow RUNNING through the trees, a mirror to Ben
Tallmadge's run from the opening.  His breathing fades UNDER-

As we hear a drunken chant RISE:

REDCOATS (V.O. PRE-LAP)
Don t want the Sergeant s shilling,
Don t want to be shot down / I m
really much more willing / to make
myself a killing... 

INT. ROE TAVERN - NIGHT

DRUNKEN REDCOATS revel in coarse song.

REDCOATS 
Living off the pickings of the Ladies
of the Town!

Anna, running the place on her own, collects pewter mugs to
clean, tries to ignore the dregs of North London or worse. 
And Captain Simcoe, who comes here just to watch her work.    

REDCOATS (CONT'D)
Don t want a bullet up my bumhole /
Don t want my cobblers minced with
ball / For if I have to lose  em 
then let it be with Susan / Or Meg
or Peg or any whore at all!49.

They laugh and cheer.  Simcoe catches Anna's attention.   

SIMCOE
Another round of cider for my boys.

Anna forces a smile.  Simcoe watches her go into the back.

INT. ROE TAVERN - CELLAR

Dark.  Anna creaks down the steps, sets her candle on a cask. 
She goes to grab a quarter barrel of cider...

When a HAND grabs her wrist and another CLAMPS over her mouth
before she can scream.

ABE
Shhh.  It's me.  It's me.  

Abe holds Anna until she nods.  He turns her to face him.

ABE (CONT'D)
You only have a few moments to bring
that cider back so listen close. 

ANNA
Yes.

Doesn't even know what she's saying yes to.  She's ready. 
It trips Abe up for a second, and then he presses on.  

ABE
Tallmadge devised a way so we could
signal him in secret.  

ANNA
He's coming here?!

ABE
He'll send a courier.  We'll meet on
one of the coves along the bay.   

ANNA
Which one?  

ABE
Whichever one is not being watched.  

ANNA
How will he know? 

ABE
You signal him.  Your home can be
seen from the bay.  
(MORE)50.

ABE (CONT'D)
When you hang a black petticoat from
your peg-line, they'll know I'm ready
to meet.  Six coves, left to right. 
You'll pin up white handkerchiefs to
designate the safe one.  That's where
they'll sail.  Tomorrow you'll put
out four. 
(beat)
And Hope to God someone's watching.

Anna is thrilled and scared at the same time.  

The stairs CREAK. 

SIMCOE (O.S.)
Need help down there?  

Abe shows Anna FOUR fingers, then ducks back behind the
barrels of rum, cider, and beer.  Anna smooths her dress as
Simcoe steps down into the candlelight.  

ANNA
Yes, Captain, thank you.  A bit heavy
for me...

She puts the barrel in his arms and quickly heads back up
the stairs.  He glances around the cellar, then follows.  

A moment later, Abe sneaks out and heads for the trap double
doors to the surface.

FADE TO:

EXT. STRONG MANOR - BACK LAWN - DAY

CLOSE ON A BLACK PETTICOAT being pegged to the laundry line.  

Anna looks out to the water, squinting, as she pins up four
WHITE LINEN HANDKERCHIEFS on the line next to it.  

ANGLE ON A MAID

ABIGAIL, watching her from the porch, troubled.  CICERO, a
House Boy, steps next to her, curious.  

CICERO
'She doin'...?

Abigail's concern begins to slide into suspicion.  

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - DAY

Abe works his field.  The sun is hot, but the full moon still
hangs in the blue sky.  Abe stares at it.51.

Behind him, Mary exits the porch door, sets a bowl on a bench,
and walks back in, giving a quick tug on the cast iron dinner
bell as she goes, pointedly never looking at Abe.  

He turns at the CLANG, in time to see her enter the house.  

MOMENTS LATER - Abe picks up his supper.  Cold cornmeal mush.

INT. WOODHULL HOUSE - DAY

Abe walks inside with it.  Mary is sitting near the stove,
nursing Thomas.  

ABE
I'm sorry.

MARY
Whatever you're doing... don't.  We
can't afford to lose you.  

ABE
We?

MARY
I can't.  

She turns to look at him, with a flicker of vulnerability. 
Then turns back to the heat of the stove.  Abe watches her.

INT. WOODHULL HOUSE - NIGHT

Abe lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting the seconds.

He turns his head, looks at Thomas, sleeping.  Mary too,
turned away from him.  He runs a finger across Thomas' cheek.  

Abe carefully extracts himself from bed.  

EXT. COVE - NIGHT

Abe stealths down to the shore, stops when he sees...

A familiar WHALEBOAT pulled into the reeds.  Empty.

Abe recognizes it, surprised.  Then confused.  Then angry. 
He quickly pulls his hop knife, WHIRLS to face--

CALEB BREWSTER sneaking up on him, with a cheshire grin.

CALEB
Quicker this time.  

ABE
You.  You're the courier?! 52.

CALEB
Lower that butter knife, will ya?  

ABE
Did... did Tallmadge catch you?  How
did he find you?  

CALEB
He didn't find me.  We found you.  

Abe stares at him, mind racing.  

ABE
Back at Frog's point...

CALEB
That was the first interview.  Second
was Ben's.  You passed muster when
you refused to give up my name. 
Just want you to know I was touched
by that. 

ABE
You set me up?  You're a... you're a
devil.  A liar, a--

CALEB
Lieutenant.  Second Continental
Artillery, assigned to Captain
Tallmadge for special detail. 
(steps closer, menacing)
Who the hell are you?  

ABE
Someone tricked, now expected to
trust.

CALEB
Whatever you give me goes straight
to Ben.  No one else knows your name. 
No one.  

ABE
Or hers.

CALEB
Of course.  Now she hung out that
Petticoat for a reason.  What?

ABE
A detachment's being readied, to
strike a safe house on Meeg's Harbor. 
Kensington's farm.

Caleb nods, blood pumping. 53.

CALEB
When.  

ABE
Tomorrow.  There was a dispatch,
from York Island, signed by a Major
Andre.  

CALEB
Anything else?

ABE
The man leading it is Simcoe. 
Captain.  I think he suspects me. 

CALEB
Simcoe.  I'll keep an eye out.
(grins)
Trust me, Woody.  Once you get a
taste for boiling these lobsters,
you'll want more.  

ABE
Don't call me that.  

CALEB
An' after I pass this up the ladder,
they'll want more.  Washington's
been trying to get a man inside the
city since Clinton took it over.  

ABE
He'll have to find someone else.  I
don't have any business that would
take me to the city.  

CALEB
Then maybe you make some.  

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

Caleb smiles.

CALEB
Just like the last time. 

Caleb hops into his boat.  Pushes off.    

Abe stands there for a moment, watching him disappear.  Then
turns back and heads into the reeds.  

END ACT FOUR54.

ACT FIVE

EXT. SETAUKET - VILLAGE GREEN - DAY

A SMALL CROWD is gathered near the Church, and the Stockade,
to witness Abe swear his oath of allegiance.  MAJOR HEWLETT
and FIVE REGULARS are the only military presence.  Mary is
dressed up, and holds Thomas in her arms.  Will Robeson
watches, and Judge Woodhull administers the oath to his son.    

Abe puts his hand on his father's bible. 

ABE
I, Abraham Woodhull, do sincerely
and faithfully promise and swear
that I will bear true allegiance to
His Majesty King George the Third.

EXT. CONNECTICUT FOREST - DAY

A WOOD HOUSE sits back in trees, hidden from view.  

ABE (V.O.)
And that with heart and hands, life
and goods... 

SIMCOE leads a detachment of 30 REDCOATS through the trees,
quietly.  He gives them the sign to drop into firing position.  

ABE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...Maintain and defend His Majesty's
Government.

The first line takes a knee.

EXT. SETAUKET - VILLAGE GREEN (INTERCUT)

Abe's eyes wander to the left, making contact with ANNA in
the back of the crowd.  

ABE
And the laws of the Province of New
York...

Mary follows his look to her.  

SIMCOE (V.O.)
FIRE!

IN CONNECTICUT - a volley EXPLODES out.  Shattering windows
and blasting the hell out of the building.   

The front line primes and loads while the back advances -
and waits to let loose ANOTHER burst.55.

ABE (V.O.)
Against all traitorous conspiracies
and attempts... 

Both units CHARGE toward the house.  An ENSIGN kicks in the
front door... it's EMPTY.  

ABE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
..Which shall be made against his
person, Crown or Dignity.

BOOM!  MUZZLE FLASHES light up the trees all around them.    
Several Regulars FALL, caught in an AMBUSH. 

Redcoats scramble and die in the CROSSFIRE.  Simcoe PULLS
HIS SWORD.

BEN TALLMADGE leads his Dragoons and some Connecticut Militia
including CALEB in a charge out of their hiding spots. 

They engage the Redcoats at point blank range, FIRING pistols
and STABBING with bayonets.  It's a slaughter.

ABE  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I will do my utmost endeavor to
disclose and make known to His Majesty
and his Successors...

EXT. SETAUKET - VILLAGE GREEN (INTERCUT)

ABE 
All treasons, and traitorous
conspiracies, which I shall know to
be against, or any of them.

Richard looks on his son with grave, official scrutiny.  

EXT. CONNECTICUT FOREST (INTERCUT) 

Powder smoke in the air.  Dead King's Men litter the ground.  

SIMCOE, shot in the stomach and knee, pulls himself on his
belly.  His new "Captain" epaulette dangling off the uniform. 
A pair of muddy boots stop in front of him.  

CALEB (O.S.)
Captn' Simcoe?

He looks up to see Caleb looming over him.  Pistol leveled.   

CALEB (CONT'D)
Abe Woodhull says hello. 

Caleb's SHOT echoes through the trees.  56.

EXT. SETAUKET - VILLAGE GREEN - END INTERCUT

ABE
God save the King. 

The neighbors give cheers.  Some are half-hearted.  Robeson,
staring at Abe, turns and quickly walks away.

EXT. CONNECTICUT FOREST - DAY

The Continentals search the dead.  Caleb approaches Ben, who
still looks like he's in a rage.     

BEN
Regulars. 

CALEB
Just like we expected. 

BEN
Thought they might send Rangers to
link up with 'em.  Was hoping for
Rogers.   

CALEB
We'll get him soon enough.  

Ben looks at Caleb, nods.  Then reaches into his shirt and
takes the RANGER BONNET out.  Tosses it on Simcoe's corpse.

CALEB (CONT'D)
What's that for? 

BEN
Send my regards. 

Ben walks off.  Caleb looks down.  PUSH IN on the green woolen
Ranger Bonnet on Simcoe's chest...

EXT. SETAUKET - ROAD - DAY

Cicadas sing as Abe drives a wagon back to his farm, with
Mary, Thomas, and Richard in the wagon seat.  

MARY
I thought you presented yourself
well.

Abe looks at his wife, surprised.  An olive branch?

ABE
Thank you.  I thought Thomas did
well. 57.

RICHARD
Not so much as a peep.  

ABE
That's my boy. 

MARY
Well, there was everyone quiet while
you went ahead and said more than
two words.
(hugging Thomas)
He likes to listen to his father.  

RICHARD
A lost art.

Abe shakes his head, as they bump around the bend... 

EXT. WOODHULL FARM - CONTINUOUS

Where they are confronted by a horrific sight: his cabbage
field TRAMPLED by someone (or a group of someones). 

ABE
What... what...

RICHARD
Dear God.

Abe yanks the reigns.  The horse stops.  Abe hops off and
runs into the rows of sabotaged crop.  The entire crop.

MARY
Abraham!  Abraham! 

Mary is in a panic, running toward Abe, holding Thomas.

MARY (CONT'D)
What happened?  Why is this happening?

ABE
Mary, go inside.

MARY
No!  This is... everything!

She spins to take in the field, then turns back too fast. 
Thomas begins to cry.  Abe steadies her, then grabs Thomas
gently into his arms.  

ABE
Go inside and wait for me.  Now!

Mary suddenly imagines inside and then picks up her dress
and runs for her house.  58.

Abe calms Thomas down.  Richard slowly approaches.

ABE (CONT'D)
Two... three, maybe four horses. 
Must have taken them at least a half
an hour.

RICHARD
While we were in town. 

ABE
Who.  Who did this?

RICHARD
(quiet)
You did.  

Abe turns to Richard in disbelief.  Richard is ice.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
You brought this on yourself.  Many
around here don't trust you. 

Abe carefully sets Thomas down on the soft soil.  

RICHARD (CONT'D)
I know you lied.  To Major Hewlett. 
In my house.  In front of me.  Do
you think I don't know my own son?  

Abe is speechless.  JUDGE Woodhull peers at him. 

RICHARD (CONT'D)
Why did you give those names?  There
are no boys down in Hempstead with
those names.  Tell the truth.

ABE
Father...

RICHARD
Did you kill Joyce?

ABE
No!

RICHARD
Tell the truth!

ABE
I kept the money!

Richard stares.  Abe lies with the truth.59.

ABE (CONT'D)
There was no arrest by rebels.  I
cut my own scar.  I buried the silver
by the shore, and used the silk to
sell my story.  

RICHARD
You thought the Major would take
your profit...

ABE
The way he took your house.   

RICHARD
I invited him to billet-

ABE
Under threat of law.

RICHARD
Where is your take now?  Eh?

Abe steps toward him.  Richard steps back.  

ABE
With Anna Strong.  I used it to pay
my debt, that's why I went.  

Richard searches Abe's eyes.  Sees truth there.  He's furious.

RICHARD
I thought we decided you would stay
away from-

ABE
I never decided.  You decided for
me.  

RICHARD
You're a grown man, you can make
your own decisions.
(then)
But you are also my son and I will
always tell you what I think is right. 
And what is right... now... is we
return the proceeds to Hewlett.  

ABE
No.

RICHARD
Son, I have protected you up to this
point.  I will not go any further.   60.

Abe nods.  He looks around - too much to risk, too much to
lose, too much already lost.  He slowly settles to the ground,
forearms on his knees.

Richard feels both sympathetic, and satisfied.  He resumes a
wise, encouraging tone.   

RICHARD (CONT'D)
No matter how dark the night, God
grants each of us the chance to begin
anew, every day.
(beat)
It's not too late for you, Abraham.  

Abe picks up a leaf of uprooted cabbage.  Maybe he's right. 
Maybe it's time to make a choice.    

ABE
Your butcher stores.  In the city. 
You still need someone to run product
to them?    

Richard nods.  Glad that Abe has made the right decision,
not knowing that Abe has taken a step against the cause his
Father believes in. 

Richard steps up behind Abe, and puts a hand on his shoulder.  

Abe feels the low ache of betrayal in the pit of his stomach.

At that moment, THOMAS STANDS UP, wobbly.  Abe doesn't see
him.  Thomas takes his first steps - one, two, three... and
puts his tiny hand on Abe's other shoulder.  

Richard and Abe look at Thomas.  

Both Woodhulls smile at the same time. 

FADE OUT.

                       END OF SHOW
