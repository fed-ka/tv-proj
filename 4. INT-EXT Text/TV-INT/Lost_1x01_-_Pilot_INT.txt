      INSIDE the fuselage, looking out, the tumultuous OCEAN framed 
      by this giant shattered aluminum tube.  It's a disorienting 
      shot, since the plane is BANKED ON ITS SIDE.  At this angle, 
      SEATS are on a SIDE WALL, the wreckage-strewn floor actually 
    a long row of windows.

      And Jack appears, looking into the fuselage -- and we PUSH IN 
      ON HIM.  What Jack sees -- despite his ER training -- sickens 
      him.  Then Boone arrives, urgent, holding a HANDFUL OF PENS.

                                  BOONE
                    -- I didn't know which one would work best.

      For a long beat, Jack's eyes don't leave the fuselage.  
      Finally he looks at Boone.  And the pens.  And tears well in 
      Jack's eyes -- the whole experience finally catching up to 
      him.  Jack takes all of the pens, saying, softly, 
        emotionally, kindly:

                                  JACK
                      ...They're all good.  Thanks...

      And Jack walks off, past Boone, who turns, watching Jack go.


      This was Jack's POV -- as he still stares out the window, 
      contemplating something pretty heavy. Then:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    ...How's the drink?

      Jack turns -- looking up at the pretty, Australian FLIGHT 
      ATTENDANT.

                                  JACK
                          (bad)
                    It's good.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    That wasn't a very strong reaction.

                                  JACK
                    It's not a very strong drink.

      So she slips a couple MINI-BOTTLES of VODKA from her cart to 
      Jack.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                          (quiet, playful)
                    Shh.

                                  JACK
                          (leans in, sotto,
                            conspiratorial)
                    This of course breaks some critical FAA 
                      regulations --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    I saw you when you got on.  Giving your 
                    first class ticket to that older lady.

                                  JACK
                    Oh, I wasn't being sweet.  She guilted me 
                    into it.  She's like six-hundred years 
                    old and says she's never flown before.
                          (gimme a break)
                    Come on.


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    You think it's all an act?

                                  JACK
                    I'm pretty sure.

      Smiling, she walks off, toward the rear of the plane -- where 
      she has words with another Passenger a few rows back.  Jack 
      is smiling too, hoping she'll be back again soon.  Pleased, 
      Jack twists open one of the bottles, empties it into his 
      DRINK.  DOWNS the whole thing.

      He puts the other mini-bottle into his jacket pocket.

      Unbuckles his seatbelt, gets out of his seat just as CHARLIE 
      quickly pushes past, heading toward the front of the plane at 
    a swift clip -- a man on a mission --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Sorry...

                                  ROSE
                    Guess he really had to go.

      Jack smiles at ROSE seated across the row from him.  Of 
      course he has no idea that he will, in short order, save this 
      woman's life.

      Suddenly: light TURBULENCE.  Just a little.  No big deal. 
      DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP.  Jack becomes visibly 
      tense, does his best not to let it show --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has 
                    turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- 
                    please return to your seats with your 
                    seatbelts fastened...

      Jack glances at Rose, nervously clutching her armrest.

                                  JACK
                    It's normal.

                                  ROSE
                          (grateful)
                    ...Oh, I know.
                          (then)
                    I've just never been a good flier.  My 
                    husband always reminds me that planes 
                    want to be in the air.

                                  JACK
                    Well he sounds like a smart man.


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                    You be sure and tell him that when he 
                    gets back from the bathroom.

      The plane SHAKES again.  Jack smiles at Rose... and we almost 
      get the sense it's easier for him to focus on her fear than 
      deal with his own --

                                  JACK
                    I'll keep you company 'til he does.
                          (clicks seatbelt)
                    Don't worry, it'll be over in a --

6666AND THE PLANE DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET IN TWO SECONDS -- 
      SCREAMS, ENGINE WHINES AND THREE PEOPLE AND EVERY LOOSE 
      OBJECT SLAM TO THE CEILING -- JACK GRIPS THE ARMRESTS AS THE 
      PLANE SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY AND WE SMASH CUT TO --


      Kate stands up to find herself -- inside the front section of 
      the plane.  Everything eerily CANTED: all of FIRST CLASS and 
      the FRONT LAVATORIES between her and the COCKPIT.  OVERHEAD 
      BINS hanging open, the aisles themselves on an ANGLE -- RAIN 
      leaking in -- half a dozen BODIES still in their chairs.

      Jack emerges from the opening -- Sees Kate is uneasy --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Let's find your transgizmo and get outta 
                    here, yeah?

      Jack starts to move up the aisle -- fighting GRAVITY -- has 
      to grab onto the SEATS so he doesn't fall...

      Kate follows him, THE SOUND OF THE RAIN still pounding on the 
      shattered hull.  Goes without being said --

      This is all pretty fucking SCARY.

      Charlie then crawls through.  Stands.  Looks up, toward the 
      cockpit.  Takes it all in --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    God... this is horrible...

      He starts climbing behind them...

      CONTINUOUS

      Jack reaches the COCKPIT DOOR.  Battered by the crash -- 
      slightly ajar, but still LOCKED.  Jack reaches in -- TUGS on 
      the door.  But it won't open.  Jack grabs a CHARRED FIRE 
        EXTINGUISHER...

                                  JACK
                          (to Kate)
                    -- Get back...

      And Jack SLAMS the extinguisher down on the DOOR KNOB.  
      Dents, but nothing.  SLAMS it down again -- the lock BREAKS a 
      little -- but it'll take some more SLAMS --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                          (HITTING IT with all his MIGHT)
                    Come on-- come on-- COME ON!

      BANG!  The knob BREAKS off!  And Jack drops the extinguisher  
      -- RIPS OPEN THE DOOR AND THE COPILOT'S BODY FALLS OUT!

      Kate SCREAMS -- Jack SHOUTS -- and the body lands RIGHT NEAR 
      CHARLIE, JUST AS HE'S CLIMBING INTO THE FRONT SECTION AND HE 
      SCREAMS --

                                    CHARLIE
                      AAAHHH--DAMN!  GOD!

      Jack looks to Kate --

                                  JACK
                    You okay?

                                  KATE
                          (no)
                    -- Yeah, you?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I'm all right!  FYI -- I'm good...

      And Jack pulls himself up and into:







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          39.



      CONTINUOUS

      Rain pours through one of the shattered windows -- though 
      TREE BRANCHES and LEAVES obscures any view.  The other 
      windows are intact, but thick with humidity.  Branches and 
      leaves also obscure any view to the outside.  The instrument 
      panel broken -- some pieces HANGING -- WIRES EXPOSED.

      And the PILOT's body is here, slumped in his seat.  Jack 
      turns back to Kate, who is about to climb up -- but she sees 
      the Pilot's body.

                                  JACK
                          (protectively)
                    -- You don't have to come up here--

                                  KATE
                    -- No, I'm good.

      So Jack helps pull up Kate.  As he starts searching 
      compartments:

                                  KATE (CONT'D)
                    -- So what does a transceiver look like?

                                  JACK
                    -- Like a complicated walkie talkie.

      Kate starts looking for it too.  In order to check the 
      Pilot's compartment, she has to pull him back, off the 
      controls.  So does, back into his seat and SUDDENLY THE PILOT 
      JOLTS, AWAKE -- KATE GASPS and Jack, shocked, moves to him -- 
      the Pilot COUGHS, disoriented and hurt.  Jack unbuckles his 
      straps -- checks his vitals --

                  JACK (CONT'D)PILOT
      -- Hey -- can you hear me?(dazed, weak)
        (to Kate)-- What -- wh --
      -- I need the water --

      Kate quickly goes through the backpack as Jack undoes the 
      Pilot's tie, loosens his collar -- Kate hands the water to 
      Jack, who gives it to the Pilot -- he drinks a little, coughs 
      some up.  A dried cut on the man's forehead -- his eye 
      closed.  Although a pro, the Pilot is on the verge of tears.

                                  PILOT 
                    -- How many -- survived?





                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  JACK
                    At least forty-eight.  Including you.
                          (Pilot nods, heartsick)
                    -- Anything feel broken?

      The Pilot slowly, painfully begins to move -- but:

                                  PILOT
                    Head hurts -- dizzy...

                                  JACK
                    Probably a concussion.

                                  PILOT
                    -- How long has it been?

                                  JACK
                    Sixteen hours.

                                  PILOT
                    -- Sixteen...
                          (then, afraid)
                    -- Has anyone come?

                                  JACK
                    Not yet.

      Jack and Kate watch as the Pilot closes his eyes, almost in 
      pain at the thought.  Finally, his voice weak:

                                  PILOT
                    Six hours in.  Our radio went out.  The 
                    redundant system... the transponder -- 
                    wasn't functioning.  No one could see us.
                          (then, with dread)
                    So we turned back.  To land in Fiji.
                          (dear God...)
                    When we hit that turbulence... we were 
                    over a thousand miles off course -- 
                    They'll be looking in the wrong place.

      Kate looks to Jack -- this is even worse news than he 
        anticipated.

                                  PILOT (CONT'D)
                    We have a transceiver--

                                  JACK
                    -- Good, that's what we were hoping --

      And the Pilot tries to stand -- it's hard, he's so bruised --




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    You shouldn't try to...

                                  PILOT
                          (getting his bearings now)
                    I'm all right.
                          (points to the panel)
                      Transceiver's in there.

      Kate goes for a compartment -- and pulls out a DAMAGED RADIO. 
      She hands it to the Pilot.  He starts to work it -- when Jack 
      realizes:

                                  JACK
                    -- Where's Charlie?

      Good question.  Kate moves back, out of the cockpit.  The 
      Pilot keeps trying to radio -- but:

                                  PILOT
                    -- It's not working...


      Kate peeks in -- but Charlie's nowhere to be seen.  Played as 
      an eerie moment... but then she sees the door to one of the 
      FRONT LAVS is ajar.  Hears something INSIDE.

      Kate climbs back -- peers into the inverted bathroom, where 
      Charlie's leaning over the toilet bowl --

                                  KATE
                    -- Hey, what're you d--?

      Charlie jumps -- nervous -- turns to her -- we HOLD ON 
      CHARLIE, he doesn't have a fast answer --

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- What?  Nothing --

      But then: MROOOOOWRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOBWWRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  Oh 
      shit: the SOUND again.  Except this time it's CLOSE --


      Jack turns -- the Pilot freezes --

                      PILOTJACK
      -- What the hell was that?(whisper yell to the 
                                                      back)
                                                  Kate!

      Kate's quickly climbing back in --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  KATE
                          (sotto)
                    -- It's right outside --

                                  PILOT
                    -- What's righ -- ?

                                  JACK
                    -- Shh!

      -- Whatever it is, it's RIGHT THERE -- stepping now, outside 
      the cockpit -- they're motionless as there's ANOTHER STEP -- 
      the WIRES in the cockpit SHAKE with the apparent "FOOT" 
      IMPACT -- and a DARK SHAPE CROSSES the window --

      Jack SLOWLY climbs up -- on one of the pilot seats -- and he 
      uses his hand -- wipes away some of the humidity on the 
      window in order to look outside -- but there's no way to see 
    a thing out there.

      So the Pilot gets up -- moves toward the broken window 
      covered with LEAVES and BRANCHES --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    -- I wouldn't do that.

                                  PILOT
                    -- Good to know.

      And the Pilot puts the transceiver down on his seat as he 
      pushes away the LEAVES and BRANCHES and PEEKS HIS HEAD OUT 
      THE SHATTERED WINDOW.

      Jack and Kate watch, terrified for a moment.  Then, quietly:

                                  KATE
                    ...Do you s--

      SUDDENLY THE PILOT'S BODY GETS YANKED UP -- BUT HIS LEGS HIT 
      THE DASH SO WHATEVER'S GOT HIM CAN'T PULL HIM OUT AND KATE 
      SCREAMS AND THE PILOT -- HIS UPPER BODY OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT -- 
      DROPS THE TRANSCEIVER ONTO THE FLOOR AND HE SCREAMS 
        BLOODYFUCKINGMURDER AS JACK MOVES TO HOLD KATE BACK -- 
      CHARLIE SCRAMBLES UP, YELLING:

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPE--?!?!

      -- NOW CHARLIE'S SCREAMING AS THE PILOT'S BODY GETS YANKED UP 
      AGAIN -- BAM! -- HIS LEGS HIT THE DASH AGAIN -- THE PILOT'S 
      SCREAMS ARE HORRIBLE -- KATE SCREAMS AGAIN AS THE PILOT 
      FINALLY GETS YANKED OUT OF THE COCKPIT AND SUDDENLY THE THING 
      OUTSIDE SLAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE COCKPIT --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED: (2)8181


      Jack, Kate and Charlie all on the ground, scrambling to get 
      out, trying to get the fuck out of the cockpit but --

      Jack looks back -- sees the TRANSCEIVER has fallen off the 
      pilot's seat.  He reaches for it -- BAM!  The cockpit jars 
      again -- transceiver skitters out of Jack's grasp --

                        KATECHARLIE
      JACK!  C'MON!LEAVE IT!

                                  JACK
                    No...

      But he doesn't give up -- lunges after it -- SLAM!  Jack 
      loses his footing, lands on his stomach -- transceiver's just 
      sitting there, arm's length away and --

      Jack finally gets it into his grasp -- staggering to his feet 
      as it SHIFTS again and --

      BAM!!!  ONCE -- THE THREE FALL DOWN -- TWICE -- AND THEN 
      AGAIN -- AND THE WHOLE COCKPIT DROPS --

      CONTINUOUS

      -- And it's so LOUD in here. Jack scrambles after Kate and 
      Charlie, all three trying to get the fuck outta here --


      Back on the PLANE, PRE-CRASH.  CHARLIE sits in his seat near 
      the rear of the plane, shaking.  Pale.  SWEAT dots his brow.  
      He looks up at the same FLIGHT ATTENDANT that helped Jack:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah -- I'm good, thanks.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    Can I get you some wat--?

                                    CHARLIE
                          (go away)
                    I'm fine.  Thank you.  Please.

      The Flight Attendant stares.  Then:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    All right.

      As she heads to the back of the plane, she looks at him, 
      maybe a little SUSPICIOUSLY.

      Charlie taps his hand, FIDGETY. Takes a quick peek over his 
      shoulder at --

      THE REAR GALLEY

      The Flight Attendant who he just blew off talks to TWO MALE 
      FLIGHT ATTENDANTS in hushed tones and --

      All three look up at Charlie.

      He immediately faces front -- nervous.  TIGHT on him.  He 
      turns back -- takes another peek --




                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:9696


      ALL THREE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS are heading back up the aisle 
      towards him --

      Charlie quickly undoes his seatbelt, gets up in one swift 
      motion --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (CONT D)
                    Sir?  Excuse me --

      But Charlie's already moving fast down the aisle -- and he 
      brushes by JACK, getting up from his own seat --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sorry...

      And as Charlie moves on, we can just hear behind him --

                                  ROSE (O.S.)
                    Guess he really had to go.

      Charlie arrives at the lavatories -- but they're both 
      occupied.

                                  CHARLIE
                    -- Bugger --

      -- And so he KEEPS MOVING, through BUSINESS CLASS -- crossing 
      to the other side of the plane -- he keeps going, into FIRST 
      CLASS -- he turns back to see the THREE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
      heading for him -- and the PLANE SHAKES.  Just a little.  No 
      big deal.  DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP as Charlie 
      reaches the FRONT LAVATORY, enters --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has 
                    turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- 
                    please return to your seats with your 
                    seatbelts fastened...


      Charlie is FLIPPING OUT.  CAMERA is in here with him, TIGHT.  
      CLAUSTROPHOBIC as he PULLS OFF HIS SHOE -- reaches into his 
      SOCK as suddenly there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.)
                    Sir?  Are you all right?

      Charlie ignores her, still digging in his sock... finally 
      pulls out a ROLLED UP BAGGIE containing a BROWN POWDER.

      KNOCKING MORE INSISTENT NOW...



                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to open 
                    the door...

      Charlie holds the baggie up... looks at it longingly.  This 
      physically PAINS him.  But he turns around and drops it into 
      the TOILET.  The baggie rests on the METAL DROP-PLATE as...

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 - MALE 
                                  (O.S.)
                          (firm)
                    Open the door now, sir.

      Charlie takes one last look at his stash, TIGHT SHOT as he 
      reaches for the FLUSH LEVER and...

      THE PLANE SUDDENLY DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET -- CHARLIE IS 
      THROWN TO THE CEILING --


      PEOPLE SCREAMING -- THE PLANE BANKING HARD -- NIGHTMARE

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Seconds after Jack has pulled out the shrapnel -- Jack doing 
      his best to assess the wound, now bleeding profusely.  Hurley 
      has neglected his duty in holding Shrapnel Man down, in 
        awe/disgust/shock about what's happening in front of him --

                      HURLEYJACK
      Dude...Hand me those strips --

      And thank fucking God most of this happening below frame 
      because Jack actually just put his hand inside the guy.

                      HURLEYJACK
      Dude.Just hand me the strips -- I 
                                                  need to get this blood --
      -- I don't think I can --(feels something; it 
                                                      ain't good)
                                                  -- Oh.
      -- "Oh."  Oh what?  What's 
      going on?  Is there something 
      in there ---- I need a little focus, 
                                                  okay?  The strips.  Just hand 
                                                  me the --

      But Hurley in fact cannot focus.  He's looking at the open 
      wound, eyes glazing over.  Jack sees it --

                                  JACK 
                    Hey!  Don't even think about -- HURLEY!

      But it's too late.  Hurley crumples, hits the ground like a 
      bag of rocks -- PASSED OUT.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Dammit.

      And as he does his best to refocus on the task at hand --


      We're looking up at the FLIGHT ATTENDANT -- and realize that 
      we're back on the plane.  The moments before the trouble.

      And the Flight Attendant is talking to KATE, who looks up at 
      her -- and as if having to hide some deep trouble, kindly 
      says about her almost-empty cup of Coke:

                                  KATE
                    No, I'm fine with this, thank you.

      The Flight Attendant turns to the MAN sitting beside Kate --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                    -- You, sir?

      AND WE REALIZE IT'S THE MAN WHO WAS BLEEDING FROM THE HEAD AT 
      THE CRASH SCENE -- THE MAN WHO JACK IS OPERATING ON.

                                  MAN
                          (to her chest)
                    I'll have a coffee, sweetheart.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                    -- Coffee, sure --

      And the Flight Attendant moves away.  The Man glances at 
      Kate.  Kate stares out the window, pensive.  A beat.

                                  MAN
                    You look worried.
                          (she says nothing)
                    I'd be worried too, I was you.

      Kate's eyes just stare at the blue out there.

                                  MAN (CONT'D)
                    Hey -- look at the bright side.  There's 
                    an off-chance they'll believe your story.

                          (tongue firmly in cheek)
                    I sure know I do.

      Kate finally looks at him.  An intense stare.  For a reason 
      we're about to learn, she resents this man.

                                  KATE
                    It doesn't matter to me what you believe.

      He grins.  If it wasn't clear before, it's clear now -- this 
      guy is a Class-A prickfuck.

                                  MAN
                    Well that sure is true.  Always has been.
                          (long beat)
                    You sure you don't want another soda?

                                  KATE
                          (defiant)
                    Yeah, thanks.

      Then she goes to take a final sip -- and what we see shocks 
      us.

      KATE IS WEARING THE HANDCUFFS.

      HER JACKET HAS HIDDEN THEM FROM THOSE AROUND HER -- BUT HOLY 
      SHIT, SHE'S THE ONE THE U.S. MARSHAL WAS TAKING BACK TO THE 
      STATES -- AND THE MAN BESIDE HER IS THAT MARSHAL.

      As she finishes her drink, the PLANE SHAKES.  Just a little. 
      No big deal.  DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has

      And Kate turns to the man.

                                  KATE
                    I have one favor to ask.

      AND SUDDENLY THE PLANE DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET IN TWO SECONDS  
      -- PEOPLE HIT THE CEILING -- SCREAMS AS THE BEVERAGE CART 
      COMES DOWN, HITTING THE MAN BESIDE KATE -- HE'S SUDDENLY 
      UNCONSCIOUS AS THE PLANE HITS HORRIBLE TURBULENCE --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          88.



      PASSENGERS SCREAMING -- TERRIFIED --137137

      -- AND THE PLANE DROPS -- it's MAYHEM as the thing is about 
      to break up and the OXYGEN MASKS DROP NOW and people scramble 
      to grab them -- Kate tries too --

      BUT HER CUFFS ARE ATTACHED TO HER BELT -- SHE CAN'T REACH 
      HIGH ENOUGH -- AND SHE CAN BARELY BREATHE NOW -- UNABLE TO 
      REACH FOR THE OXYGEN MASK --

      PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING --138138

      CAMERA SHAKING MADLY AS THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLANE IS TESTED  
      -- THE VIEW OUT KATE'S WINDOW ALTERNATELY SKY AND SEA AS THEY 
      DROP --

      THEN KATE139139

      GRABS THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN AND PULLS HIM OVER HER -- HE SLUMPS 
      ON TOP OF HER, HEAD BLOODY AND SHE PULLS HIS KEY-RING OUT -- 
      SCRAMBLES TO UNLOCK HER CUFFS -- SHE DOES -- AND SHE GRABS 
      THE OXYGEN MASK, PUTS IT ON HER -- AND PROPS THE MARSHAL UP 
      IN HIS SEAT -- GRABS HIS MASK AND PUTS IT ON HIM.

      AND WE'RE TIGHT ON KATE --140140

      TERRIFIED OUT OF HER MIND AS THE PLANE IS ABOUT TO BREAK UP -- 
      AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HER AS THE REAR OF THE PLANE RIPS OFF -- 
      JUST FUCKING DISAPPEARS -- PEOPLE AND THINGS FALLING OUT INTO 
      NOTHINGNESS AS WE SMASH CUT TO:
