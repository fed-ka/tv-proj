CLOSE ON: A scrawny MONKEY scratches.
ANGLES ON: Defeated, listless ANIMALS, in the bleak environs of a
dilapidated ZOO.
WIDER: It is CENTRAL PARK ZOO in depression era NEW YORK. The PARK
itself is like a GARBAGE DUMP, dotted with squalid SHANTY TOWNS.
Against these BLEAK IMAGES, the SOUND of a BRIGHT, BRASSY SONG
fades up: Al Jolson, singing "I'm Sitting on Top of the World".
The sky line of MANHATTAN rises in the background, a grim steaming
jungle on this cold FALL day.
I
LONG continues over:
IMAGES: The CROWDED STREETS of NEW YORK ... beneath the bustle is
a sense of despair.
LONG SOUP LINES snake along the STREETS.
The HUNGRY search through RUBBISH BINS for FOOD. SKYSCRAPERS rise
steadily upwards as more people are evicted from their homes.
HOMELESS sleep amid steaming VENTS and GARBAGE STREWN GUTTERS.
Intercut:
The COLOR and MUSIC contrast with the SOUP LINES and SLUMPED
SHOULDERS of the REAL WORLD.
MANNY and ANN emerge from the STAGE DOOR, into an ALLEYWAY. Night
and winter are setting in ...
MANNY splutters out another LOUD SNEEZE.
MANNY
The trick is to start the build right
at the back of your throat...
(sneezing comically)
Works well out through the nose too.
ANN
Have you eaten today?
MANNY
(sheepish)
Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about
me.
ANN
Hey - you're all I've got.
ANN slips her arm through MANNY'S ...
ANN (cont'd)
Come on - take me to dinner.
MANNY
You think the kitchen'll still be open
on Third?
4.
ANN
Soup and biscuits - perfect.
Cut to:
WIDE ON: The VAUDEVILLE THEATRE. The DOOR is chained closed.
WORKMEN are up ladders, taking the HOARDINGS down SIGN and putting
a large sign up: THEATRE CLOSED TILL FURTHER NOTICE ...
ANN
(calling out to Harry)
Hey! Harry, what's going on?
ANGLE ON: ANN ... rattling the HEAVY STEEL CHAINS that are
LOCKED
around the DOORS to the VAUDEVILLE THEATRE ...
ANN(cont'd)
Hey, open up! We work here.
A WORKMAN up a LADDER smirks down at her.
LADDER MAN
Not anymore.
A MOTLEY collection of VAUDEVILLE PERFORMERS cluster on the
SIDEWALK ... near them an incongruous assortment of PROPS and
COSTUMES litter the STREET ...
MAUDE
(calling at some WORKMEN)
It's all right for you! We haven't had
a pay check in two weeks - how we
going to eat?
ANN
They're not going to get away with
this.
LOSE ON: MAUDE looks bleakly at ANN ...
AUDE
They just did.
ANN tries to gather up PROPS - MANNY's BROOM, her TOP-HAT, HARRY'S
parasol ...
MANNY (O.S.)
Ann ... Annie! It's no use.
ANN turns ... Manny is standing quietly to one side.
ANNY (cont'd)
The show it's over - it's done.
'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm
going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ...
ANGLE ON: ANN stares at MANNY in shock ..
5.
MANNY (cont'd)
I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were
small people have been letting you
down. But you gotta think of yourself
now. You should try out for that part.
ANN looks at him warily ...
MANNY (cont'd)
It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I
know what you're thinking - every time
you reach out for something you care
about ... fate comes along and
snatches it away.
MANNY, grabs ANN'S hand ...
MANNY (cont'd)
But not this time, Annie ... not this
time.
LOSE ON: ANN as she digests MANNY'S words ... the LOUD rumble
of an EL TRAIN thunders overhead ...
ANGLE ON: WESTON, a NEW YORK THEATRE PRODUCER, strides out of
his office, a copy of VARIETY tucked under his arm ...
ANN
(faux nonchalance)
Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!
WESTON turns and sees ANN ... he quickens his step.
WESTON
Oh, Jeez ...
ANGLE ON: ANN falls into step beside WESTON as he hurries
along the BUSY SIDEWALK.
WESTON (cont'd)
Look, Miss ... I told you already;
call my office - leave your resume
with my secretary.
ANN doggedly follows WESTON ...
ANN
Why would I want to do that when we
can talk about it in person?
WESTON
Because that's what a smart girl would
do.
ANN
But I already sent you my resume - you
returned it unopened.
6.
WESTON
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.
ANN
Please, just an audition - that's all
I'm asking.
WESTON
esus - you don't give up, do you?
ANN
Mr. Weston, I know this role
backwards.
ESTON
ell, that's too bad - because we just
gave the part to someone else. Sorry,
kid - the play is cast.
They are standing outside an ITALIAN RESTAURANT ... WESTON goes to
enter ...
ANN catches a glimpse of PLATES of FOOD and GLASSES of WINE. She
quickly looks away. WESTON catches the glance and stops.
WESTON (cont'd)
Look - I know times are tough. You
want my advice? Use what you got.
You're not bad looking - a girl like
you doesn't have to starve.
HOPE flickers in ANN'S EYES as WESTON fishes into his POCKET
for a PEN and BUSINESS CARD. He scribbles down an address.
WESTON (cont'd)
There's a new place, just opened.
(handing to her)
Listen, princess - this gig ain't the
Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny
K. Tell him I sent you.
WESTON hands her the BUSINESS CARD ... ANN looks down at the
address, not recognizing it. She looks at him questioningly.
ESTON (cont'd)
(evasive)
Just play the date, take the money and
forget you was ever there.
CLOSE ON: ANN staring down at the piece of paper in her hand.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM and PRESTON hurrying down the CROWDED SIDEWALK -
struggling under the weight of 8 FILM CANS! DENHAM is glancing
back over his shoulder.
DENHAM
I want the cast and crew on the ship
within the hour.
RESTON
o Carl, you can't do this!
DENHAM
Tell `em the studio's pressured us
into an early departure.
PRESTON
It's not ethical!
DENHAM
hat are they gonna do - sue me? They
can get in line! I'm not going to let
them kill my film.
ANGLE ON: PRESTON follows DENHAM, who steps off the curb ... and
flags a CAB down. He cuts across the BUSY ROAD, PRESTON hurrying
behind.
RESTON
ou realize none of the camera
equipment is on board. We have no
permits ... no visas ...
DENHAM
hat's why I have you, Preston.
RESTON
We have no insurance, no foreign
currency - in fact, we have no
currency of any kind -
ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks back across the STREET and notices an angry
INVESTOR heading towards him.
DENHAM
Get in there!
PRESTON suddenly finds himself BUNDLED into the back of a CAB.
PRESTON
ho's gonna pay for the ship?
QUICK MOMENT: The SLEAZY INVESTOR grabs at the PARTIALLY OPEN BACK
WINDOW of the CAB.
SLEAZY INVESTOR
Get out of there!
12.
DENHAM hurriedly WINDS the WINDOW SHUT ... the SLEAZY INVESTOR
yelps with PAIN, as he yanks his JAMMED FINGERS away from the CAB!
DENHAM
tep on it!
SLEAZY INVESTOR
(furious)
You're finished, Denham!
ANGLE ON: PRESTON sprawled on the SEAT, amid a PILE of FILM CANS,
as the CAB speeds away!
DENHAM
on't worry Preston - I've had a lot
of practice at this: I'm real good at
crapping the crappers.
CUT TO:
LATER ...
AERIAL WIDE: DENHAM'S CAB cruises along the CROWDED STREETS of NEW
YORK.
DENHAM
And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest
...
PRESTON (O.S.)
Red label, 80% proof - packed in a
crate marked "lemonade".
ANGLE ON: The CAB screeches to a SUDDEN HALT in MID-TRAFFIC ...
DENHAM jumps out, leaving PRESTON in protest ...
PRESTON
We gotta delay the shoot - shut
production down ... We can't sail
tonight!
DENHAM
Not an option.
RESTON
Carl!
DENHAM
I said I'd find a girl.
DENHAM turns and looks at PRESTON briefly.
DENHAM (cont'd)
For Godsake, Preston - think like a
winner. Call Jack ... I need that
Goddamn screenplay!
ANGLE ON: DENHAM leans in the window, PRESTON looks on PERPLEXED.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Defeat is always momentary.
DENHAM bangs the CAB ROOF with his hand, and then strides off
confidently along the street.
CLOSE ON: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN, with feather
boas and peacock fans ... gaudy banners proclaiming Miss Lily Rose
... Delaware Du Boise ... Velvet Cushions ...
W
IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He
straightens his tie and heads towards the DOOR.
ANGLE ON: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a SMALLER GIRL,
arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE ... DENHAM eyes
the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to go inside,
when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in the
GLASS DOOR ...
LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK. She is
unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at the BURLESQUE
HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot of anger
forming in her stomach.
LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes lock on ANN
through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.
15.
ANN angrily CRUMPLES the FLYER, drops it in the GUTTER and walks
C
away from the THEATRE.
LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.
A BUSY FRUIT STALL on the SIDEWALK. The VENDOR is hurriedly
handing out APPLES and pocketing NICKELS.
ANGLE ON: ANN walks slowly by ... her eyes on the FRUIT. She
glances at the VENDOR, SWIPES an APPLE from the TRAY, and quickly
moves on, slipping the APPLE into her POCKET.
ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED! The ANGRY VENDOR pulls her
hand
out of her pocket, which is still clutching the stolen apple.
VENDOR
(angry)
You gonna pay for this?
ANN tries to pull away. The VENDOR's grip on her arm tightens.
DENHAM (O.S.)
Excuse me ...
ANGLE ON: DENHAM steps up behind them up HOLDING a NICKEL ...
DENHAM (cont'd)
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.
ANGLE ON: THE VENDOR snatches the NICKEL from DENHAM'S fingers.
ANGLE ON: The CROWDED DOCKS ... a clutter of SHIPS and SHANTY
TOWNS. A CAB drives onto the DOCKS. DENHAM hops out and holds the
door open for ANN, who emerges carrying a BATTERED SUITCASE.
ANN stares at a LARGE OCEAN GOING LINER that rises above her.
ANN
(awestruck)
Is this the moving picture ship?
DENHAM
Not exactly ... it's actually this one
over here.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is striding towards a RUSTY BATTERED TRAMP
STEAMER on the OTHER SIDE of the WHARF! This is "The Venture".
19.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.
HAYES
Haul away ...
ROUGH looking SAILORS are working hard to get the boat under way.
Hurried activity everywhere, crates being loaded; smoke begins
pouring from the stacks ...
DENHAM crosses and talks to MIKE and HERB who stand next to some
film gear.
DENHAM
Is this all of the equipment? This is
all of it? We're taking the Bell and
Howell? Good. You got all the lenses -
you got the two and the six?
PRESTON (O.S.)
Carl!
DENHAM
Yes -
to MIKE and HERB)
Get it on board, fellas. Come on.
A
NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to
DENHAM ... his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one side.
PRESTON
(urgent whisper)
They're on their way. I've just had
word.
DENHAM
Who?
PRESTON
(whisper)
Men in uniform. The studio called the
cops!
A FLASH of FEAR crosses DENHAM'S FACE ... DENHAM calls across to
a TALL FIGURE who is supervising the loading of the ship.
DENHAM
Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the
mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever
the hell it is you do - we gotta
leave.
ENGLEHORN
I cannot do that ... we're waiting on
the manifest.
DENHAM
What? Who? English - please!
20.
ENGLEHORN
(dryly)
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.
DENHAM leans in conspiratorially ...
DENHAM
(low voice)
I'll give you another thousand to
leave right now.
ENGLEHORN
You haven't given me the first
thousand yet.
DENHAM glances at ANN, flustered and embarrassed.
DENHAM
Can we talk about this later. Can't
you see we're in the company of a VIP
guest?
ENGLEHORN's gaze falls upon ANN ...
ENGLEHORN
Ma'am...
ANN
Ann Darrow.
ENGLEHORN
So you are ready for this voyage, Miss
Darrow?
ANN
Sure...
ENGLEHORN
Nervous?
ANN
Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
ANN looks taken aback ...
ENGLEHORN
It isn't every woman who would take
such a risk.
DENHAM throws PRESTON a look!
PRESTON
(hurriedly)
Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her
cabin?
DENHAM
Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.
21.
PRESTON
Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my
name is Preston, Carl's assistant.
DENHAM pulls his CHEQUE BOOK from his JACKET POCKET.
DENHAM
Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will
you take a cheque?
ENGLEHORN
Do I have a choice?
E
ANGLE ON: PRESTON goes to lead ANN up the GANG WAY past some rough-
looking sailors, onto the SHIP - "THE VENTURE".
PRESTON
Please, follow me. If there's anything
that you need ... `excuse me fellas,
if there's anything that you need
please don't hesitate to ... ask ...
PRESTON turns back to see ANN hesitating at the bottom of the GANG
WAY ... an unnerved expression on her face ...
ANN steps forward ... Deep breath, she follows PRESTON.
CRANE DOWN the stern of the ship as the PROPELLER kicks into
action.
ANGLE ON: The PROPELLER CHURNS through the WATER ...
ENGLEHORN watches the VENTURE pull away from the dock ...
Satisfied, he enters the WHEELHOUSE ...
ENGLEHORN
Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
HAYES
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
ANGLE ON: JACK emerges from the labyrinthine SHIP INTERIOR and
rushes to the RAIL of the SHIP ... he freezes in HORROR!
JACK
Oh Christ!
ANGLE ON: The SHIP is PULLING AWAY from the DOCK ... 6 feet ...
7 feet ... JACK contemplates JUMPING for a MOMENT:
JACK (cont'd)
Goddammit!
POLICE CARS race along the docks towards the VENTURE, SIRENS
wailing.
JACK SLUMPS on the DECK in DESPAIR. He's missed his chance to
get off the ship.
26.
DENHAM steps up behind JACK, just as a POLICE CAR, followed by
ZELMAN and the INVESTORS, pull up on the DOCKS in the DISTANCE.
DENHAM
I keep telling you, Jack, there's no
money in theatre.
CUT TO:
The INVESTORS leap out of the car.
SLEAZY INVESTOR
No, no, no!
The VENTURE steams past the LIGHTS of MANHATTAN.
DENHAM
You're much better off sticking with
film.
JACK
I don't do it for the money, Carl. I
happen to love the theatre.
DENHAM
o, you don't.
JACK looks at him exasperated as DENHAM casually taps his PIPE
on the RAIL of the BOAT.
DENHAM (cont'd)
If you really loved it, you would have
jumped.
WIDE ON: ZELMAN throws his hat to the ground in anger as THE
VENTURE pulls away from the docks.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE steams away from the DOCKS, passing under the
MANHATTAN BRIDGE.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE ploughs through a HEAVY SWELL.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY is sorting NETS up on DECK. Nearby HAYES rests
against the railing.
HAYES
You gotta straighten up. You don't
want to be on this ship for the rest
of your life.
JIMMY
I do.
31.
HAYES
No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get
yourself educated. Give yourself some
options. Take this serious.
JIMMY
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been
readin'.
JIMMY pulls a battered book out of his coat pocket. HAYES takes
the book. It has a painting of a TRAMP STEAMER on the cover and
the title: HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad.
HAYES
Where did you get this?
JIMMY
(prevaricating)
I borrowed it ...
HAYES flicks the book open and sees "Property of New York
Public Library" stamped on the interior of the dust jacket.
JIMMY (cont'd)
... on long term loan. Look at this.
JIMMY points to the printed byline on the back of the book.
JIMMY (cont'd)
"Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See -
just like us.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE as it cuts through open OCEAN.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE ploughs through a HEAVY SWELL.
DENHAM (V.O.)
She's standing at the railing ... she
doesn't know it yet, but they're
sailing towards disaster. You got
that?
JACK (V.O.)
She turns ... The First Mate is
staggering towards her - there's a
knife sticking out of his back!
NGLE ON: The SHIP moves through GREY SEAS ... Dolphins swim
alongside.
IDE ON: DENHAM is FILMING ANN and BRUCE. Clustered around are his
crew, HERB and MIKE and PRESTON.
DENHAM
All right everyone, from the top.
And
... action!
ANGLE ON: BRUCE saunters up to ANN, who is leaning on the rail,
staring out to sea, in full hair and make-up.
ANN
I think this is awfully exciting! I've
never been on a ship before.
BRUCE
I've never been on one with a woman
before.
ANN
I guess you don't think much of women
on ships, do you?
BRUCE
No, they're a nuisance.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking intently at JIMMY and HAYES who are
further down the DECK ... talking quietly.
37.
ANGLE ON: HAYES shoots DENHAM an ALARMED LOOK.
ANN (O.S.)
Well, I'll try not to be.
BRUCE (O.S.)
Just being around is trouble.
ANN (O.S.)
Well! Is that a nice thing to say!
BRUCE (O.S.)
It's a dangerous thing, having girls
on ships. They're messy and they're
unreliable!
DENHAM
(distracted)
Cut! Great!
NGLE ON: DENHAM'S gaze returns to JIMMY and HAYES who are huddled
in a group with three more SAILORS ... word is travelling fast.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Bruce, wonderful performance. You can
relax for ten minutes.
ANGLE ON: BRUCE looking pretty pleased with himself.
DENHAM (cont'd)
That was very natural... I felt moved.
JACK looks on in disbelief.
B
ANGLE ON: BRUCE walking past JACK ...
RUCE
hat do you think, Driscoll? The
dialogue's got some flow now - huh?
JACK
It was pure effluence.
BRUCE
beefed up the banter ...
JACK
Try to resist that impulse.
BRUCE
It's just a little humor, Bud - what
are you, a Bolshevik or something?
JACK watches as BRUCE saunters off ... he turns back to DENHAM.
JACK
Actors. They travel the world but all
they ever see is a mirror!
38.
JACK looks up to see ANN looking dismayed, a MIRROR COMPACT, in
her hand ...
She quickly snaps the COMPACT shut and turns away.
CLOSE ON: JACK - taken aback.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM standing behind the CAMERA with HERB and MIKE.
DENHAM is caught up in the scene and is EMOTING FURIOUSLY.
NGLE ON: ANN RUNNING out on to the DECK of the VENTURE in a
GLITTERING GOWN. She is SIGHING and CRYING in a MELODRAMATIC kind
of way ...
A
NGLE ON: JACK approaching, he is reading pages in his HAND,
he
looks up just as ...
ANN turns, TEARS on her cheeks.. lit by the GOLDEN RAYS of the
SETTING SUN.
ANN stares at JACK, momentarily forgetting where she is. He stares
back at her.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM catching the EXCHANGE of LOOKS. He takes the
script pages off JACK and shoos him away ...
ANGLE ON: DENHAM & ENGLEHORN talk out the front of the WHEELHOUSE.
IDE ON: THE VENTURE steams on as the SUN falls slowly behind the
horizon ...
ANGLE ON: ANN DANCING with JIMMY, much to the AMUSEMENT of
GATHERED CREW ... CHOY is singing Marie's Wedding accompanied
by
some SAILORS playing various MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
CLOSE ON: JACK watching her ...
ANGLE ON: DENHAM scanning the HORIZON with BINOCULARS, ENGLEHORN
comes out of the WHEELHOUSE ... some charts in his HAND ...
AERIAL: The VENTURE cuts a wide arc through the sea as the SHIP
slowly turns ...
NGLE ON: DENHAM, RUNNING up the STAIRS to the WHEELHOUSE.
DENHAM
(calling)
What's going on?
45.
ENGLEHORN
There's a warrant out for your arrest.
Did you know that? I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.
DENHAM
nother week - I haven't got a film
yet. Please - I have risked everything
I have on this!
ENGLEHORN
No, Denham - you risked everything I
have.
D
DENHAM
What do you want? Tell me what you
want? I'll give you anything.
ENGLEHORN regards DENHAM with cool detachment ...
ENGLEHORN
I want you off my ship.
ENGLEHORN heads back to the DOOR of the WHEELHOUSE.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.
IDE ON: The VENTURE as it ploughs through the SWELL.
DENHAM is leaning over the railing.
46.
DENHAM
I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack.
JACK
How did you think this would end,
Carl?
CLOSE ON: The MAP as it SLOWLY rotates in JACK'S HANDS.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM leaning on the RAILING staring absently out to
SEA. Behind him JACK is looking at the MAP in his HANDS.
JACK
What is that?
DENHAM
(distracted)
What?
CLOSE ON: JACK'S EYE is caught by something on the PAPER. He
shifts the MAP around, turning it upside down.
JACK
That.
JACK walks over to the railing and hands the MAP to DENHAM.
47.
DENHAM
I don't know ... what is it, a coffee
stain?
DENHAM looks hard at the map, suddenly a look of intrigue dawning
on his face.
SLOW PUSH IN on a STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING ...
LOSE ON: DENHAM is CAPTIVATED ...
CLOSE ON: DENHAM slowly looks up from the MAP, a look of HOPE
kindles in his EYES.
CLOSE ON: the STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING. An IMAGE begins to
become clear - a GORILLA-LIKE FACE.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: the sudden blast of the SHIP'S FOG HORN.
DENHAM's eyes shift upwards ...
AT THAT MOMENT a GUST of WIND plucks the MAP from DENHAM'S HAND
and blows it overboard ... whirling it out to SEA ...
ANGLE ON: The MAP FLOATING on the INKY WATER as the VENTURE
steams away ...
.
.. into a HUGE BANK of FOG that seems to melt out of the
DARKNESS!
Another BLAST from the FOG HORN echoes across the silent ocean.
RESTON moves along the DECK ... Staring uneasily at the FOG.
VARIOUS ANGLES: Even the seasoned crew look unnerved.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY up in the CROW'S NEST ... he is reading HEART
OF
DARKNESS by torchlight.
IDE ON: The VENTURE sails into THICKENING FOG.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE steams through the FOG BANK ...
ANGLE ON: A CREWMAN throws a LEAD-LINE over the side. CONCERNED
CREWMEN hurry to their stations.
CREWMAN
(calling)
Thirty fathoms ... no bottom!
ANGLE ON: the CREWMAN with the LEAD LINE shouts up at HAYES.
CREWMAN
(alarmed)
Twenty-five fathoms!
ANGLE ON: JACK looks alarmed as CREWMEN hurry past.
DENHAM walks away from him, towards the front of the SHIP.
CREWMAN
Twenty-two fathoms!
ERIAL: THE VENTURE sails through FOG.
CREWMAN
(calling)
Ten fathoms!
ANGLE ON: JIMMY looking around ... confused.
CLOSE ON: JIMMY'S eyes SUDDENLY WIDEN in DISBELIEF ... he leaps to
his feet, unable to summon the power of speech!
50.
ANGLE ON: A HUGE ROCK FACE looms out of the FOG straight AHEAD!
JIMMY
(yelling)
Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!
ENGLEHORN ... a look of DISBELIEF on his FACE.
W
IDE ON: The VENTURE sails directly towards a HUGE WALL which
rises up 200 feet into the sky! The SHIP is DWARFED by the
monstrous structure.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is drawn to the FORWARD RAILING of the SHIP,
looking up at the VAST WALL of ROCK towering over them in AWE.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE SLOWS, but its weight is carrying it forward
...
NGLE ON: A TERRIFIED JIMMY braces himself for impact.
NGLE ON: JIMMY, a look of TERROR on his FACE.
RUNCH! The BOW of the SHIP crumples in to the WALL!
51.
NGEL ON: ANN rushes out of a door, on to the DECK, alarmed at
the PANIC on the SHIP.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks in utter AWE at the WALL.
NGLE ON: JACK looks with horror as a JAGGED ROCK looms out of
the FOG off the starboard bow.
JACK
Rocks!
ANGLE ON: JIMMY spinning around as he sees ROCKS surrounding
the SHIP.
JIMMY
(yelling)
Rocks to starboard ... to port ...
rocks everywhere!
he VENTURE lolls WITHOUT POWER in the heavy swell.
The HEAVY THROB of the ENGINES regain strength ... the reverse
propellers pull the ship away, but still without adequate control.
52.
ANGLE ON: ANN hurries up the STAIRS ... she clutches the
RAILING for support and reels off balance, literally FALLING
into JACK'S ARMS as the side of the VENTURE CRUNCHES against rock.
The IMPACT sends the VENTURE into a SLOW SPIN. As the SHIP sinks
in the trough of a WAVE, MORE ROCKS emerge from the WATER around
it.
JACK looks down at ANN - he still has hold of her.
HAYES runs OUTSIDE
HAYES
Rocks to port, Captain!
ANGLE ON: The VENTURE rides the SWELL towards CAMERA.
SUDDENLY!
A SICKENING GROAN OF METAL ... as the VENTURE RUNS AGROUND on
HIDDEN ROCKS! HAYES looks in HORROR as he comes within inches of
the rock outcrop.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM watches as a HUGE STONE FACE - part of the ROCK
OUTCROP they have grounded on - slides to a halt just off the
VENTURE'S BOW. Weathered ... eroded away ... carved by the hand of
some ANCIENT PEOPLE.
NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST
settles against the ROCK.
53.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shuts the engines down as his ship GRINDS
sickeningly against the rock ...
... STUCK FAST.
PANDEMONIUM ON DECK!
NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the
LOOMING ROCK.
DENHAM stares at the EERIE SILHOUETTE of an ISLAND, visible
through the thinning FOG. JAGGED PEAKS rise from a ROCKY
SHORELINE. CRUMBLING RUINS cling to BARREN CLIFFS.
ANN steps closer, a LOOK of total DISBELIEF on her FACE.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, HAYES and JIMMY emerge onto the DECK as the
MILKY LIGHT of DAWN washes over the SHIP.
CLOSE ON: HERB holds the CAMERA as DENHAM cranks the HANDLE.
POV: A WHALER - a small lifeboat - is being ROWED away from the
VENTURE towards the SHORE of the ISLAND. DENHAM, JACK and ANN,
HERB, MIKE, BRUCE and FOUR SAILORS are packed into the tiny
boat.
54.
HAYES
You want me to bring them back?
ENGLEHORN
I don't give a damn about Carl Denham
... I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide. We're
leaving Mr. Hayes.
IDE ON: The WHALER rows towards the ISLAND passing great STONE
RUINS jutting out of the WATER. The HUGE WALL rises out of the
WAVES and disappears INLAND.
NGLE ON: DENHAM is balanced at the front of the BOAT, filming as
the SAILORS row ashore ...
DENHAM
(quietly)
Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull
Island! We got our picture!
ANGLE ON: JACK as he STARES up at the RUINS ...
CLOSE ON: ANN, as if COMPELLED, turns and looks over the side of
the BOAT, into the SEA ... her breathe catches!
ANN'S POV: Beneath the WATER the HIDEOUSLY, DISTORTED FACE of
a
FALLEN STATUE gapes up at her ...
ANGLE ON: ANN sitting huddled to one side of the BOAT ... drawing
her RAIN-SLICKER closer around her ... ANN'S FINGERS edge across
the seat and curl over JACK'S HAND ...
WIND WHISTLES through the GAPING HOLES in the EDIFICE ... a CREEPY
MOANING SOUND that mixes with the DEEP BOOM of the CRASHING WAVES
NGLE ON: The WHALER runs onto a tiny, stony BEACH. SHEER CLIFFS
rise straight up from the SHORE.
DENHAM, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, HERB, MIKE, PRESTON and TWO SAILORS
clamber out.
JIMMY looks up, hollow-eyed ... in his hand is the copy of
"HEART OF DARKNESS". HAYES stands nearby.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY closing the BOOK, an ashen expression on his
FACE.
JIMMY
Why does Marlow keep going up the
river, why doesn't he turn back?
HAYES
shrugs)
There's a part of him that wants to,
Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself
that sounds a warning, but there's
another part, that needs to know ...
that needs to defeat the thing which
makes him afraid.
CLOSE ON: HAYES pauses, filled with a sudden sense of DREAD.
He
reluctantly turns, his eyes drawn to the creepy CARVED HEAD
towering above the SHIP.
HAYES v/o
"We could not understand, because we
were too far ... and could not
remember, because we were travelling
in the night of First Ages ...
LOSE ON: DENHAM obsessed ... cranking the handle of his CAMERA.
HAYES V/O (cont'd)
... of those Ages that are gone,
leaving hardly a sign and no memories
...
THUNDER RUMBLES overhead as DENHAM, JACK, ANN, HERB, BRUCE,
PRESTON, MIKE and 2 SAILORS clamber out of the RUINED TUNNEL
MOUTH.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY closes the BOOK.
JIMMY
(quiet)
It's not an adventure story - is it,
Mr. Hayes.
HAYES
(quiet)
No, Jimmy, it's not.
HAYES' EYES drift back to the STATUE. JIMMY follows his GAZE.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he leads the group into the village.
SPREAD among the RUINS is a VILLAGE - a crude shanty town, created
by a more recent and far less sophisticated culture ... ramshackle
GRASS and BAMBOO HUTS.
ANGLE ON: PRESTON looking around, UNNERVED ...
PRESTON
It's deserted ...
ANGLE ON: DENHAM cranking the CAMERA as he rolls film on the
VILLAGE.
DENHAM
Of course it's deserted. Use your
eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin!
Nobody's lived here for hundreds of
years.
At the moment they hear the sound of the SOBBING of a HUMAN CHILD
...
ANGLES ON: ANN, PRESTON, JACK, DENHAM, HERB ... not knowing if
they heard what they just heard ...
ROW UPON ROW of sharpened BAMBOO SPIKES line the top of the WALL.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... His eyes suddenly widen in disbelief.
57.
ANGLE ON: A SMALL CHILD standing on the DUSTY PATH ahead of them.
She stares up at them, with weird FERAL EYES.
THE CHILD slowly raises an arm towards the watching GROUP ... in a
pointing gesture. A suspended moment ... DENHAM steps forward.
ANN
(whispering)
Mr Denham ... I think we should go
back.
DENHAM
will handle this.
DENHAM pulls a NESTLE BAR from his pocket and walks up to the
CHILD. DENHAM waves the chocolate around.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Look chocolate ... you like chocolate?
The CHILD'S EYES drill into DENHAM. RAIN STARTS FALLING.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Good to eat! Take it ... take it!
The CHILD steps back. DENHAM grabs the CHILD by the wrist and
attempts to press the chocolate bar into her HAND. The CHILD
struggles and CRIES OUT!
BRUCE.
For Godsake, Denham, leave the native
alone.
JACK
She doesn't want the chocolate!
ANGLE ON: VILLAGERS begin to melt out of the shadows, OLD PEOPLE,
YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN stare HOLLOW-EYED at DENHAM as he wrestles
with the CHILD.
he CHILD sinks her TEETH into DENHAM'S WRIST. He yells, releasing
his grip. The CHILD runs off ... in to the arms of an OLD WOMAN
...
58.
The GROUP starts to nervously walk forward, DENHAM gestures
impatiently.
DENHAM
t's alright - it's just a bunch of
women and old folks ... they're
harmless.
ANGLE ON: ANN looks STARTLED as MIKE suddenly LURCHES past her.
ANN
Mike?
MIKE turns, gasping, staring at her helplessly! And then FALLS
face forward, a JAGGED SPEAR stuck in his BACK!
ANN steps back in HORROR and SCREAMS!
A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to
ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone
freezes ...
F
AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before
anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the
MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB.
In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and
wailing in unison.
IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS.
BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK
pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched
from him ...
She struggles against her captors ...
ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ...
her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark
fury ...
DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND.
The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his
HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH.
ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the
OLD
SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising
HYSTERICS ...
SHA-WOMAN
(chanting)
Larri yu sano kor ... Kweh yon
kah`weh ad-larr ... tor Kng.
CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS
like a stone.
ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE!
59.
DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust
his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise
into the air ...
.. a GUNSHOT!
The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER.
ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the
VILLAGE!
ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet.
ENGLEHORN
Seen enough?
W
IDE ON: As EACH WAVE hits the VENTURE, it GROANS and SCRAPES
against the ROCKS - SHIFTING SLIGHTLY.
NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, desperate ... yelling at his CREW, above the
HOWLING WIND.
ENGLEHORN
(yelling)
Lighten the ship! Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!
ANGLES ON: As WAVES crash against the STRANDED SHIP, LUMPY,
JIMMY, CHOY and the other SAILORS throw TABLES, CHESTS ...
KITCHEN EQUIPMENT into the SEA.
ANGLE ON: NATIVES are moving towards the VENTURE ...
UT TO:
ANGLE ON: using LONG BAMBOO POLES, A NATIVE silently VAULTS from
ROCK to ROCK over the STORMY SEAS ... towards the GROUNDED SHIP
E
NGLE ON: A SKULL ISLANDER LANDS on the BACK DECK of the
VENTURE UNSEEN! He CROUCHES in the shadows ...
ANGLE ON: JACK staggers on to the BACK DECK, clutching a
railing to steady himself. He suddenly discovers a NATIVE
NECKLACE on the DECK ...
... JACK stares at the NECKLACE, decorated with a MONKEY SKULL,
a look of HORRIFIED REALIZATION growing. JIMMY is racing past,
JACK grabs him:
JACK
Where's Ann?
JIMMY
She went to her cabin.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE at the MERCY of the RAGING SEAS as it
moves even closer to the REEF.
WIDE ON: The VENTURE floats free!
A LOUD CHEER goes up from the CREW!
IDE ON: The VENTURE plows between the JAGGED ROCKS off toward
OPEN SEA ...
ANGLE ON: ANN in the NATIVE'S GRIP ... they are being PULLED
through the STORMY SEAS onto the SHORE, by the other NATIVES
HAULING on a ROPE. ANN is HALF DROWNED.
The VENTURE is barely visible moving through the SEA SPRAY.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN comes out of the WHEELHOUSE - JACK is on the
LOWER DECK.
JACK (O.S.)
top! Stop! Turn back, we have to turn
back!
63.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN turns - he can hear the alarm in JACK's VOICE.
JACK (cont'd)
They've taken Ann!
CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN, he glances back at the ISLAND as the VENTURE
ploughs towards the open sea.
ANGLE ON: An ORANGE GLOW of FIRELIGHT is VISIBLE, emanating
from the NATIVE VILLAGE.
NGLE ON: ANN being DRAGGED through a FRENZY OF FEARFUL Skull
Island NATIVES. GLIMPSES of WAILING ... COWERING ... CHANTING.
FLAMES BLAZE along the TOP OF THE WALL.
CLOSE ON: A withered old WOMAN, EYES RED in some DRUG induced
TRANCE, speaks in TONGUES. ANN is forced to her knees.
The OLD WOMAN splashes some foul LIQUID into her face ... younger
WOMEN tie BRACELETS on her wrists.
ANGLE ON: COVERS are pulled off lifeboats as the SHIP'S CREW
gather EQUIPMENT.
CLOSE ON: HAYES yelling commands:
HAYES
All hands going ashore ...
CRASH CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: EQUIPMENT and RIFLES are THROWN IN. The ENTIRE SHIP'S
CREW is MOBILIZING.
HAYES (V.O.)
What the hell are you doing? You want
that boat to sink? Stow those rifles
midships - come on, hurry it up!
64.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM surreptitiously supervises HERB and PRESTON as
they load CAMERA EQUIPMENT on board one of the BOATS ...
ANGLE ON: JACK loading a BOX of AMMUNITION on to the other BOAT
... he looks tensely at the FIRES burning on the ISLAND.
ANGLE ON: The TWO BOATS are swung out and LOWERED.
HAYES (cont'd)
Lower away!
he TWO BOATS ROW AWAY from the SHIP, packed with SHIP'S CREW
... in one BOAT are DENHAM, PRESTON and HERB - clutching CAMERA
EQUIPMENT.
ANGLE ON: JACK in the OTHER BOAT, looking GRIM and DETERMINED.
ANGLE ON: the TINY BOATS are tossed in the RAGING SEAS. SAILORS
try to STEER them towards the SHORE, as they bounce off ROCKS and
STATUES.
LOSE ON: FLAMING TORCHES ignite POOLS of OIL along the length of
the TOP of the WALL.
ANGLES ON: ANN'S WRIST'S are TIED outstretched to BAMBOO POSTS.
She is on the SUMMIT of the WALL, lit by the flickering FLAMES ...
looking out onto DARK TREE TOPS.
F
LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY.
ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS knock away WOODEN PLUGS, releasing the
FLAMING OIL to pour down rough CHANNELS hewn into the STONE of the
WALL ... it runs and falls down CHUTES into POOLS carved into the
GROTTO WALLS.
WIDE ON: The CLIFF WALLS light up as FLAMES within LARGE CARVED
CHAMBERS create huge backlit PAGAN FACES.
FIRELIGHT dances across the nightmarish JUNGLE ... DISTANT TREES
start to TREMBLE, their canopies swaying as if PUSHED by an UNSEEN
FORCE.
CLOSE ON: ANN ... looking on with HORROR at the MOVEMENT in the
JUNGLE below her. She struggles against the ROPES, to no avail.
CLOSE ON: The OLD WOMAN, eyes rolled up in her head.
LOSE ON: A NECKLACE is placed over ANN'S head.
65.
ANGLE ON: A SHAMAN starts BEATING out a RHYTHM on a LOG DRUM ...
SKULL ISLANDERS fall to their KNEES ... a MOANING WAIL rises ...
the DRUMMING builds to a FRENZIED CLIMAX.
WIDE ON: On the OTHER SIDE, the WALL falls away vertically into a
ROCKY GROTTO, leading into the DENSE TANGLED JUNGLE of SKULL
ISLAND.
SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is
tied to are MOVING, pulling her TOWARDS the EDGE of the WALL! ANN
digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop
herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ...
.
.. into thin air!
ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS lowering the BAMBOO ALTAR STRUCTURE
DOWN, slowly releasing the flaxen ROPE.
ANN is dangling from the POSTS by her WRISTS, as the HINGED
FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a
ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST.
NGLE ON: ANN is LOWERED onto the ROCK PROMONTORY, which resembles
an ALTAR ... ANN struggles to free herself, but she is tied fast
to the posts, a TINY FIGURE illuminated by enormous GLOWING
CARVINGS ... the WALL towering up behind her.
ANGLES ON: ANN squirms ... as the FOREST BELOW HER BROILS and
SEETHES! TREES are violently SWAYING ... above the crescendo of
the NATIVE FRENZY, ANGRY BESTIAL ROARS can be heard.
SKULL ISLANDERS line the TOP of the WALL, their WAILING and
CHANTING interrupted by a LOUD SPLINTERING SOUND.
The SHIP'S BOATS pull up at the foot of the great STAIRCASE. JACK
leaps out of the BOAT and races up the stairs.
CLOSE ON: ANN lifts her head ... something VERY BIG is moving
towards HER.
ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself
THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the
air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S
MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer.
ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds.
A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a
sudden force of IMPACT!
ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud
slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible.
CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR.
66.
A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND INSTANTLY CLEARS THE VEILING SMOKE.
ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD.
The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the
TOP of the WALL.
ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between
the POSTS.
Before her is ... KONG!
A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat,
leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his
finger.
SUDDENLY ... GUNSHOTS!
FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the
VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS
SCATTER in TERROR ...
IDE ON: KONG in front of ANN ... HE RISES to his full height and
BEATS HIS CHEST!
KONG'S HUGE HAND snatches ANN and roughly PULLS her free of her
bonds.
DEAFENING ROAR!
ANN SCREAMS!
CLUTCHING her tightly, KONG carries ANN away from the ALTAR.
FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the
VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS
SCATTER in TERROR ...
ANGLES ON: The SKULL ISLANDERS melt away into the darkness ...
vanishing as fast as they appeared.
... from behind the WALL, the DISTANT CRY of ANN screaming for
help, following by an EARTH SHUDDERING ROAR.
ENGLEHORN
(staring upwards)
What in God's name was that?
JACK
(sudden realisation)
Behind the wall!
67.
ANGLE ON: JACK rushes to the BASE of the WALL and begins to climb
...
DENHAM hurries to the massive, heavily fortified gate.
C
LOSE ON: DENHAM staring through the LATTICE WORK of sharpened
bamboo ...
DENHAM'S POV: A fleeting glimpse of KONG disappearing into the
depths of the jungle. In his HUGE FIST KONG clutches ANN!
NGLE ON: JACK has reached the top of the WALL ... he races to the
EDGE peering over it. Nothing ... only the primitive ALTAR, and
beyond, DARK JUNGLE dissolving into BLACKNESS.
JACK'S POV: The EMPTY ROPES binding ANN'S WRISTS swing from the
ALTAR POSTS.
JACK
(disbelief)
She's gone!
ACK is hurrying down from the WALL.
JACK
She's gone!
CLOSE ON: DENHAM in SHOCK ... his mind racing, fuelled by FEAR.
Gradually his breathing slows and another part of his brain kicks
into gear.
JACK makes brief eye contact with DENHAM, who quickly looks away.
JACK (cont'd)
Carl? What is it?
(realizing)
You saw something ...
LATER ...
ANGLE ON: BOXES of AMMUNITION and GUNS have been brought up
from
the beach. Lids are prised open ... AMMO distributed.
DENHAM is surrounded by JACK, ENGLEHORN and the SAILORS.
ENGLEHORN
You can take Hayes and fifteen others.
I'll put a guard on the gate until you
return ... The rest of you, stay with
the ship.
JACK grabs his PACK and WALKS away TOWARDS THE GATE, with LUMPY &
JIMMY following.
68.
HAYES
Not you, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of
them knows a which way to point a gun.
HAYES takes the RIFLE out of JIMMY'S HANDS.
HAYES
Stay here.
JIMMY
Miss Darrow needs me!
HAYES
No!
CLOSE ON: JIMMY, crestfallen.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM by the CAMERA BOXES with HERB and PRESTON.
DENHAM
(quietly)
Bring the tripod - and all of the film
stock.
HERB
You wanna go with the six inch lens?
DENHAM
The wide angle will do just fine.
CLOSE ON: PRESTON slings the FILM STOCK BAG over his SHOULDER.
ANGLE ON: JACK, PRESTON, HAYES, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and 8 SAILORS
as ENGLEHORN surveys the GROUP. DENHAM and HERB are HAULING CAMERA
EQUIPMENT.
ENGLEHORN
You got guns, you got food, you got
ammo. You got twenty-four hours.
BRUCE
Twenty-four hours?
ENGLEHORN
This time tomorrow we haul anchor.
CLOSE ON: JACK ... as he slings his GUN on his shoulder, turns
and HEADS through the GATE.
NIGHT
WIDE ON: The VOLCANIC ROCKS form a JAGGED, TORTURED LANDSCAPE of
DEEP CREVASSES and TOWERING CLIFFS. The vegetation is THICK, the
JUNGLE DARK. ANCIENT GNARLED TREES twist out of the ground, thick
LICHEN and long MOSSES hang from branches and TANGLED VINES. STEAM
RISES from festering SWAMPS ...
69.
HAYES is LEADING DENHAM, JACK, PRESTON, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and
EIGHT SAILORS. HERB is limping along with the heavy CAMERA on his
shoulder.
The atmosphere is TENSE ... unseen creatures scurry in the
darkness, fleeing from the approaching humans.
HAYES puts his hands up ... the GROUP stops ... a STRANGE, LOW
MOAN echoes from the SURROUNDING JUNGLE ... The MEN stare into the
darkness ... watchful, on edge ...
CLOSE ON: ANN in KONG'S HAND, being tossed around like a rag doll
as KONG RUNS through the FOREST.
NGLE ON: KONG propels himself through the JUNGLE with EASE,
barely disturbing the forest, moving with GRACE along a well used
route.
LOSE ON: ANN held fast in his GRIP. She is FLUNG wildly around as
KONG BOUNDS across CHASMS, LEAPING over rivers.
ANN'S FEVERED POV: The JUNGLE SPINNING and BLURRING by. She tries
to brace herself against KONG'S FINGERS, but the rigors of the
journey knock her sideways like a RAG DOLL.
WIDE ON: SHAFTS of MOONLIGHT play on the faces of grotesque
STATUES set into a MOSSY CLIFF.
ANGLE ON: ANN clutched tightly in KONG'S HAND. She is rigid with
FEAR. KONG squats down ... he LOOKS CLOSELY at ANN.
CLOSE ON: KONG ... we see him clearly for the first time. A very
old, brutish BULL GORILLA. Years of survival have left SCARS on
his face. One EYE LID is mangled and his JAW is CROOKED ...
leaving a huge yellowed INCISOR TOOTH jutting up.
KONG stares at ANN ... she dare not move; only her RAPID BREATHING
belies her INNER TERROR.
ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ... the
ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK.
CLOSE ON: ANN'S HORRIFIED FACE ... she sees HUMAN REMAINS amongst
the NECKLACES! Bones ... skulls! A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from
the back of her throat.
SWIRLING UPSIDE DOWN POV: The NECKLACE lands on the ground - amid
DOZENS of OTHER NECKLACES littering the clearing.
ANGLE ON: ANN is lifted UPWARDS ... KONG'S LIPS curl in a low,
slow SNARL.
ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense
of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF
PRESERVATION!
70.
KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance! She suddenly
PROPELS herself off his HAND! ANN DROPS 12 feet and lands heavily
at KONG'S FEET. She rolls amongst grinning HUMAN SKULLS and LEG
BONES ... staggers to her feet and RUNS!
KONG rises up with a ROAR, but ANN is already disappearing into
the JUNGLE!
NGLES ON: ANN desperately powering through the DENSE UNDERGROWTH.
She throws herself over huge FALLEN LOGS, through TANGLED VINES.
.
She GLANCES BACK ...
.. TREES are FALLING, KONG is smashing through the undergrowth
after her!
ANGLE ON: With surprising AGILITY and GRACE, KONG sweeps down from
above and SCOOPS ANN off the ROCK. She barely has time to CRY OUT
before being CARRIED AWAY, as KONG disappears into the DEPTHS of
the ISLAND.
CLOSE ON: JACK ... hearing ANN'S DISTANT SCREAMS!
JACK
Ann!
ANGLE ON: JACK starts RUNNING towards the SOUND. DENHAM and the
OTHERS follow ... JACK is barging through THICK TANGLED
VEGETATION, which is growing between huge moss covered FALLEN
COLUMNS.
KONG'S ENRAGED ROAR echos through the JUNGLE.
JACK (cont'd)
(yelling)
Ann!
ANGLE ON: The GROUP pause at the sound of ANN'S TERRIFIED SCREAM.
CLOSE ON: JACK'S ashen face.
ONG LEAPS ACROSS CHASMS as he CARRIES ANN through the JUNGLE.
ANGLE ON: JACK picks up ANN'S NECKLACE ... a LOCK of BLONDE
HAIR
still tangled within it's STRANDS ...
71.
WIDE ON: DAWN LIGHT brightens the SKY as the GROUP survey the
KILLING GROUND.
LUMPY
Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard!
(horrified realization)
They've been ripped limb from limb.
JACK
(calling)
ANN! Ann!
ANGLE ON: DENHAM casts an eye over the DEBRIS STREWN GROUND ...
his gaze rising to a HUGE GASH in the FOREST ...
DENHAM POV: TREES have been RIPPED from the earth where KONG
has
SMASHED a path through the JUNGLE ...
ANGLE ON: HAYES notices a SAILOR with a WOOLLEN HAT pulled
down
over his head ... the SAILOR has turned away from the GRISLY
REMAINS. HAYES bats the hat off the SAILOR'S HEAD ... it's JIMMY.
JIMMY
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend
you didn't see me.
HAYES
esus, Jimmy!
HAYES snatches the GUN off him ...
JIMMY
defiant)
Hey! I need that!
HAYES
(angry)
I'm not giving you a gun!
JIMMY
You were younger than me when they
gave you one!
HAYES
I was in the army. I was trained - I
had a drill sergeant!
CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks at HAYES.
IMMY
quietly)
I just wanna help bring her back.
HAYES's expression softens. He hands the gun back to JIMMY.
HAYES
Don't make me regret it.
72.
ANGLE ON: The GROUP'S NERVES are FRAYED ... as they continue
slogging through the difficult TERRAIN. HUGE INSECTS fly around
them, AND THE GROUP try in vain to SWAT them away.
ANGLE ON: LUMPY shooting WILDLY at a HUGE BUG ...
HAYES
growling)
Conserve your ammunition!
LUMPY GLARES at HAYES ... and SHOOTS one last time at a HUGE BUG
ON A NEARBY TREE ...
ANGLE ON: SLIDING FEET ... down a VINE strewn slope.
ULL BACK to reveal ... the GROUP have emerged from the JUNGLE
into a NARROW VALLEY, deep in the heart of SKULL ISLAND ... The
VALLEY is less than 75 feet wide, flanked by sheer CLIFFS.
JACK looks up and down the VALLEY ... he wipes his brow ..
the
SUN is high, it is hot out of the SHADE.
ANGLE ON: LUMPY stumbling forward with a hacking SMOKER'S COUGH.
LUMPY
I'm knackered! I've gotta have a
breather.
LUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind
his ear and lights up.
JACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit.
JACK
Hey fellas - we don't have time for
this. We've lost too much ground
already! Come on, - get up!
HAYES
(quiet)
They're not about to quit on you. Cut
them some slack.
JACK stares at HAYES and then sighs, resigned.
HAYES calls to the MEN ...
HAYES (cont'd)
Alright, you got five minutes!
Everybody stay in sight!
ANGLE ON: DENHAM grabs the CAMERA from HERB. Nearby PRESTON sets
up the TRIPOD.
73.
DENHAM
(hushed)
Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of
the valley.
NGLE ON: DENHAM as he arrives at the top of the SLOPE, he
turns
at the sound of a STRANGE NOISE ...
PUSH IN: ON DENHAM ... a look of AMAZEMENT dawning on his FACE.
CLOSE ON: JACK kneels down and stares at an unmistakable
indent
in the sand: a GIANT FOOTPRINT!
LUMPY
Bloody Nora!
JACK looks up to see SAILORS gathering around.
JIMMY
Is that what took Miss Darrow?
LUMPY
(sagely)
There's only one creature capable of
leaving a footprint that size ...
ALL look up at LUMPY ...
LUMPY (cont'd)
The abominable snowman!
A ripple of FEAR spreads throughout the CROWD.
The RATTLED SAILORS mutter agreement. There is random chatter of
turning back.
HAYES kneels down beside JACK ...
HAYES
(quiet)
It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty-
five feet?
JACK
(grimly)
Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
HAYES looks over his SHOULDER ...
HAYES
Denham!
no answer)
Where'd he go?
ANGLE ON: JACK walking up the VALLEY.
JACK
Carl!!!
74.
WIDE ON: DENHAM, BRUCE and HERB arrive at the TOP of the VALLEY
A
... they stare transfixed at a HERD of grazing BRONTOSAURS.
NGLE ON: DENHAM is cranking the CAMERA ...
DENHAM
low)
Walk forward, Bruce.
BRUCE
What?!
ANGLE ON: a HERD of TWELVE BRONTOSAURS are slowly moving through a
WIDE CLEARING ahead.
DENHAM
You're the star of this picture! Get
into character and head towards the
animals.
ANGLE ON: BRUCE nervously SHUFFLES forward ...
BRUCE
What the hell kind of place is this?
(beat)
Are you sure about this, Denham???
Don't we have a stand-in for this type
of thing?
DENHAM
need you in the shot, or people will
say they're fake.
BRUCE
Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
SUDDEN flash of MOVEMENT! CARNOTAURS are circling the HERD.
ANGLE ON: the BRONTOSAUR HERD looking EDGY and RESTLESS!
DENHAM
ou're making them nervous! No sudden
movement.
BRUCE
I'm not moving.
A LOW RUMBLING SOUND can now be heard ... the GROUND starts to
SHAKE ...
PUSH IN: on BRUCE as he realizes what is about to HAPPEN!
BRUCE (cont'd)
(under his breath)
Mother of God ...
ANGLE ON: BRUCE suddenly turns and runs!
ANGLE ON: HERB is starting to get NERVOUS as DENHAM determinedly
continues filming ...
75.
WIDE ON: A sudden FALL of ROCKS ... Jack looks up!
ANGLE ON: The MEN look NERVOUS as the GROUND starts to TREMBLE
beneath their feet!
JACK turns and sees: BRUCE running down the hill ...
JACK
What is it?! Where's Carl?
BRUCE slows down, attempting to appear CALM.
BRUCE
He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up
there ... filming.
A LOUD ROAR!
BRUCE bolts like a STARTLED RABBIT!
SEVERAL nervous SAILORS jump up and start running.
ANGLE ON: JACK cautiously moves uphill towards the source of the
LOUD RUMBLING SOUND.
A
NGLE ON: DENHAM and HERB appear on the brow of the HILL. They are
running flat out towards JACK!
Seconds later a HERD of BRONTOSAURUS stampede down the hill after
DENHAM and HERB!
DENHAM
Run Jack!
JACK
Holy Christ!
HAYES
(yelling)
Go Jimmy - Run!
EVERYONE TURNS and FLEES!
ANGLE ON: JACK running ... he looks back and sees DENHAM trip and
fall!
The STAMPEDING DINOSAURS storm towards DENHAM down the NARROW
VALLEY!
CLOSE ON: DENHAM is frozen to the spot, staring at the CAMERA,
which is lying directly in the rampaging DINOSAUR'S PATH.
JACK turns back ... he attempts to drag DENHAM to his FEET, as
DENHAM struggles to grab hold of the CAMERA and TRIPOD.
JACK
Leave it!!!
DENHAM
No!!!
76.
DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN!
DENHAM
cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the
BRONTO PACK
bears down on them from behind!
Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are
CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the
back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide
against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing
BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past.
DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ...
JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR
LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM!
A
NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of
HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The
CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the
MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE,
out of reach of the MEATEATERS!
QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and
is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the
BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM
... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS,
CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall!
A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN
and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's
SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head!
ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR
SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly
trampled!
BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING
FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front
of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed!
BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS
THE STAMPEDE!
JACK sees it coming ...
JACK
(yelling)
No!!!!
BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ...
... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the
chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER,
it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS
PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling!
JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an
amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as
BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when
TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together.
JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all
around him.
77.
DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA.
n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced
to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS
immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into
fleshy stomachs.
J
ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he
staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the
SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD
BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS
leaps ...
BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls
DEAD at JACK'S FEET!
HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!
HAYES
(yelling)
Go! Go!
HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they
SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS.
JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic.
JACK
(frantic)
Carl!? Carl?! Get up!
DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST -
the CAMERA in his arms.
HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS.
HAYES
Run!
The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE -
slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS
follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their
panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are
working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the
flailing SAILORS!
A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO
CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD.
The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from
the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW
FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot
squeeze through.
ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg
... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ...
78.
DENHAM
Herb! Come on!
HERB
(gasping)
Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.
DENHAM
Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up.
Come on, hold on to your end.
HERB
(gasping)
You gotta go!!
DENHAM
I'm not going anywhere without you!
HERB
You gotta leave me!
HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way
... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR!
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the
frenzying CARNOTAURS.
ANGLE ON: KONG drops ANN onto the ground. She LANDS in a LIFELESS
heap.
KONG has dropped ANN in a small RUINED COURTYARD, it's WALLS are
cracked and split by encroaching JUNGLE CREEPERS.
IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the
GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response.
KONG
GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL.
LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily
towards KONG.
ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber
down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They
are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ...
CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS
are lost.
AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED.
They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER
CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.
HAYES
Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know
how many injured and how bad -
79.
LUMPY
(interrupting)
Injured? Four of us are dead!
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK.
He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP.
PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.
PRESTON
It's not your fault. What happened to
Herb - it's no ones fault.
DENHAM
(soft realization)
You're absolutely right, Preston ...
And I'll tell you something else.
Herbert didn't die for nothing. He
died for what he believed in and I'm
gonna honour that.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification.
DENHAM (cont'd)
He died believing there is still some
mystery left in this world - and we
can all have a piece of it - for the
price of an admission ticket!
(excited)
Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish
this film for Herb. We'll finish it,
and donate the proceeds to his wife
and kids.
CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before.
WIDE ON: BRUCE stands amongst the SEATED SAILORS.
BRUCE
(desperate)
We gotta get back to the ship.
Englehorn sails in nine hours.
JIMMY
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
BRUCE
Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be
stranded here!
BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self
consciously clears his THROAT.
BRUCE (cont'd)
Miss Darrow was a great gal - no
question. She was a wonderful person.
It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna
miss her.
80.
JACK
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen - I
just never figured you for a coward.
BRUCE
Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look
like me - not in the real world. In
the real world they've got bad teeth,
a bald spot and a beer gut ... be
seeing ya.
BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.
HAYES
Anyone else?
A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.
WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE.
He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an
enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out.
ith a splintering rip, KONG pulls off one of the DINOSAUR'S LEGS
and starts EATING it.
ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously
searches for a way to escape.
C
LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The
WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ...
... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading
down into the JUNGLE.
INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH
towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS
WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.
ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG
doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues
EATING ...
ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some
CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from
her FACE!
With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries
towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -
finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN
hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!
81.
ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of
KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign
of him there ...
... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and
makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the
JUNGLE!
THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN!
She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST
blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY!
ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and
DEADLY.
NGLE ON: ANN suddenly ducks under KONG'S ARM and makes a last
ditch attempt to escape! She is half way across the clearing when
she TRIPS and FALLS!
NGLE ON: KONG bounds over to ANN, SLAPPING his HANDS on the
GROUND in a frenzy of excitement - he utters a GUTTERAL SQUEAL.
CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.
ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a
couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick
OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out!
... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders
if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes
another PRATFALL!!
KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES
her.
ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,
SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.
ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly
and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around
KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.
NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle
down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's
looking for her chance ...
... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants
ANN to fall down again.
KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to
the GROUND ... WINDED.
KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED
GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,
delighted with the GAME.
82.
ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she
stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.
HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into
getting up and is STARTLED when she HITS his FINGER AWAY!
ANN
(gasping)
No! I said no!
KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND.
HUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
ANN (cont'd)
(gasping)
That's all there is ... there isn't
any more.
KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN.
His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight
TOWARDS ANN!
CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground
inches away from her.
THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!
ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of
ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER
spirals into violent MADNESS.
LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For
a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT!
C
LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
waiting for DEATH to come.
In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half
formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he
feels a connection to this tiny creature.
The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...
KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.
ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He
knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in
turn, DIMINISHED his power.
KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT
and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.
ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a
RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.
ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.
83.
NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH
thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY.
IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the
remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ...
spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE.
WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a
SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place.
IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the
SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES
... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other,
trying not to let the DROP unnerve them.
ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS
on the other side of the CHASM ...
CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.
J
IMMY
(low voice)
What is it?
HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into
the
DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS.
JIMMY (cont'd)
(whispering)
Mr. Hayes ...?
HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.
HAYES
If anything happens, I want you to
run! Understand?
JIMMY
I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
HAYES
(gently)
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.
CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across
the LOG.
NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of
the FAR BANK.
84.
Ahead, some RUINS have collapsed, creating a LONG DARK TUNNEL.
CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing
towards HAYES.
HAYES
o back! Back across the log!
The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and
sliding on the WET MOSS.
JIMMY
I ain't gonna run.
HAYES
Get Jimmy out of here.
ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.
KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one
SWEEP of his HAND.
CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ...
IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG!
JIMMY
No! Let him go!
(to HAYES)
Kill him! Kill him!
HAYES
(to KONG)
Look at me! Look at me!
JIMMY
(desperate)
Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks
back on HAYES ...
HAYES
deadly calm)
You've gotta run, Jimmy.
IMMY
No! I ain't gonna run.
HAYES
Do as I say.
(to JIMMY)
G
o with Jack ... All of you.
KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL
at KONG to shoot!
85.
HAYES (cont'd)
Run!
ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their
heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE
with a sickening CRUNCH.
JIMMY
No!
JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK
KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.
JACK
(desperate)
Shoot him!
WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on
the LOG.
KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE.
KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG,
knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM
below.
NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of
gun fire.
ANN
Hey! Here! Over here!
She runs up the bank towards the noise.
IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG!
JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold
on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG,
bucking the MEN into the air.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away,
becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP.
LL AROUND panicked SAILORS are SHOOTING WILDLY, but fear and lack
of balance throws their AIM OFF.
WO SAILORS FALL ... CHOY scrambles for something to grab.
CHOY
Lumpy! Help me!
LUMPY desperately tries to reach CHOY'S hand ... but CHOY slips
away into the ABYSS.
86.
KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the
CHASM!
QUICK IMAGE: DENHAM, PRESTON, JACK, JIMMY and LUMPY gripping the
LOG as it FALLS!
QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he
manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF.
ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and
MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to
safety.
ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its
FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into
mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions
the impact of the LANDING.
ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching
FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S
eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS!
CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY
... she hesitates.
She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now
VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is
in the GLADE before her!
NGLE ON: ANN as she quietly backtracks. The CARNIVORE pauses, as
if SENSING something. It's NOSTRILS twitch. She ducks behind a
WIDE TREE.
NGLE ON: ANN PEERING around from behind the TREE ...
... there is another CARNIVORE BEHIND HER! It snares at her ...
and pounces!
ANN leaps away ... she barely has time to start running before the
CARNIVORE GIVES CHASE!
ANGLE ON: ANN races past the first CARNIVORE ... the creature
turns it's head ... and soon BOTH DINOSAURS are pursuing ANN.
NGLE ON: ANN desperately heads towards the TANGLED ROOT SYSTEM of
a HUGE TREE. She throws herself forward, as the CARNIVORE'S JAWS
snap above her head.
NGLE ON: ANN ROLLS and SCRAMBLES into a HOLLOW under the ROTTEN
TREE.
ANGLE ON: The CARNIVORE CLAW at the TREE, trying to get at ANN.
87.
ANN is lying beneath the ROOTS ... all she can see are LEGS and
SLAVERING SNOUTS! The DINOSAUR RAM'S it's nose into the NARROW
GAP.
SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the
GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air.
he SECOND CARNIVORE turns and FLEES into the JUNGLE, as ANN is
forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL.
The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM
and go limp.
ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed
the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE.
CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her.
CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe
along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her.
ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels
another crawling up over her shoulder.
ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ...
rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN...
... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply
from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX!
ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the
DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the
JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through
BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can
feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE
JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!
E
NGLE ON: ANN slips down a MUDDY BANK, rolls over a LOG, and
CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...
ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is
GAINING
on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that
juts
out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and
crawls
towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow
her.
She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying
the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks
off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free,
only to turn and discover another is behind her!
With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG
with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The
TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ...
88.
she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs
on desperately ...
SHE SCREAMS!
ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the
FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ...
AT THAT MOMENT: KONG CHARGES!
KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with
his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN
loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the
ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ...
ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another
swipe.
AST FEVERED ACTION: A pair of CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS leap towards
HER! They cling onto KONG'S ARM, clawing furiously, snapping at
ANN!
LOSE ON: Saliva flies from wild, snapping jaws.
WIDE ON: KONG rolls over, THUMPING his arm against a TREE,
crushing a DINOSAUR.
ANN is WINDED ... she clings to KONG'S FINGERS as he strangles the
second BEAST with one hand, snapping it's NECK with a BONE
CRUNCHING sound.
UDDENLY! A SECOND TYRANNOSAUR ATTACKS!!! He comes charging into
shot, grabbing KONG'S ARM in his JAWS! KONG ROARS, sending both
TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR
scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he
braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS
CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from
behind.
T
hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH.
KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only
does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also
PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE
OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.
KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses
wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN
rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and
the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her.
The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE
BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD.
KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP.
KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over
his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO
THE LEDGE KONG PULLS THE FIRST TYRANNOSAUR OFF THE LEDGE ... BUT
AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT.
E
89.
KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ...
DOWN INTO THE VINES. KONG CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE TYRANNOSAUR, AS
ANN IS LEFT SWINGING, CAUGHT UP IN THE VINES ... TOWARDS THE
SECOND TYRANNOSAUR. HE SNAPS AT HER AS SHE COMES WITHIN INCHES OF
HIS JAW.
WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN.
THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS
HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS
OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ...
ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE
FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND
LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP.
RUNS. IT CHASES.
WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN
BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF
CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN
BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS
BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG.
T
HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS
ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each
other.
KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the
TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over,
using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN
before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR
sprawls back, DEAD.
KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.
He
puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST,
TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR.
WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY -
his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT
TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS
ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY
INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE.
ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.
ANN
Wait!
ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off
into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.
ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to
his SHOULDER.
CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the
JUNGLE.
KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on
his SHOULDER ...
90.
ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the
tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND
... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels
SAFE.
CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF
INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE
PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS
from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF.
DENHAM is lying nearby.
JACK
Carl!!!
DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE.
JACK SEES JIMMY.
CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down.
JACK (cont'd)
Jimmy?
CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks up at JACK, there are tears filling his
eyes. He falls into JACK'S arms softly sobbing.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes.
LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S
FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY
.. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED.
NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the
floor of the RAVINE.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA
lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny,
thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like
spilt innards.
DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams
DESTROYED.
WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES.
CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES
the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.
ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out!
It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY!
ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are
ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs!
JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it
TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK.
91.
LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS.
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he
smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE,
pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT!
All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and
crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE
INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and
CENTIPEDES!
SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK.
GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK.
BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart!
JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're
SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the
INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them.
BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in
the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP
of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS!
ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN
BLAZING!
BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not
blasted
apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.
Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG
launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out
to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ...
SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM
WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively
to his CHEST he lands with a THUD!
ANN looks up alarmed!
KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the
GROUND pushing her protectively behind him.
KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE!
CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to
DAWNING COMPREHENSION.
ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.
ANN
It's alright ... it's okay ...
ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES
and CREEPERS to reveal ...
92.
A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING
GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ...
ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand.
ANN (cont'd)
Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ...
you. "Kong". This is you.
KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...
KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.
PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to
understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.
CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is
seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time.
ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a
VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his
EYES.
In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into
the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his
hand.
A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull
ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at
her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN
... they have eight-foot wing spans and TALONED FEET. Their faces
are more reptile than bat.
93.
WIDE ON: KONG steps out of a LARGE ROUND CAVE onto a LEDGE that
juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ...
This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at
least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE.
The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some
three miles away.
NGLE ON: KONG gently places ANN on the GROUND ... ANN watches as
he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE.
The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ...
SILHOUETTING
the FIGURE of KONG ...
CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE
SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and
SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ...
ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES
of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone.
SUDDEN flutter in the DARK recesses of the LAIR, a SINISTER
SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ...
ONG won't look at her.
ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans
down
and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse
him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ...
He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking
in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS
of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over
the OCEAN.
ANN
(softly)
It's beautiful.
KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at
him.
ANN (cont'd)
Beautiful.
ANN places her HAND against her heart.
ANN (cont'd)
Beau-ti-ful.
KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment,
then CLIMBS into it.
ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ...
94.
WIDE ON: KONG with ANN, high above the JUNGLE, as the last of the
DUSK LIGHT FADES.
LOSE ON: HANDS reach down as ENGLEHORN and a SAILOR PULL PRESTON
up the last stretch of the ROPE ...
ENGLEHORN turns and sees JACK climbing towards the TOP of the
D
CHASM ... TWO SAILORS reaching down to help him.
DENHAM
Thank God.
ENGLEHORN
Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
CLOSE ON: BRUCE PULLING HIMSELF UP THE ROPE, gasping from
exertion.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I
knew you'd be okay ...
CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up to see ENGLEHORN standing at the top of
the CHASM. ENGLEHORN is watching him IMPASSIVELY.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
That's the thing about cockroaches; no
matter how many times you flush them
down the toilet they always crawl back
up the bowl!
ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he rises to his feet.
DENHAM
ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm
drying off my wings and trekking
across the lid!
ENGLEHORN LOOKS at DENHAM a BEAT and then LOOKS across the CHASM
in SURPRISE. DENHAM FOLLOWS HIS GAZE.
WIDE ON: JACK at the TOP of the opposite side of the CHASM ... a
solitary figure, bloodied and torn.
ENGLEHORN
Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it
up, it's useless ... She's dead.
DENHAM
(quietly)
She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her
back.
ENGLEHORN turns to DENHAM.
95.
DENHAM (cont'd)
And the ape will be hard on his heels.
We can still come out of this thing
okay -
(pause)
More than okay. Think about it, you've
got a boat full of chloroform we can
put to good use.
ENGLEHORN looks at DENHAM for a BEAT and then LAUGHS.
ENGLEHORN
You want to trap the Ape? I don't
think so.
DENHAM
Isn't that what you do? Live animal
capture? I heard you were the best.
ENGLEHORN stares at DENHAM for a moment, it is impossible to know
what he is thinking.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Jack!
JACK looks at DENHAM D
... DENHAM raises a hand in salute.
DENHAM (cont'd)
(calling)
Look after yourself!
JACK
Keep the Gate open.
DENHAM
Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
ANGLE ON: JACK turns to go ... and disappears up the DARK TUNNEL.
DENHAM (cont'd)
I'm sorry.
ANGLE ON: JACK struggles through the JUNGLE ... he breaks into
CLEARING and STOPS SHORT as he see's the VAST VISTA of the
MOUNTAIN in front of him.
ANGLE ON: JACK is climbing up through ROCKS towards KONG'S LAIR!
BAT-THINGS flutter ... AGITATED ... SENSING an INTRUDER.
CLOSE ON: JACK freezes.
NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the
STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN.
He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The
OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK.
ACK CLIMBS higher INTO THE CAVE until at last he's on THE LEDGE
WITH KONG.
ANGLE ON: JACK moves forward, towards KONG. He stays in the
SHADOWS of the ROCKS.
JACK CRAWLS FORWARD onto the LEDGE.
ANGLE ON: JACK creeps CLOSE to the SLEEPING KONG'S BACK ... his
SHOULDERS gently heaving with each breath.
LOSE ON: JACK crawls past KONG'S FEET ... he looks in AMAZEMENT.
... ANN is ASLEEP in KONG'S HAND!
LOSE ON: KONG GROWLS ... JACK SPINS AROUND ... KONG is growling
in his sleep!
JACK is less than 8 FEET away from ANN.
CLOSE ON: ANN'S eyes OPEN. For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK
... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She
looks at JACK with disbelief.
LOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ...
neither DARES to move, or make a sound.
ERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her
to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM.
NGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of
the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is
overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN.
KONG STIRS.
CLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out
... their FINGERS TOUCH ...
... and KONG'S EYES SNAP OPEN!
97.
TIME seems to SLOW: JACK attempts to GRAB ANN'S WRIST, but KONG'S
FINGERS CLOSE around ANN with stunning SPEED! KONG ROLLS to his
FEET, pulling ANN away from JACK!
NGLE ON: KONG SNARLS at JACK, who now stands HELPLESSLY before
him.
The BAT-THINGS SWARM above KONG.
ANN
(yelling)
Jack, run!
ANGLE ON: KONG SWATS at JACK with his FREE HAND. ANN struggles and
KICKS in his GRASP. A
ANN (cont'd)
(yelling)
No!
KONG places ANN high on a SMALL LEDGE and CHARGES at JACK!
NGLE ON: JACK ROLLS to the SIDE, KONG'S FISTS smashing DOWN
around him!
ONG STAMPS on JACK, who DIVES CLEAR, just as the HUGE FOOT
pummels into the GROUND.
CLOSE ON: JACK is LYING on the GROUND with KONG rearing above him
... there is NO ESCAPE!
CLOSE ON: KONG'S EYES, blazing with DEADLY INTENT. He LIFTS his
FOOT, ready to SQUASH JACK like a bug!
AT THAT MOMENT! ANN SHRIEKS in PAIN!
KONG spins around ...
ANGLE ON: ANN is under ATTACK from the BAT-THINGS ... they are
FRENZYING around ANN, sharp CLAWS lashing her! She cowers against
the ROCK FACE, trying to protect herself.
CLOSE ON: KONG ... ROARING with ANGER ... he abandons JACK and
CHARGES at the BAT-THINGS!
The FRENZIED BAT-THINGS ATTACK KONG EN MASSE as he snatches ANN
from the LEDGE.
They strike at KONG and ANN like a swarm of giant bees. KONG ROARS
and THRASHES OUT at them in a FRENZY!
NGLE ON: KONG puts ANN down against the ROCKS, so he can use BOTH
HANDS to strike at the DEADLY BAT-THINGS. With every sweep of his
ARM, several BAT-THINGS are KNOCKED TO THE GROUND, but OTHERS claw
at his HEAD and BODY.
A
NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the
CLIFF towards ANN ... under the cover of an OVERHANG.
98.
JACK and ANN are inches away from each other right behind KONG'S
FEET!
ACK grabs ANN'S HAND and leads her towards the only possible
escape route - the EDGE of the LEDGE, 1000 FEET above the JUNGLE!
JACK grabs a LARGE VINE, testing it's strength. He turns to
Ann.
JACK
(urgent)
This way! Come on!
JACK pulls ANN to him and clambers over the EDGE of the
DIZZYING
DROP.
WIDE ON: JACK and ANN desperately CLIMB down the THICK VINES that
hang over the LEDGE ... hand over hand ... the SOUND of KONG
ROARING above, as he battles the BAT-THINGS.
ANGLE ON: SEVERAL BAT-THINGS are gripping and CLAWING KONG'S BACK
in an effort to weaken the huge ape ... he suddenly POUNDS HIS
BACK against the WALL of the CAVE, SQUASHING THEM ALL!
The surviving BAT-THINGS wheel away from KONG, HISSING ANGRILY ...
16 lie on the cave floor, STUNNED or DEAD. They FLUTTER towards
the BACK OF THE CAVE, preparing their NEXT ATTACK.
KONG LOOKS for ANN ... she has GONE!
ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN are 60 FEET down the VINE ... JACK is
trying to SWING towards the ROCK FACE ...
SUDDENLY! They start RISING!
WIDE ON: KONG is PULLING on the VINE! He lifts JACK and ANN
towards HIM, like a fisherman reeling in a catch.
ANN tightens her grip on JACK'S SHOULDERS as BAT-THINGS flutter
around THEM.
A
NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT-
THINGS dive towards JACK and ANN!
A BAT-THING CLAWS at JACK'S HEAD. He releases ONE HAND and GRABS
it's TALONED ANKLE.
ACK
(yelling)
Hang on to me!
99.
ANN hangs onto JACK for dear life, as he GRABS the BAT-THINGS
OTHER ANKLE.
ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN DESCENDING RAPIDLY ... the BAT-THING
furiously FLAPPING it's WINGS, but unable to stop the SPIRALLING
plunge past the CLIFF FACE.
SOUNDS of KONG ROARING WITH GRIEF FROM THE LEDGE.
The BAT-THING wobbles crazily in the sky, rapidly LOSING ENERGY
... JACK looks down - a FAST FLOWING RIVER is 50 feet below. He
RELEASES HIS GRIP!
ANN SCREAMS as she and JACK fall into the RIVER ... they are
immediately picked up by the current and SWEPT AWAY.
JACK and ANN are carried into the RAPIDS, swept down a small
WATERFALL, surfacing into a FAST-FLOWING, but less violent part of
the river.
WIDE ON: The VILLAGE WALL AND SURROUNDING, as KONG'S ROAR echoes
out over the ISLAND.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM & ENGLEHORN as they hear KONG'S ANGER.
ANGLE ON: Half drowned JACK and ANN swim to the side of the RIVER,
hauling themselves up on the MUDDY BANK.
KONG'S POV as he CRASHES THROUGH THE JUNGLE in HOT PURSUIT.
AN ENRAGED KONG is visible ... quickly descending from his
mountain lair!
ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN racing through the JUNGLE.
NGLE ON: LOW ANGLE of the WALL and ALTAR.
A LOW THUNDERING SOUND reverberates ... BIRDS LIFT off from TREES.
100.
SUDDENLY! JACK and ANN appear from the undergrowth, RUNNING
towards the CHASM and WALL ... the ALTAR BRIDGE has been raised,
and hangs just out of reach.
ACK
(yelling)
Carl!
OW ANGLE: The TOP of the WALL is deserted ...
ANN
Please! Somebody help us!
SOUNDTRACK: A ROAR ... growing louder ...
ANN casts a nervous glance over her shoulder.
TREES CRASH to the GROUND as KONG SMASHES his way through the
JUNGLE towards the CLEARING ...
ANN looks at the deserted wall.
ANN (cont'd)
(ashen)
They've gone.
JACK
(yelling)
Carl? Oh Christ! Carl?
CLOSE ON: DENHAM silently listens to his FRIENDS calling.
IDER ON: PRESTON, ENGLEHORN, BRUCE and JIMMY are waiting nearby.
PRESTON
Drop the bridge! Do it now, for
chrissakes!
DENHAM
(quiet)
Not yet ... wait.
The GROUP react to KONG'S ROAR - now VERY CLOSE. A SAILOR with a
MACHETE hovers near the ROPE, ready to cut it on DENHAM'S COMMAND.
DENHAM (cont'd)
Wait ...
PRESTON
(incensed)
No Carl ...
PRESTON suddenly leaps to his feet and SNATCHES the MACHETE.
He
slices through the ROPE ...
101.
NGLE ON: The BRIDGE DROPS, just as KONG explodes from the JUNGLE!
J
KONG sees ANN and charges forward!
ACK and ANN race across the BRIDGE, getting to the other side
just as KONG LEAPS the CHASM.
JACK leads ANN through the HOLE in the DOOR ... KONG SMASHES
through the BAMBOO defences.
ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN run into the VILLAGE ... it looks deserted.
DENHAM suddenly rises and walks past them towards the GATE,
fixated on the ROARING BEAST, smashing at the TIMBERS.
CLOSE ON: ANN ... seeing GROUPS of SAILORS crouched behind rocks,
with GRAPPLING HOOKS at the ready. PRESTON lies to one side, a RAG
held against his BLEEDING FACE. ENGLEHORN gripping a CRATE OF
CHLOROFORM BOTTLES.
ENGLEHORN
(shouting)
Now!!!
ANGLE ON: KONG SMASHES through the GATE! For a BRIEF MOMENT KONG
makes EYE CONTACT with ANN ... she looks at him DESPAIRINGLY. He
reaches towards her ...
DENHAM
to ENGLEHORN)
Bring him down! Do it!
ANGLES ON: SAILORS THROW GRAPPLING HOOKS at KONG, HAULING on
the
ROPES.
A
ANN
No!
JACK
Are you out of your mind? Carl!
BRUCE rushes forward, pulling PRESTON to his feet, hustling
him
towards the TUNNEL EXIT.
ENGLEHORN yells at SAILORS poised on the TOP of the WALL.
DENHAM
Drop the net!
ANGLE ON: The SAILORS drop BOULDERS attached to a LARGE SHIP
NET

Ann ... He'll kill you!
ANN
No, he won't.
ANGLE ON: KONG trying to get up ...
ENGLEHORN hurls the CHLOROFORM BOTTLE at KONG, smashing it on the
ground right under his face.
ANN (cont'd)
No!
KONG breathes in the cloud of CHLOROFORM, he tries to push himself
up.
ENGLEHORN
Keep him down!
SAILORS throw BOULDERS down from the TOP of the WALL,
pummelling
KONG'S HEAD.
ANN breaks away from JACK, rushes at ENGLEHORN, grabbing his
arm
just as he prepares to throw another CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.
ANN
Stop it! You're killing him!
ENGLEHORN
Get her out of here! Get her out of
his sight!
JACK takes ANN'S ARM ... DENHAM yells at him, as KONG'S RAGE
intensifies.
DENHAM
Do it!
CLOSE ON: ANN STARES up at JACK.
ANN
Let go of me ...
CLOSE ON: JACK, he STARES at ANN, torn about what to do. His eyes
flicker towards KONG. He makes his decision.
A
NGLE ON: JACK pulling ANN by the HAND towards the TUNNEL
ENTRANCE. She struggles to break free.
CLOSE ON: KONG WATCHING ANN being DRAGGED AWAY ... he EXPLODES
with ANGER, suddenly RISING to his FEET, ripping the NET to
PIECES! He SWINGS the ROPES AWAY, sending HAPLESS SAILORS flying
through the AIR!
103.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks on in HORROR, as his PLAN to CAPTURE
KONG
falls apart.
SAILOR
We can't contain him!
ENGLEHORN
Kill it!
DENHAM
No!
ENGLEHORN
It's over, you Goddamn lunatic!
DENHAM
I need him alive!
ENGLEHORN
Shoot it!!!
ANGLE ON: ENRAGED KONG throwing SAILORS and overturning STONE
BUILDINGS.
CLOSE ON: JIMMY, gripping a TOMMY GUN, stands in front of KONG ...

by the collar, shoving him down the path.
ENGLEHORN (cont'd)
Jimmy - get out of here! Get to the
boat!
(yelling)
All of you! Run!
ONG climbs DOWN THE WALL.
ANGLE ON: JACK running with ANN towards a waiting BOAT ... ANN
fights as JACK tries to LIFT her on BOARD ... both turn!
JACK
Get in the boat!
ANN
(distraught)
No! It's me he wants. I can stop this -
KONG stampedes down towards the COVE ... JIMMY stands his
ground
with his TOMMY GUN.
ACK yells at BRUCE.
JACK
Take her!
BRUCE takes ANN, as ENGLEHORN leaps into their BOAT ... he
yells
to the SAILORS.
104.
ANN
Let me go to him!
ENGLEHORN
Row! Get the hell out of here!
ANGLE ON: JACK pushes JIMMY into the SECOND BOAT.
ACK
Jimmy! No!
JACK tries to prevent JIMMY from shooting at KONG, as SAILORS push
their BOAT away from the shore.
CLOSE ON: DENHAM finds a CRATE of CHLOROFORM BOTTLES on the FLOOR
of the BOAT. He snatches one up ... prepares to throw.
ANGLE ON: JIMMY manages to fire a BURST at KONG ... KONG CHARGES
in FURY and THUMPS his FIST down on the BOW of the BOAT.
A
NGLE ON: DENHAM is flung into the water, still clutching the
CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.
ANGLE ON: KONG flings the BOAT against the COVE WALL, smashing it -
sending JACK, JIMMY and SAILORS into the SEA!
ANN looks on in horror as JACK SURFACES, holding onto JIMMY,
who
is COUGHING SEA WATER.
KONG turns to ANN'S BOAT ... he looks at her ...
ANN
Go back!
KONG PAUSES at the SOUND of her VOICE ... as if sensing her
fear
for him.
ENGLEHORN
Hold her!
BRUCE holds ANN as ENGLEHORN suddenly FIRES a HARPOON into KONG'S
KNEE ... KONG ROARS in PAIN and SINKS into the water. ANN is
sobbing with DISTRESS.
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN starts LOADING a SECOND HARPOON ... DENHAM
scrambles on to a ROCK, clutching the CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.
DENHAM
Wait!

unconsciousness.
CLOSE ON: ANN and JACK make EYE CONTACT across the water .... She

Broadway! "Kong - the Eighth Wonder of
the World"!
SMASH CUT TO:

THE ROAD!!!
ANGLE ON: JACK stares up in horror as KONG heads straight for him
... JACK is going to DIE!
116.
With an ANGUISHED ROAR the HUGE GORILLA stumbles past JACK
into

KONG spins around reacting with terrified confusion to the

FRUSTRATION!

JACK
(under his breath)
Oh Jesus ...
ANGLE ON: JACK as he watches KONG heading off down BROADWAY.
CRASHING off BUILDINGS KONG CAREENS out of TIMES SQUARE ...
ANGLE ON: ANN emerges from a SHABBY THEATRE, just as SEVERAL
POLICE CARS drive past at SPEED.
ANN runs to an INTERSECTION and looks up the STREET. Several

it's DRIVER watching the scene, MOUTH AGAPE!
ANGLE ON: JACK jumping into the BACK of the CAB. He gestures

ANGLE ON: KONG ... his FIST about to SMASH down on a TRAM full
of PEOPLE! The BLARE of a CAR HORN makes him turn ... he
hesitates ... realizing who is behind the wheel of the CAB!
ACK'S POV ... as KONG comes closer. PANICKING DRIVERS PILE into
each other. JACK desperately tries his door, but it won't open, he
is WEDGED IN by CARS on either side.
KONG LIFTS THE CAR directly in front - HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD,
throwing it into a BUILDING.
CLOSE ON:
JACK'S FOOT depresses ACCELERATOR.
The WHEELS are SPINNING WILDLY ... in a CLOUD OF BURNING RUBBER,
the CAB speeds down the ROAD, weaving in and out of the path cut
by KONG'S DESTRUCTION.
KONG BOUNDS AFTER THE CAB, running on all FOURS with incredible
speed.
JACK crosses an INTERSECTION, driving up on the SIDEWALK to get a
CLEARER DRIVING LANE ... PEDESTRIANS scatter - not only from the
CAB, but from KONG who is in HOT PURSUIT.
T
he CAB SLEWS across the STREET, disappearing up a TINY ALLEY,
only just wide enough for the CAB, but TOO NARROW for KONG.
JACK glances back at KONG, ROARING with frustration at the ALLEY
ENTRANCE.
JACK speeds out of the ALLEY and CROSSES the TRAFFIC FLOW, causing
much BRAKING and HORN action. He gets SLOWED in THICK TRAFFIC ...
KONG BURSTS his way out of the ALLEY ENTRANCE ... RIGHT IN FRONT
OF JACK'S CAB!!!
JACK SWERVES on to the SIDEWALK ...
118.
JACK steers the CAB wildly along the SIDEWALK scattering
PEDESTRIANS in all directions!

bend and DRIVES straight into a FRUIT VENDOR'S STALL!
ANGLE ON: The CAB, covered by the RUINED STALL, SLAMS into the
WALL of a BUILDING. JACK is thrown forward on IMPACT ...
KONG rounds the corner and BOUNDS PAST JACK'S CAB ... hidden
beneath the RUBBLE ...
KONG searches for the CAB, ROARING in FRUSTRATION!
KONG'S HUGE EYES glance in the WINDOW, just as:
KONG suddenly FREEZES! He inclines his HEAD; unsure if what he is
seeing is REAL.
KONG'S POV: ANN is walking towards him!
KONG tentatively inches TOWARDS ANN!
ANN stops ... KONG stops. They stare at each other for a long
moment ... ANN offers KONG a small SMILE, and reaches her HAND out
hesitantly towards his ARM.
K
ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.
ANN holds tightly on to his HAND and they DISAPPEAR into the
night.
IDE ON: KONG carries ANN through the snow covered trees of
CENTRAL PARK ...
SUDDENLY he finds himself stepping on to the FROZEN POND ...
ANGLE ON: The GIANT GORILLA slipping on the ICE ... as soon as his
