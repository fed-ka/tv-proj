   (SHAWN, REBECCA)

    REBECCA IS WALKING A STILL DAZED-LOOKING SHAWN INTO HER 
    HOUSE.  SHE TAKES HIM BY THE HAND AND LEADS HIM TOWARDS THE  
    LIVING ROOM.  

                                SHAWN

              Nice place--

                                REBECCA

              Thanks. 

  SHE YANKS HIM QUICKLY DOWN ON THE COUCH.  SHE CLOSES HER 
  EYES, THEN TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

                                REBECCA (CONT D)

              Okay, let me say this quickly, or I 

              won t say it at all. I haven t been 

              honest with you. Maybe it s because 

              I ve lost faith in mankind or menkind, 

              or maybe I just lost faith in myself. 

              I lied to you when I said I don t have 

              kids. I have two kids who are having 

              dinner at my sister s right now. 

              Scout s twelve and Justin s fourteen--

              I had them young! I don t know when I 

              was planning to tell you. Maybe next 

              Christmas. Or if we had a second date. 

              But I don t know, somehow...tonight 

              just kind of felt like the right time 

              to tell you.                                                                                31.



  SHAWN SMILES AT HER, THEN HE LOOKS DOWN FOR A LONG BEAT.  HE 
  TAKES A DEEP BREATH, THEN LEANS A LITTLE CLOSER.

                                SHAWN

              There s something I need to tell you 

              too. I lied to you about Perry.     

              I m the alcoholic, not him.

    REBECCA LOOKS AT HIM, TAKEN ABACK.

                                REBECCA

              Wha...t?

                                SHAWN

              Um, maybe not a full-out 100% alkie, 

              but I have a LOT of demons and you re 

              great, you truly are incredible and 

              you deserve so much better than me. 

  SHAWN IS NOW BACKING QUICKLY TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              (SINCERE) I had a fantastic time 

              tonight, I really did, and I, I wish 

              you and...your family good luck.

  SHAWN NODS GOODBYE, FUMBLES WITH HER DOOR AND EXITS.  REBECCA 
    STARES AT THE DOOR FOR A BEAT, INCREDULOUS, THEN SHAKES HER 
  HEAD IN DISGUST.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, SHAWN SHAKES 
  HIS HEAD TOO, MORE SURPRISED THAN HER BY WHAT JUST CAME OUT 
  OF HIS MOUTH.  

                                                                          FADE OUT


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                32.

   (REBECCA, SHAWN, JUSTIN, SCOUT)

  SHAWN IS WALKING REBECCA TO HER DOOR.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                REBECCA

              You lied to me again. We had a meal.

                                SHAWN

              No, no, we had fifteen appetizers. 

                                REBECCA

              Well, thanks. It was...fun.

                                SHAWN

              When I replay that later in my mind, 

              I m going to eliminate the pause.

  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR AN AWKWARD BEAT.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Can I call you again?

                                REBECCA

              Um...I guess.

  SHAWN SMILES.  IT S NOT MUCH, BUT HE LL TAKE IT.  HE LEANS IN 
  TO KISS HER ON THE CHEEK, BUT SHE EXTENDS HER HAND.  THEN 
  SHAWN EXTENDS HIS HAND, AND SHE TRIES TO KISS HIM ON THE 
    CHEEK.  SUDDENLY, JUSTIN, REBECCA S JOCK-ISH 14-YEAR-OLD SON, 
  OPENS THE DOOR.

                                JUSTIN

              Get your filthy paws off my mother.

                                REBECCA

              Justin!                                                                                43.



                                JUSTIN

              He was about to go for your goods, 

              Mom. 

    SCOUT, REBECCA S CUTE, CHRONICALLY ANXIOUS 12-YEAR-OLD 
    DAUGHTER WALKS ONTO THE PORCH NOW TOO.  SHE DOESN T SAY A 
  WORD, SHE JUST STARES, MAKING SHAWN EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE. 

                                REBECCA

              Don t be crude! Look, Shawn here is 

              just a friend--

                                SHAWN

              (A BIT STUNG) O-kay.

                                REBECCA

              (LOOKS AT SHAWN) A friend I may get to 

              know a little better...(TO JUSTIN) so 

              I expect you to be a hell of a lot 

              more courteous, mister.

    JUSTIN LOCKS EYES WITH SHAWN AND GIVES HIM A LONG GLARE.  

                                SHAWN

              Hi... (LONG BEAT) Put on a jacket or 

              you ll catch your death of cold.

    JUSTIN JUST STARES AT HIM LIKE HE S AN ALIEN.  AFTER A BEAT, 
  SCOUT LEANS SHYLY FORWARD.

                                SCOUT

              We ll all be dead in twenty years  

              anyway after the earth s magnetic 

              field disappears and we re bombarded 

              by deadly cosmic rays.

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HER, TAKEN ABACK, THEN TURNS TO REBECCA.                                                                                44.



                                SHAWN

              Kids...

    REBECCA SMILES, THEN WAVES GOODBYE TO SHAWN AND ESCORTS 
    JUSTIN AND SCOUT BACK INTO THE HOUSE. SHAWN WAVES BACK, THEN 
  WALKS TOWARDS HIS HONDA.  HE SNEAKS ONE MORE LOOK AT REBECCA, 
  THEN TAKES ANOTHER NERVOUS LOOK AT HER KIDS.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                45.
