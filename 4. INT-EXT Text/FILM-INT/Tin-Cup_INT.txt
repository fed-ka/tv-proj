Tin Cup holds court.
TIN CUP
Takes about two ounces of brains
to figure it out. Anyone think
they got a brain with two ounces
of brains in it?
The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
reveal the heft of their brains.
TIN CUP
For Chrissakes, boys! A little
self-confidence from the players'
gallery. We ain't talking long
division.
EARL
(timidly)
How much we gotta lose?
TIN CUP
You want to liven things up, Earl?
That's a hell of an idea. Say
everyone puts in twenty bucks and
the pot goes to whoever solves the
riddle.
DEWEY
You going to get the riddle, Tin
Cup?
3.
TIN CUP
(patiently)
Dewey. I'm the one asking the
riddle. I already know the
answer. I don't getta guess.
Although... We could say if I get
to five hundred bounces and no one
gets the riddle, I get the pot.
And I know what you're thinking.
It's an impossible riddle. Well,
It's not. It's an easy riddle.
And if somehow by the grace of
fluke luck I win, and you all
don't agree it was an easy
riddle, hell, I'll refund your
money.
EARL, CLINT & ALL
I'm in... We're in... Count us
in... etc...
TIN CUP
Okay, a man's driving down the
road with his son and they get
in a crash. Two ambulances come
and take the man and his son to
different hospitals. Son goes
into the operating room, the
doctor looks at him and says, 'I
can't operate on this boy. He's
my son.' How's that possible?
(beat)
The clock's ticking boys...
Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.
EARL
Father didn't sneak back in,
right? He's still at the other
hospital?
TIN CUP
It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl.
No
one beamed him aboard.
That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
The men think harder.
EARL
Well... if the father married the
son's daughter --
TIN CUP
It's a family riddle, Earl.
Think
clean thoughts.
4.
The regulars puzzle some more.
CLINT
Give us a little hint.
MOLLY (O.S.)
The doctor's a woman.
All heads turn to take in the arrival of:

MOLLY GRISWOLD
3
Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
riddle's answer.
MOLLY
The doctor is the son's mother.
Feminists pose the riddle to
reveal how deeply our sexual
stereotypes run.
(directly to Tin Cup)
I take it you're a feminist?
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.
TIN CUP
Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
things -- but no one's ever
saddled me with that one.
MOLLY
You might try being saddled
sometime -- the smell of leather,
the sting of a whip...
The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.
TIN CUP
(slightly taken
aback)
I'm just a humble golf pro...
MOLLY
You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I
pictured something... different.
I have a seven o'clock lesson.
TIN CUP
I thought I had a Doctor Griswold

at seven.
They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his
gaffe.
And the regulars gather to look out the window --

THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW

To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is
discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.

Tin Cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather
excitedly around the TV monitor now coming in.
TIN CUP
A class act there, boys --
probably the first actual `lady
type' female ever seen on these
premises --
ROMEO
Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus
Christi dog track on the dish --
EARL
This is yer dead mortal cinch lock
bet with Do-reen.
Everyone's glued to the set. A greyhound race comes on
from a remote Texas track on the gulf.
TIN CUP
Free money, boys, what does
Doreen know about the fine art of
Greyhound breeding?
ROMEO
All she knows is she likes the
three dog 'cause his name is
Pride of Odessa 'cause she's
from Odessa.
TIN CUP
Get ready for Oddessa-lation, boys.
How deep we in?
ROMEO
You gave her twenty to one --
EARL
It's only fifteen to one on the
toteboard --
TIN CUP
Yeah, but I got every other dog
in the race. I'm just getting
even with Doreen -- I'm not
trying to clean her clock.
CLINT
So how much you stand to lose?
ROMEO
Twelve thousand.
13.
TIN CUP
Hundred.
ROMEO
Thousand.
TIN CUP
(panicky)
Hundred.
ROMEO
You said to shoot the wad.
TIN CUP
I said get even, Pod. I didn't
say shoot the wad. We better see
that three dog rolling on his ass.
All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break.
EARL
Except... if he breaks slow, he
won't get creamed...
The starting box opens -- "THERE GOES THE RABBIT" -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch.
REGULARS
Three dog's dying, T.C.... easy
money... (etc.)
The one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn,
annihilating the field. Dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins, and --
REGULARS
Uh-oh.
The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over --
the three dog wins.
Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks --
ROMEO
So, Roy, you were saying you
felt a little flutter for this
doctor lady?
TIN CUP
Yes, I was saying that... just
before I was interrupted by...
bankruptcy -- a development that
the 'Doctor Lady,' as you call her,
14.
will consider utterly predictable.

WAITRESS/STRIPPER

TIN CUP
Busy man, Courtenay, busy man --
As they pass the stage, even the Naked Dancer interrupts
her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills --
NAKED DANCER
Tin Cup!
Hi, sweetie!
TIN CUP
Hiya, honey -- lookin' sweet...
And backstage they go, easily waved through by another
bouncer. They come up to a dressing room door. And
knock.
A voice from inside.
VOICE (O.S.)
That better be you, Roy.

TIN CUP AND ROMEO

enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. And
there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty,
hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess. She's older than the
other girls, and more experienced in every way. She's
smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her
stripper's outfit.
Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning.
TIN CUP
Doreen...
ROMEO
You're looking particularly
lovely this evening -- This is
nicer than the leopard suit --
DOREEN
Cut the horseshit, guys. So...
the one and two dogs always run
wide and the three dog always
breaks slow, so I figure there's
gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at
the turn and the three dog's
gonna tiptoe around it and walk
on home... I was right.
(smiles)
You owe me twelve thousand
dollars.
ROMEO
We going to pay you.
16.
Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit.
DOREEN
I know you're going to pay me.
DOREEN (CONT'D)
(admiring her own
outfit)
Y'know I finally got rid of the
leopard suit thing -- it was so
retro, y'know... it's not easy
being a post-modern stripper...
(beat)
So... twelve big ones?
Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.
TIN CUP
There. With equity and inventory
it's worth twelve grand... more or
less.
Doreen leans forward to examine the papers.
She looks at
Tin Cup with surprise.
DOREEN
This is how you think you can
settle up? By deeding me your
driving range?
TIN CUP
Only on condition you don't sell
right away, and me'n Romeo keep
our jobs.
DOREEN
What in the world would I want
with your stupid driving range?
TIN CUP
Equity, inventory, cash flow...
not to mention an enhanced stature
in the community, and prepaid
membership in the Salome Chamber
of Commerce.
For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup,
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.
DOREEN
What are your labor costs?
(off no response
from Tin Cup)
Payroll, Roy. What do you pay
17.
your help?
TIN CUP
Let's see... the tractor kid gets
five bucks an hour. Romeo, he
gets ten cash --
DOREEN
What do you pay yourself?
TIN CUP
Myself?
Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening.
DOREEN
To hit golf balls all day... when
you're not breaking for beers or
corn dogs or to gather the guys
and lay bets on which crow flies
off the fence next.
TIN CUP
You're referring to my managerial
salary?
DOREEN
I'm referring to every nickel you
snatch out of the till and every
bag of beer nuts you lift from the
rack, is what I'm referring to.
(beat)
I'll say it's worth ten and you
still owe me two.
She smiles, he sighs.

Tin Cup sits on the couch, swigging Maalox.

ROMEO
But your clubs are your livelihood.
TIN CUP
Well the hood ain't too lively at
the moment.
A CAR HORN SOUNDS from outside.
TIN CUP
Whoever it is, tell 'em I'm in

Romeo opens the door, and steps outside.

Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can
of water where the balls are washing. Tin Cup sits on a
bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox.

TIN CUP
If I had it all to do over, I'd
still hit that shot.
ROMEO
(nods with neither
rancor nor irony)
The look comes over your face, you
would bury yourself alive to prove
you can handle a shovel.
Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative. But Romeo's just washing and scooping
balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.
TIN CUP
You know why I'd still hit that
shot?
Now Romeo looks over... and he decides that Tin Cup is
the one in need of perspective.
ROMEO
'Cuz it's the only way you can
beat David Simms. 'Cuz you never
got over that he is on tour and
you are not. 'Cuz you get that
look on your face...
TIN CUP
No...
(pauses, adding
weight to his
thoughts)
I'd hit it again because that shot
was a defining moment. And when a
defining moment comes along you
define the moment or the moment
defines you. I did not shrink
from the challenge. I rose to it.
Romeo nods, holding his peace.
ROMEO
1981, Fort Washington Golf Club,
Fresno, California, final round of
the Tour Qualifying School...
Tin Cup cringes at the memory, then moves for the high
ground.
TIN CUP
I was playing to win.
ROMEO
A defining moment when you tried
to hit the same impossible cut

it off and tapped in for a

(beat)
When a twelve woulda got you on
the tour! That was a defining
moment and the definition was
shit!
TIN CUP
Greatness courts failure, Romeo.
That's why most people, in their
whole lives, never ever reach for
the brass ring, never know when to
dig deep and try for the
impossible shot...
ROMEO
You're right about that, boss, but
sometimes... sometimes... par is
good enough to win.
Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail.

TIN CUP
It's a business proposition. I'm
offering you my winnings from all
them tournaments this summer.
DOREEN
In exchange for what?
TIN CUP
My driving range back.
She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea.
She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition,
and moves her face opposite his.
DOREEN
Roy, I'm not as dumb as my hair
makes me look.
TIN CUP
They ain't all strictly minor

two grand!
She twirls off.
He chases her, beer and entries in hand.
TIN CUP
Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do
the math, and you gotta look at
how good I'm playing. I hit the
shot of the tournament at the
best-ball. They put it on
national TV.
DOREEN
I saw.
TIN CUP
And what does that tell you?
The MUSIC comes to an END.
The club is momentarily

TIN CUP

lessons.
ROMEO
She don't know you live in a
Winnebago.
TIN CUP
Well, she sure as hell knows I
ain't taking her to no Doral for
massages and mimosas all weekend.
I gotta do something with my life.
He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs.
TIN CUP
I gotta rise to a level worthy of
the women that think I'm a joke.
ROMEO
Well... you could go out and win
The Open.
TIN CUP
(pausing, as
if jarred)
Romeo, that idea has promise.
ROMEO
I was joking.
TIN CUP
I ain't.

ROMEO
We talking about the same
tournament? The U.S. Open? The
Biggest golf tournament in the
world?
TIN CUP
Not just the biggest golf
Tournament in the world; the most
democratic.
ROMEO
What do you mean?
TIN CUP
I mean it's open. Anyone's got a
shot at it. You just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the A.T.T., they can't
keep you out. They can't ask you
if you're a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper. You qualify, you're in.
ROMEO
And then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated --
TIN CUP
Who's intimidated? I just told
you I'm gonna win the damn thing!
ROMEO
You don't got the game.
TIN CUP
I got every shot in the book.
ROMEO
I said you don't got the game.
The mental game. The head game.
TIN CUP
You suggesting I err on the side

ROMEO
You always go out to shoot zero.
Sometimes you pull it off. But
you can't play like that at the
Open. You win by taking what the

Tin Cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an

Well, since you're the authority,
How'd you like to teach me how to

ROMEO
You don't ever listen to me.

This time'll be different.

In parlance you might understand,
just kick back and let the Big Dog

He sighs and plunges in.

TIN CUP
Okay, okay, let 'er rip...
(deep breath)
Suppose there's this guy. He's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. And the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. But on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. I guess my
question's this: What would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?
MOLLY
He's an idiot.
TIN CUP
No. He's a hell of a swimmer,
see. His problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?
MOLLY
He's a juvenile idiot.
TIN CUP
You don't understand what I mean
by the river.
MOLLY
We're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, Roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.
TIN CUP
Y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? I came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?
MOLLY
You don't have any inner demons.
What you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.
45.
TIN CUP
I ain't just some jerk driving-
range pro who drinks too much
booze and eats too few vegetables.
MOLLY
You're being defensive -- cut to
the chase and tell me why you're
here.
TIN CUP
Well... I'm smitten with a woman.
MOLLY
That's good.
Is she smitten with
you?
TIN CUP
Not yet.
MOLLY
Have you asked her out?
TIN CUP
She's seeing a guy. I don't know
how serious it is, but the guy's a
real horse's ass, in my opinion...
MOLLY
If you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force
these issues out in the open.
TIN CUP
I'm afraid she'll say no.
MOLLY
Ahh... so what you're saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life.
TIN CUP
Christ, I didn't know we were
gonna get into my personal life!
MOLLY
This is therapy!
TIN CUP
Well, jeez, I know, but I didn't
think it was that kind of
therapy...
46.
MOLLY
What were you expecting?
Ann
Landers?
TIN CUP
Yeah.
MOLLY
Look, it's rather simple. Those
risks that you love to take on the
golf course, the risks you talk so
passionately and poetically about
-- you need to apply those risks
to your personal life with the
same passion.
TIN CUP
I should ask this woman out.
MOLLY
Yes!
TIN CUP
I should risk coming right over
the top and snap-hooking it out of
bounds left.
MOLLY
Yes!
TIN CUP
Risk hitting it a little thin
and --
MOLLY
For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough!
TIN CUP
Right.
Sorry.
MOLLY
S'okay...
(beat)
Look, just walk up to this woman,
wherever she is, look her in the
eye with those big beautiful green
eyes of yours, let down your guard
and don't try to be smooth or cool
or whatever -- just be honest and
take the risk -- you can do it!
Tin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She
stares at him. And he walks right up to her.
TIN CUP
Dr. Griswold -- I think I'm in

Molly is stunned.
MOLLY
What?!
TIN CUP
From the moment I first saw you I
knew I was through with bar girls
and strippers and motorcycle
chicks, and when you started
talking I was smitten and I'm
smitten more every day I think
about you -- and the fact that
you know I'm full of crapola
only makes you more attractive
to me because usually I can
bullshit people but I can't
bullshit you and in addition, most
women I'm thinking about how to get
into their pants from Day One but
with you I'm just thinking about
how to get into your heart --
Molly was clue-less.
She just stares.
MOLLY
My God...
TIN CUP
(optimistically,
proudly)
Stunned, eh? So what about dinner
and we can talk about `us' and if
we have a future and how to drop
that horse's ass boyfriend of
yours --
MOLLY
Roy, slow down --
TIN CUP
Hey! I just hit a eight degree
driver off a cart path here, I'm

Wrong.
Aw, shit...

I am one horrible shrink...
jeez... I didn't know you were
talking about me.

Would your advice have been
different?
She's frustrated and at a loss for words.
MOLLY
Session's over. You better leave.
Crushed, Tin Cup heads to the door, stops and turns.
TIN CUP
I'm gonna qualify for the U.S.
Open and kick your boyfriend's

He drops his clubs on the couch. The place is a wreck,
and he collapses in a chair, CRACKING a CAN of cheap
BEER.
A KNOCK at the door.
He's startled.
TIN CUP
Debt collection? Process server?
51.
Ex-flame? Jesus, I'm clean.
(disguises his
voice)
Who is it?
The door opens -- Molly enters. He's surprised but well-
settled into his bath of cynicism.
MOLLY
God, you've got a beautiful
swing --
TIN CUP
-- And big, beautiful green eyes
-- I'm a beautiful guy.
MOLLY
I came here to apologize.
TIN CUP
For what?
MOLLY
Well, I counseled you, you did
exactly what I said, and I just...
poured cold water over your
effort.
(quickly)
I didn't get it. I'm a terrible
shrink, probably... I should've
never got out of real estate --
actually I should never have
left Ohio for that cowboy in
Armarillo -- have you ever been
to Amarillo?
TIN CUP
A cowboy?
MOLLY
It's not as romantic when you're
actually with one -- a wrangler,
y'know -- so of course the oil
man in Dallas looked great after
that -- I don't know what I was
thinking... That's when I went to
the gulf and ended up in, well,
trailer sales and then all those
condos in Corpus Christi -- the
bottom fell outta the market and
I needed a new gig --
TIN CUP
A new gig?
MOLLY
Therapy.
I took all the classes.
52.
I'm licensed, y'know.
(suddenly dejected)
Oh God...
(reaching into her
purse)
Mind if I smoke?
(lights up)
Anyway, I'm flattered you asked me
out. I can't accept because I am
involved with David and I haven't
seen any evidence that he treats
old people, kids or dogs badly.
TIN CUP
I got a little carried away, I
guess. I shoulda just layed up,
made my par, and moved on.
MOLLY
Look, I want to propose something
-- as long as you understand this
is professional -- we're not going
out together --
TIN CUP
Tee it up.
MOLLY
I can help you with the mental
aspects of the game. You've got
Romeo to be your swing doctor, I
can be your head doctor.
TIN CUP
But you said you were a lousy shrink?
MOLLY
Well, yeah... I'll improve.
TIN CUP
I got no money to pay for you.
MOLLY
I'll trade my services for golf
lessons and help you through the
qualifying. If you get into the
Open, well, you're on your own.
TIN CUP
You'll be with David.
MOLLY
Yeah...
Silence.
A deal.
It's the best they can do.

A nearly nude dancer named SAMMANTHA on stage to a big
Saturday night crowd. Tin Cup's in the front row,
sitting with Doreen and a beer. Disconsolate.
P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Bring out those bills, boys, if ya
wanta see a little more of
Sammantha!
Guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway,
placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper.
SAMMANTHA
(to Tin Cup)
Hey, honey...
67.
Tin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster
wave, he's depressed -- or something.
TIN CUP
Hey, honey...
DOREEN
I heard you qualified for the
Regionals -- why you so down?
TIN CUP
I broke my clubs -- don't ask why,
my caddie's pissed off at me, I
lost my wheels in a sucker bet,
and my shrink thinks I'm a fool --
'cause I probably am...
DOREEN
You're seeing a therapist?!
TIN CUP
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
DOREEN
Only way you'd ever go into
therapy was if the shrink was a
doll and you were trying to get
her into the rack --
TIN CUP
You're so shallow. The Good
Doctor and I are dealing with my
regression and denial --
DOREEN
Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock.
You
got a hard-on.
A GUY from the next table leans over, interrupting.
GUY
You `Tin Cup'?
Won the Local with
a seven iron?
TIN CUP
That's me.
GUY
McAvoy?
The Tin Cup McAvoy?
DOREEN
There's only one -- thank God...
TIN CUP
Yeah.
You looking for a game?
68.
GUY
No, but I'd sure like to show you
my grip...
Doreen can't keep his attention. Neither can Sammantha,
who writhes only a few feet away.
DOREEN
How long have you been seeing this
`Good Doctor'?
TIN CUP
Excuse me, Dor', the man's having
trouble with his grip --
The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.
GUY
See, I used to play a real weak
grip. But you look at Couples,
he's got a left hand way over
here...
Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip.
TIN CUP
No, grip it like this, so you're
holding on with the last two
fingers of your left hand.
The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him.
GUY
See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you
grip a golf club like this, with
these two fingers.
DOREEN
Roy?
(off no response)
Roy?
Tin Cup? Hello?
TIN CUP
The grip and address are about 90
percent of the golf swing, so pay
attention here...
COWBOY
When you're done with him, can I
ask you about my club position at
address?
Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of
the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --
69.
SAMMANTHA
Am I doing something wrong?
DOREEN
No, honey, you ain't -- but a
healthy woman's only got two
choices in this world of ours...
(beat)
Either fall in love with another
woman -- or take up golf.
And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not
at all surprised. She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men.
TIN CUP
... Now the stronger right-hand
grip can help ya draw the ball,
which I plan to do at the
Regionals next week in Tulsa...
just shift the hand over a little
bit... blah, blah, blah...
... And naked women dance before them, unnoticed.

Tin Cup drives, as most of the Regulars lounge -- all are
there including Turk (the bouncer). But Romeo is
missing.
CLINT
We get through the next 36 holes
and we in the Open!
EARL
I got the yips and I ain't even
teeing it up...
TIN CUP
Nothing to worry about, boys --
JOSE
But you ain't got Romeo?
TIN CUP
Don't need him till the Open --
he'll be back.
70.
CLINT
But you don't got the doctor lady?
TIN CUP
Oh no, I got her. Right here.
He holds up a tape cassette.
TIN CUP
She can't travel to Arizona for
the Regionals -- she's got a busy
practice, y'know... so she made me
this tape to play while I'm out
there... keep me calm, cool, and
collected...
EARL
What's on it?
TIN CUP
A little James Taylor, little
George Jones, little Kahlil
Gibran, little this, little
that... and a lotta the voice of
the smartest chick I ever met.
EARL
The good doctor herself...
CLINT
Can we hear it or is it personal?
TIN CUP
Since when is therapy personal,
eh?
He punches into his deck and the Winnebago is filled with
the sounds of MOLLY'S TAPE, beginning with George
Jones...
... and the voice of GEORGE JONES takes us into...
DISSOLVE TO:

Tin Cup stands there caught, like a deer in the
headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private
confession made public -- he can't run and he can't
hide...
Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly
first arrived with -- plus many more. He wears a
pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious
triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow
attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he
swings a collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO
PROJECTS loudly from his VCR, so loudly that he never
heard her knocking.
MOLLY
My God...
TIN CUP
Aarghh...
MOLLY
Roy...
TIN CUP
Dr. Griswold...
A moment of pathetic silence, then:
Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.
TIN CUP
The therapist laughs at her
patient? Is that how it works? A
man is laid bare before God and
he's the butt of the cosmic joke?
MOLLY
I'm sorry, I just...
TIN CUP
Some of this shit might actually

work, y'know... I mean I think
there's something to this hat
with the pendulum golf ball
thing... may be on to something
here...
MOLLY
Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself,
'It is the paraphernalia for lost
and desperate souls.'
Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.
TIN CUP
Well, God damn... a lost and
desperate soul stands before you.
(beat)
I assume I have the
confidentiality of doctor-client
privilege in regards to this
outfit?
MOLLY
Of course you do. What happened?
TIN CUP
I got the shanks.
MOLLY
Are you taking penicillin?
TIN CUP
It can't be treated! It's much
worse than whatever you thought it
was.
(beat)
There's a glitch in my swing.
MOLLY
So it's in Romeo's department?
TIN CUP
He thinks it's your department --
says it's a head thing.
MOLLY
Oh. Well. I just came over to
congratulate you on the regionals
and return your car -- David says
he doesn't want it, just wanted to
make a point with you --
(beat)
But I suppose we could have a
therapy session right here and now
--
85.
TIN CUP
I don't want therapy. I want you.
MOLLY
Roy...
I gotta get some air --
TIN CUP
Look at me --
(considering what
that means)
Well, not right at the moment --
but listen to me. You're with the
wrong guy. I'm the right guy.
Everyone tells me my face is all
screwed up tight as a drum 'cause
I've been crazy about you from
the day you showed up wearing
this stupid stuff and the whole
damn thing has both inspired
me to get here on the verge of
greatness yet it's also caused
me to get the shanks which
could humiliate me in front of
a zillion people.
(beat)
Such is life. So dump that phony
bastard and come to the Open in my
corner -- you can delay your
romantic urges, which I know are
lurking in there among the excess
of brain cells you possess --
until the appropriate time...
(beat)
Tell me you're not at least
moderately attracted to me.
Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows --
for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.
MOLLY
You have moments.
TIN CUP
Tell me which ones are my moments
and I'll try to duplicate them.
MOLLY
This is a moment. You look great.
TIN CUP
Now?!
MOLLY
Utterly exposed, completely
vulnerable, the inner child trying
to get out.
86.
TIN CUP
My inner child needs spanking.
MOLLY
You always liked that part about
saddling up, the smell of leather
--
TIN CUP
C'mon, let's have a drink. Call
it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour.
Little Cuervo, little Freud...
She's thinking about it.
MOLLY
Naw... I gotta go.
(turns to leave)
Oh, I don't have a car, I
need a ride.
CUT TO:

Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness
-- a couple of wide-eyed kids.
TIN CUP
I bet this is the first Winnebago
they ever saw here...
89.
ROMEO
Yeah... and the first Mexican...
The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- A SECURITY
GUARD comes to the window. A banner hangs above the
entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming:
"Old Pines -- U.S. Open Championship."
SECURITY GUARD
Yes?
ROMEO
Como esta, amigo. I have with me
one of the legendary ball strikers
in the history of golf --
The Security Guard strains to see in.
SECURITY GUARD
Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you?
Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No?
Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself.
TIN CUP
Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy.
Representing the great American
Southwest.
The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his SECOND.
SECURITY GUARD
Do we have a... McCormack... on
the list.
ROMEO
McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- he's a
legend!
SECURITY GUARD
We got over 150 legends in this
tournament. Sorry.
Romeo starts cursing in Spanish.
The Guard is unphased.
SECURITY GUARD
Call the police.
ROMEO
Police?
The police quickly appear to take over the situation.
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point.
TIN CUP
There's a mistake here, fellas!
90.
A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight.
It's
getting ugly real fast.
COP
We'll throw your ass in jail right
now, pal -- there's a lotta
lunatics here and we don't take
chances...
At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a con-
vertible sponsor's car. He sees the scuffle, gets
out.
SIMMS
What's the problem here?
SECURITY GUARD
This clown says he's in the
Open...
Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him. Tin
Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face.
TIN CUP
Hiya, David... nice sweater.
SECURITY GUARD
He's not on the list.
Simms takes the clipboard with the list.
SIMMS
Hiya, Roy... welcome to the big
leagues...
(checks the list)
Here ya go, Charlie, his name's
right here.
(to Tin Cup)
They spelled your name wrong --
easy mistake with a total unknown.
SECURITY GUARD
(to Cop)
Let him in.
Simms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top.
Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard:
TIN CUP
Which way to the practice range?
As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back
into the Winnebago --
91.
SECURITY GUARD
(to Simms)
He said he was a 'legend'?
SIMMS
Oh he is... he's a very big name
at a driving range in Salome,
Texas...
They all have a good laugh, and --

Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is
doing a slow dance with his driver.
Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink
after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered.
TIN CUP
It's three in the morning, Romes,
what time I tee off?
ROMEO
Seven-o-five... first group off...
Keep drinking, keep dancing...
TIN CUP
That's four hours from now?
ROMEO
You're drinking till five...
c'mon, c'mon, have another --
(a tough coach)
Get you in shape --
95.
Tin Cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggers
around the room with his driver until, finally, he
collapses in a heap on the floor. Romeo looks down
at him coolly, like horse trainer Wayne Lukas sizing
up his Derby entry.
ROMEO
Nothing like the sight of a
finely-tuned athlete on the verge
of greatness...
Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor.

David Simms is interviewed.
SIMMS (V.O.)
(on the television)
I'm the last person who expected
me to come out of the blocks with
a sixty-seven and lead the Open...
It's been a long time since I
played this game with the fire and
determination you need to win...
TIN CUP
The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you
believe it?
ROMEO
Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot
putter...
SIMMS (V.O.)
(on television)
... you see, this game is all
about integrity and tradition and
honor...
TIN CUP
What? It's about cheating and
racism and bullshit!
ROMEO
Easy, boss...

Simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials,
caddies, other PLAYERS. Instantly, in public, he feigns
humility with convincing flair.
PLAYER #1
Helluva round, Dave!
99.
SIMMS
Got lucky out there...
PLAYER #2
Great start, Simmsy...
Simms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their
sorrows.
SIMMS
Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a
monster number up there...
TIN CUP
Coulda been worse...
A small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts.
SIMMS
I played in the Pro-Am with some
asshole movie star shot 82 here
once... how did a great ball-
striker like you, a `legend,'
manage to shoot an 83?
TIN CUP
I missed a four foot putt on the
eighteen for an 82, that's how...
SIMMS
It ain't like playing some muni
track in Brownsville, is it?
A voice interrupts.
MOLLY
Does, `integrity, tradition, and
honor' include kicking a man when
he's down?
SIMMS
Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff,
bar talk, part of the game -- no
offense, right, Cup?
No answer.
Tin Cup's about as low as one can go.
MOLLY
(defensively)
This man still has a lot of good
golf shots in his system --
TIN CUP
(trying to hide)
Molly, it's okay, go away... I
don't need any attention right
100.
now...
SOME GUY AT THE BAR
(to Tin Cup)
You the guy shot 83?!
MOLLY
David, I'll bet you a hundred
dollars right now that Roy here
can hit a ball --
(looks around)
-- from right here to... through
that door to the patio...
She points to a double door, forty feet away across, the
bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening.
TIN CUP
Molly, please...
MOLLY
(to bartender)
And give me a vodka tonic with a
twist --
SIMMS
Molly, really, this isn't...
dignified...
MOLLY
Roy?
TIN CUP
I wanta go back to Texas...
MOLLY
What about the river, the piranha,
the immortality? All that
bullshit? You gonna drag your ass
home with an 83?
(looks around)
In fact, two hundred says he can
hit it through that door, over the
patio, into the river, and make
that pelican fly off that post.
Everyone strains to look --
POV - ABOUT 170 YARDS AWAY
A pelican sits on a piling in the river.
Impossible.
BACK TO SCENE
101.
SIMMS
This is ridiculous...
But Romeo's sizing it up.
ROMEO
You got that shot, Pods, hood the
seven, turn it over, start it low,
right to left...
Molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on
the bar.
MOLLY
I'm not leaving till one of you
men starts acting in a manly
fashion.
Simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter.
SIMMS
Let's just get this over with.
One ball, one swing, one gull.
MOLLY
Roy?
Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. He's
never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low.
ROMEO
You the man.
He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.
TIN CUP
One swing?
Four to one odds.
SIMMS
I'll make it ten to one. Stick it
up your ass. I'm leading the
Open.
MOLLY
Now we're talking! Manly men!
Whoas! From the barside gallery. Tin Cup rises and
someone hands him a club. Suddenly there's a crowd,
including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far
end of the bar. He grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a
mike and begins announcing.
McCORD
... He's looking at thirty yards
of bar and grill, an opening
through the French doors, forty
yards of patio umbrellas, a
102.
hundred yards of water, and a
lonely pelican sitting out there
in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south
by southwest...
(beat)
He'll probably try to shut down a
four iron -- no, he's selected his
trusty seven iron...
Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.
TIN CUP
Kind of a thin lie...
SIMMS
Beats all that deep rough you were
in today...
ROMEO
Fore in the grill! Fore on the
patio! You're the legend, boss...
Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly.
TIN CUP
What is this all about?
MOLLY
Shut up and hit the ball.
McCORD
(on "mike")
The Ledge still has to be thinking
about that brutal, ego-sapping,
manhood-robbing eighty-three he
buried himself under yesterday. I
mean, that's just an avalanche of
golf swings, a landslide, a
pyroclastic flow --
TIN CUP
Dollar bills...
98
And he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and
98
clears the open door...
The bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the
patio to watch the flight of the ball, as --
It's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then:
THWACK! -- It hits the piling!
The SEAGULL lifts off,
SCREECHING angrily.
ROMEO
Stiff, baby, stiff!

A whoop goes up -- And Simms storms out.

SIMMS
I'm outta here. You're all nuts.
MOLLY
I musta been blind thinking you
were worth a shit, Simmsy!
(raucously)
Drinks on me, boys! Helluva shot,
Roy!
TIN CUP
Actually I thinned it a little or

with a Titleist up his ass...
This is the old Tin Cup -- and he's in the clubhouse with

MOLLY
No, no, no... you were great...

How do you go from shooting an
eighty-three one day to a record-
breaking sixty-two the next?
TIN CUP
Well, it wasn't from clean
living...
Laughter from the reporters.
Reporter #1 follows up.
REPORTER #1
If you had to do it again, would
you still go for the green on
eighteen?

Yeah. And I'll go for it tomorrow

Nantz and Venturi in the booth. Tin Cup is on the
monitor, arriving at his ball. We hear SHOUTS from the
GALLERY, encouraging him to go for the green.
VENTURI
It's the same shot he knocked in
the water yesterday. And the
thing for him to do right now is
to tune out the gallery, rein in
his emotions, and forget what he
said in yesterday's interview. He
has to lay up.
117

The announcers see Tin Cup taking out the three wood.
NANTZ
Well, he hasn't shown an ounce of
fear all day.
VENTURI
This isn't courage, Jim. This is

Tin Cup snarls at the impudent question of Reporter #3.

REPORTER #3
I'm just trying to understand your
thinking. You were in the same
spot on eighteen yesterday without
a headwind and you --
TIN CUP
You don't think I can knock it on
from there?
REPORTER #3
It seemed like a low-percentage
shot.
TIN CUP
So am I! Look at me. I'm playing
for...
(points at his
sew-on patches)
... Rio Grande Short-Haul
Trucking, Brink and Brown
Sanitation, First State Bank of

Nothing to celebrate yet. Plus
these are my people. I'm a waffle

ROMEO
Plus he needs his carbohydrates --

If the boys from Salome was in

Tin Cup leans back in his chair, turns to Molly.

ROMEO
You're looking particularly lovely
this evening... the coif is
extraordinary.
DOREEN
Why thank you... Romeo.

All twelve of them are asleep or nearly so in the R.V.,
sprawled on and over every surface. Much snoring.
CLOSE ON MOLLY
Her face close to Tin Cup's.
Both awake.
114.
MOLLY
You nervous about tomorrow?
TIN CUP
Yeah, I'm nervous. So's everybody
else. But I only gotta come and
catch Simms. Sixty-seven guys
gotta come and get me...
Silence.
Except for the random snore.
TIN CUP
It won't always be like this...
y'know... with me... surrounded by
all these guys... snoring... a
stripper ex-girlfriend on the
floor... my caddie sleeping next to
her... all of us damn near
broke... won't always be like
this...
She puts her finger over his mouth gently.
MOLLY
Yes it will... yes it will... and
it's okay...

Molly serves coffee to the regulars.
She's upset.
MOLLY
Which one of you is the bookie?
DEWEY
We all are, but Earl's the best.
115.
MOLLY
What are the odds that Roy will win?
EARL
Vegas has him at ten to one. They're
sure he's gonna self-destruct.
MOLLY
Those sound good to me -- I want
you to place a bet for me. Five
thousand nine hundred dollars on
Tin Cup to win.
They stare nervously.
CURT
That's your nestegg.
EARL
That's a bad idea, honey -- we
love him, but he's gonna fuck-
up --
MOLLY
I said put it all on Roy.
Got
it?
DEWEY
We can't let you --
MOLLY
Boys --
Silence.
Molly's in charge.
She hands them a roll of
cash.
MOLLY
Put it all on Tin Cup.
Earl reluctantly takes the money.

Nantz and Wright stare at the monitors.
NANTZ
That took balls...

Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as:
The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then
rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally
stops five feet from the pin.
A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies
the unfolding shot, and --

Tin Cup's fans, deeply into the beer by now, contort with
body-english and holler at the TV screen.
FANS
Get in there!
Come on!
Go down!
They explode with cheers.
Some twirl with glee.
Others
exchange high fives.
EARL
He's tied for the lead again!
And
they're running outta holes!

Tin Cup and Simms sign their cards and get up to leave in
unison. Simms turns to Tin Cup and has to shake his
head.
SIMMS
I gotta hand it to you, Roy.
When
you go down, you go down in
flames.
TIN CUP
Someday you can tell your
grandchildren you finished second
in the U.S. Open...
(beat)
-- just don't tell 'em how.
And he moves brusquely past Simms and out of the tent,
congratulating Tubbs, the winner, as he passes.
TIN CUP
Good job, Tubbsy... you won it.
And out of the scorer's tent...

Romeo and Doreen eye each other -- locked in a stare
of longing and mystery. TANGO MUSIC comes from a
BOOM BOX. They begin to move toward each other
in a tango step.
