
      LOIS and CLARK walk, each awkwardly burdened with reams of
      wedding-related documents.

                                    LOIS
                    I can't believe it's next week.

                                    CLARK
                    I know.

                                    LOIS
                    The caterer needs a final head 
                    count, the band doesn't have a 
                    final song list... Clark, we're way 
                    behind.

                                    CLARK
                    We'd be way ahead if people'd just
                    stop trying to kill us.

                                    LOIS
                    Let's keep our fingers crossed
                    things stay quiet this week.

      They pass a police station where several WANTED POSTERS are
      pinned up.  One catches Lois' eye -- a bank camera photo of 
      a familiar face (minus the familiar beard): _Tempus_.  She
      pauses for just a second, as if recognizing it, then moves 
      on with Clark.



      Lois and Clark walk.  She consults an actively-revised sheet 
      of names.

                                    LOIS
                    Is this the absolute, total and
                    final guest count?

                                    CLARK
                    Funny you should mention that.  I
                    ran into an old friend last night.

                    Lois, you're getting that sound in
                    your voice.

                                    LOIS
                    What sound?

                    Like any minute claws are gonna pop
                    out of your paws and I'll be
                    getting you a saucer of milk.
                    She's not worth it.  We dated in

      Lois walks by and hears a 'Psssst' from the alley.  She
      stops, turns and a large GUN is aimed at her.  A finger
      appears and crooks her to come in.  She does.



      Lois is led in by TEMPUS.  Much as we remember him:
      arrogant, superior and armed to the teeth.  Only now wearing
      20th Century clothes.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Hi, Lois.  Remember me?

                    Come.  I know I lost the beard but
                    I'm in politics now and Joe Average
                    doesn't trust facial hair.  Oh,

                    other, I'm not ringing any bells?

      And now he pivots, revealing H.G. Wells' time machine at the
      far end of the alley.  On it, his bag of jewels and gold
      from the bank.

                    ... can be a real brain drain.  You

      Superman lands fast and reaches out to grab the gun from

      Superman's hands pass right through Tempus.  Tempus laughs.
      He and Lois disappear in a BLAST OF LIGHT.                 (X)

                    was from 1899.  The me you now see

                                    WELLS
                    Quite all right.  After our
                    escapade, Tempus escaped and built           (X)
                    his own time machine... then did
                    something rather unique with it.
                    Let me show you.



      Wells and Lois emerge.  She looks around.  People, cars, and
      store fronts all identify it as Metropolis.

                                    LOIS
                    It's Metropolis.

                                    WELLS
                    Look carefully.

      She does.  It is different.  Not Our Metropolis.  Garbage
      in the streets, graffiti on walls.  Grim.

      He picks up a newspaper from atop a trashcan, unfolds it and

                    A second Metropolis; a sibling

                    hidden from us by a curtain of 
                    space, now parted.

                           discovery)
                    A thousand details exactly alike --
                    and a thousand as startlingly 
                    different as the infinite choices

                    Why does this keep happening?

      A GANG walks by, all wearing bolstered pistols.  Then across 
      the street she sees a MAN in a business suit with a shotgun 
      slung over his shoulder.

      Then up the street an OLD LADY, purse in one hand, machine 
      gun in another.  (General Rule: about a third of every extra 
      in a street scene carries some kind of firearm.)

                    From what little I've been able to 
                    gather, everyone is frightened, 
                    cynical, with no faith that society

      He gestures to a sign over a store front that reads TEMPUS 
      WEAPONS STORE -- BIG GUNS, SMALL PRICES.  There's a grinning
      picture of Tempus and the motto: "Be Prepared For The 
      Enemy!"

                    I know.

      They both watch, stunned, as a bus rolls by with a huge
      TEMPUS FOR MAYOR sign on it, with the slogan "_He's_
      Prepared For The Enemy -- Are You?"

                    Wait.  If this place _is_ the same

      A SPY who works for Tempus follows along behind Wells and

                                    SPY
                    Looks like the Daily Planet.

                                    TEMPUS
                    No doubt in search of a super-hero.
                    I love predictable behavior.

      TEMPUS OUT.  The Spy melts into the Crowd.  We pick up Wells 
      and Lois in mid-conversation:

                                    LOIS
                    Clark must be going out of his

      They pass a MAN who pulls a gun and is handed a wallet by 
      ANOTHER MAN as if it were the most natural thing in the

      a radio.

                    _completely_ nuts.

      A banner has just been unfurled-over the face of a nearby
      building.  It has a huge picture of Perry and says: PERRY 
      WHITE FOR MAYOR.

                                    WELLS

      toward them.  Different glasses, a more subdued style of

      She's cut off by a rapid report of GUNFIRE from down the 
      street.  Everyone drops low.  MANY pull guns.  A car SQUEALS 
      into view, the DRIVER shooting at a storefront, the MAN in 
      the store FIRING back.  The car then peels out of sight.

      Lois looks over at Clark and sees him in motion.  He ducks 
      behind a building -- then she hears a familiar O.S. WHOOSH.

      Lois, blindfolded and hands tied, tumbles, SCREAMING.  The

      She plummets at high speed, about to pancake, when a BLUR

                                    CLARK
                    What's the other?

                                    LOIS
                          (leading him off)
                    Let's talk about that...



      Lois and Clark walk.

                                    CLARK
                    Look, I don't want to be a hero.

                                    LOIS
                    Really.  Then why did you go after 
                    that gunman this morning?  Why did 
                    you save me just now?

                                    CLARK
                    I help when I can... but I want to
                    live my life.

                                    LOIS
                    Well, that's why you've got your
                    secret identity.

                                    CLARK
                    A what?  A secret what?

                                    LOIS
                    Just go with me on this...

      She pushes him through a doorway.  WE REVEAL it's a ski 
      store, having an off-season sale.

      Lois and Clark emerge with a bag.

                                    LOIS
                    It's not a ski suit -- I mean, it
                    _is_ but it's more than that --
                    it's a symbol, you're making 
                    yourself into a beacon.

                                    CLARK
                    Are you always like this?

                                    LOIS
                    Sorry, I'm a little high-strung.

                                    CLARK
                    Lady, you're a Stradivarius.

                                    LOIS
                          (exasperated)
                    Maybe this'll help.

      She hands him the bag.  He takes it.  She pulls her wallet 
      out of her purse and shows him a picture of Superman.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    That's what I'm talking about.

                                    CLARK
                    That's... what I'm afraid of.

      He flips to another photo:  Lois and Clark.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                    Is that... us?

                                    LOIS
                    Well, it's me and him.

                                    CLARK
                    Are we -- ?

      She shows him the ring.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                    This is just too weird.

      He flips to another picture:  Clark and the Kents.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                    Oh, my God.

      He just stares at them.  Has to sit on a bus bench.  Lois 
      sits with him.

                    They're alive?
                          (she nods; pause)
                    Does he... spend a lot of time with 
                    them?

                                    LOIS
                    Yes.

                                    CLARK
                    That's good.  That's...

      He lets it trail, overwhelmed.

                                    LOIS
                    They're very proud of him.  I bet
                    your parents were, too.

                                    CLARK
                    I guess so.  It was a long time
                    ago.

                                    LOIS
                    What happened?

                                    CLARK
                    Car wreck.  I saw it happen.  I was
                    pretty fast, even then, but... not
                    fast enough.  Lana said I                    (X)
                    shouldn't blame myself.  One man 
                    can't really make a difference... 
                    no matter what kind of powers he 
                    has.

                                    LOIS
                    I know things are different here.
                    I know _you're_ different.  But 
                    trust me... powers or no powers... 
                    one man can change any world.

      He flips back to the picture of Superman.

                                    CLARK
                    His Mom made that, huh?

      Lois is waiting out here alone.  Then she hears him come
      through the door.  She turns.  He stands there, backlit:
      Superman.  He takes her breath away.  She just stares.

                                    SUPERMAN
                          (heads back in)
                    I knew it, I look stupid.

                    No.  No.  You look great.

      She takes his hand and they move to the edge of the deck.

                    I'm sure.
                          (off his hesitation)
                    But you're not.  So why don't we
                    get you comfortable?

                    How?



      We soar.  Superman, with Lois in his arms, swoops into     (X)
      view.  A SONG kicks in.  He and Lois bank out of view.



      Urged on by Lois, Superman flies above the clouds.  Then she
      points down.  He sighs.



      He dives down into the Metropolis skyline.  She gestures for
      him to go lower.  He hesitates.  She whacks his shoulder.
      Reluctantly, he drops out of frame.

      The Cop and the Thug both just stare as Superman walks over

                    He's quite a man, the Clark Kent of

      She nods.  Across the sea of people, Superman and Lois lock

                    cruel to others.
                          (looking at Superman)
                    Even those who would be gods.

      Then Wells and Lois move onto the machine together.  WE PAN
      AWAY, see a FLASH of lights O.S.                           (X)



      The Superman of Our World is just exiting the alley Lois
      disappeared from in the Tease.  He looks utterly defeated.
      Then -- Lois, Wells and the machine materialize.  He       (X)
      whirls.  She jumps off.                                    (X)

      They run to each other and embrace.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Oh, my God, are you all right?

                                    LOIS
                    I'm fine, I'm fine...

                                    SUPERMAN
                    What happened?  You were gone for
                    almost ten seconds.

                                    LOIS
                    Ten seconds?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    The weirdest ten seconds of my 
                    life.  I didn't know where you 
                    were, what to do and then.,..

                                    LOIS
                    What?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    ... I just got this feeling.  Of 
                    what my life would be like if I 
                    lost you.  Surrounded by people,
                    mobbing me, telling me they loved 
                    me but... without you it was... so 
                    lonely.

      They embrace, tight.

                                    SUPERMAN (CONT'D)
                    What happened to you?



      Lois comes out with her wedding papers.  Clark is one step 
      behind, straightening his tie.

                                    LOIS
                    A long story.  I'm just glad to be
                    back.

      A cop car pulls to a stop.  COPS get out and Tempus is 
      pulled from the back in handcuffs.

                                    TEMPUS
                    You bone-headed backward
                    Cro-Magnons!

                                    CLARK
                    Hey, isn't that -- ? Isn't he -- ?

                                    LOIS
                    -- wanted for bank robbery.  In
                    _this_ dimension, anyway.

      Lois gives Tempus a wave.  He glares.

                                    TEMPUS
                    I won't forget this!
                          (to cop)
                    Any of you!  You fools think you
                    can hold me?

      Tempus is led off.

                                    LOIS
                    Clark, about Lana Lang?                      (X)

                                    CLARK
                    Yeah?

                                    LOIS
                    Let's go ahead and invite her.  I
                    think I have a pretty good idea why 
                    it didn't work out between you two...
                          (looks at him tenderly)
                    ... and why it'll _always_ work 
                    with us, no matter how crazy the 
                    world gets.

      They kiss and exit frame.  REVEAL Wells in the crowd,
      observing, a paper cup of tea in his hand.  He checks his 
      watch, smiles and moves off.

                                                    FADE OUT:
