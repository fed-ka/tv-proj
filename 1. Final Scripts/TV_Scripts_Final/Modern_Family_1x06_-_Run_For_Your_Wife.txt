PHIL AND CLAIRE INTERVIEW22

CLAIRE
Getting everybody out the door in the

first day of school.

PHIL
From the moment we get up at seven 
until we drop them off at school, it 
is go, go, go.

PHIL
Honey, are you moving out?

ALEX
Five more years.  A little help here?  

CLAIRE
This is why we suggested the violin.

ALEX
The cello is more in demand in 
university orchestras. 

HALEY
You know what s not in demand?  Girls 
who play in university orchestras.

You are a cutie.  Yes, you are.

Why is our daughter dressed like Donna 
Summer?

We REVEAL that Lily is in a sequined evening gown and Afro 
wig.  Some photography equipment is nearby.

CAMERON
She is not Donna Summer.  She s 
clearly Diana Ross from the RCA years.  
How are you not seeing that?

MITCHELL
I thought you were done with this.

CAMERON
I made no such promise.

CAMERON

need to loosen up and have fun.

MITCHELL
I m loose.  I m fun.  Remember last 
week?  Breakfast for dinner.  That was 
my idea.

You ve been tense ever since we 
brought Lily home.  All you do is put 
child locks on things and read

CLAIRE
I run five miles a day.  I have a 
resting heart rate of forty-eight.  I 
would never lose a two mile race to 
Johnny Ski Pole.  But after seeing the 
look on Phil s face when the kids came 
home from school and then seeing that 
shirt, I realized something.  The 
first day of school is a big 
adjustment for all of us, but it s 
especially hard on Phil.MODERN FAMILY "Run For Your Wife" 8/11/09 Shooting Pink Rev  26.
