Dawn. Venice Beach. On the path along the ocean we FIND... 

ALVEY HENDERSON, mid-forties, average height, average build, 
handsome blunted features, on his morning run. He checks his 
WATCH, accelerates, faster, faster, gets anaerobic, wheezes, 
has to stop. Doubles over. Exhausted.  

ALVEY
Fuck me...

He spots a public RESTROOM --  

CUT TO:



Alvey emerges, pale and clammy. Steadies himself. 

MAN (O.S.)
Excuse me, sir? 

Two Latinos, CARLOS and HECTOR, approach -- early 20 s, gang 
ink, shaved heads, scary.

CARLOS
Can you help us out?  

ALVEY
What s up?

Carlos pulls a PHOTO of a young girl from his wallet. 

CARLOS
It s my baby sister s quincea era 
today. That s her right there.   

Alvey looks at the photo.2.


ALVEY
You two must have your mother s 
forehead. Looks like a nice girl. 
Congratulations. 

CARLOS
She s my angel. I want to get her a 
cake, but it s hard times so we re 
out here trying to raise a few 
bucks.  

ALVEY
Sorry, guys, I don t have any cash. 

Alvey tries to leave, but he s cut off. 

CARLOS
Hold up. You can t give me a couple 
bucks to buy my baby sister a cake? 

ALVEY
I m on a run. I don t have my 
wallet.

CARLOS
Then check your fucking shoes. 

Carlos flashes a KNIFE. Hector circles. Escalating. Alvey 
takes off his shoes and socks. Shakes them out. No money. 

CARLOS (CONT D)
Take your clothes off.

ALVEY
Guys...

CARLOS
I seen dudes in county treat their 
assholes like a FedEx truck. Maybe 
you left a twenty up there and 
forgot about it. Can t hurt to 
look, right?  

No choice. Alvey undresses revealing several tattoos. He 
palms his junk for modesty. Humiliating. 

CARLOS (CONT D)
White boy s inked up. 

Carlos traces  LISA  inked on Alvey s pec with the knife.    

CARLOS (CONT D)
Yo, snowflake fucked up and got a 
bitch stamp.  Lisa.  
(MORE)3.

CARLOS (CONT D)
(then)
Bitches come and go, man.  

Carlos pulls off his shirt -- heavy gang/prison ink --  BROWN 
PRIDE  letters his entire chest.

CARLOS (CONT D)
(re: Brown Pride)
But this shit s forever. And you re 
in the wrong neighborhood.  

Carlos holds the blade to Alvey s throat.  

CARLOS (CONT D)
Now the three of us are gonna go 
back to your house and get that 
wallet. Then you can introduce us 
to  Lisa.  

CRACK! Alvey snaps a headbutt -- explodes Carlos s nose. Then 
nails Hector with a back-kick to the gut. Hector crumples, 
wheezing for breath.

Carlos lunges but Alvey shoots low, gathers his legs and 
slams him to the pavement. The knife skitters away. Alvey 
controls him, puts him on his back, mounts, left hand pins 
him by the neck while the right beats him to a bloody pulp 
THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD, followed by nasty elbows. 
Carlos goes limp.  

Fast, brutal, beautiful.  

Alvey stands up, out of breath, still buck naked, surveys the 
carnage. Hector crawls for air. Carlos moans through blood-
bubbles.    

Alvey puts on his clothes, scans for witnesses, then jogs off 
down the beach with the rising sun as we SMASH TO TITLES:



A gritty storefront gym in Venice. SIGN: Navy Street Mixed 
Martial Arts. 

LISA HENDERSON, 27, natural California stunner, toned Type A, 
exits the gym trailed by three BEAUTIES (early 20 s) in 
sports bras and spandex -- bored shitless.  

LISA
I want fliers in every business, 
coffee shop, bar and car from here 
to Hollywood. 4.


She grabs a BOX of FLIERS from her PRIUS. Unpacks them. 

FLIER: A glossy promo for Navy Street MMA with a photo of 
smiling Alvey. 

LISA (CONT D)
Lindsay, you have Venice. Madison s 
got Santa Monica to Westwood and 
Carmen you have Hollywood. Start at 
Runyon Canyon and work your way 
back.

CARMEN
(whiny)
Dog shit park. Awesome.  

LISA
Hey. Tits up, Carmen. And remember 
the pitch.   

Lisa offers Carmen the flier. Shows her how it s done.

LISA (CONT D)
Hi, I m Lisa. Would you like to try 
a free week at Navy Street MMA? We 
offer Brazilian Jiujitsu, wrestling 
and Muay Thai boxing. It s an 
amazing workout, you ll get to 
train with Mixed Martial Arts 
legend Alvey Henderson and if you 
come to Navy Street MMA, you just 
might get to fuck a girl like me 
one day.  

Alvey pulls up on his old DUCATI. Parks behind the Prius.  

ALVEY
Good morning, ladies.     

The girls grab stacks of fliers. Alvey takes one. Lisa 
notices his scuffed hand from the fight.  

LISA
What happened to your hand? 

ALVEY
Hurt it running. 

LISA
How? 

ALVEY
That s not the flier, is it? 5.


LISA
Yes. 

ALVEY
No, Lisa, I hate this picture. You 
know that. 

LISA
It s cute. 

ALVEY
I thought we were using the other 
one. 

LISA
You mean the one where you re 
glaring at the camera with your 
cheeks sucked in?

ALVEY
It s better than this. This -- I 
look like a motivational speaker. 
Or a dentist. And what s all that 
neck shit? Do I look like that? 

Alvey juts his chin. Tightens his loosening neck-skin.

LISA
Are you asking me if you look like 
a picture of yourself?  

Alvey studies the picture. The sad truth.  

ALVEY
What happened to me? I m a monster.  

LISA
(off his vanity)
God, you re like a teenage girl.

He drops the flier, kisses her good morning. 

ALVEY
Is Nate here? 

LISA
He s taping up. 



Ryan and Nate stop outside the front door. 

NATE
So, are you back now or what? 

RYAN
Maybe. I don t know.  

NATE
My wrestling needs some work. 

RYAN
Your dad and I are talking. We ll 
work it out. I ll get you tuned up. 

NATE
That d be cool. 

Ryan clocks a BUS pulling up across the street. 

RYAN
Shit. I gotta get back to 
Huntington. We ll hit it tomorrow. 

Another hug. Then as he s running across the street.

RYAN (CONT D)
Seriously, bro, put on your big boy 
shorts. We re gonna work. 
(then)
Hey, and give your brother a shout. 
Tell m I ll call him. 

Nate nods, then watches his one-time idol board a bus. As the 
bus lurches away, Nate pulls on his hat and we --

CUT TO:19.



Nate, Vans, skull-cap, HEADPHONES, glides through the streets 
of Venice on a LONG-BOARD passing, bars, liquor stores, 
marijuana pharmacies, taco stands, SURFERS, GANG-BANGERS -- 
ghetto on the beach.

Nate skates on, impassive, quiet, serious, self-contained, 
calcified rage, a killer in the cage.  

He veers down a low-rent residential street... 



CHUI, 30, skate rat, stoned on a shitty COUCH on the front 
porch of a small run down BUNGALOW. SURFBOARDS and 
SKATEBOARDS lean against the house... MUSIC blares from a 
party inside. Chui fires a GLASS BONG. Monster hit. 

Nate rolls up... 

CHUI
(holding it in)
Sup, Nate?  

NATE
My brother here? 

Chui exhales a think plume.  

CHUI
Inside somewhere.
(then)
Oh, dude. I m probably bringing 
that chick to your fight. 

NATE
What chick?

CHUI
Rina s cousin from Torrance, chunky 
one, kind of looks like a... kinda 
like a cartoon deer but... without 
any fur...obviously.  

Nate notices a scrap of PAPER on the ground. Picks it up.

PAPER: RENT??? LATE AGAIN!! LAST CHANCE!!!

CHUI (CONT D)
She s way hotter than she sounds. 
But, so, can you put her on the 
list? 20.


Nate ignores, folds the paper in his pocket, walks inside.   



Alvey joins Lisa on the beach-front patio.    

ALVEY
Yes. The fact that he used to fuck 
you does give me pause. But we re 
solid. I trust you.  

LISA
I thought we put this to bed, 
Alvey. 

ALVEY
We did. I m fine. 

LISA
Bullshit. You feel guilty. That s 
what this is. 

ALVEY
Hell yeah I feel guilty. We got 
together while he was in prison. I 
stole you, and I m glad I did but, 
how am I supposed to feel good 
about it?  

LISA
You stole me? What am I, a fucking 
bicycle?   

ALVEY
That s not what I meant, but that s 
what happened.  

LISA
Your ego is just fucking beautiful. 
And huge. And dumb as a fucking 
manatee.   

ALVEY
Thanks, honey.

LISA
How many times do I have to beat 
this into your head? I didn t leave 
Ryan for you. I left him for me. 
He s toxic waste. He uses people 
until there s nothing left to use 
and then he moves on. Have you 
forgotten what he did to you?  

ALVEY
It s the past. Let it go. 24.


LISA
You got him to the UFC then he left 
your ass for Albuquerque as soon as 
Greg Jackson batted his eyelashes. 
Self-absorbed little star-fucker 
dropped you like a bad habit. 

ALVEY
He messed up. He knows that now. 

LISA
He doesn t care. He doesn t care. 
You don t know him like I do.

Lisa takes a drag. Alvey knows she s right but...  

ALVEY
He s good for the gym. 

LISA
Alvey.

ALVEY
You know how it works, Lisa. A 
gym s only as good as its fighters. 
Few years ago, it was Militich out 
in Iowa. Now it s all about Jackson 
-- he s got St. Pierre, Jon Jones. 
If I want to be relevant, I need a 
star in my camp.   

LISA
You have Nate. 

ALVEY
And Nate s special but, unless he 
wins Long Beach, he s just a 
prospect. Ryan is a star. Three-
time All-American, UFC champ, and 
he s only 29 years old -- there s a 
lot of fights left in him. 

LISA
Does he even want to fight again? 

That little problem. Alvey s working on it.

ALVEY
He will. 
(beat)
Fighters love him. They find out 
he s in my camp they ll be knocking 
down the door to train. 25.


Lisa doesn t like the logic.   

ALVEY (CONT D)
You see the books just like I do. 
Financially, we re hanging by a 
thread. Guys like Ryan don t come 
around everyday. I can t turn him 
away.   

A beat. Lisa takes one last drag.  

LISA
It s a mistake.   

Lisa puts out her cigarette and goes inside. Off Alvey...

LATINO MAN (PRE-LAP)
(flat-line monotone)
The behaviors that precede an 
addict s relapse follow a standard 
pattern.



Ryan pours coffee at the refreshment cart. Michael, the 
heckler, approaches with two of his BOYS (20 s, hard). He s 
got a pair of BAG-GLOVES from the rec-area (both righthands -- 
one blue, one red). 

MICHAEL
Yo, I hear you re like a fighter or 
some shit? 

Ryan tries not to engage. 

RYAN
That was a while ago.  

MICHAEL
Must ve been.  Cause now you don t 
look like shit.  

Others sniff conflict and gather, including an ex-con turned 
security guard, RODDY (40 s, bald, old prison ink). 

RYAN
I m gonna head inside. 

Michael stops him. Shoves a gloves in his chest.  

MICHAEL
Hundred bucks says I hit harder 
than you. 27.


RYAN
I don t have a hundred bucks. 

MICHAEL
(baiting)
Then you better win.

RYAN
We ll both get written up, man. 
It s not worth it. 

MICHAEL
Roddy, you cool with this? 

RODDY
Long as y all both agree, I m cool. 
Shit, I wanna see it.  

Michael looks back to Ryan. 

MICHAEL
We re all good, homie. I ll even 
let you go first. 

A beat, then Ryan pulls on the glove. It s on. They square up 
-- Michael s got four inches and forty pounds on Ryan.  

MICHAEL (CONT D)
Anytime, motherfu --

THWACK! Ryan crushes him across the face. Michael stiffens 
and hits the refreshment table -- out on his feet. The crowd 
goes wild with HOWLS and  Oh Shits!    

Ryan takes off his glove. Gives a little NOD to Javy. Javy 
nods back. Ryan takes his coffee and walks inside. 



The backyard is half beer garden, half MMA gym: A SPARRING 
DUMMY, HEAVY BAG, TRUCK TIRE, SLEDGEHAMMER, mingled with 
EMPTY BEER CANS, LIQUOR BOTTLES and a BONG.

Jay grills a steak for himself, skinless chicken for Nate. 
Nate sits at the patio table watching Youtube highlights of 
his upcoming opponent, CLAY WALKER on his laptop. The 
overwhelming power and speed concerns Nate.   

NATE
Walker s got heavy hands. 28.


JAY
That s all he s got. It s his whole 
game. 

NATE
I don t know, he s been in 
Albuquerque --

JAY
Same motherfucker, bro.  

Jay sits with the food. Takes a bite of steak. Nate keeps 
watching the computer, anxiety grows. Jay shuts the laptop. 

JAY (CONT D)
It s a highlight reel. They re not 
gonna show you the times he got his 
ass whipped.  

NATE
He s won seven in a row. 

JAY
Against fucking nobody. Yeah, he ll 
come out throwing bombs, and you ll 
eat a few, but then you ll gobble 
that shit up and when he sees 
you re still standing there, BOOM --
he ll break. Smash his game. That s 
how I beat his ass, and that s how 
you will too. 

NATE
Three years ago. 

JAY
Same motherfucker, bro. 

Jay eats. Nate pulls the late rent NOTE from his pocket.  

NATE
This was on the porch.

Jay, stops eating, forgot about the note.  

NATE (CONT D)
You said you paid the rent.  

JAY
(downplays)
Couple hundred short. He s 
trippin . Don t worry about it.

Jay tosses the note on the grill, digs into steak.  29.


NATE
What happened to the money from my 
last fight?

JAY
It s gone. 

NATE
Where d it go? 

JAY
Rent, bills, supplements, shit s 
expensive -- 

NATE
Do we even have any money? 

JAY
Yes, we do.  

NATE
Seems like we re always short. 

JAY
Nate, we re fine. I m eating a 
fucking steak right now. Come on. 

Nate s not convinced. 

JAY (CONT D)
Hey, haven t I always taken care of 
you? Huh?   

NATE
Yeah... 

JAY
Yeah, thank you. I don t recall us 
ever sleeping on the beach, right? 

Nate nods. 

JAY (CONT D)
Focus on the fight. That s all you 
should be thinking about.  

Jay knows best. Nate let s it drop. Eats his chicken.   

JAY (CONT D)
You wanna spar tomorrow? 

NATE
Dad doesn t want you at the gym.30.


JAY
You got a key, right? 

Off Nate, wary...



A Mexican house party in full swing. Latin hip hop THUMPS. 

Hector (one of the bangers that jumped Alvey in the teaser) 
is on the front porch getting fucked up with FRIENDS. Despite 
the black eye Alvey gave him, he s having a nice evening.   

CAMERA FINDS a BLACK IMPALA parked on the street out front. 



Alvey and Ryan walk and talk toward the gym. TRAINING BAGS 
over shoulders and COFFEES in hand. 

ALVEY
Finish up the cardio, then I want 
you and Nate to roll for a half-
hour or so -- see where he s at.  

RYAN
I can show him a few things that ll 
keep Walker s hands off him. 

ALVEY
But don t overwhelm him. He s 
comfortable with the game plan. I 
don t want you throwing the kitchen 
sink at him. 

RYAN
I ll keep it simple. 

They walk a bit more, then Alvey stops him.  

ALVEY
I gotcha something. 

Alvey pulls a worn BOOK from his bag and hands it to Ryan.  

RYAN
(reading the cover)
The Screwtape Letters. 32.


ALVEY
It s about this old demon, 
Screwtape, who writes these letters 
to this young up-and-coming demon 
called Wormwood, basically telling 
how to tempt people and lead them 
away from God. It s actually funny 
as shit. 

RYAN
I m not a big Christian. 

ALVEY
Shit, you know I m a heathen. I got 
this book from a retired old whore 
in a San Pedro bar. 

Ryan laughs.

ALVEY (CONT D)
You know it s bad when retired 
whores are trying to give you 
books.
(then)
I m not preaching. But it does help 
to know who you re fighting.  
(then)
Anyway, read it or don t. It calmed 
me down so I m passing it on. That 
and the Lexapro. They should put 
that shit in the water. Solve a lot 
of problems.  

Ryan puts the book in his bag. 

RYAN
Appreciate it. I ll give it a look. 

They continue around the corner to find Lisa, stressed and 
smoking, in front of the gym. 

ALVEY
This can t be good.
(reaching Lisa)
What s wrong? 

LISA
Don t freak out. 

Alvey hears MUSIC from inside.

ALVEY
(darkens)
Son of a bitch. 33.


Alvey slams inside. 



Lisa smokes, frayed from the blowup. Ryan practices wrapping 
his wrists, struggles. There s a lot of history here -- 
fucking, fighting, loving, crying. Finally...     

RYAN
You and Alvey...   

Lisa smokes, won t engage. Ryan unwraps and starts over -- 
knows it s driving her crazy.

RYAN (CONT D)
How long s that been going on?  

LISA
Two years -- are you fucking 
kidding me? 

RYAN
Easy. I m not trying to start 
anything. 
(beat)
I m happy for you guys. I love 
Alvey. 35.


LISA
So do I.  

RYAN
I can see that. 

LISA
And I don t know what he promised, 
but we can t afford to pay you. 

RYAN
That s fine.  

LISA
So what are you gonna do? You gonna 
get a real job? 

RYAN
Yes, I am. I have to. 

LISA
Doing what? 

RYAN
I don t know yet, Lisa, I m still 
trying to learn the fucking bus.  

He s fallen far. Lisa lays off a bit. Ryan finishes wrapping 
his wrist -- it looks terrible.

LISA
(softening)
You re doing it wrong. Here. Give 
it. 

Lisa unwraps him to start over...   

LISA (CONT D)
Professional fighter and you can t 
even wrap your own wrists. 

RYAN
Always had somebody do it for me. 

LISA
Maybe that s your problem. 

Ryan smiles as she takes his hands. 

LISA (CONT D)
Palms up.

She turns his hands over revealing several RAZED SCARS ON 
BOTH HIS WRISTS -- an obvious suicide attempt.36.


LISA (CONT D)
(reflexive)
Holy shit. 

She looks up at Ryan. A beat. She hands him the wraps. 

LISA (CONT D)
(gestures inside)
I should check on them. Come back 
tomorrow if you want.  

Ryan picks up his bag and heads across the street.  

LISA (CONT D)
(calling out)
Ryan. 

He turns. 

LISA (CONT D)
Don t fuck with my life. 

RYAN
That s not me anymore. You ll see.

Lisa heads inside.    



Nate runs out, Casey trailing, to find...

Jay, buck naked with a GUN, pumping rounds into the SPARRING 
DUMMY. POP! POP! POP! A one-man firing squad.  

NATE
Jay! Stop it! 

Jay keeps going. POP! POP! POP! Nate springs. Puts him in a 
rear-naked choke. Jay drops the gun. 

NATE (CONT D)
(to Casey)
Get the gun!

She snatches it up. Nate drags his brother to the ground. 
Jay s about to pass out. Finally, taps his brother s arm. 
Nate lets him go. A beat, as they both catch their breath. 

NATE (CONT D)
What s wrong with you? 

JAY
(re: the dummy)
He was looking at me funny. 

Jay, stoned to hell, bursts into laughter. Nate s had enough. 
Gets up to leave.  

JAY (CONT D)
Come on! It s funny. It s a dummy. 
We ve been brutalizing that rubber 
idiot for years. I m putting him 
out of his misery.   

The scales lift from Nate s eyes. Sees his brother for what 
he is: a cackling junkie. The sad truth.    

NATE
I m going to dad s. 

JAY
Nate, come on. Nate. Nate! 

But Nate s gone. Jay looks up at Casey. Shrugs and gives a 
half-hearted laugh. Off Jay, naked on the ground...  38.



SERIES OF SHOTS: Ryan and Jay surfing. Carving waves. 
Graceful, aggressive, smooth, peaceful. Been doing this their 
whole lives and they re very good.   

CUT TO:



Jay and Ryan sit in the back of the Jay s TRUCK overlooking 
the beach. Jay drinks a beer, smokes a joint.

JAY
(big exhale)
... he s a fucking hypocrite. 
Nobody put more shit up his nose 
than my dad. He d eat the asshole 
out of a mule if he thought it d 
get him high. Now he s coming at 
Nate saying,  I m your dad, I ll 
look out for you?  Bullshit, where 
the fuck s he been? I ve been 
raising Nate since I was fifteen. 

RYAN
He made mistakes but at least he s 
trying now. 

JAY
That s what s so funny. Now he s 
got his pills and his shrink and 
he s like a fucking preacher 
telling everyone what to do. Of 
course he never apologizes for 
anything. Not my mom or anything.  

RYAN
Your mom s ill, Jay. That s not 
your dad s fault. 

JAY
Because he fucked with her head. 
Disappearing with other bitches. 
Treating her like shit. I watched 
it happen. She wasn t like that 
when we were little.
(then)
(MORE)45.

JAY (CONT'D)
And why are you defending him? If I 
was you, I d fuck his ass up, 
stealing my girl while I m locked 
down, jerking off into a sock and 
shit.  

RYAN
I put myself in prison.

JAY
Still. That s fucked up. Lisa s 
dope. 

Jay hits his joint and smiles. Little shit-stirrer.  

RYAN
You have no idea how small your 
world can become. One day you ll 
wake up and find you re the only 
one left.   

JAY
I love my world. 
(gestures to the ocean)
Look at this. I do whatever I want, 
whenever I want, to whoever I want. 
My world s the shit, bro.   

RYAN
When was the last time you fought? 

JAY
I don t know.

RYAN
Two years is what your dad said.

JAY
Fine, two years, who gives a shit? 

RYAN
You understand what little respect 
you have left disappears every day 
you don t fight?  Whatever happened 
to Jay Henderson?   Who the fuck 
cares?  Bro, you don t do anything 
else. You didn t go to school. You 
don t have a job. The one thing 
you re good at is fighting. And you 
don t even do that. The only thing 
you do is alienate anybody that s 
ever made the mistake of giving a 
shit about your skinny ass. 46.


Jay takes a hit. Always deflecting. Puts out the joint. Makes 
a big show of it.  

JAY
Well. You have ruined a beautiful 
day. Were you raped in prison? 
Because somebody sure fucked the 
fun out of you.  

RYAN
You re an angry kid. So was I. But 
don t isolate yourself the way I 
did.   

JAY
I should be so lucky. You re  The 
Destroyer.  King of the shit. 
Everybody wants to be Ryan Revis.   

RYAN
And now I live in a shitbox with a 
roommate who s on probation for 
sucking dick behind an Albertson s 
for a rock of meth. And that dude s 
not even gay. 

JAY
(laughing)
Dude, I don t need to know.

RYAN
I can t even go to your brother s 
fight because I got a curfew. 
(telling him)
But you re gonna be there. 

Jay looks away. 

RYAN (CONT D)
Jay, seriously, don t break your 
brother s heart --  

JAY
It s not about Nate. He knows that. 

RYAN
Yes, it is. He s the one in the 
cage. 

A beat. Jay shakes his head. Whatever. Takes a long pull off 
his beer. Ryan snatches the can, throws it in the parking 
lot. Jay backs down. Knows better than to challenge him.  47.


RYAN (CONT D)
Keep your shit together. You gotta 
drive me back to rehab.   

Ryan hops out of the back. Off Jay -- 

CUT TO:



Fight Night. KLIEG LIGHTS. TOWN CARS pulling up. FANS stream 
inside.  



Jay creeps down a sleazy Los Angeles street. Red Light 
District without all the light. 

He finds what he s looking for. Pulls up to a couple HOOKERS 
(40 s). He rolls down the window as one of the women, 
CHRISTINA, approaches, scans the street for cops.  

CHRISTINA
(not looking at him, 
scanning)
You want company? 

Jay can t answer. 54.


CHRISTINA (CONT D)
Yes or no? You re gonna get me in 
trouble.  

Jay looks up at her. 

JAY
Mom. It s me. 

She finally looks at his face. Her big troubled eyes light 
up. 

CHRISTINA
Jay!  Hey, baby! 

JAY
Get in. 

She looks away. Steps backs a little. He knew she wouldn t 
come. Still kills him. 

CHRISTINA
(smiling)
It s good to see you, baby. 

Jay hands her the cash from pawning the computer. 

JAY
Get some food. Love you. 

She takes the money. Nothing else to say. He pulls away.  

Christina watches as his tail lights fade around the corner. 



Nate steps out into the Venice sun. IPOD in his ears, he hops 
on his board and...  

We go WIDE as he weaves S s down Navy Street. Peace in 
Venice.

ANGLE ON the BLACK IMPALA COMING FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. 

The Impala suddenly accelerates and VEERS INTO NATE... Nate 
hits the windshield, rolls over the top of the car and lands 
hard in the middle of the street.  

Carlos, TIRE IRON in hand and Hector, ALUMINUM BAT, jump out. 
Both wear masks. Nate tries to crawl away but Hector SMASHES 
his legs CRACK, CRACK, CRACK, relentless. Carlos pushes 
Hector away and rolls Nate onto his back. Stands over Nate. 
Lifts his mask. Recalls Alvey s words... 

CARLOS
Must have your mother s forehead. 

He smashes Nate s face with the tire iron. Nate s out, blood 
pools around his head. 

CARLOS (CONT D)
Tell your dad what s up. 

Carlos spits in his face. 

CARLOS (CONT D)
Punk ass little bitch. 59.


Hector drags him back to the Impala and they tear off.
