      We PUSH past the putting greens, past the perfectly-manicured 
      grounds, past the monied MEMBERS and GUESTS mingling on the 
      patio under a banner that reads --  ANNUAL LABOR DAY BARBECUE. 

      This is Firmwood, an exclusive country club located amongst 
      the monied estates of Westchester, New York, just north of 
      New York City, where many of our most successful CEOS -- and 
      CEOs to-be -- live, work and play.

      Amidst the snippets of dialogue --  No, the insider trading 
      charges were dropped,   She was a wonderful nanny until she 
      was deported,   I have the X3 and the X5.  One day I hope to 
      get the X7.  -- we HEAR something slightly more interesting -- 
      the SOUNDS of SEX.  And we re --


      James emerges, still reeling from the turn of events.  He s 
      met by STACEY, 35, his beautiful, sympathetic wife.

                                  STACEY
                    There you are.  The guys were 
                    looking for you.

      James nods.  Stacey notes his preoccupation.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                          (concerned)
                    Hey, are you okay?  What did he 
                    want?

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                      Oh...nothing.  You know, work 
                    stuff.

                                  STACEY
                          (skeptical)
                     Work stuff?   Today?

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah, you know.  SEC poking around. 
                    Quarterly reports.  All that.
                          (off her look)
                      Listen...I m just gonna go find the 
                    guys.  And then I ll meet you and 
                    the kids for smores, okay?                                                                                      8.



      Stacey nods.  James gives her a kiss.  As he walks away, he 
      turns back to her -- 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    That dress still kills me, by the 
                    way.

      James exits.  Stacey watches him go, thinks.


      AN OVERTURNED GOLF CART spins its wheels, as nearby a SMALL 
      CROWD huddles around a STRICKEN MAN.

      James pushes through the crowd to see that the downed man is 
        none-other-than...the CEO who just fired him.                                                                                      9.



                                  JAMES
                          (exclaims)
                    OhmyGod.  My boss!

      Meanwhile Brody, just OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE of ONLOOKERS, looks 
      down to see an EMPTY PLATE and SHRIMP strewn across the 
      putting green.

                                  BRODY
                    OhmyGod.  My shrimp!

      Brody scurries to start collecting his wife s shrimp as James 
      pushes to his boss  side, loosens his shirt and presses his 
      fingers against his neck to check for a pulse. 

      But there s nothing. The impact of the crash has rendered the 
      CEO unconscious.  James turns to a CLUB WORKER.

                                  JAMES
                          (aloud)
                    Call 9-1-1.

      James tears open Walter s jacket -- the black JEWELRY CASE 
      falls out of the inner breast pocket.  He pulls open his 
      shirt, pounds on his chest and begins administering CPR.  

      As the onlookers -- including Karl and Duncan -- watch, James 
      furiously tries to breath life into the CEO.  But it s no 
      use.  James once again checks for a pulse.  But...nothing.  
      The CEO is, well, dead.

      James looks up at his friends with a grave look in his eyes.  
      Then, to the Club Worker...

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You can forget 9-1-1.  

      James exhales.  He takes off his jacket and gently lays it 
      over Walter s face.  And just then, Brody -- with his plate 
      of reclaimed shrimp -- sidles next to James.

                                  BRODY
                          (sotto)
                    I think things are suddenly looking 
                    up for you, huh, James?

      As Brody smiles at an unsure James, we...SMASH TO:

      MAIN TITLE CARD.

      We DISSOLVE to BLACK and then FADE UP ON --                                                                                    10.




      Brody runs on his treadmill, talks on his speaker-phone.

                                  BRODY
                    Maybe they should have had a sign.  
                     CAUTION: CEO CROSSING. 


      The guys are golfing.  Karl -- complete with a fanny-pack 
      around his middle -- tees off.  Brody and James stand nearby 
      in the khakis and golf shirts.  Leaning on their drivers, as 
      they await their turns.

                                  JAMES
                    So not only am I still employed, 
                    but they ve decided to promote from 
                    within.  They re interviewing every 
                      upper-level exec for the CEO s job.  
                    Including me.

      Karl slices the ball unsettling close to the other guys.  
      They duck for cover.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Jesus, Karl.  What end of the club 
                    are you using?

                                  KARL
                    Sorry.  My instructor says that 
                    sometimes I break my wrists too 
                    soon.

                                  BRODY
                    No, Tiger Woods sometimes breaks 
                    his wrists too soon.  You just 
                    suck.

      James laughs.  Karl takes another ball out of his fanny pack 
      and tees it up.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    You re gonna get it, aren t you?
                          (off James  unsure look)
                    You re gonna be a CEO at 35.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    And I ll still be a senior VP.  And 
                    I ll be honest with you -- that s 
                    gonna be a real blow to my self-
                    esteem.  So you know what?  As a 
                      friend...I d appreciate if you tank 
                    the interview.  For me.

      James laughs.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (stares at him)
                    What part of that do you think 
                    wasn t serious?

      Just then, Duncan flies up in a golf cart.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (to Duncan)
                    You re late.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (serious)
                    I got trouble.


      The cart is parked at the mid-way break.  The guys sit at a 
      secluded table, as Duncan recounts his troubles.

                                  JAMES
                    Wait a second.  I thought you said 
                    you were arrested for a DWI.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (shakes his head)
                    No.  That was just my cover.  For 
                    why I needed bail money.

                                  KARL
                          (hurt)
                    You lied to us?

                                  BRODY
                    Karl, we re guys.  If it involves 
                    sex, money or a pending criminal 
                      proceeding...we re allowed to lie.

                                  JAMES 
                          (to Duncan)
                    So I don t get it...then what 
                    happened in Roscoe, New York?

      Duncan exhales, as the guys await his explanation.                                                                                    18.



                                  DUNCAN
                    I was coming home from a hunting 
                    trip...

                                  BRODY
                    You don t hunt!

                                  DUNCAN
                          (edgy)
                    Fine, I was antiquing.  Can we 
                    stick to the subject here?

      The guys nod.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    I was getting tired, so I pulled 
                    into a rest stop for some coffee.  
                    To keep me awake for the drive 
                    home.  There was a woman there.  
                    Dark and beautiful.  She smiled at 
                    me and we began to talk...

                                  JAMES
                    Don t tell me.  She was a pro.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (nods)
                    I was lonely.  And one thing led to 
                    another and before I knew it, we 
                    were in a men s room stall for a 
                    little business transaction.

                                  BRODY
                          (blanches)
                    Why do I feel dirty?

                                  DUNCAN
                    But in the midst of our... 
                      transaction, a State Trooper 
                    stumbled in.  Arrested both of us.

      Brody looks at Duncan.

                                  BRODY
                    Okay, so you got pinched for 
                      solicitation.  Maybe not something 
                    you want on the resume, but it 
                    could have been a lot worse --

                                  DUNCAN
                    Let me finish.

      The guys look at him expectantly.                                                                                    19.



                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    This dark, beautiful woman.  
                      Well...she was full of surprises.  
                    And probably the biggest surprise 
                    was, well...her penis.

      The guys all let out spontaneous  eeewwws. 

                                  BRODY
                          (repulsed)
                    You got a hummer from a 
                      transvestite hooker?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (defensively)
                    I told you, I didn t know.  How do 
                    you think I felt?  I mean, you 
                    should have seen her.  Every inch 
                    of her was woman.

                                  BRODY
                    Except the eight-and-a-half between 
                    her legs.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (bristles)
                    Nice.  Very supportive...

                                  BRODY
                    No...just personal preference.  
                    When it comes to chicks, I m not 
                    what you call a  penis man.   I 
                    like my ladies sans shvantz, if you 
                    know what I mean.

      James steps in.

                                  JAMES
                    Look, let s focus here.  If this 
                      journalist gets corroboration...it 
                    could sink RevNet s stock price.  
                    Not to mention cost Duncan his job.

                                  BRODY
                          (getting on board)
                    Alright, well you ve come to the 
                    right guy.  This is what crisis 
                      management is all about.  So...did 
                    you pull the arrest report?                                                                                    20.



                                  DUNCAN
                    Of course.  And I greased the palms 
                    of every state trooper in a ten-
                    mile radius.  So they wouldn t 
                    talk...

                                  BRODY
                    Good.  That s good.

                                  KARL
                    First year law school -- if there s 
                    no corroborating witness, then it s 
                    all hearsay until someone gets a 
                    hold of the tranny.

                                  BRODY
                    Exactly.  Which is why you need to 
                    get to him -- or her -- first.  And 
                    figure out a way to keep her -- or 
                    him -- quiet.  And you re home free.  
                    This reporter can t touch you.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (a mission statement)
                    Track down the tranny.

                                  BRODY
                          (concurs)
                    Track down the tranny.

      CLOSE ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE CEO IN TRANQUIL REPOSE.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he s in his coffin and we re --


      Brody s S-Class pulls off the service road and into the rest 
      stop adjacent to the New York State Thruway.  When the car 
      slows to a stop, Duncan and Brody emerge.

                                  BRODY
                    Classy spot.  I can see how those 
                    vending machines might really put a 
                    guy in the mood.

      The guys peer around.  Looking for the tranny.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                          (to Duncan, re: the 
                            tranny)
                    So you re sure she s going to be 
                    here?

                                  DUNCAN
                      I remember she told me this was her 
                    regular spot.  That her pimp had 
                    just promoted her.

                                  BRODY
                    She got promoted to this?  Where 
                    was she working before, a 
                      slaughterhouse?
                          (beat)
                    By the way, you never told me her 
                    name...

                                  DUNCAN
                      Dontrelle.

      Brody stops, looks incredulously at Duncan.                                                                                    30.


                                  BRODY
                          (stunned)
                    You hooked up with someone named 
                    Dontrelle and you didn t think it 
                    MIGHT be a dude?  He sounds like a 
                    middle linebacker.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (defensively)
                    She said  Dontrelle  was a family 
                    name.  Besides, I told you it was 
                    dark.

                                  BRODY
                    Yeah.  Because Dontrelle probably 
                    went 6 4 , 220 and blocked out the 
                    sun.

      Duncan chooses not to respond.  Then he spots a PROSTITUTE 
      loitering by the vending machines.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hold on.  There s someone...

      Brody and Duncan approach the hooker.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Hey...

                                  HOOKER
                    Hey, yourself.  You boys looking 
                    for a good time?

                                  BRODY
                    No.  I m married. I m done with 
                    good times.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Actually, we re looking for 
                      Dontrelle.

                                  HOOKER
                    Dontrelle doesn t work Exit 47 
                    anymore.

                                  BRODY
                    Another promotion perhaps.

      Duncan shoots Brody a look.  Not helping.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (to the Hooker)
                    Do you know where I could find, um, 
                    her?                                                                                    31.



                                  HOOKER
                      No...sorry.  Can t help you.

      Duncan pulls out his bill-fold and peels off a couple of 
      TWENTIES.  He hands them to the hooker.

                                  HOOKER (CONT D)
                    You know, now that I think about 
                    it, I might be able to track 
                    Dontrelle down through an old john 
                    I know.

      Duncan jots his phone number on a piece of paper and hands it 
      to the hooker.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Tell her to call me at that number.  
                    And tell her it s important.

                                  HOOKER
                    She was that good, huh?

                                  BRODY
                    Let s just say -- when it comes to 
                    sex, she s the man.

      As Duncan shakes his head, we re --



      James sits alone on his back porch, overlooking his pool and 
      spacious backyard.  He nurses a beer and thinks.  After a 
      moment, Stacey emerges.

                                  STACEY
                    The kids are asleep.  Florie said 
                    they were angels.

      James says nothing.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                    I m pretty tired myself.  I think 
                    I m going to head up and --

                                  JAMES
                          (interrupting)
                    The first time I saw you.  Freshman 
                    year at Madison.  Econ 101.  

                                  STACEY
                          (laughs unsurely)
                    What s this about?                                                                                    32.



                                  JAMES
                            (continuing)
                    You walked in -- I was already 
                    there, of course, because I arrived 
                      everywhere 15 minutes early 
                    freshman year -- and I thought to 
                    myself that if I could sit across 
                    from that girl and have a cup of 
                      coffee...that my life would be 
                    perfect.

                                  STACEY
                    You got more than a cup of coffee.

                                  JAMES
                    I know.  But my life isn t perfect.

      Stacey looks at him unsurely.

                                  STACEY
                    What s wrong?  Are you nervous 
                    about your interview tomorrow?

                                  JAMES
                    No, I was just thinking about 
                    seeing you that first time.  And 
                    wondering if my boss felt the same 
                    way.  The first time he saw you.

      Stacey stares at him.  But does her best to betray nothing.

                                  STACEY
                    What are you talking about?

                                  JAMES
                    You...you were sleeping with him.  
                    He gave you that necklace before he 
                    died, didn t he? 

      Stacey reflexively clutches at her necklace.

                                  STACEY
                    Jamey...

                                  JAMES
                    Don t call me that, okay?  Don t 
                    talk to me like you love me.

                                  STACEY
                    But I do love you...                                                                                    33.



                                  JAMES
                    Answer me.  Were you having an 
                    affair with him?  And I ll respect 
                    you a helluva lot more if you tell 
                    me the truth.
                          (beat, then forceful)
                    Stacey.  Answer me!

      A long beat, then...

                                  STACEY
                    Yes.

      James nods.  His worst fears confirmed.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                          (gently)
                    At least you can t say I m a liar.

                                  JAMES
                    No, I am. Because I don t respect 
                    you one bit.

      James walks past her.  As he does, she clutches at his arm.  
      But he pulls away.

                                  STACEY
                    Wait.  Where are you going?  Jamey?  
                    Let s talk about this.  James... 
                    don t walk out on me.

      He stops, stares at her.

                                  JAMES
                    I may be leaving.  But I m not the 
                    one who walked out.

      James walks past her and down the driveway.

                                  STACEY 
                          (calling after him)
                    James.  Wait.  James!

      We HEAR his car start and peel off.  He s gone.  As tears run 
      down Stacey s face, we SMASH TO BLACK.

                                      ACT THREE


      CLOSE ON A FRAMED PICTURE OF JAMES AND STACEY.  Happy, 
      carefree.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL James sitting at his desk.  He looks every 
      bit the man whose whole world has been turned upside down. 
      Barely slept.  Unshaven, no tie.  Although a few tie options 
      rest on his desk.  He can t help but stare at the picture.

      Just then, Katie enters.  Stylish and confident in her sleek 
      Prada suit.  She takes him in.

                                  KATIE
                    Jesus... look at you.  I can t 
                    believe I need to tell you this, 
                    but today s the wrong day not to 
                    bring your  A-game. 

                                  JAMES 
                    How do you know that my  A-game  
                    doesn t include making you think 
                    I m not bringing my  A-game? 

      Katie considers this.  Then...

                                  KATIE
                    By the way, why d you run out of 
                    the wake like that?  You didn t 
                    even say goodbye.

                                  JAMES
                          (covering)
                    Stomach thing, sorry.

      Katie looks at him as if trying to determine if he s telling 
      the truth.  Just then, James  assistant pokes her head in.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Ms. Graham, the Board is ready for 
                    you now.

                                  KATIE
                    I ll be right in.

      Katie turns to James.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    You know, you may be my best friend 
                    but I want this job.  And except 
                    for men, I m pretty good at getting 
                    what I want.                                                                                    35.



      James nods.  Then Katie takes him in -- in all his pitiful 
      glory.  She can t help herself...

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    Oh, Jeez.  C mere...  

      Katie straightens James  collar.  Smooths his hair.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    And wear the blue tie.  It looks 
                    great on you.

      And she s gone.  James smiles to himself.  Then as he looks 
      back at the picture, the smile runs from his face.


      Marla emerges from a taxi cab in front of Karl s house.  
      Apparently, it was not an idle threat.  She takes a deep 
      breath, steeling herself for the task ahead, and marches 
      towards the front door.

      She knocks loudly on the door and composes herself as she 
      waits.  A beat and Wendy opens the door.

                                  WENDY
                    Hi.  Can I help you?

                                  MARLA
                    Actually, maybe I can help you.  

      And on Marla s smile, we...SMASH TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Karl pulls up to his house in his BMW.  He parks and moves 
      quickly towards the front door.  He s here to do his best to 
      reclaim his marriage.  He opens the front door and enters.


      As a TAXI pulls away with Dontrelle inside, Duncan breathes a 
      sigh of relief.  Just then, Cameron steps in next to him.

                                    CAMERON
                    You and Dontrelle -- not just old 
                    hunting buddies, right?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Don t tell your mother, okay?

      Cameron nods.  A beat, then...

                                    CAMERON
                    You know, we re more alike than I 
                    thought, Duncan.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                    CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    We both have trouble getting out of 
                    our own ways.

      Duncan turns and looks at her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you going to stop embarrassing 
                    me at work?

                                    CAMERON
                    Probably not.  
                          (then)
                    Are you going to stop judging me?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Not likely.

                                    CAMERON
                    Well at least we know where we 
                    stand.

      Cameron turns and starts to walk off...

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Good night, Duncan.  See you 
                    Monday.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (calling after her)
                    You can call me  Dad,  you know.

                                    CAMERON
                    I know.  
                          (then)
                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan watches Cameron walk off.  He can t help but smile.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (to himself)
                    Baby steps.


      We join Stacey and James in the midst of their charged 
      discussion.

                                  STACEY
                            (generously)
                    CEO...  God, the articles in the 
                    papers -- the kids were so excited, 
                    they took them to school with them.  
                    I m so proud of you, James.                                                                                    58.



      James nods, says nothing.

                                  STACEY (CONT D)
                    I m not asking you not to be angry 
                    at me, you know.

                                  JAMES
                    Then what are you asking?

                                  STACEY
                    If you re ever going to be able to 
                    stop.

      James looks at her.

                                  JAMES
                    Did you love him?

                                  STACEY
                    No.

                                  JAMES
                    Then why d you -- ?

                                  STACEY
                    I don t know.  Maybe I was bored.  
                    Or maybe I was scared you were.  
                    That at any moment I d become one 
                    of those  first wives of Firmwood  
                    whose husbands traded them in for a 
                    newer model.

      James shakes his head at the irony.  A beat, then...

                                  JAMES
                          (heartfelt)
                    When I was promoted yesterday, you 
                    know what I first thought?  How I 
                    wished I could call you just to 
                    hear your voice.  And at my press 
                      conference, you know what I thought 
                    then?  How I loved watching you 
                    wake up in the morning.  And at the 
                    company dinner...?  All I could 
                    think was how you should have been 
                    right beside me in your little 
                    black dress.  It was a day I d been 
                    dreaming of since B-school, Stace, 
                    and all I could think of was what 
                    I d lost.                                                                                    59.



                                  STACEY
                    It doesn t have to be like that.  
                    You can come home.

                                  JAMES
                    No, I can t.

                                  STACEY
                    Never?

                                  JAMES
                    Not right away, no.
                          (beat)
                    I ll find a place nearby.  We ll 
                    tell the kids we re taking a  time 
                    out. 

      Stacey nods.  She understands.  Then...trying to ease their 
      pain.

                                  STACEY 
                    CEO of AmeriMart.  World s most 
                    eligible bachelor.

                                  JAMES
                    It s not what I wanted for myself.  
                    Not since Econ 101.

      A last, regretful look.  James is gone.  And as Stacey 
      convulses into tears, we re...


      Dontrelle hands the micro-cassette to Lori Hodge, the 
      reporter who earlier interviewed Duncan.

                                  DONTRELLE
                    He seems like a nice guy.  I don t 
                    know why you needed me to tape him.

                                  LORI
                    Because a thousand words paint a 
                    very nice picture...

      Dontrelle shrugs.  And as Lori cradles the tape in her hands -
      - and we wonder to ourselves about the intrigue that awaits 
      us, we...SMASH TO BLACK.
