Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.
RIPLEY (O/S)
If I could just go back.
If I could rub
everything out.
Starting with myself.
Starting with borrowing a jacket.
Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.
EMILY GREENLEAF
(to Fran)
I hope you'll come and see us...
FRAN
That's very kind.
EMILY GREENLEAF
Both of you...
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
Jazz. He has a saxophone.
To my ear Jazz
is just noise, just an insolent noise.
The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
through him.
Put coins in a bowl.
The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
the performances.
A haughty woman in the box turns round and
he closes the curtain.
An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
ghostlight.
A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
the house lights.
Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
apologetically.
RIPLEY
Sorry, sorry.
I know.
Sorry.
A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.
An exuberant and
mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
into a raucous big band jazz number:
Dizzy Gillespie's The
Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.
RIPLEY (O/S)
I don't know. Count Basie?
Duke
Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.
The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.
A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.
Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.
Signs everywhere of
packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.
Ripley paces in this
BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
bedroom all in one.
Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
give onto bars and a wall.
RIPLEY
Don't even know if this is a man or a
woman.
There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
flinches.
Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
Charlie Parker's Koko.
He listens hard, recognizes the
track.
RIPLEY
That's Charlie Parker. Bird.
He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
right, he smiles.
Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
before closing the door behind him.
Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
and dollars.
CHAUFFEUR
I can tell you.
The Greenleaf name opens
a lot of doors.
ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
escorted, fussed over into the hall.
Their bags have been
unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
under the initials of their owners.
STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
his name.
Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
and joins the crowd around the letter R.
A striking young
woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.
Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.
MEREDITH
What's your secret?
RIPLEY
Excuse me?
MEREDITH
No, it's just - you are American, aren't
you? - no, I just, I have so much
luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
It's humiliating.
Ripley shrugs.
Now they're opening a second case of the
passenger ahead.
Hard not to converse.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
Randall.
RIPLEY
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
MEREDITH
Hello.
They are passed through immigration, head down the long
stairs towards the street.
Meredith catches up with Ripley.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
RIPLEY
(thinking quickly)
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
MEREDITH
So now, did they put your suitcase in the
wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
weren't you under the R stand? I thought
I saw you there.
RIPLEY
My father wants me in New York. He builds
boats. I'd rather sail them.
I travel
under my mother's name.
MEREDITH
Which is?
RIPLEY
Emily.
(Meredith's bewildered)
Just kidding.
MEREDITH
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
either. I'm Logue.
RIPLEY
(nods, recognizing the name)
As in the...?
MEREDITH
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
off the dress. I travel under my mother's
name, too.
RIPLEY
Randall.
MEREDITH
Right.
They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.
They're going in
different directions.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
(offering her hand)
So - partners in disguise.
(looks at the signs)
Bye.
Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
new town. People get off.
INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.
Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
down through a square, passing the local church.
A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
scheming.
DICKIE
I'm never going back. To actually hire
somebody to come all the way here to drag
me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
he?
SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.
DICKIE (cont'd)
I'm never going back!
RIPLEY
No, I think your mother, her illness -
DICKIE
It's got nothing to do with my mother!
She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
makes me boil about him! HE wants me
back! - it's got nothing to do with my
mother.
RIPLEY
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
you what I -
DICKIE
(interrupting)
Go back!
Go back to New York or call him
if you can find a telephone that works,
and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
back to him or his shipyard.
A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.
Dickie is
instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
cigarette.
Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
up onto the stage.
FAUSTO
(improvising in Italian)
Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
all the way from America... etc.
Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.
FAUSTO (cont'd)
And a big round of applause for a new
friend from New York - Tom Ripley!
Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
him up.
The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.
DICKIE (O/S)
(reading)
I have bumped into an old friend from
Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
He says he's going to haunt me until I
agree to come back to New York with
him...
Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.
DICKIE
(grins)
Good afternoon!
RIPLEY
What time is it?
(puts on his glasses and checks
his watch)
Oh God!
Do you always type your letters?
(points at the letter)
That should be two Ts.
DICKIE
I can't write and I can't spell.
That's
the privilege of a first-class education.
You're upstairs at the back. I think
Ermelinda made the bed up.
RIPLEY
This is so good of you.
DICKIE
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
Agent and we're going to string my Dad
alone, I was thinking we might buy a
little car with the expense money he's
sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.
MARGE
Dickie, you can't even drive a car!
No,
what we need urgently is an icebox. What
do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
be your friend for life.
RIPLEY
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.
Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.
Ripley picks up the tie and
walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
conversation float up to Ripley.
DICKIE
It'll just be for a little while.
He can
be... he makes me laugh.
MARGE
Okay, darling.
DICKIE
You'd say if you mind?
MARGE
No, I like him.
DICKIE
Marge, you like everybody.
MARGE
I don't like you.
DICKIE
Then I'll go to your place and you can
move in with Tom.
Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.
Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.
A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.
DICKIE
I could fuck this icebox I love it so
much.
(considering Ripley)
What were you actually doing in New York?
RIPLEY
I played piano in a few places.
DICKIE
That's one job, you told me a lot of
jobs.
RIPLEY
A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
I don't want to think about New York.
DICKIE
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
spend hours speculating.
(drinking)
Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
RIPLEY
Copy out from here...
He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.
DICKIE
(staring to write on the back
of a postcard)
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
with you and no clothes.
Ermelinda says
you wash the same shirt out every night.
Is that true?
RIPLEY
No! I've got more than one shirt!
DICKIE
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
just wear some of my things, wear
anything you want, most of it's ancient.
(he's finished writing)
RIPLEY
Now your signature.
(watching him write)
Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
them. Dickie looks at him.
DICKIE
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
(takes them, tries them on)
I don't need them because I never read.
How do I look.
RIPLEY
Like Clark Kent.
(takes them back, puts them on
beaming at Dickie)
Now Superman.
Dickie cuffs him.
Ripley looks down at the postcard.
DICKIE
I know. I write like a child.
RIPLEY
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
pain, that's secret pain.
DICKIE
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
know about it.
RIPLEY
Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
See - nothing's quite touching the line -
that's vanity.
DICKIE
(flattered)
Well we certainly know that's true.
Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.
DICKIE
Do you have any brothers?
RIPLEY
No, no brothers, no sisters.
DICKIE
me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
children - what does that mean?
He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.
RIPLEY
Means we never shared a bath.
I'm cold. Can I get in?
DICKIE
No!
RIPLEY
I didn't mean with you in it.
DICKIE
(standing)
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
anyway.
He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
his towel.
An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
is used to it.
DICKIE
It is me. It's an old picture.
(sighs at Ripley)
Every time - 'is it you?
Doesn't look
like you'.
He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
with his initials prominently embossed.
Ripley watches him
sign and collect a large wad of notes.
CLERK
Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.
Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
holds up one letter to Dickie.
RIPLEY
Fran.
(anticipating her letter)
I miss you, where are you coming home?
Stop telling me what a great time you're
having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
and...
(the next letter)
And this one, I think, is your dad...
Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.
He
frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.
DICKIE
What does he say?
RIPLEY
He's getting impatient. He wants me to
reassure him you'll be home by
Thanksgiving.
DICKIE
You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
sick of seeing you in them.
RIPLEY
I can't. I can't keep spending your
father's money.
DICKIE
I love how responsible you are. My Dad
should make you Chief Accountant or
something.
Let me buy you a jacket.
There's a great place when we get to
Rome, Batistoni.
Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".
DICKIE (cont'd)
Andiamo a Roma.
We're taking Tom to
Roma!
This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.
There are two
LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
into it, sharing a set of headphones.
Ripley stands outside
the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
accordion doors.
DICKIE
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
grab a cab and we can meet up at the
railway station.
RIPLEY
(absolutely crestfallen)
What club?
DICKIE
Freddie's arranged it with some of the
skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
RIPLEY
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
what have you...
FREDDIE
(from inside the booth)
Dick - you've got to hear this!
DICKIE
(oblivious to Ripley's pain)
Listen, just take one of mine when we get
back. Don't worry about it.
I did the
Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
enough in anyone's life.
Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.
DICKIE
Ciao.
Have fun.
Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
booth.
Dickie pushes it open.
RIPLEY
You said to make sure you didn't miss the
train. It leaves at eight.
It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.
There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
catches one of Dickie's expressions.
There are clothes
abandoned everywhere.
He's been having a big dressing-up
session. He sings along with Bing.
DICKIE (O/S)
What are you doing?
Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
doorway.
The music thumps away.
RIPLEY
Oh - just amusing myself.
Sorry, Dickie.
(pause)
I didn't think you were coming back.
Dickie turns off the record player.
DICKIE
I wish you'd get out of my clothes.
Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
mortification and shock.
Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
his head.
DICKIE (cont'd)
Shoes too?
RIPLEY
(lame, ashamed)
You said I could pick out a jacket and I
just... Sorry.
DICKIE
Get undressed in your own room, would
you?
RIPLEY
I thought you'd missed the train.
DICKIE
Freddie drove me back in his car.
RIPLEY
(horrified)
Is Freddie here?
DICKIE
He's downstairs.
RIPLEY
I was just fooling around. Don't say
anything. Sorry.
Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
dressing-up session, not amused.
Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
begins tidying the mess in the living room.
He picks up
empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.
RIPLEY
I know why you're upset.
(Dickie continues playing)
I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
and Silvana.
Dickie stops playing.
DICKIE
What about us?
He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.
DICKIE (cont'd)
(losing his temper)
You don't have to clean up! Really!
Ripley disappears into the kitchen.
DICKIE (cont'd)
(as Ripley returns)
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
you know what that means in a place like
this?
RIPLEY
I'm prepared to take the blame.
DICKIE
What are you talking about?
RIPLEY
You've been so good to me. You're the
brother I never had. I'm the brother you
never had.
DICKIE
She came to me for help, she needed
money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
help her. Now she's dead and it's my
fault.
RIPLEY
I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
or anybody, the police - It's a secret
between us and I'll keep it.
And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
somehow in thrall to Ripley.
RIPLEY (O/S)
Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
discontinue your expense checks...
Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.
Dickie
suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.
DICKIE
(terse)
Why do you do that thing - with your
neck? On trains you always do that thing,
it's so spooky.
Ripley approaches the front desk.
He's shivering.
He's not
wearing his glasses.
RIPLEY
Can I have my key, please?
RECEPTIONIST
(at the key rack)
Of course - But you must be very cold?
Signor Greenleaf?
Yes? -
RIPLEY
(mind racing)
No, it's - I'm...
Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.
He
can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.
Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.
As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
back into the kitchen area.
MARGE
There was a letter from Dickie in with my
perfume. You realize it's more than a few
days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.
She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
them up.
She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
fresh ice into her glass.
MARGE (cont'd)
The thing is, the night before he left,
we talked about moving, together, going
North - and I suppose I put some pressure
on him, about getting married, I just
might have scared him off. There's a side
to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
I know no-one else sees it, which is
really tender.
(unravelling)
I think I should come with you to Rome
and just confront him.
Ripley lights a cigarette.
Marge loses confidence.
MARGE (cont'd)
He hates being confronted.
RIPLEY
I think you're right.
RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:
DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a
baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.
Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
rings.
As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
passport, he looks at the owner.
Ripley wears a terrific
suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.
ALDO
Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.
RIPLEY
(walking away)
Thank you.
The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
its opulence.
He immediately picks up the telephone.
RIPLEY
Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
Grazie.
He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
Greenleaf.
Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.
The telephone rings.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.
A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.
RIPLEY
He's not there?
Very well. I'll leave a
message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
sounds fine. Ripley.
(listens as it's read back)
Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
you.
Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.
RIPLEY
I'd like these to have my initials -
embossed, I don't know the word in
Italian ...embossed?
GUCCI ASSISTANT
Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.
There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
alone and delighted to see him.
He grins and mouths hello.
MEREDITH
(entering the shop)
Dickie! Oh my God!
Ciao.
Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
by her presence.
She goes to the window ahead of him.
She takes her money, turns to him.
He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.
RIPLEY
I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
will change them.
Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
Ripley.
MEREDITH
Show me the other one again.
(the Tailor obliges)
I like them both.
RIPLEY
I'll take them both.
Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
Meredith shows the Tailor out.
As she returns she notices
the open sax case, peers inside.
MEREDITH (O/S)
I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
absolutely hate the Opera?
I've been
trying to give my tickets away, it's
tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
dragged...
She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
him, the romance she feels to be in the air.
RIPLEY
(emerging)
You could drag me.
On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.
Lensky sings his aria
before the duel with Onegin.
Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.
He knows what comes next.
Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
snow.
Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.
The Interval.
Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
drinks).
RIPLEY
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
JOAN
Can you bear it?
We hear you're a friend
of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
tattooed on his chest.
RIPLEY
There's room for a whole libretto on
Freddie's chest.
JOAN
(laughs)
I'm sure we've met.
They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.
JOAN (cont'd)
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
RIPLEY
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
JOAN
One minute you people are children and
the next you're getting tattooed.
Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
Englishman.
They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
beside them.
MARGE
(as if she's seen a ghost)
Oh my God. Tom.
RIPLEY
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
Rome?
MARGE
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
RIPLEY
No.
(to Smith-Kingsley)
Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
PETER
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.
MARGE
(works out what's strange)
No glasses.
He fishes out the glasses.
RIPLEY
(to Peter)
Ditto.
PETER
Where are you hiding him? He's
impossible, isn't he?
MARGE
Is he really not here?
RIPLEY
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
tattooed on his chest.
MARGE
You were going to Venice.
PETER
Yes, what happened? I heard you were
desperate to come. I was looking forward
to rowing you around.
RIPLEY
I am.
I really am. And I've been
travelling. I just can't seem to get that
far north.
PETER
Well hurry, before we sink.
(reaches into his jacket)
Should I give you my telephone number in
Venice?
RIPLEY
Thanks.
The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
Ripley, sees Meredith.
PETER
Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
Meredith -
(embarrassed at not
remembering)
God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
her house...!
MARGE
I don't know her.
(to Ripley)
He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
just these cryptic notes. You don't just
dump people.
The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.
PETER
Will we see you later?
RIPLEY
I can't later.
PETER
And tomorrow?
RIPLEY
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
PETER
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
RIPLEY
Ten thirty?
PETER
We'll be there.
RIPLEY
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
(to Peter)
It's really good to meet you.
Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.
RIPLEY
Let's go.
MEREDITH
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
RIPLEY
Let's take a Carozza and look at the
moon.
MEREDITH
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
dangerously near as they approach their seats.
RIPLEY
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
two of us.
MEREDITH
(quite taken)
Okay then, you're crazy.
Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
explores, relishing the decor.
SIGNORA BUFFI
Accendo il riscaldamento.
(I'll turn the heating on.)
RIPLEY
(mimes playing sax)
Mi piace suonare.
(I like to play music.)
SIGNORA BUFFI
(shrugs)
Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
(I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
do you like it?)
Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
glass, pours himself a drink.
Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.
RIPLEY
Hello?
FREDDIE (O/S)
Dickie?
RIPLEY
Who is it?
FREDDIE (O/S)
It's Freddie. Let me in.
RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.
FREDDIE (O/S)
Dickie, come on, it's me.
Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
door.
RIPLEY
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
FREDDIE
(confused, not pleasantly)
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
RIPLEY
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
FREDDIE
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
If you said he was still at lunch I'd
believe you. Incredible. The guy has
disappeared off the face of the earth.
RIPLEY
I guess.
FREDDIE
The landlady - as far as I could tell,
the landlady said he was here right now.
RIPLEY
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
can't think why you would imagine Dickie
would hide from you.
FREDDIE
Because he's been hiding from me - what
happened at Christmas?
RIPLEY
What about Christmas?
FREDDIE
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
get a cable or a call or a note or,
frankly, a fart.
Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.
RIPLEY (O/S)
Of course, he's been very involved in his
music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
you know, you have to go into a cocoon
before you can become a butterfly.
FREDDIE
Which is horseshit.
Have you heard him
play that thing?
(gesturing at the sax on its
stand)
He can't.
RIPLEY (O/S)
(casually)
How did you find him? It's such an out of
the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
FREDDIE
No thanks.
(explaining his detective work)
Some kid at the American Express Office.
(he starts to explore)
Are you living here?
Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.
RIPLEY
(returning, flinching)
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
in Rome.
That's a new piano, so you prob -
FREDDIE (O/S)
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
bourgeois.
Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.
RIPLEY
You should watch that!
FREDDIE
In fact the only thing which looks like
Dickie is you.
RIPLEY
Hardly.
FREDDIE
Have you done something to your hair?
Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.
RIPLEY
Freddie, do you have something to say?
FREDDIE
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
going on. He's either converted to
Christianity - or to something else.
RIPLEY
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
Corso.
FREDDIE
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
Last time you didn't know your ass from
your elbow, now you're giving me
directions. That's not fair, you probably
do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
see you.
AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.
FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.
Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
in, he launches into his interrogation.
FREDDIE
Ripley? There's someth -
- AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.
Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.
Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.
ROVERINI
Dickie Greenleaf?
RIPLEY
Yes?
ROVERINI
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.
ROVERINI
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
Signor Miles leave yesterday?
RIPLEY
I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
both taken on far too many drinks - but
it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
walked him down to his car.
ROVERINI
So Signor Miles drove away and you did
what?
RIPLEY
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.
ROVERINI
Senta.
We have to ask you to stay in
Rome.
RIPLEY
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
ROVERINI
So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
(looks at Baggio)
- come se dice?
RIPLEY
Postmortem?
ROVERINI
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
conclusion was that Signor Miles was
killed not later than seven o'clock
yesterday evening.
RIPLEY
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
drove off in his car.
ROVERINI
No.
As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.
RIPLEY
Can we go up? Do you mind?
ROVERINI
Of course. What happened to your face?
RIPLEY
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
photographers.
He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
(agitated)
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
feeling hounded - do you think you could
not give out my address?
ROVERINI
Never. We've had many requests and, of
course, we say no - even to your fiance.
RIPLEY
I really don't want to see anybody.
ROVERINI
Even your fiance...?
RIPLEY
Even her.
ROVERINI
What about Thomas Ripley?
RIPLEY
What about Ripley?
Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
barely wait for Roverini to catch up.
Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.
ROVERINI
You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
is that right?
Ripley is appalled. He smiles.
RIPLEY
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
was months ago.
ROVERINI
November, I thought.
RIPLEY
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
ROVERINI
November 7th is my information.
RIPLEY
I don't remember the exact date.
ROVERINI
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
RIPLEY
A few days ago.
ROVERINI
Does he stay with you here?
RIPLEY
No!
ROVERINI
No.
Here is a pattern. Two days ago
Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
little boat is found in San Remo full of
rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
was stolen on November 7th. We look at
hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
our boatman remembers two Americans
taking a boat.
RIPLEY
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
there must have been a hundred people
renting a boat on that day.
ROVERINI
31 people.
RIPLEY
31 people.
Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.
ROVERINI
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
Sherwood.
RIPLEY
(appalled, defeated)
Let her in, what's the difference?
Let
her in.
(Baggio is on his way to the
door.)
No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
if you would ask her to come back later.
Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Thank you.
ROVERINI
(watching him)
May I ask...why would you speak to your
friend and not your fiance?
RIPLEY
I think I just said. Ripley was handling
some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
want to marry me.
Nor did he ask me
every day if I would marry him. And when.
ROVERINI
Do you have a photograph of Signor
Ripley?
RIPLEY
I'm not in the habit of carrying around
photographs of my male friends.
ROVERINI
Now I think I have upset you. My English
perhaps is coarse.
RIPLEY
It is a little coarse, yes.
ROVERINI
Sorry.
No-one has seen Signor Ripley
since San -
RIPLEY
I have!
ROVERINI
You have, yes.
RIPLEY
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
her! and if I could remember which hotel
he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
was staying at the Goldoni.
ROVERINI
Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
coincidence.
(he gets up to leave)
I look forward to our next meeting when I
will be more careful with my English and
persuade you to play me your saxophone.
Alto.
RIPLEY
Absolutely.
ROVERINI
(suddenly turning)
I have a witness who thinks they saw two
men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
wants to identify you in a - confronto -
line-up.
(ominously)
Tomorrow then?
RIPLEY
(thrown, scrabbling)
Tomorrow.
Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
stairs.
ROVERINI (O/S)
Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.
He's in but I
really don't think he wants to see
anyone.
Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
suddenly a voice shocks him upright.
MARGE
Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
What am I doing, chasing you around...?
I was going to say I would count to three
and if you didn't open the door, but I
won't count any more. On you. I won't
count on you any more. Whatever it is,
whatever you've done or haven't done,
you've broken my heart. That's one thing
I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
why, I don't know why, I just don't know
why...
Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.
Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.
RIPLEY (O/S)
My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
about going to the police, but I can't do
it, I can't face it.
I can't face
anything anymore...
CHAOS.
Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.
He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.
RIPLEY (O/S)
...I wish I could give you the life I
took for granted. You've always
understood what's at the heart of me,
Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
why I'm writing this to you, the brother
I never had. The only true friend I ever
had. In all kinds of ways you're much
more like the son my father always
wanted. I realise you can change the
people, change the scenery, but you can't
change your own rotten self. Now I can't
think what to do, or where to go. I'm
haunted by everything I've done, and
can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
I've made a mess of being Dickie
Greenleaf haven't I?
He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.
Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.
He finds some
dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
saxophone.
Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.
Later.
Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
processed.
The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
waits.
PETER
Welcome to Venice.
This place reeks,
doesn't it? Can you smell it?
Ugh.
Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
first day.
RIPLEY
It's okay.
PETER
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
delay. Finally.
We're waiting for
someone from Rome.
RIPLEY
(completely thrown)
What do you mean?
They're sending
someone from Rome?
PETER
That's good, isn't it?
RIPLEY
(as if suffocating)
No, but I thought that didn't happen in
Italy, that each region was completely
separate! I was sure that was the -
PETER
You've seen the papers, you know what a
big deal it's been here. American tourist
murdered -
RIPLEY
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
the stench I can hardly breathe.
A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.
A POLICEMAN
introduces him.
POLICEMAN
Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
Roma.
VERRECCHIA
(to Peter, in Italian)
Qui e Ripley?
Who is Ripley?
PETER
(in Italian)
Lui. Him.
Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
room at the back of the station.
His manner is ominous.
This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
locked area for cells at one wall.
A small, sour window
gives onto a canal.
The main station is glimpsed through
some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.
Verrecchia sits down.
Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
during which Peter translates.
VERRECCHIA
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
noto non e riuscito a impedire il
verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
al momento passibile di incriminazione
del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
PETER
(translating)
He's taken over the case because...
they're annoyed the previous chap let
Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
he was the only suspect in Freddie's
murder.
VERRECCHIA
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
signor Ripley ha visto il signor
Greenleaf?
(When was the last time Ripley saw
Greenleaf?)
Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
answers.
RIPLEY
In Rome, about three weeks ago.
(shrugs)
I knew that one.
PETER
(giving Ripley a look)
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
VERRECCHIA
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
PETER
(translating)
Where have you been since then?
RIPLEY
I've been backpacking.
PETER
I don't know how to translate that.
(he tries)
E difficile....il signor Ripley
....dormiva all'aperto, con un...
VERRECCHIA
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
PETER
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
outside.
VERRECCHIA
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
omosessuali?
PETER
Are you a homosexual?
(then as himself)
Interesting non-sequitur.
RIPLEY
No.
PETER
(translates for him)
No.
(as Peter, drily)
By the way, officially there are no
Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
Michelangelo very inconvenient.
RIPLEY
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a
fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a
string of them.
PETER
(translating)
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
molte fidanzate.
VERRECCHIA
(laughs)
Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!
They all laugh.
RIPLEY
What did he say?
PETER
He says so many fiances.
VERRECCHIA
(suddenly very tough)
Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?
As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.
PETER
He wants to know if you killed Freddie
Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
RIPLEY
(outraged)
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.
Is
he accusing me?
(Peter clearly doesn't ask)
Ask him if he's accusing me!
PETER
He's already angry, I don't think -
RIPLEY
(interrupting, heated)
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
VERRECCHIA
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
conversazioni private!
(This is not the
place for your private conversations)
PETER
(appeasing him)
A ragione.
A ragione.
(You're right.
You're right.)
VERRECCHIA
Hmm. C'e questa...
(There's this...)
Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
the outside. Ripley stares at it.
VERRECCHIA
(cont'd)
Questa lettera e stata trovata
nell'abitazione del signor Richard
Greenleaf a Roma.
PETER
They found this in Dickie's place in
Rome.
RIPLEY
You opened this?
VERRECCHIA
Of course!
He stands and takes the letter out.
Begins to read. He has
the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.
RIPLEY
(to Peter)
It's a suicide note.
(to Verrecchia)
You ask me all these questions and you've
already read this suicide note?
There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
He's setting the table.
PETER
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
up every morning, how can you? Just wake
up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
RIPLEY
Whatever you do, however terrible,
however hurtful - it all makes sense,
doesn't it? inside your head. You never
meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
person or that they're cruel.
PETER
But you're still tormented, you must be,
you've killed somebody...
RIPLEY
Don't you put the past in a room, in the
cellar, and lock the door and just never
go in there? Because that's what I do.
PETER
Probably. In my case it's probably a
whole building.
RIPLEY
Then you meet someone special and all you
want to do is toss them the key, say open
up, step inside, but you can't because
it's dark and there are demons and if
anybody saw how ugly it was...
Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.
PETER
That's the music talking. Harder to be
bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
Brown.
He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.
RIPLEY
I keep wanting to do that - fling open
the door - let the light in, clean
everything out. If I could get a huge
eraser and rub everything out...starting
with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...
PETER
(as Ripley falls silent)
No key, huh?
A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.
The
orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
organ.
Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
listens. Peter sees him, smiles.
Ripley smiles back.
Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.
MARGE
This is spectacular.
PETER
That's why Tom wanted you to stay.
It's
better than squeezing into my room, and I
know how you hate hotels.
MARGE
A hotel would've been fine.
(to Ripley)
We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
his dollar has stretched.
Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
raging. Peter turns
PETER
What's funny?
MARGE
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
Tom arrived in Mongi.
(to Ripley)
And now look at you.
RIPLEY
Look at me what?
MARGE
To the manner born.
Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(reading, plunging into gloom)
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
RIPLEY
I think it might hurt her to know.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
scratch out your own face like that - can
you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
have to be in?
(reading)
I've thought about going to the police
but I can't face it. I can't face
anything anymore.
RIPLEY
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
away. I spoke and he heard you.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(such a disappointed father)
Well, if we all pushed him away what
about him pushing us away? You've been a
great friend to my son. Everything is
someone else's fault. We all want to sow
wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
word?
(Ripley shakes his head)
The moment someone confronts him he
lashes out.
He lashes out. You know,
people always say you can't choose your
parents, but you can't choose your
children.
Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
and Marge.
RIPLEY
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
fallen asleep.
PETER
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
MARGE
Did Dickie's Dad go?
RIPLEY
He's having an early night.
MARGE
Poor man.
(she heads to her room)
We were knocking on that door for ever.
(she fiddles inside the sleeve
of her dress)
I think I've broken my strap.
PETER
Not guilty.
RIPLEY
I'll fix some drinks.
MARGE
You walk in Venice!
She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
a little concerned.
PETER
Are you okay?
RIPLEY
I'm fine.
PETER
(a hand on his shoulder)
Do you want me to stick around?
RIPLEY
It's okay.
PETER
Or I could come back.
Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.
PETER (cont'd)
Your key.
Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.
MARGE (O/S)
Tom?
RIPLEY
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
MARGE (O/S)
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
slightly breathless.
MARGE
I found Dickie's rings.
RIPLEY
What?
MARGE
You've got Dickie's rings.
RIPLEY
I can explain.
He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.
MARGE
Dickie promised me he would never take
off this ring.
RIPLEY
Let me put on some clothes and then we
can talk about this.
MARGE
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
Greenleaf.
RIPLEY
Marge, calm down, you're being
hysterical.
MARGE
He promised me. I swear I'll never take
off this ring until the day -
RIPLEY
Shut up! Shut up!
His towel slips off from his waist.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
really like to put my clothes on. So go
and pour us both a drink, will you?
She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.
Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
bathroom.
RIPLEY
Marge?
Where are you going?
MARGE
(like a creature caught in
headlights)
I was looking for a needle and thread. I
wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
needle and thread to mend my bra.
RIPLEY
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
So many things. The day he was late back
from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
was with another girl. I'm not talking
about Meredith, another girl we met in a
bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
minutes. So when he makes a promise it
doesn't mean what it means when you make
a promise. Or I do. He has so many
realities, Dickie, and he believes them
all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
the time he doesn't even realize.
A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Today, for the first time, I've even
wondered whether he might have killed
Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
contradicted him - well, you know that.
Marge. I loved you - you might as well
know - I loved you, and because he knew I
loved you, he let you think I loved him.
Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
now, so just write it on a piece of paper
or something, and keep it in your purse
for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
MARGE
(as if she'd heard nothing)
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.
RIPLEY
I told you. He gave them to me.
MARGE
Why? When?
RIPLEY
I feel as if you haven't heard anything
I've been saying to you.
MARGE
I don't believe you.
RIPLEY
It's all true.
MARGE
I don't believe a single word you've
said.
Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.
RIPLEY
You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
Would you let me hold you?
Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.
MARGE
(sobbing uncontrollably)
Oh Peter! Get me out of here.
Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.
PETER
Tom, are you okay?
RIPLEY
You try. You try talking to her.
PETER
(calls after him)
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
RIPLEY
(not turning around)
I give up.
Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.
PETER
You can't be angry with her.
She's upset
and needs someone to blame. So she blames
you.
I'll go home and talk to her.
As
for you - either get a safety razor or
grow a beard.
Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.
Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
private investigator.
RIPLEY
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
MACCARRON
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
MARGE (O/S)
I don't know, I don't know, I just know
it.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(O/S)
Marge, there's female intuition, and
then there are facts -
Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
TABLE.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Tom.
RIPLEY
Hello, sir.
(smiles thinly at Marge)
Marge, you should have waited, didn't
Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
up?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Marge has been telling us about the
rings.
RIPLEY
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
ridiculous.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
heads into his bedroom.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(cont'd)
I'm going to take Marge for a little
walk, Tom.
Mr MacCarron wants to talk
with you.
RIPLEY
(feeling caged in)
We could go down to the bar - no need for
you to -
HERBERT GREENLEAF
No, he should talk to you alone.
He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
indifferent view.
Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.
PETER
Hello.
What are you up to?
RIPLEY
All kinds of things. Making plans.
PETER
Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
for the future?
RIPLEY
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
Come with me.
PETER
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
Come back though.
Come back.
(smiles at him)
You know, you look so relaxed, like a
completely different person.
RIPLEY
Well, that's entirely your fault.
And,
if I fall overboard, that'll be your
fault too.
Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.
PETER
How was it?
RIPLEY
Good. But I think we should stay in here
for the rest of the trip.
PETER
Was that Meredith?
RIPLEY
(sighs)
Was who Meredith?
PETER
Meredith Logue. You were kissing
somebody. Looked like Meredith.
RIPLEY
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
PETER
Didn't look that way - you know - from a
distance.
RIPLEY
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
you.
PETER
Why lie?
RIPLEY
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
gossip, isn't it?
PETER
Or Tom and Peter even.
RIPLEY
Well that would be even better gossip.
PETER
Really, why?
(completely lost)
Sorry, I'm completely lost.
RIPLEY
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
my, that's my - terrible and alone and
dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
where I am, and so nobody can ever find
me.
PETER
What do you mean lied about who you are?
RIPLEY
I suppose I always thought - better to be
a fake somebody than a real nobody.
PETER
What are you talking about - you're not a
nobody! That's the last thing you are.
RIPLEY
Peter, I... I...
PETER
(conciliatory)
And don't forget. I have the key.
RIPLEY
You have the key. Tell me some good
things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
Just tell me some nice things.
He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
brimming with tears.
He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
begins twisting it in his hands.
PETER
Good things about Tom Ripley?
Could take
some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
tender... Tom is beautiful...
RIPLEY
(during this, and tender)
You're such a liar...
PETER
...Tom is a mystery...
Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...
Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.
PETER (O/S)
(cont'd)
...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
That is a good thing!
(feeling Ripley's weight on
him)
Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
(suddenly alarmed)
Tom, you're crushing me!
The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.
THE END.
Lullaby for Cain
From the silence
from the night
comes a distant lullabye
Cry, remembering that first cry
Your brother standing by
and loved
both loved
beloved sons of mine
sing a lullabye
mother is close by
innocent eyes
such innocent eyes
Envy stole your brother's life
came home murdered peace of mind
left you nightmares on the pillow
sleep now
Soul, surrendering your soul
the heart of you not whole
for love
but love
what toll
Cast into the dark
branded with the mark
of shame
of Cain
From the garden of God's light
to a wilderness of light
sleep now
sleep now.
