          The fragment lies on the counter as MARC, 32, the owner,
          examines it with Walt and J.J.

          Johnny starts flipping through this collection of bucolic
          lake scenes and landscapes.  He's trying to stay out of
          this.

                        It's not from a boat.  It's from
                        a plane crash.  Johnny saw it.

                                        MARC
                        What do you mean he saw it?

                        He's a psychic.

          Marc turns toward Johnny, who can't escape him.

                                        MARC

                        big deal out of this...

          PAULINE, 25, appears.  She is dressed in cut-offs and a
          tank top that are shorter and tighter than circumstances
          require, but her manner isn't slutty: think of her as
          full of life.

                                        PAULINE
                        What's going on?

                          ...seems to think it crashed on
                        the east side of the mountain.

                                        PAULINE
                        That would explain why you couldn't
                        find it after three years searching
                        the west side.

          Pauline gives her full attention to this handsome stranger.

                        Caught some kind of serial killer

          Sarah clears her throat and nods toward J.J.

                        Oh, sorry... You really think you
                        know where that plane went down?

          Johnny's eye returns to the postcard display--

                        That would be Randy Turman.  I'll
                        get him on the radio.

          Pauline and Marc exchange a look as she reaches for the
          radio.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          One room with a pot bellied stove and several logging or
          climbing tools hanging on the bare walls.  J.J. is already
          in his sleeping bag on the floor, out like a light.  Sarah
          and Walt are settling...

                                        WALT
                        I wish I could drop off to sleep
                        like that.

          Sarah snuggles him.

                                        SARAH
                        Well, if the mountain air doesn't
                        work, I might have something...

          She kisses him.

                                        SARAH
                        You've been great about this whole
                          weekend.

                        Letting Johnny be part of this?

                        It's fine.  Let's get some sleep.

          Walt is not prepared to share his feelings on the subject. 
          They hunker down for sleep, nothing more--



          Marc is hurriedly going through the contents of a small
          lock box full of newspaper clippings, setting them aside
          as he looks for something.  A headline of one of the
            clippings reads:  COURIER FLIGHT CRASHES IN MAINE, PILOTS
          FEARED DEAD -- ramp into the subhead -- TWO MILLION DOLLAR
          CARGO STILL MISSING.

          The view WIDENS as Marc finds what he's looking for: the
          bolt he showed Johnny.  He shuts the lock box, stuffs the
          bolt in his pocket, then grabs something else from under
          the counter -- A GUN.           DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT ONE - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  19A.

                        charred hole in the ground.

          Sarah reacts to this with horror.  Just then, J.J. STIRS.

                        Ain't so bad.  We got each other --*
                        right, baby?*

                                        PAULINE*
                        That's right.*

                        year round, too, huh...?*

          Just then Turman shouts from up ahead.*




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/06/03 - WHT-2   28.*

                                        TURMAN
                        Mr. Smith, why don't you catch up
                        with J.J. and me?*

          Turman waits as Johnny catches up.  Marc watches him go,*
            wondering what that was about.  But a seed has been*
          planted...*

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:*

          TURMAN AND THE OTHERS - WIDE SPOT IN THE TRAIL (NOT YET*

          as a concerned Turman consults the map.*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Trail's washed out up ahead. *
                        Looks like we're going to have to*
                        cross at the old railroad bridge*
                        about a quarter mile upstream.*

                                        MARC*
                        Didn't some kids get killed foolin'*

                        It's the only way across. *
                          Otherwise it's a two day walk up*
                        to the narrows...*

          He looks at the map again.*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Let me just scout ahead a bit,*
                        maybe there's another crossing. *

          Turman heads off.*

          The pilots brace for final impact, the altitude alarm
          blaring as they begin slashing through the tree tops.

                                                                          VISION ENDS:


  5454RESUME JOHNNY

          As he comes out of the vision, shaking his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  I'm seeing the crash, but*
                        it's too disjointed, it's not*
                        giving me any sense of which
                          direction to go.

          Turman shows a flash of anger, twitching his gun hand.

                                        TURMAN
                        Try harder.

          Johnny has no choice but to comply.  He fingers the piece
          of metal, thinking, playing for time.  He looks up at the
          surrounding trees, the wind blowing the forest canopy,*
          and an idea starts to form.*

          As Turman watches in fascination, Johnny takes the bolt*
          in one hand, then closing his eyes to concentrate, reaches
          out with his trembling free hand to touch a large tree
          near him, TRIGGERING:


  54A54AA VISION

          With a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH, the VIEW RAMPS from the bolt in
          Johnny's hand -- across Johnny -- and up into the tree, 
          pausing momentarily to look straight down on Johnny and
          the others -- the Whoosh -- RAMPS TO ANOTHER TREE, then
          another, then another, sometimes even following the roots,*
          the view moving from tree to tree, accelerating with each*
          connection, pausing at each junction before ramping to
          the next tree -- along the way shooting past A DEER --
          then an owl -- gathering speed

    54ACONTINUED:54A

          until the forest is just a blur -- then it appears -- at
          first just a silver dot in the distance, rushing towards
          us until we see --


          THE CRASH SITE -- 

          Johnny's vision POV hurtling toward the wreckage,
          surrounded by the trees that have embraced it, hiding
          it's secret until now.  The view continues into the broken
            fuselage, taking us right inside -- crashing to a stop on --


          THE DEAD PILOT'S SKELETON

          Still at the controls, mouth open in his final scream,
          tendrils of a creeping vine gripping his skull, the forest
          having claimed him as it's own.

                                                                          VISION ENDS:


    54B54BRESUME REALITY - RAMPING OUT FROM JOHNNY

          He drops the metal and disconnects from the tree, fighting
          to steady himself, rocked by the effort.  He picks up his
          cane and points...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That way.

                                        TURMAN
                          Downstream?  You sure?

          Johnny nods yes.

                                        TURMAN
                        All right then.  Lets get moving.

          As Johnny looks to Sarah...

                                                                              FADE OUT:
