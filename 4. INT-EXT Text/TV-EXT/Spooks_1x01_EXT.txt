 
DANNY (20s, kind-eyed, suited, black) waits under a  FOR SALE  
sign. He spots a wary looking woman (OSPREY) further down the 
street. She s 30s, casually dressed, nervous as hell. Nearby, 
a Street Sweeper sweeps away, innocently enough... 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  3

DANNY has a newspaper. He chucks it in a nearby bin. Turns--
and, without looking at the woman--enters the house. 
 
OSPREY has seen this. She crosses the road. Glances up at the 
house--the blinds in the first floor have now been drawn. A 
signal. The street sweeper watches her as she enters. 
 
 
KAREN LYNOTT (40s) climbs into her car, dressed for work. MIKE 
LYNOTT (also 40s) emerges with a crying daughter, SARAH (7). 
Another daughter, CLAIRE, 4, clutches his leg. 
 
                                        MIKE 
                          She wants to go with you. 
 
                                        KAREN 
        Sarah, you have to go with Daddy today. I m sorry 
                                      sweetheart. 
 
She blows her a kiss. MIKE cajoles SARAH, leaves the girls on 
the doorstep and walks towards KAREN and the car. 
 
KAREN puts her hand on the key--but then notices MIKE in the 
wing mirror. He s peering under the car. She looks quizzically 
back at him. He looks almost nervous. 
 
                                        MIKE 
                        Exhaust looks a bit rusty. 
 
                                        KAREN 
                          I ll drop in to Kwik Fit. 
 
MIKE sneaks another look underneath the car. Checking. KAREN 
waves goodbye to her family. Turns the key... 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  5

It starts up fine. KAREN reverses slowly down the drive. 
 
MIKE walks back to the door and picks up SARAH, who waves bye 
to her Mum. She struggles out of his arms and runs after Mum, 
waving... 
 
Bins are out on the street for the binmen. 
 
Further down the street, a man (ROB) in a long coat watches 
the car backing out. He carries a newspaper under his arm. 
 
As KAREN s car passes the bins, he drops his newspaper on the 
ground--it s like a signal. We stay with the man as he rounds 
the corner. Then, from the driveway area... 
 
..the muffled thud of an explosion. 
 
A shockwave, then silence... alarms filter through the haze. 
 
The man is still walking. A car draws up. He calmly gets in. 
The driver is a heavy-set man (STEVE). In the back, a woman we 
will come to know later as MARY KANE. In her hand, what looks 
like a mobile phone of some kind. 
 
The car does a U-turn and drives off.

        You re journalists, you know the situation. We re 
        in the middle of a new war on global terror. Here 
              at MI5 we ve been fighting it for years. 
 
 
Speeding along the Embankment. TOM on the phone in the back.

        Army bomb disposal teams have confirmed this was a 
          previously unexploded World War II bomb. Repeat, 
            this was not a terrorist incident. Make sure 
          that s the only message getting out. I want it 
                          across the board. WW-2. 
 
 
Everyone else in London has gone home for the night. 
 
 
A nondescript, homely row of cottagey terraces. 
 
 
Unknown POV - OSPREY, the woman from the safe house, walks 
with another man we haven t seen before. Call him ED. He says 
goodbye to OSPREY, and sets off down the street. 
 
                                  FEMALE VOICE 
                All ears, new face, new face is live. 
 
We will now see three people following him: 
ALPHA is a Pakistani man in a suit. 
BRAVO is a builder in a top that says  Lets Get Plastered . 
CHARLIE is a middle-aged woman with a shopping bag. 
 
Alpha walks behind Ed at a safe distance. Bravo walks behind 
Alpha. Charlie is across the street. Ed stops at a crossing. 
Alpha walks straight past Ed. 
Bravo crosses the street. Charlie moves around the corner.

                                    MALE VOICE 
                  Falco snagged. Charlie to zero zero. 
 
When Ed continues his walk, Charlie s now behind him. Bravo 
follows Charlie. Alpha s now across the street. A classic A-B-
C foot surveillance. But Ed has other ideas. A cab draws up. 
He gets in. 
 
                                  FEMALE VOICE 
                    Falco now with termite, no spark. 
 
The taxi drives away. A car pulls out, following. We now see: 
Ed is not alone in the back of the cab. MARY KANE is with him. 
They are talking. 
 
                                  ANOTHER VOICE 
          Delta picking up. Another new face, another new 
        face. Can you get a shot and continue following? 
 
POV--CAMERA LENS 
taking rapid snaps of MARY S face through the window. 
 
 
In a shitty lane, a shitty lockup. ROB opens up the door. 
STEVEN enters with a black holdall. 
 
 
MARY KANE and STEVEN exit the cottage, and walk to a car. They 
get in and drive off. 
 
                                    VOICE V.O. 
                Beta covering. Have a lovely evening. 
 
A previously unseen motorbike zooms off, following the car. 
And only now do we notice the Transco Gas van. 
 
 
ZOE and RINGO in gas board overalls, being eyed over a heavy 
door chain by an ELDERLY WOMAN. Ringo cannot be seen by the 
woman. He is spraying a tiny aerosol into the air. It s 
completely silent. 
 
                                        ZOE 
          Gas board, Madam. We ve had a report of a minor 
                            gas leak in the area. 
 
                              ELDERLY WOMAN (V.O.) 
                  I want to see your identification. 
 
ZOE hands over a perfectly official pass. 
 
                                        ZOE 
        There s a number on there if you want to call it. 
 
The ELDERLY WOMAN opens the door. Steps outside as RINGO 
conceals the aerosol. She sniffs... nods. 
 
                                  ELDERLY WOMAN 
                      Gas... yes, I can smell it... 
 
 
ZOE keeps a lookout as PAUL jimmies the door. Opens it. A grey 
cat slips between his legs, and into the darkness. 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  33

                                        PAUL 
                                        Shit. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        PAUL 
        I ve let the bloody cat out. You never said there 
                            was a moggy in here. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        Check the kitchen cupboards. 
                                  (he s blank) 
                                    Cat food! 
 
PAUL runs off. RINGO has now joined ZOE. 
 
                                        RINGO 
                  That granny s away to her sister s. 
                                (sees her face) 
                                        What? 
 
PAUL appears with a saucer of dry catfood. 
 
                                        PAUL 
        That s dry kibble there, and I found some old tuna 
        flakes in the bin, so I ve sprinkled them on with 
          a bit of olive oil cos sometimes they like it a 
                                    bit moist. 
 
                                        RINGO 
                    What the bloody hell s going on? 
 
He s pulled inside. ZOE is left alone with the saucer. She 
pulls out a phone. It starts to rain. 
 
 
TOM on his mobile by the entrance. Party chatter from inside. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Patch me through. 
 
 
ZOE in the pissing rain carrying the saucer. On the phone. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          I ve lost the bloody cat. 
 
INTERCUT CONVERSATION: 
 
TOM is calm, reassuring--a star. 
 
                                        TOM 
          If you don t find it by your cutoff, trash the 
        place, make it look good. We ll plant a break-in 
                  story in the local rag, no problem.

                                        ZOE 
                                  I m sorry Tom. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Keep the head. Keep in touch. Okay? Zoe? Zoe? 
                                (bad reception) 
                                        Zoe? 
 
Tom ends the call, sees MAISIE sitting at the bottom of the 
stairs. Watching. She GIGGLES. Ellie arrives, picks her up. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              Everything alright? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Sort of... 
                                (he can t do it) 
                      Few problems with a project. 
 
ELLIE smiles, apparently convinced. 
 
 
ZOE is soaked to the skin. RINGO joins her. 
 
                                        RINGO 
                Johnny s looking in the cottage again. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    Where s he looking, in the kettle? 
 
                                    JOHN O.S. 
                                Hey Miss Marple. 
 
She turns. He s framed in the doorway. A cat in his arms. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              Will you marry me? 
 
                                        JOHN 
                        He must have crept back in. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          Right. Find a hairdryer. 
 
JOHN stares at her, briefly confused. 
 
SEQUENCE--WIRING UP THE HOUSE: 
-- bugs are placed in light fittings instead of screws; 
-- hole drilled in the ceiling, pinhole camera fitted; 
-- back of the TV, radio, alarm clock... all replaced; 
-- finally: a grey cat is blowdried to purrfection.

The gas van departs the lane exactly as they found it. Two 
seconds later, MARY KANE s car turns in. 
 
 
The local bin men do the bins on the street. An older worker 
picks up MARY s rubbish. 
 
 
Thames House has views over London. Windy but wonderful. Blows 
the cobwebs away. TOM, however, is angry. Pacing. 
 
                                        HARRY 
        Tom, I m sorry... Mary Kane is a hot name to drop 
        in Washington right now. They re frothing at the 
                                  mouth for her. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  How did they know? They can t know-- 
 
                                        HARRY 
          Home Office know. And now so do the Americans. 
          We re in the middle of a war against terrorists 
        and finally it looks like we may even have caught 
          one. No wonder the Americans are going loopy. 
        She s not just a scalp, Tom, right now Mary Kane 
          is the Hope Diamond. The Yanks want to get her 
          into custody and back home as soon as possible. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Well that s tough, isn t it?

                        I know you want those cells. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Her husband s going to the chair she s got 
          nineteen bombs to commemorate it--most of them 
          capable of destroying a building full of people. 
            She s got cells and supporters all over the 
          country, potentially. But we won t know anything 
        about them if Special Branch stick her in bloody 
                                        jail! 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Shoulder to shoulder means exactly that, Tom. 
          Unfortunately in this case. You re quite friendly 
              with the CIA London liaison, aren t you? 
 
                                        TOM 
          I m in no mood to schmooze Christine Dale. I d 
                          rather bite her head off. 
 
HARRY s pager buzzes. He consults it without a flicker and 
shoots TOM a look that says-- how prescient of you .

FOXTROT s POV from inside surveillance car: MARY KANE and 
STEVEN walking. Soundtrack crackles and dialogue is 
occasionally faint--but we still hear them speaking, despite 
them being far away. A long-range parabolic surveillance mic. 
 
                                        STEVEN 
                                This is madness. 
 
MARY glances towards us... POV changes, shifts... re-
establishes audio contact... 
 
                                        MARY 
        ...I ve made up my mind. Goodbye, Steven. And try 
                  to forget everything I ve told you. 
 
They shake hands. STEVEN continues walking. MARY glances 
towards the surveillance car and crosses road, to go into the 
church. 
 
                                    MAN S VOICE 
                  Stay with Target A. Watcher please. 
 
 
A man in suit and tie (FOXTROT)gets out of the surveillance 
car and walks into the church. 
 
 
Kids zoom around in this brightly-coloured area. RACHEL is 
sitting here, her youngest child one of the zoomers. 
 
ZOE arrives-- with JIMMY. He runs off to play in the sand. Zoe 
sits on the bench next to RACHEL. ZOE removes the coffee 
carryout. A gigantic steaming cup. 
 
RACHEL sniffs the air--ZOE sniffs her coffee. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    Oh, dammit. 
 
RACHEL turns to her. ZOE smiles ruefully. KEITH passes in the 
background...  strolling ... keeping an eye. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
        Must have taken the wrong cup. Bloody hazelnut or 
                                      something. 
                                        (beat) 
                          You don t want it do you? 
                                (Rachel s unsure) 
                    Please. I ll only throw it away. 
 
RACHEL takes the coffee. Sniffs it hungrily. Drinks. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
        I ll tell you what, it s an expensive habit these 
                        days. Two quid that cost me. 
 
ZOE lifts her bag onto the bench. RACHEL glances down to see a 
Pro Life sticker on the bag. She smiles. 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  45

                                        RACHEL 
                                    Thank you. 
 
ANOTHER ANGLE--LONG LENS 
The two women begin to chat in a friendly way. 
 
 
ZOE and RACHEL walk towards the car park. Their kids toddle 
around in front of them. ZOE glances at her watch. 
 
                                        RACHEL 
        It s just informal. And if you re new to the area, 
        it s a nice way to meet... like-minded people--you 
                                        okay? 
 
A phone rings. ZOE fishes for it.

                                  (into phone) 
                                        Hi... 
                            (listens--mood changes) 
            What? Oh, no... I ll be there. Look, I ll get 
                          there as soon as I can. 
        She hangs up. Colour drains from her face... tears 
                                        come. 
 
                                        RACHEL 
                              Is everything okay? 
 
                                        ZOE 
        My friend s eight months pregnant, she s gone to 
          hospital...complications. I have to go, I have to-
                                  -oh, dammit! 
                                  (a thought) 
                      You don t have a car do you? 
 
RACHEL regards ZOE--comes to a decision. 
 
                                        RACHEL 
                          I ll take you. Come on. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    No, really, you don t have to-- 
 
                                        RACHEL 
                                  No problem. 
 
 
ZOE gets out of RACHEL s car. She s looking lost. RACHEL s 
coming with--

                                        ZOE 
                          No, no, don t be silly... 
 
                                        RACHEL 
                    You don t be silly... I ll just-- 
                                  (to ATTENDANT) 
                            Can I park somewhere? 
 
The attendant is DANNY. He s found her a space. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    Don t worry. I ll look after it. 
 
She pulls in, runs back to deal with ZOE. They both disappear 
inside--ZOE keeping her head down, RACHEL too... 
 
Danny moves quietly to the car. 
 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  48

RACHEL bundles her son into her car. DANNY observes all from 
the cab of an Ambulance. 
 
 
CHRISTINE and TOM could be ordinary folks on a date. 
 
                                        TOM 
        Unless you re here to get me a stay of execution 
            for Paul Kane I m a little pressed for word 
                                      games... 
 
                                      CHRISTINE 
                          You know how busy we are. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          We re all busy Christine. 
 
                                      CHRISTINE 
        Get the extradition signature, Tom, or we re both 
                        going to look like assholes. 
                                        (beat) 
                          This is non-negotiable. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Meaning? 
 
                                      CHRISTINE 
        You know the score these days. We re waging a war. 
        No stone unturned. No excuses. No delays. America 
        wants Mary back. And America s going to get her. 
                        We want our Kodak moment. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    I thought we were equal partners. 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  52

                                      CHRISTINE 
      We are. Which means, you don t get to stand around 
        and mean well, Tom. You actually have to get off 
          your butt sometimes and ... do exactly what we 
                                    tell you. 
 
She turns and walks in the opposite direction. 
 
 
TOM inhales the air. HELEN is here too, smoking. 
                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  57

                                        TOM 
                  Helen. Remind me why I do this job? 
 
                                        HELEN 
                  You liked the idea of a secret life. 
 
TOM regards her closely. HELEN returns the gaze. There s 
definitely something chemical here. 
 
                                  HELEN (CONT'D) 
                          Come on, Tom, it s true. 
 
He smiles, returns to contemplation. HELEN s not done yet. 
 
                                  HELEN (CONT D) 
          Even if I had a boyfriend... I mean, someone I 
        really cared about... I m not sure I d ever want 
            to tell them everything. There s something 
          comforting about having somewhere you can go. In 
                                    your head. 
 
                                        TOM 
          My last girlfriend didn t think so. Day after I 
            told her she told all her mates in the pub. 
 
                                        HELEN 
        You ve known Ellie long enough. Or, whatever her 
          name is. Sorry, I saw the vetting file--and I 
        mean, not that I looked or anything, I m sure she 
            won t blab. Not that it s any of my business, 
                                      obviously. 
                                    (Tom nods) 
                    So get over yourself. Tell her. 
                                      (silence) 
                  Come on, what have you got to lose? 
 
HELEN has pushed it too far. She instantly regrets it as TOM 
ices over. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Her. 
 
HARRY arrives, spies TOM. Approaches. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    We have a salvo from the floor. 
 
 
A new day. Everyone who knows better is asleep. 
 
 
MARY carries a small holdall. Passes a baby in a pram. Stops 
to coo at her little face.

        Don t think much of Sullivan s weekends. When do 
                                we go shopping? 
 
 
ZOE drives towards the market.

          Alpha Zero, Bravo One. Proceeding to away point 
                                    two over. 
 
Suddenly we see a blue Micra, being driven by MARY. 
 
                                      VOICE ONE 
            That s a contact! Jesus, we ve got her. Blue 
                                        Micra. 
 
 
ZOE passes in her car--followed after a few seconds by MARY. 
 
 
ZOE pulls into a space. MARY s Micra passes in the b.g. 
 
                                    VOICE THREE 
                  We have a contact, contact, contact. 
 
MARY drives calmly in, parks near the exit, fifty feet away. 
 
The Biker on a motorbike enters moments later, parks in the 
bike zone. Removes her helmet, holds it in MARYs direction. 
 
POV--HELMET CAM 
 
We see the car park bounce around. The market is relatively 
busy--a few couples, pensioners, singles, meandering amongst                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  62

the terracotta pots. 
 
 
ZOE pretends to be adjusting her seat. 
 
                                  DANNY S VOICE 
        Okay Zoe, contact confirmed. Move it along inside, 
            she s waiting for you. Sound off if you re in 
                        visual with agent or target. 
 
ZOE gets out of the car. Nerves jangling. 
 
We walk with her as she slowly approaches MARY, who is 
pretending to admire some gnomes. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          She s looking at gnomes. 
 
                                  DANNY S VOICE 
        Keep it together Zoe. The gnomes are on your side. 
 
As she gets closer and closer to MARY...a variety of 
customers, workers, pensioners, daytrippers--all sound off                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  63

quietly... everyone in this place is a spook. 
 
                                      VOICE ONE 
                                Alpha One clear. 
 
                                      VOICE TWO 
                      Alpha Two, target approaching. 
 
BRIEFLY, IN SLO-MO: 
 
MARY turns--and exits--the two women pass each other. A polite 
smile. Good morning to you. 
 
 
ZOE is waiting calmly by the gnomes as a whirlwind of chatter 
buzzes in her ear. 
She can see MARY approaching ZOE s car. When she emerges into 
clear vision again, she s not holding the bag anymore. 
 
                              DISPOSAL EXPERT V.O. 
                    Full spectrum ready when you are.

                                  On my signal. 
 
MARY removes her phone and starts to walk away. ZOE moves 
towards her, to get a view  
  
                              DISPOSAL EXPERT V.O. 
                                      Engaging.  
 
TOM is already out of the van-- MARY sees him. Susses the 
situation immediately. Stand off. TOM takes a step towards 
her--her thumb moves to the button. TOM stops. 
 
She smiles. Glances over at ZOE. 
 
MARY presses send--nothing. She presses it again. And again. 
Frustration builds into a scream as she keeps pressing-! She 
stares at her phone s display. It reads:  NETWORK SEARCH...  
 
 
An unidentifiable army bomb disposal van. 
 
 
MARY stands, frozen to the spot, pressing buttons on her 
mobile. TOM calmly walks over, puts his hand on her arm and 
takes the mobile from her.

Spooks converge on them from all over the market. 
 
 
The one we saw at the beginning. A moment s peace. 
 
 
DANNY and ZOE are staring out at the night. Still tense. 
 
                                        ZOE 
        You know on my first posting I got to look through 
                  Andrew and Fergie s mobile decrypts. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      No way!

                                    Any good?

                            Quite sweet actually. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          Right. According to you. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              Yes, according to me. Don t I know sweet? 
 
A little frisson here. Not much, but enough for a glance. A 
charge. ZOE deflects to the sky (not directly above!). 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                      What s that--is that Jupiter?

                                    What about? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    I did get someone pregnant. Once. 
                                      (silence) 
                    It was at school. Stupidly young.

                                        Sorry. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s okay. Amazing what you can forget if you                                                       Spooks\Season 1\Episode 1 Page  69

                        really put your mind to it. 
 
HELEN arrives. Nods of recognition. Roof posse. 
 
                                        HELEN 
          Hi. Your car s here. Oh--and Danny, the flat s 
          come through, the room s yours, if you want it. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Excellent. 
 
ZOE looks at DANNY. She can t believe it. They re walking-- 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            Wait, wait--what room? 
 
 
A car zooms past a sign to Heathrow. 
 
 
TOM, ZOE and DANNY walk back to a darkened car (MI5 RANGE 
ROVER) parked further down the road. Headlights illuminate 
their face. Their eyes. 
 
We hear: the sounds of jail guards. Footsteps. Clanking doors. 
The precursor to execution: 
 
                              AMERICAN GUARD V.O. 
                              Dead man walking! 
 
We INTERCUT with A PERCUSSIVE SERIES OF SHOTS: 
 
 
Different take teams bursting down different doors--shields 
and guns--one, two, three times. 
 
 
Our three get into the car. It drives off into the night.
