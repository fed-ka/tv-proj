          A beautiful summer morning on this glittering mountain
          lake in the far north of Penobscot County.  Small fishing
          boats dot the water.  Smoke rises from campfires along
          the shore.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        The fish aren't hungry but I am.


  22ANGLE ON THE BANNERMAN BOAT

          JOHNNY and WALT are at the stern while J.J. is in the
          bow.  All three are dressed for camping.  They have fishing
          gear, but no fish.  J.J. pulls his line out of the water.

                                        J.J.
                        I'm bored.

                                        WALT
                        Fishing takes time J.J.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we're using the wrong kind
                        of worms.

                                        WALT
                                (annoyed)
                        Oh?  What kind of worms would you
                        recommend?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The kind that fish eat.

          Walt is trying to be helpful, but there's an edge to his
          dealings with Johnny.

          J.J. tries to impale a fresh worm on his hook.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here, J.J., let me help with that--

          He quickly paws through the can of worm dirt, picking up
          several worms, until--          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - TEASER - 6/02/03 - BLUE      2.

          A TROUT THE SIZE OF VERMONT RACES TOWARD US, MOUTH OPEN...

          Johnny allows himself a little smile as he hands the pole
          with the baited hook back to J.J.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Try this one.

          J.J. drops the line in the water--

                                        WALT
                        And be patient--

          There's an IMMEDIATE TUG on J.J.'s line--

                                        J.J.
                                (as surprised as anyone)
                        Dad!  I've got one!

                                        WALT
                                (gives Johnny a look)
                        Okay, okay, hold on--

          J.J. pulls a flopping trout into the boat.  Momentary
          excitement as this beast of the depths is subdued.

                                        J.J.
                          I caught a fish!

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a whopper too.

                        worms.

                        How's it going?

          Johnny watches Walt haul the boat ashore as J.J. SPLASHES
          into the shallow water.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's going.

                                        SARAH
                        Hang in there.

                        Ow!  I stepped on something.

          J.J. almost drops the trout.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, honey, did you cut your foot?

                        There's something down there.

          Walt reaches down and pulls something metallic out of the
          water.

                                        WALT
                          Aluminum.  Looks like a piece of
                        a boat.

          He hands it to Johnny, whose hand starts to SHAKE--

          OF AN AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE, WHICH GROWS INTO A SMALL JET

          JOHNNY LOOKS UP AND SEES THE SMOKY TRAIL OF THE PLANE AS

          Dazed by this vision as he holds up the fragment.

          FADE IN:


          A shack by the lake.  Several handsome young people in
          bathing suits, a surprising number of them women in their
          early 20s, stroll in and out.

                        It might be.



          CLOSE on a SNAKE slithering across the path.  REVERSE to
          find J.J., Walt, Sarah, Johnny and Pauline stopping dead

                          Careful!

          The ranger -- RANDY TURMAN -- is in his mid-thirties. 
          He's good-looking, rugged, totally in control of his
            surroundings.  He SCOOPS UP the snake.

                        Wanna touch?

          J.J. is torn between fear and fascination.

                                        J.J.
                                (to Walt and Sarah)
                        Can I?

                        Is it poisonous?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are no poisonous snakes in
                        Maine.

            Everyone, including Ranger Turman, looks his way.

                                        TURMAN
                        Like Ireland.  This is a milk
                        snake.  It only looks like the
                        North American coral snake--

          Hesitantly, J.J. touches the snake as it coils up and
          around Turman's arms.

                                        J.J.
                        It's not slimy.

                                        TURMAN
                        Nope.  What's your name?

                        Well, J.J., it's the color of the
                        bands that lets you know.  "Red

          J.J. laughs -- but the ranger is still holding the snake.

                        If he says he saw it, that's what
                          happened.

                        Really.  What exactly did you
                        see?

          Johnny orients himself, and raises his right hand toward
          the mountain.

                        Just an impression I got off the
                        piece of metal.  Inside a cargo
                        plane.  Pilots fighting for control --
                        the engine stalled -- they went
                        into a dive toward that peak.

          Turman glances at Pauline.  Interesting.

                                        TURMAN
                        All that from a piece of metal? 
                        Seems impossible, but if you're
                        right, I need to go up there. 
                        There are two families who had
                        nothing to bury.  Sure like to
                        find some closure for them.  Think
                        if I took you up there we could
                        find the crash site?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not the hiker I used to be,
                        but I might be able to narrow
                        down the search.

                        Sure.  We'll be right behind.

                        You listen to Ranger Turman though.

          Marc and Pauline watch as Johnny catches up to the rest
          of the group.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          A couple of hours later.  It is now mid-afternoon.  Johnny
          catches up with Walt and Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        How's the leg holding up?

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a white lie)
                        So far the hike is easier than
                        one of Bruce's workouts.

                                        WALT
                        Well at least somebody is bonding
                        with J.J.

          He nods ahead--


          ANGLE - J.J. WITH TURMAN

          Turman is pointing to some object in a tree, to J.J.'s
          rapt attention.

                                        SARAH
                        Don't listen to him.  Now's your
                        chance to catch up.  J.J.'s

                        J.J. and I to get to know each

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        now this has become about one of
                        my visions.  I was just hoping it
                        could be... normal.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, if you're waiting for the
                        perfect moment it's never going
                        to happen.  Now go on.

          Johnny looks at her, thinks about it for a beat, then
          heads off to catch up with J.J. and the Ranger, leaving
          Sarah behind with Walt.

                                        WALT
                        What if he's right?  What if it
                        just isn't meant to be?

          Sarah watches Johnny go, hoping that's not true.


  16A16AJ.J. AND TURMAN

          Looking up into a tree at a large bird's nest as Johnny
          catches up.

                                        J.J.
                        Johnny look, Ranger Randy showed
                        me an owl's nest.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh yeah, look at that.  Spotted
                        Owl?

                                        TURMAN
                        Logging back in the 70's almost
                        wiped em out.

                                        J.J.
                        Aren't they endangered?

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impressed)
                        That's right J.J. ...Everything
                        in this forest is interconnected. 
                        If the owls weren't here to feed
                        on the small animals, this whole
                        habitat could be damaged.

          Johnny starts looking around on the ground directly beneath
          the nest.

                                        J.J.
                        Whatcha looking for?

          Johnny finds something, sweeping away some debris on the
          ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Owls are predators -- they eat
                        small mammals like mice -- and
                        they swallow them whole because
                        they don't have teeth.  They can't
                        digest the bones, so they spit
                        them out in what's called a pellet. 
                        There's one right here.

          J.J. leans in close to see.


          E.C.U. - AN OWL PELLET

            A crushed up mouse skeleton about the size of an egg.

                                        J.J.
                        Cool.  It's like a smushed up
                          skeleton.  Can I touch it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.  Here, go show it to your
                        mom, she'll love it.

          Johnny puts the pellet in J.J.'s hand, and he goes running
          off with it.


          JOHNNY AND TURMAN

          Continue up the trail.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know your park.

                                        TURMAN
                        Well, I am the ranger.
                                (beat)
                        You do all right, too.  Most
                          visitors wouldn't know the
                        difference between a milk snake
                        and a milk shake.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I used to teach high school biology 
                        down in Cleaves Mills.

                                        TURMAN
                        Nice town.  A little crowded.

          Johnny can't help laughing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Cleaves Mills?  Too crowded?

                                        TURMAN
                        Guess I'm not what you'd call a
                        people person.  Hell even Spirit
                        Lake is getting a little crowded
                        for me.  Park Service cabin is
                        just a few bends ahead.  We'll
                        camp there tonight.

          Just then a SCREAM draws there attention.  Johnny and
          Turman turn to see:

          Walt is laughing as J.J. shows Sarah the owl pellet,
            thrusting it right in her face.

                        Yes.  Yes.  It's very nice.  Now

          A meal and several hours later.  A fire burns down as
          Johnny, Sarah, Walt, J.J. and Turman sit around the
            campfire.

                                        TURMAN
                        --they heard the snap of a branch. 
                        No one was supposed to be there. 
                        At first they thought it was a
                        black bear.  Or maybe a brush
                        wolf.

          Yes, Turman is in full scary story mode.  J.J. is
          listening, trying to keep cool.  It's not working.

                                        TURMAN
                        So Ned, the first logger, goes to
                          investigate.  Wham!  He disappears
                                (J.J. jumps)
                        The other logger, whose name was
                        Gerald, takes the rifle and goes
                        to investigate.  Because he knows
                        better than to go into the forest
                          alone... at night.

          Turman's voice dies.  Stays dead.  After a moment--

                                        J.J.
                        Then what?

                                        TURMAN
                        They tracked him into the woods,
                        where the footprints suddenly
                        ended, as if he'd been yanked
                        into mid-air.  Gerald and Ned
                        were never seen again.

          J.J. can't help gasping.  Sarah, too.

                                        SARAH
                                  (prompting)
                        Of course, this all happened a
                        looong time ago, right?

                                        TURMAN
                                (picking up the hint)
                        True.

                        The Old Man of Mount Mannesquan 
                        retired to Florida in, what, 1992?

          This gets a laugh, especially from J.J.

                                        TURMAN
                        Okay, park rule: scary stories
                        must be followed by marshmallows.

          He pulls a bag out of his pack, then starts searching for
          sticks.

                                        J.J.
                        Cool!

          While everyone else gets ready for Marshmallows, something
          catches Johnny's attention, drawing his look off into the
          darkness


    18A18AJOHNNY'S POV: THE STALKER - JOHNNY - INTERCUTTING

          Standing in the darkness, just beyond the light thrown
          from the fire.  It's eerie, like he's lit from another
          dimension.  He's staring at Johnny, saying something, but
          there's no sound coming from his mouth.  Johnny strains
          to see him, not even sure he's there.  The Stalker's hand
          is in his pocket, and just as he's about to take it out
          to show something to Johnny...

    18B18BRESUME - WIDER

          Johnny turns to Sarah...

                        ...I thought I saw something.

          Johnny turns back, the Stalker is gone.  Everyone else
          looks -- nothing there.

                                        WALT
                                (having fun)
                        Maybe it's the Old Man of Mount
                          Mannesquan...

          J.J.'s eyes widen.  He tucks up against Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt...

          Johnny knows he saw something, but isn't sure if it's a
          vision or real.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Guess it's nothing...

          Johnny's attention returns to the group as he shakes off
          the weird vision.  J.J. barely has the first marshmallow
          in the fire when CRUNCH!  A sound from THE WOODS STARTLES
          THE HELL out of them all.

          Sarah.

                        Well... this is a surprise.

                        It's a big mountain. Thought you
                        could use a hand.

                                (to Johnny and company)
                        Marc spent three summers searching
                        the mountain for that plane, so I
                        guess we can't blame him for
                        wanting to help.

                        I, ah, hope it's all right.

                        An extra pair of eyes might be
                          helpful.

                        And I've got something to show
                        Mr. Smith here.

          Marc takes a handkerchief out of his pack and peels it
          open to reveal another piece of metal -- this one is a
          bolt that is twisted and bent.  Everyone watches as Marc
          unwraps the bolt and hands it to Johnny --

          The twisted bolt grows into the storm battered tail of
          the plane.  As the rudder is buffeted by turbulence, the
          bolt rips loose and the rudder is peeled away by the wind,
          sending the plane into a dive.          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT ONE - 6/05/03 - GREEN   17.

          J.J., Walt and Sarah head into the cabin as Johnny grabs
          his sleeping bag.  Johnny exchanges a look with Pauline,
          who gives him a friendly smile.  Maybe too friendly.



          Johnny returns from a trip to the bushes to find Marc
          toasting the last of the marshmallows.

          left alone by the fire, looks back into the woods where
          he saw the Stalker earlier.

          Nothing there.

          shrugs it off.  Notices one marshmallow left.

          FADE IN:


          A tense Johnny and Walt sit before the campfire as Turman
          waits for Marc to take up position.  Both carry pistols. 
          They are nervous.

                                        WALT
                        Why are you doing this?

                        This was never about finding the
                        dead pilots was it?  There's
                          something on that plane you want.

          It's a guess, not a vision.  But it hits home.  Pauline
          ELBOWS Marc.

                                        TURMAN
                        I told you not to let him touch

                        Doesn't matter now.  You two should
                        have stayed back at the lake like
                        we agreed.

                        If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't

                        So what's this two million dollar
                        cargo?

          Turman and Marc react, this guy is good.

                                        TURMAN
                        That's where it gets interesting. 
                        We're not sure.  All we know is
                        there's a single package insured
                        for over two million dollars.          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/05/03 - GOLD    22.



          Pauline SHOVES Sarah into view.  Walt and Johnny RISE as
          one, but Marc is there, covering them.  Pauline hands the
          walkie to Turman.

                        You might want to put this
                          someplace safe.

                        All right, Mom knows, too.  That
                        makes everything simpler.

                        Okay, all of you.  This kind of
                        hero stuff is only going to get
                        someone hurt.  You don't want
                        that, and we don't want that.  So
                        here's what's going to happen. 
                        J.J.'s a great kid; he doesn't
                        need to know anything.  As far as
                        he's concerned, we're just on a
                        little treasure hunt.  The rest
                        of you behave yourselves, and
                        nobody gets hurt.  Understood?

          Walt knows he has to buy time.  He and Sarah nod in silent
          agreement.

                                        TURMAN*
                        It's okay.  I love the little*
                        guy.*

                                        SARAH*
                                (covering her fear)*
                        We'll be right here J.J.*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Ever been on a treasure hunt,*
                        J.J.?*

                                        J.J.*
                        No sir!*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Well, this is kind of like that,*
                        except your friend Johnny here is*
                        our treasure map.*

                                        J.J.*
                          Cool...*

          Johnny and Turman exchange a look.*

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:*          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/06/03 - WHT-2   26.*



          An hour or so later.  The terrain is up and down, rocky,
            heavily-wooded.  No one is going too fast, except for
          J.J., who is happily scampering up and down every rock in
          sight.


          MARC AND PAULINE*

          hike along, keeping an eye on Walt and Sarah.*

                                        MARC*
                        First thing I'm gonna do with our*
                        share, baby, is buy you a proper*
                        wedding ring with a diamond about*
                        the size of my fist.*

                                        PAULINE*
                                  (playfully)*
                        About time... what's the second*
                        thing you're going to do?*

          Marc slides up next to her and whispers in her ear.*

                                        PAULINE*
                        Mmm... aren't you the bad boy...*


          WALT AND SARAH*

          listen to Marc and Pauline, seething.  Walt plays it cool,*
          but his eyes are scanning his captors, his cop's mind*
          constantly updating escape scenarios.*


          JOHNNY, TURMAN AND J.J.*

          J.J. finds a big chunk of black basalt.*

                                        J.J.*
                        Look what I found.

          He hands it to Turman first.

                                        TURMAN
                        That's a beauty.*

          Turman logically hands the rock back to J.J.  Johnny sees*
          an opportunity.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's see that, J.J.*

          The touch of the rock leads to --*          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  26A.



          Johnny, J.J., Sarah and Walt eating trail mix.  Only J.J.*
          has an appetite.  Marc watches them like a hawk.*

                                        J.J.*
                        I want to be a Ranger when I grow*
                        up.*

                                        WALT*
                          I thought you wanted to be a cop.*

                                        J.J.*
                        I want to be a copy and a Ranger...*
                        and a scientist.*

                                        SARAH*
                                (finding a ray of*
                                  sunshine)*
                        I'm sure you'll be all of those*
                        things and more.*


          ANGLE ON PAULINE*

          rifling through her and Marc's packs, getting frustrated.*

                                        PAULINE*
                          I thought I told you to pack some*
                        of those power bars.*

                                        MARC*
                        I did.*

                                        PAULINE*
                                (bitchy)*
                        Well, they aren't here.*

          A window into a day in the life of Marc and Pauline -- it*
          ain't pretty.*

                                        MARC*
                        Lemme look.*

          Marc walks over to Pauline, turning his back on Johnny*
          and the others.  As he bends over to search through the*
          packs, his shirt rides up, revealing the gun tucked in*
          the back of his pants.*


          JOHNNY AND WALT*

          see this.  Eyes locked on the gun, Walt hands his water*
          bottle to Johnny, triggering --*          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  29A.*


  4141*A VISION

          Walt sees his chance and takes it, running the ten steps*
          across the trail, tackling Marc from behind, their momentum*
          knocking Pauline and the packs aside.  Walt and Marc fight*
          for the gun, Marc getting off a wild shot before Walt*
          subdues him, winding up on top with his knee in Marc's*
          back.  But then --*

                                        SARAH*
                                (quiet, almost*
                                  surprised)*
                          ...Walt...*

          Johnny and Walt turn to see:*


          SARAH*

          hands clutched to her stomach, bleeding, a look of surprise*
          on her face as she collapses.*

                                                                          VISION ENDS:*


  4242*JOHNNY & WALT

          Just as Johnny takes the water bottle from Walt, who we*
          see is coiling like a spring, ready to --*


          WIDER*

          as Walt makes his move, running toward Marc, and disaster.*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Walt, NO!*

          It's all the warning Marc needs, turning just in time to*
          sidestep Walt and pull his gun, bashing Walt in the head*
          as they go down.*

                                        SARAH*
                        Oh my god!*

                                        J.J.*
                        Daddy!*

          Marc pulls himself free, leaving Walt on the ground,*
            bleeding.  Sarah and J.J. run to Walt who staggers to his*
          feet, wiping the blood from his head.  All three look to*
          Johnny, a mixture of fear and confusion on their faces.*

                                        WALT*
                        What the hell's wrong with you,*
                          Johnny?*


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT TWO - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  29B.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I saw it -- Sarah you were -- it*
                        wasn't going to work...*

          Just then Turman returns, gun drawn, standing next to*
          Johnny.*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Listen to your friend, Sheriff. *
                        He's never wrong.  Said so*
                        yourself.*

          Walt glares at Johnny and Turman.  Off Johnny's look...*

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          Walt is on his feet, hands in the air.  Marc holds a gun
          on him.  (He is shaking with anger.)  Pauline has her
          pistol aimed at Johnny and Sarah, who holds onto J.J.*

                                        TURMAN*
                                  (disappointed)*
                        All you people had to do was play
                        along.
                                (to Walt)
                        But you had to be the big hero--

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did you expect?  You can't*
                        kidnap a man's family and not
                        expect him to do something--

          But Turman isn't listening to Johnny.

                                        MARC*
                        Well, you can't expect me not to
                        do something either.

                                        TURMAN*
                        Calm down.  Take him back the way*
                        we came a few hundred yards and
                        tie him up where some hiker won't
                        see him.

                                        MARC
                        Don't you think...

                                        TURMAN
                        Just do what I tell you for once.*

                                        SARAH
                                (to Turman)
                        Then what?













                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT THREE - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  31.


    43CONTINUED:43

          Pauline answers for him--

                                        PAULINE
                        Then you shut up and do what you're*
                        told.

          Sarah looks at her with loathing.  Turman gives Pauline a
          look that says, "Stay out of it."

                                        TURMAN
                        Like I've been saying all along. 
                        Mr. Smith helps us find the plane,*
                        then everybody gets to go home. 
                        By the time you three pick up the
                        Sheriff and trek back down to the*
                        lake, we'll be across the border--

          Turman is getting impatient -- he tosses Marc a coil of*
          rope.*

                                        TURMAN
                        Get going!  You can catch up with*
                        us at the bridge.*
                                (then to Walt)
                        Leave the pack.

          As Walt passes, he peels off the pack and hands it to
          Johnny, triggering --


4444A VISION - AT THE EDGE OF A RIVER GORGE

          Marc marches Walt to a spot at the edge of a gorge
          overlooking a rushing river below.  Walt looks at the
          drop off, then turns around to face Marc, who stops about
          ten feet back from the edge.

                                        WALT
                        Now what?

                                        MARC
                        Turn around so I can tie you up.

          Walt turns around.

                                        WALT
                        You hurt my wife and kid, I'll
                        kill you.

                                        MARC
                        You don't need to worry about
                        that...

          The view WIDENS TO REVEAL Johnny, standing next to Marc,

    44CONTINUED:44

          watching as Marc drops the coil of rope and aims his gun*
          at Walt's back.*

                          ...anymore.

          And Marc fires the gun...

          VISION SLOWS to bullet time as the bullet inches its way*
          toward Walt.

          Johnny reacts in horror as the VISION SNAPS TO NORMAL*
          SPEED and the bullet hits Walt in the back.  Johnny watches*
          helpless as Walt falls dead over the edge of the cliff*
          and we HEAR A SPLASH from below.

                                        MARC
                        Shoulda jumped when you had the
                        chance.

          Walt handing off the pack to Johnny.

                        Jump.

          Walt's first reaction is annoyance -- what the hell is
          Johnny talking about?  Then he remembers just who's talking
          to him.

                                        MARC
                        Hey.  Shut up you two.

          Marc pushes Walt along.  J.J. runs to him.

                        your mom now.  It's okay.

                                        MARC
                        Go on kid, do as your Dad says.

          Sarah pulls J.J. away as Marc marches Walt off.  Pauline*
          and Turman exchange a look about Marc that makes us wonder*
          what they're thinking.  Sarah turns to Johnny, her eyes*
          pleading for a way out of this as Turman starts them*
          marching away.*

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:*



          A railroad bridge that has seen better decades.  Reaching*
          the head of the bridge, Turman pauses.  The view CRANES*
          UP to reveal the depth of the river gorge below.  Pauline*
          looks at the shear drop.*

                                        PAULINE*
                        You're not really thinking of*
                        going across that are you?*

                                        TURMAN*
                        Don't worry, I have an idea.*

          He steps aside and politely motions with his gun for Johnny*
          to pass him.*

                                        TURMAN*
                        All right, Smith, you're the
                          psychic.
                                (points to the bridge)
                        You go first.*

          A beat.  Then Johnny steps forward onto the bridge,*
          gingerly touching each plank with his foot before stepping*
          on it.*


4747A VISION - (BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET)

          The board cracks into splinters, and Johnny plunges through
          the opening, hurtling down to the rocks below, dying.*

                                                                          VISION ENDS:          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT THREE - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  34.*


    47A47A*RESUME - REALITY

          Johnny decides to skip that board.*


    47B47B*VISION RESUMES - (BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW THAT)

          He takes a few steps more, testing each board as he goes.*


          ANOTHER BOARD BREAKS*

          and Johnny falls through, but this time, the VISION FREEZES*
          before he falls all the way through, THEN REVERSES, Johnny*
          popping back up onto the bridge.*


          HE TRIES THE NEXT BOARD*

          It breaks, too.  Again Johnny falls through, and again*
          the VISION FREEZES, then REVERSES, Johnny popping back up*
          on the bridge.*


  4848RESUME - REALITY

          Johnny back where he started - none of the boards broken,*
          it was all a vision.  He begins crossing the bridge,*
          careful not to step on the bad planks.  Turman watches,
          J.J. at his side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's no good.  Neither is
                        that one. Step here.

          Turman looks at the water below.

                                        TURMAN
                        Not that I don't trust you Mr.
                        Smith, but...

          Turman extends a hand to J.J.

                                        TURMAN
                        ...Take my hand.

          J.J. looks to Sarah, who looks to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go ahead, J.J.  I won't let
                          anything happen to you.

                                        SARAH
                        It's okay, baby.

          Turman takes J.J.'s hand, gripping it tightly.*




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT THREE - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  35.


    48CONTINUED:48

          Turman hits the next plank.  Solid.  The three of them*
          advance, followed by Sarah and Pauline.*



          A few hundred yards down the trail.  Marc pushes Walt
          along at gunpoint.  We hear water RUSHING PAST below. 
          Hard to tell which of them is more nervous.

                                        MARC
                        Over there.

          In a repeat of Johnny's vision, Marc marches Walt to a
          spot at the edge of a gorge overlooking a rushing river
          below.  Walt looks at the drop off, then turns around to
          face Marc, who stops about ten feet back from the edge.

                                        WALT
                        Now what?

                                        MARC
                        Turn around so I can tie you up.

                                        WALT
                        You hurt my wife and kid, I'll
                        kill you.

          He's moving as slowly as he can, trying to figure out
          what Johnny meant.  Turning to face the edge, he looks
          down to the river, forty feet below.

                                        MARC
                        You don't need to worry about
                        that...

          Walt realizes this must be the moment Johnny was talking
          about.

                                        WALT
                                (to himself)
                        Damn... Johnny...

          As Marc drops the rope and raises his gun in SLOW MOTION,*
          Walt looks down and...*

                                                                                CUT TO:*



          Johnny, J.J. and Turman -- are just reaching the other
          side.  Sarah and Pauline follow, half a dozen planks behind
          as Marc's SHOT ECHOES.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT THREE - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  35A.

                        Walt!

          Johnny looks back at her.  He wants to be reassuring, but
          there's nothing he can say out loud.*

                        Stay focused, Sarah.*
                                (then, re: a plank)*
                        This one.*

          J.J. and Turman step as Johnny does.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And... this one.

          The final plank.  They have reached the other side.  They
          turn to wait for Sarah and Pauline.

                                        TURMAN
                                (getting impatient)
                          Pauline, do you see Marc anywhere?

          Pauline looks down river.

                                        PAULINE
                        Not yet.

          Sarah reaches the safety of the far side.  J.J. runs to
          her arms; Turman lets him.  Pauline is still working her
          way across the last few steps, leaving Johnny alone with
          Turman.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Marc knows you're nailing his
                        wife. 

          Turman reacts, surprised Johnny knows this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going to wait until we find
                        your cargo, and then he's going
                        to kill you, too.*

                                        TURMAN
                        Nice try Mr. Smith, but the mind
                        games aren't going to work.  One
                        thing I know about Marc is, he
                        has no impulse-control.  The fact
                        that I'm still breathing means he
                        doesn't know...
                                (then quietly
                                  threatening)
                        ...And you sure as hell aren't
                        going to tell him... understood?

                                        MARC (O.S.)
                        Hey, a little help!

          ANGLE - MARC

          He stands on the far side of the bridge, breathless.

                                        TURMAN*
                        What happened?*

                                        MARC*
                        Just a warning shot.  He tried to*
                        make a break.*

                                        TURMAN

                                at Johnny)
                        Hurry up, then.  I'll guide you.*


          SARAH, J.J., AND JOHNNY

          Sarah, terrified, silently mouths to Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                                (silent)
                        What happened to Walt?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (silently, shrugging)
                        I don't know yet...

          He reaches out and squeezes her hand as Sarah hugs J.J.


          ANGLE - THE BRIDGE

          Pistol in belt, Marc has made it halfway across.  Turman
          stands at the safe end, guiding.  Pauline is behind the
          ranger, pistol trained on Johnny, Sarah and J.J.

                                        TURMAN
                        Next... okay.  Keep going.

          Marc stops.

                                        MARC
                        This one looks bad--

                                        TURMAN
                        Then step over it.  Trust me, we*
                        all made it...*

          Marc steps over it.  Hears a CREAK, but doesn't fall. *
          He's halfway across.*

                        Now what?

          Marc steps.  Solid.  Steps again... close to the safe
          side now.

          Marc does, and he SMASHES THROUGH the rotted wood.  Sarah
          reacts, turning J.J. away. 

          Pauline RUSHES FORWARD, but hesitates, exchanging a look
          with Turman.

          Seeing that Marc is hanging on solidly, Turman turns his
          gun on Johnny.

                                        TURMAN
                        Help him up.

          SURVIVED THE JUMP... AND IS BEING CARRIED DOWNSTREAM... 
          ALIVE--


  5252RESUME

          Johnny has Turman's help now, pulling Marc to safety.

                                        TURMAN*
                                (to Marc)*
                        Sorry about that.  I must have*
                          mis-counted...*

          Pauline rushes to Marc, embracing him.

                                        PAULINE
                        Are you okay, baby?*

                                        MARC
                        Yeah, fine...

          He exchanges a look of grudging thanks with Johnny.  As*
          Marc and Pauline put on their packs, Johnny sneaks a smile*
          to Sarah, signaling her that Walt is alive.  Just then*
          Turman pulls Johnny aside.*

    52CONTINUED:52

                                        TURMAN*
                        I know you touched Marc.  What*
                        really happened with the Sheriff?*

                                        JOHNNY*
                                (lying well)*
                        You know what happened you bastard. *
                        Just don't tell his wife and kid.*

          Turman nods soberly.  Then...*

                                        TURMAN
                                  (lightening the mood)*
                        Okay Mr. Smith, upstream or*
                          downstream?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  All my visions so
                        far have been from up above the
                        trees.  It all looks so different
                        from here.  Without something to
                        touch, I can't really say.

          Turman thinks a beat.

                                        TURMAN
                        Marc... you still got that bolt?

                                        MARC
                        Yeah sure.

                                        TURMAN
                        Give it here.

          Marc digs it out of his pack and starts to give it to
          Turman, who avoids touching it.*

                                        TURMAN
                        Hand it to Mr. Smith.
                                (then to Johnny)
                        Maybe you can get another hit off
                        of this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't work like that...

                                        TURMAN
                        Try...*
                                (then subtly*
                                  threatening)*
                        What do you have to lose?*

          JOHNNY

          Takes the bolt from Marc...



          The view TILTS DOWN from the canopy of pine trees to reveal
          A HAND, snapping a low hanging branch.  The VIEW WIDENS
          TO REVEAL: Walt, wet but alive.  Listening to the sound
          of VOICES approaching from behind him, he moves off deeper
          into the forest.



            Following Johnny as Turman, J.J., Sarah,  Marc and Pauline
          leave the trail behind.

                                        J.J.
                        I'm tired.

                                        SARAH
                        Me too Sweetie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang in there J.J. You're being
                        super brave.

                                        J.J.
                        I want my Dad.

          Sarah and Johnny exchange a look.

                                        J.J.
                        What's going to happen to us?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You just stay close to your mom,
                          everything's gonna be okay.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


    55A55ATHROUGH THE TREES

          We get glimpses of the now familiar peak of Mt. Mannesquan
          ahead.



          Johnny and the others stop to rest and get a drink.

                                        TURMAN
                        We'll stop here for a minute,
                        give the kid a rest.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT FOUR - 6/04/03 - YELLOW  44.


    56CONTINUED:56

                                        MARC
                        I'm going to scout around up ahead.

                                        TURMAN
                        Suit yourself.  Give a shout if
                        you see anything.

          Turman offers his canteen to J.J., who just shakes his
          head no.

                                        TURMAN
                        That's okay kid, I guess I'd be
                        mad too.  Don't worry, you'll be
                        with your Dad soon enough.

          Sarah doesn't like the ambiguity of Turman's tone.  She
          takes J.J. away to sit down on a log. 


          JOHNNY

          Notices a broken branch on a tree at the edge of the
            clearing.  Curious he touches it and WE HEAR A DEAD ZONE
          WHOOSH.  Johnny looks around, surprised; Walt?  Here?


          RESUME WIDER - THE CLEARING

          Turman walks over to Johnny.

                                        TURMAN
                        You know Mr. Smith, I'm really
                          starting to respect this talent
                        of yours.  It's too bad we didn't
                        get a chance to meet under
                          different circumstances.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what was your plan anyway? 

                                        TURMAN
                        I was hoping I could come up here
                        with just you folks, find the
                        package and stash it someplace
                        where I could come back later for
                        it and nobody would be the wiser. 
                        I never intended for anybody to
                        get hurt.

          Just then Pauline catches up.

                                        PAULINE
                        How much farther?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT FOUR - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  45.


    56CONTINUED: (2)56

                                        TURMAN
                        Can't be too far, we're going to
                        be above the treeline pretty soon.
                                (then to Johnny)
                        You said it went down in the trees
                        didn't you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I saw.

                                        PAULINE
                                (taunting)
                        What else do you see Mr. Smith? 
                        If you're so psychic, tell me my
                          future...

          Johnny tries to ignore her.  Turman doesn't like where
          this is going.

                                        TURMAN
                          Pauline...*

                                        PAULINE
                        No.  I really want to know.  C'mon
                        Mr. Psychic, am I wrapped in a
                        mink in Switzerland or am I in
                        Rio, lying on the beach in a bikini
                        and pearls? 

                                        TURMAN
                                  (stronger)*
                        Pauline...

                                        PAULINE
                        I'm just having a little fun...
                                (then to Johnny)
                        Go ahead touch me.

          She gets right in front of Johnny, he just looks at her.

                                        PAULINE
                                (flirty)
                        What?  You don't want to touch
                        me?
                                (then sarcastically)
                        That's a first... alright, then
                        I'll touch you...

          She reaches out like a girl playing tag, touching Johnny
          with her finger, triggering:

          wound in her chest.  The view RAMPS OUT wider to reveal --


          TURMAN

          Holding a gun.  He looks up from Pauline, then takes the*
          gun AND SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE SHOULDER, giving himself a*
          nice through-and-through wound.  Gritting his teeth in*
          pain, he takes a few steps revealing:*


          MARC

          Also dead, bleeding from an unseen wound to the head. 
          Turman puts the clean gun in Marc's hand, pressing his
          fingers around the trigger to FIRE the gun off into a*
          nearby tree.  Next he pulls out his walkie talkie and*
          starts speaking, suddenly acting panicked and out of*
          breath.*

          As he walks away from Marc and Pauline the VIEW FOLLOWS*
          HIM TO REVEAL:*


          JOHNNY AND SARAH*

          Dead.  Face down.  J.J. is unseen, but Turman's demeanor*

          Johnny comes out of the vision, tempering his reaction.

                                        PAULINE
                        So?  What did you see?

                        The beach.  I knew it.

          Just then, Marc shouts from up ahead.

                                        MARC
                        I found it... the crash... it's
                        just up ahead.

          Everyone reacts.  Johnny and Sarah exchange a look. 
          Whatever is going to happen, is going to happen soon.

                                        TURMAN
                                (to Pauline)

                        No way.  I'm coming with you.

                                  (forcefully)

    58CONTINUED: (2)58

            A meaningful look passes between Turman and Pauline.  A
          decision has been made.  Kill Marc?

                                        PAULINE
                          Okay...*

          Nearby another look is passing between Johnny and Sarah. *
          Turning so Pauline and Turman can't see him, Johnny shifts
          his eyes to indicate the surrounding forest and mouths*
          "Walt".

                                        TURMAN
                        C'mon Mr. Smith, I want you with
                        me.


  5959MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          As he works his way up the mountain, Turman right behind
          as he catches up with Marc.

                                        MARC (O.S.)
                        It's right up here!



          Johnny and Turman round a bend, reacting to what they
          find:  the final resting place of First Direct 233.  Pieces
          of metallic debris and paper are scattered among the pine
          needles; some pieces HANG FROM TREES.

          Several large sections of the fuselage survived the crash,
          hidden beneath the dense forest canopy.

                                        MARC
                        No wonder they never found it
                        from the air.

          Unable to restrain himself, he PLUNGES into the rear hunk
          of fuselage, leaving Johnny and Turman alone for a moment.

                                        MARC (O.S.)
                        It's a mess in here - help me*
                        look.  It's a steel shipping*
                          container about yay big.

          He shapes a briefcase with his hands.

          Marc climbs out of the rear fuselage.

                                        MARC
                        Nothing here.

                                        TURMAN
                        Check the cockpit, everything
                        might have been thrown forward in
                        the crash.  Get in there and help
                        him Smith.

          Johnny goes--


  6161INSIDE THE FRONT SECTION

          Dark but for beams of light streaming through holes and
          jagged cracks in the metal.  There is a mound of debris --*
          jumbled, smashed bags and boxes -- filling the nose of
          the wreck, burying the co-pilot.*

          Johnny follows Marc inside, reacting to what he sees.


          THE DEAD PILOT

          As seen in Johnny's vision, still strapped to his seat. 
          The rest of the cockpit is filled with debris.

                                        MARC
                        Gross huh?  Poor bastard.  Guess
                        we all gotta go sometime.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: Marc)
                        Some sooner than others.

          Marc is pawing through the mass of debris on the co-pilot's
          side.

                                        MARC
                                (ripping open a mailer)
                        It's all paper!  Where is the
                        damn thing.

          Johnny reluctantly helps clear some debris... loses
          balance... reaches out for the cabin wall... When he
          touches it we hear a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH.  As Johnny reacts...*          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT FOUR - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  49.

          Pressed up against the outside of the plane, hidden,
          waiting.  He shifts his weight, and a piece of debris
          falls, making a noise.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


          TURMAN

          On the opposite side of the plane from Walt.  He hears
          the noise and goes to investigate.  THE VIEW FOLLOWS HIM
          as he walks around the plane, but when he gets there,
          Walt's gone.  Shrugging it off, he exits back the way he
          came, the view holding a beat before REVEALING: Walt behind
          a nearby tree.


          ANOTHER VIEW - TURMAN

          Just outside the cockpit.

                                        TURMAN
                        How's it going in there?

                                        MARC (O.S.)
                        Still looking.  It's a big damn
                        mess...


  6363RESUME INTERIOR FUSELAGE

          Johnny watches as Marc continues pawing through the debris
          tugging at one large piece of metal in the way.

                                        MARC
                        Give me a hand with this.

          Johnny steps in to help.  As they pull together, the metal
          suddenly gives way and Marc falls backward, buried in
          debris, INCLUDING:

          THE DEAD CO-PILOT

          Face to face with Marc.

                                        MARC
                          AAAaaaahhh-Jeeezze-Godddd.  Get
                        it off me.  Get it off.

          Marc scrambles to get out from under the corpse, Johnny
          pulling him by the collar without touching the body.  As
          he does, several pieces of cargo fall.  Johnny looks down,
          and sees--


          THE CONTAINER

          Battered and scraped, but still intact.  (It is the only
          steel object to be seen.)  He picks it up--

                                        JOHNNY
                        This what you were looking for?

          --And hands the case to Marc.

                        Sure looks like it.

          Marc struggles to open the case.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly but firmly)
                        Don't bother.
                                (Marc looks up)
                        You're never going to live to
                        spend it.  Turman's going to shoot
                        you.

                                        MARC
                        Why would he do that?  We're
                          partners!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your partner's been screwing your*
                        wife.

                                        MARC
                                (harshly)

                        Same way I know you didn't tie up*
                        the Sheriff.*

          Johnny lets this soak in as Marc begins to burn.*

                                        MARC
                        That bastard Turman--*

          He tucks the case under his arm, pulls out his gun and*
          heads outside...*



          Turman watches as Marc, then Johnny, come out.  Marc DROPS
          the case at Turman's feet, then points his gun at him.

                                        TURMAN
                                (calmly)
                        So you found it.  Aren't you going
                        to open it?

          Marc is about to explode.  Turman remains calm, his hands*
          in his JACKET pockets.*

                                        MARC
                        Forget the case.  What about you
                        and Pauline?

          Turman slowly looks at Johnny.

                                        MARC
                        He says you've been screwing my*
                        wife and now you're going to...*

          Marc never finishes the sentence: Turman SHOOTS HIM. *
          Johnny FLINCHES as Marc falls... DEAD.*

          Turman checks him.  Takes Marc's unfired pistol from his
          hand and tucks it in his belt.

                                        TURMAN
                        Are you ever wrong?

                                                                                  CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: THE MOUNTAIN - ACT FOUR - 6/06/03 - WHT-2  52.



          The sound of Turman's SHOT still ECHOES.  Pauline reacts
          with alarm, turning away from them toward the sound.

          Sarah sees her chance, and dives at Pauline, knocking the*
          gun loose.*

                                        SARAH
                                (to J.J.)
                        Run!

          J.J. runs.*



          Turman sets the case down in front of him, gets ready to
          shoot off the lock.

                                        TURMAN
                        I've always wanted to touch two
                        million bucks worth of anything--

          He smiles up at Johnny, then shoots off the lock.

                                        TURMAN
                        I guess this isn't the end you
                        had in mind--

          As he opens the case, Johnny sees--


          WALT

          sneaking up behind Turman, a piece of debris held like a*
          club.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not over yet.

          Just as Turman stands, Walt smashes Turman with his*
            makeshift club, KNOCKING HIM INTO JOHNNY.*

          All three go SPRAWLING...  Johnny's cane and Turman's gun
          and Marc's gun go SKITTERING... both Walt and Johnny try
          for the weapons... too late... Turman beats them to his.

                                        TURMAN
                        Right again, Smith.

          He gets to his feet, out of breath as he PICKS UP Marc's*
          pistol.  He gestures with the gun.*

                        Almost.

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Turman goes down, wounded.  Sarah*
          appears ten feet away, still aiming at Turman.*

                                        SARAH
                                  (frightened, but sure)*
                        Don't make me kill you.*

          Walt grabs Turman and disarms him.*

          radio. *

          Nearby, J.J. is wrapped in his mother's embrace, looking
          tired but safe.  Sarah rocks him gently, as much for her*
          comfort as his.*
