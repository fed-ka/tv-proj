          FADE IN:

  11EXT. MASSACHUSETTS COAST - DAY

          A two lane road snakes along a rocky coastline.  The crash
          of the assaulting surf overpowering.  We may see oyster
          boats docked in the background.

          Bruce's PT Cruiser winds up along the coast.  We hear the
          strains of Rock N' Roll as it drives by...


  22INT. PT CRUISER - DAY (TRAVELING)

          Bruce and Johnny in their classic driving pose; Bruce's
          eyes on the road, Johnny's staring out the side window.

          Music, circa the '70s'-'80s, plays on the speakers.  Bruce
          is trying to get into it, but it's just not working.

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, fifty mile mark.  Time
                        for my music. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        We listened to "The Outcasts" all
                        the way down to Boston, now you'll
                        have to suffer on the way back. 

                                        BRUCE
                        First of all, it's just "Outkast." 
                        No "the", no plural- 

                                        JOHNNY
                        And no more.  Please.   Pull out
                        one of my other Cds if you don't
                        like this one...

          Bruce reaches into a CD case glances at dated albums
            including AC/DC's "Highway to Hell"...

                                        BRUCE
                        Ancient history.  I'm trying to
                        bring you up to speed on the music
                        of today.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - TEASER - 5/30/02 - GOLD  2.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce, you didn't know me before
                        the coma.  I was never "up to
                          speed"... was part of my charm.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, but you're so far behind
                        now it's like you're going in
                          reverse.  You gotta get with the
                        new, y'know?  With the now. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        The new, huh? 
                                (off Bruce's nod)
                        The now?

          Johnny reaches behind his seat and pulls out a series of
          X-RAYS of his SKULL, including a 3-D CAT-SCAN rendering
          of his head.  Bruce sees where he's going, and sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I present the latest
                          technology, utilized by the top
                        doctors at the most cutting edge
                        labs... this is not your father's
                          CAT-SCAN...

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, enough...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yet all the king's doctors, with
                        all the latest toys, still can't
                        find what's wrong with me.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's because there is nothing
                        wrong. 

          Bruce's tone signals that they've been through this before. 
          Silence hangs as Johnny rolls the sentiment around in his
          mind, trying to decide how to feel about it.  He smirks. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Besides my taste in music.

                                        BRUCE
                        Besides that.  I'm hungry.  You
                        hungry?


  33EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

          The PT Cruiser zips by the camera, which whips to reveal


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - TEASER - 5/30/02 - GOLD  3.


    3CONTINUED:3

          a sign: WELCOME TO HOBBS LANDING, POP. 2,735.  Underneath
          is the universal sign for food - the fork and knife.


  44OMITTED


  55EXT. HOBBS LANDING - DAY

          The PT Cruiser enters the picturesque town center, which
          is lined with old-fashioned brick and wood buildings.  A
          flag pole stands in the square, Old Glory at half mast. 
          (The ocean might be visible in the background; this is a
          remote oyster village.)

          The town square is awfully empty and quiet for mid-day.

          Bruce parks across the street from a diner.


  66INT. DINER - DAY

          EIGHT LOCALS are having lunch.  2 COUPLES at tables, 3
          OLD MEN at another, and a hefty man (BERT) at the counter. 

          All eyes go to Johnny and Bruce as they enter.  Johnny
          and Bruce hesitate a moment as some conversations pause
          briefly to consider the strangers.  They head for the
          counter, feeling eyes on them.  There's something
          unwelcoming about this town.

          Johnny and Bruce take seats, place orders with the waitress
          (LINDA) whose face we cannot see.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, hi ya doin'?
                                (no answer)
                        Uh, could I get a cup of chowder
                        and half a turkey sandwich? 

          The Waitress jots it down.  Johnny, distracted, looks up.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Cheeseburger and just a glass of
                        water, please... 

          His voice trails off as he turns to look over his shoulder.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, water for me too, please.

          Johnny meets the glances of the locals.  Most of them
          turn away from his look.  The old men don't. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - TEASER - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  4.


    6CONTINUED:6

          Johnny turns back as the Waitress sets down two glasses
          of water.  As Johnny raises the glass to his lips, we
          RAMP INTO HIS FACE AS A VISION STRIKES --


  77EXT. FOREST - DAY (VISION)

          Johnny stands among an ANGRY MOB during the ROAR of the
          crowd.  He looks around him, at the SCREAMING FACES, some
          of whom we recognize - the waitress (Linda), the hefty
          man (Bert) at the counter.  Johnny looks to the focus of
          their fury, only to see --

          HIMSELF, TIED TO A TREE, A MAKESHIFT PYRE OF BRANCHES AND
          LEAVES AT HIS FEET.  Johnny sputters as GASOLINE is
          splashed on his face.  Someone near him cracks open an
            emergency FLARE, then tosses it onto the pyre, IGNITING
          IT IN A HOWLING FIRE. 


  88INT. DINER - RESUME

          Johnny nearly chokes on his water as he swallows it. 
            Ashen-faced, he calls out to the departing Waitress.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me...

          She turns, and we recognize her as one of the screaming
          faces of the Mob.  Right now, her face is passive. 
          Johnny's voice almost cracks as he fights to maintain a
          polite smile.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can we get this to go?

          Bruce looks at Johnny, confused, as we...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  99EXT. HOBBS LANDING - DAY

          Johnny exits the diner, foam take-out container clutched
          under his arm.  Bruce follows. 

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell you in a few miles.   

          Across the street, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER is now parked next
          to the PT.  A uniformed officer, DEPUTY NANCY SIMMONS, is
          taking down the license plate number.  Bruce hurries up. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, no.  Is this a red zone?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were just leaving.

          Deputy Simmons, mid-thirties, no make-up, hair pulled
          back into a disciplined bun, sizes up Bruce, then Johnny.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        You fellas have identification? 

          Behind them, a couple of the LOCALS have stepped out of
          the diner to watch.  They reach for their drivers' licenses
          and, as the dialogue continues, hand them to her...  Up
          ahead, trucks from a caravan are parking along the curb,
            TOWNSFOLK disembarking.  Three or four to a truck.  They
          look tired as they begin to greet people walking out of
          stores to talk to them... they glance over at Johnny and
          Bruce with curiosity... 

                                        BRUCE
                        Is there a problem, officer?

          She glances at the names on the licenses...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                                  (correcting)
                        Deputy.  Simmons.
                                (looking up)
                        Guess you haven't heard, huh...

          Johnny and Bruce react, heard what?, take note of the
          caravan people...

    9CONTINUED:9

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS (CONT'D)
                        We had a double homicide last
                        night.  Mother and her eight year
                        old daughter out in the woods. 

                                        BRUCE
                                (reacts)
                        Oh, man...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Second daughter is still missing. 
                          Thirteen years old.  This town's
                        been walking the woods all night. 
                        We're hoping she's still alive.

          Bruce makes the most natural assumption based on everything
          he knows about Johnny Smith...

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, if she is... 
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        John, maybe you could...

          But he stops as he sees Johnny's discomfort... Bruce has 
          no idea what's going on... it's an awkward moment and the
          deputy picks up on it...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Could what...?

          And there's really no escape now...

                                        BRUCE
                                (still confused by
                                  Johnny's reaction)
                        My friend has helped the police
                        up in Maine now and then...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Helped how...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you'd call me a psychic.

          Deputy Simmons studies Johnny long and hard.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        A psychic.  Like with supernatural
                        powers?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I just sense things sometimes.

          And the crowd is getting curious and Simmons glances at

          smiles pleasantly...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Look, we... we sure could use any
                        help we can get, psychic or
                        otherwise.  Why don't you come on
                        inside and we can talk about it?

          Johnny glances at the people from the caravan... it's not
          that he wouldn't help under any other circumstance... but
          here he hesitates and off that hesitation, the deputy
            reacts...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  No.  That's fine.

          Bruce knows it's not fine but doesn't know why and it's
          all very uncomfortable as the deputy leads these two across
          the street to the station house... past the TOWNSFOLK
          from the search party, who have formed an unintentional
            roadblock of bodies across the street.  Most talking, but
          some looking down this way.

                        I'm gonna bring in some of the
                          evidence in this case... who knows -

          She leaves.  Bruce immediately turns to Johnny...

                        You want to tell me what's going

                        People here are scared out of
                        their skins, the last thing they
                        need to hear is we're soliciting
                          a psychic for "help" in our

                          straight to the suspect, a deputy
                        named Dodd.  But Dodd never
                        confessed.  Killed himself before

                        Mary Reed and her daughter are

                        cover his own tracks... then he

          Danforth places a gentle arm on her shoulder...

                        I want you to stop, I want you to
                        get some rest.

          Simmons rises, headstrong.

                        We have a crime scene with ritual

                        what he's gonna say.

          Sheriff Danforth sighs, gives the okay.

          Nothing.  He turns the sneaker over.

          Sheriff Danforth reacts to the accurate information, his

                        Running through the trees. 
                        Terrified.  

          He puts the sneaker down, shaking his head clear.

                        I can't see where she is.

          Deputy Simmons only reply is to remove the HACKSAW from
          its bag, and place it in front of Johnny.  He stares at

                        This was used to cut down the

                          pentagram... before the killing. 

          Danforth straightens in surprise in the observation room... 

          Simmons slides the DAGGER across the table.  The blade is
            S-curved, a wave of steel.  Dried blood caked on the tip.

          Johnny touches the hilt with a tentative finger.  Then
          two.  Starts to get a feeling...

    16CONTINUED:16

          The Deputy and Sheriff respectively react to his insight.
          Johnny's grip on the knife adjusts.  His fingers interlace,
          like we've seen him do in visions, except now they tighten
          over the hilt of the dagger.  Then he begins to whisper
          to himself.

          Holy shit.  Sheriff Danforth takes a step back.  Deputy
          Simmons' hand casually slips off the table to rest on her
          holster, thumb gently hooking under the snap.  Bruce's
          eyes narrow with concern...

          Johnny slowly raises the dagger above his head in a double
          grip, eyes shut tight.  Mouthing the language (Enochian).

          Sheriff Danforth's jaw slacks open.

                          Baphomet!

          Johnny suddenly STABS DOWNWARD WITH THE DAGGER.

          Johnny JOLTS back from the table, hands recoil to his
          face, to wipe away the blood that, of course, is not there.

                                        JOHNNY

          The Deputy has stepped up and out of her chair, hand still

          straight up from the table, vibrations from the impact
          ebbing away.

          DOUG MARTIN, 45, dressed in a simple blue dress shirt and
          tie, leans back in his chair.  He regards the Sheriff
          with a thoughtful look.

                        He knows things... things we
                        haven't released yet.  Some things
                          I didn't even know...

          Martin turns in his chair to confront the shelves stacked
          with law books.  The thoughtful look returns.

          Bruce's face is heavily bruised around his eye, his lip
          is split and bleeding, and there is a gash on his forehead.

          her finger onto the phone hook as Johnny starts to dial

          Danforth...

                        all weekend.  Johnny was seeing

                        around to testify for your friend.

          Martin nods to the Sheriff and exits through the front
          door.  The Sheriff walks into the bullpen.  Bruce is left

          Panning to find someone else eating a grilled cheese
            sandwich, looking outside at Bruce.  It's a man in a RED
          FLANNEL JACKET AND RED WORK PANTS, as seen in Johnny's
          bloody Bruce vision.

                        No, but "witchcraft" is the kind
                        of word a spin doctor dreams about.

                        I'm only suggesting we keep a
                        close eye on this for awhile...
                        see how it plays out... it may go
                        away all on its own.

                        The court has informed me you
                        don't have an attorney, and they
                        need to take you before the judge

                        I'm assuming you'll want someone
                        of your own choosing to represent

                        You understand this witchcraft

                        I do see things that no one else
                        can see.  I know what's going to

  3434EXT. HOBBS LANDING - DAY

          A sheriff' vehicle pulls around a corner into the town
          square, revealing a LARGE CROWD assembled in the square,
          like you might find on the 4th of July.  This is the bulk
          force of the MANHUNT assembled to find Cathy Reed. 

          The sheriff car turns on its lights and gives a WHOOP!  A
          path is cleared for it, PEOPLE looking in the windows. 
          In the front seat:  Sheriff Danforth and Deputy Simmons. 
          In the back:  Gabriel Barnes and Johnny Smith. 

          Johnny looks out at the locals, as they look in.  Meeting
          their now accusatory stares.  Gabe notices this, too,
          thinks about what Johnny said.     

          Johnny suddenly spots the man wearing a RED FLANNEL JACKET
          and RED WORK PANTS, right from his "Bloody Bruce" vision. 
          The man is sitting on the trunk of an Olds '88, as are
          two others.  Their clothes show that they have been
          trekking through the woods; muddy boots, leaves on coats.

          The car stops in front of the COUNTY COURTHOUSE.  Johnny
          gets out, igniting murmurs from the crowd.  And then...

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        WHERE IS CATHY?

          EDDIE is tall and wiry.  His voice is clear and loud.  A
          few random SHOUTS compliment his outburst. 

          Then, a patch of the crowd falls QUIET and parts to let
          the distraught father, TOM REED, step forward.  He stares
          at Johnny with a blank expression.  A hand or two reaches
          out to rub Tom's shoulder for comfort.   

          Johnny's eyes meet Tom's for a beat, and then he is ushered
          into the COURTHOUSE.

          The last face he sees is Bruce's... and Johnny reacts
          with dismay... but Bruce just shrugs and says with a look
          that he couldn't leave... overlapping from next scene --

          JUDGE DONALD WILSON, 60's, a grandfatherly face, listens
          curiously, struggles to place the ordinance, he prides
          himself on knowing most of them.  LOCALS have filled the
          only seats available in the back.  Tom Reed is among them. 
          Bruce sits behind Johnny.

                        trial.  

          A confused murmur ripples through the crowd.  Judge Wilson
          adjusts his hearing aid, leans forward. 

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Excuse me, Doug.  I missed that,

                          preposterous.  The prosecution of
                        witchcraft as a criminal charge
                        was dismissed over two hundred
                        years ago...

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Counsel approach the bench.  Both
                        of you.  Now.   

          ON Martin, Gabe, Judge Wilson.  Their rapport is familiar.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Boys, I was hoping to go fishing
                        today. 

                                        GABE
                        The Sheriff and Prosecutor have
                        clearly trumped up a bogus charge
                        to unlawfully detain this man. 
                        It's a violation of his civil
                          rights...
                                (right to Martin)
                        And frankly I think it mocks this
                        court.

          Wilson looks at Doug Martin, who remains very calm.

                        I won't lie.  The accused is the
                        leading suspect in the Reed
                          murders, and the Sheriff needs
                        time to gather evidence.  But the
                        outcome of this hearing will be
                          evidence in its own right.

          Judge Wilson wrinkles his nose, confused.  So is Gabe.

                                        MARTIN
                        The Reed Murders involve elements
                        of Satanism.  A conviction on
                        witchcraft will be a key element
                        in the prosecution of that case. 
                                (turns to Gabe)
                        And the charge is not bogus,
                        because I intend to prove it.

          Judge Wilson thinks about it.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        I'm willing to see where this
                        goes, but if I don't like it,
                        we're all going home.

          They break.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          As Martin reads from it...  

                                        MARTIN
                        Local ordinance number 65 defines
                        witchcraft as "the practice of
                        and belief in supernatural
                        abilities, including the divination
                        of future and past events, the
                          sickening or corrupting of others
                        through incantations, spells or
                        motions of the hand or eye.  A
                          communion with the Devil."

          He then walks a handful of PRINT-OUTS up to Judge Wilson.

          A rumbling from the crowd.  Bruce looks around, surprised
          at their reaction.  Johnny whispers something to Gabe.

  36A36AEXT. HOBB'S LANDING - A CAR (FORMERLY PART OF SCENE 41)

          With Maine license plates, pulling to a stop behind the
          virtual barricade of townie cars clogging the square.

          DANA BRIGHT steps out, takes in the gathering, surprised
          to see such a hubbub.  She shakes her head.

                                        DANA
                        Johnny Smith.  You had to go and
                        piss off Mayberry.

          She heads to the courthouse, shaking her head.


  3737INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Dana edges through the doors, eyeing the packed room, and
          feeling the looks of xenophobic locals.

          She spots Bruce on the stand...

                                        MARTIN
                        So you admit to being a witness
                        to Mr. Smith's... powers.  Would
                        you say it's accurate to say he
                          'divined future and past events?'

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't think he 'divined'
                          anything.

                        Really.  How do you think he does
                        it? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Medical science can't explain
                        that; I sure can't.

                        So you can't categorically dismiss
                          non-scientific explanations can
                        you?  For example, spiritual
                          explanations.

                                        BRUCE
                          I certainly don't believe they
                        come from the devil if that's
                        what you're getting at.

                        But you have no alternative
                          explanation to offer.  Science
                        has no alternative explanation to
                        offer.  You said so yourself.

          Bruce pauses, thinking.  He looks at Johnny, smiles.

                        I've never said this out loud

                                        MARTIN
                        Or a very old one.

                          Something urgent came up.  Truth
                        is he's home, making sure his
                        hands don't get dirty.
                                (dry)
                        He asked me to keep him well
                          informed and to express his deep
                        concern for your well being.

                        Great.  We call for the cavalry
                        and he sends a press release.

                        They can't seriously expect this
                        witchcraft charge to hold up in
                          court...

                        It doesn't have to hold up in
                        court.  People hear what the
                          prosecution is saying... they
                        know Satanism was involved in the
                        murders...

                        And it begins to take on a life
                        of its own.

                        at the murder site... when I
                        touched it I got a vision of the
                          father... there's something about

                        I have nothing to say.

          He stamps on his cigarette... goes back inside the
            courthouse... Dana frowns... Moving to find Sheriff
          Danforth scanning the crowd, worry lines deepening.  He

                        you can't stay here.

          They break up but not really... moving away from the

                        Mr. Smith, I have the report from
                        your interview with Deputy Nancy
                          Simmons.  Says here that by
                          touching key pieces of evidence,
                        you were able to "see" the crime
                        scene in great detail.

          Johnny's eyes sweep the crowd, lock onto Deputy Simmons,
          who holds his look, unrepentant.

                        At one point, you held a ritual
                        dagger, the kind used in Satanic
                        ritual, and began to speak words
                        in a "strange language."

                        What have you done with Cathy?

          Johnny winces at the assault.  Wilson bangs on his gavel.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        George, get him out of here!

          GEORGE, the bailiff, moves to grab Eddie, who puts up
          little resistance as he is ushered through the back doors. 
          Judge Wilson addresses the court, furious.

                        One more outburst like that, from
                        anyone, and I will clear this
                        court. 

          Gabe stands up, trying to stop this. 

                                        GABE
                        Your Honor, it's described in the
                          newspaper articles how Mr Smith's
                        psychic visions often place him
                        in the roles of other people during
                        events he sees... this line of
                          questioning is deliberately
                          inflammatory... 

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Perhaps you should fast forward
                        to your point, Doug. 

                                        MARTIN
                                (advancing on Johnny)
                        My point, your Honor, is simple:
                        either Mr. Smith possesses
                        attributes which match the
                        definition of witchcraft in
                          ordinance sixty-five -
                          "supernatural abilities including
                        the divination of future and past
                          events", or he lied to the
                          investigators, and was present at
                        the scene of the murders. 

          It's as if an electric current was sent through the
            assembly.  Judge Wilson has to BANG his gavel hard...


  40A40AEXT. ROAD - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 46)

          Bruce drives Dana's car past the "Welcome to Hobbs Landing"
          sign.  As soon as he passes it, he exhales a sigh of
          relief.  Drives for two more beats.  Then suddenly grits
          his teeth and slams the brakes, skidding to a halt.

          He sits in the road, then guns a U-turn and heads back to
          town.  Loyalty, doubt, guilt, or a little of all three.

          Rounding the corner up ahead is the Olds '88.  It swerves
          into the ONCOMING lane.  Bruce tenses, swerves into the
          other lane.

          The Olds MATCHES him, forcing a game of chicken.  Bruce
          SWERVES BACK, the Olds CALLS.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT THREE - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  39.


    40ACONTINUED:40A

          Bruce wrenches the wheel left to avoid a head-on, and
          BARRELS off road, then stopping.

          The Olds smokes to a halt.  Sits there, idling.

          Bruce gets out of the Sebring, royally pissed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man, this wasn't even my car!

          He looks up at the Olds, as four men hop out.  Bruce
          freezes when he sees the Man in Red approaching.  The
          four shadows of the men stretch out over the pavement,
          encroaching on Bruce's feet.

          Bruce freezes, realizes too late, that he's in trouble...

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, why don't we just calm down
                        and...

          One of the men SUCKER-PUNCHES him.  But then, Bruce moves
            LIGHTNING-FAST, and we realize we've never really seen
          Bruce MOVE before.

          He BLOCKS the fist, TRAPS the arm, and then THROWS DOWN a
          hundred and seventy three pounds of asshole.

          Then the other three pounce.

          Bruce holds his own for a few rounds, but then takes a
          bad crack to the temple and gut at the same time.  He
          stumbles down, and we cut way...

          WAY BACK to view the beating from a distance, framed by
          the giant coastal pine trees.  Twilight is falling.

  4242INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          Martin has crossed back to his desk and holds aloft a
          HAIR CLIP like it's the fucking sword in the stone.

                        Your honor, this is a piece of
                          evidence recovered from the crime
                        scene.  A hair clip belonging to
                        Cathy Reed, which was not touched
                        by Mr. Smith during his interview.
                                (to Johnny)
                        I'd like you to touch it now.

                        I'm giving him the chance, in the
                        eyes of this court, to demonstrate
                        his abilities are what he claims
                        them to be.  Otherwise, we have
                        no choice but to believe that he
                        is a murderer.

          Gabe leans as far over his desk as he's allowed.

                                        GABE

                        You don't have to do this... 

          Johnny looks at Gabe, Martin, the Crowd.  It's the witch's
          dilemma: if you float, they hang you.  If you drown, you're
            innocent. 

          The room falls silent as Johnny reaches out and takes the
          hair clip from Martin, who makes a show of stepping back.

          Johnny looks down at the hair clip (note: it has a pearl
          imbedded in it) and suddenly the CAMERA begins to SWAY
          into a CANTED ANGLE.  He looks up to see...

          Half the LOCALS in the room stand straight up in their

          vindicated, impressed with himself.  Gabe slowly sits
          back down.  Judge Wilson BANGS his gavel OVER and OVER

          George the Bailiff tries to herd people out, Deputy Simmons
          assists.  Dana forces her way against the throng toward

                        me he thinks the missing girl may
                        be on a boat.  Have you searched

          LEAVES AT HIS FEET. 

          -- GASOLINE is splashed on his face.  

          -- Someone near him cracks open an emergency FLARE...

          All these are intercut with the crowd action...

          Those gathered in the square look up.  Some cheer.  Some
          stand numb.  Some quickly depart, wanting no part of this.

          Eddie pulls Johnny's head back, to see the crowd.

            A HOWLING FIRE.

          Much walla... cries of "murderer", "tell us where she
          is"...

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Now, what "psychic motivation" do
                        you need to say where Cathy is? 

          Johnny looks at the man.  There's no reasoning with this
          one, with any of them.  He needs to know where she is.  

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shaken)

                        Yeah.  Figured you would.  Isn't
                        that what they say - you always
                        return to the scene of the crime...   

          Eddie drags him toward his car.  The MOB FOLLOWS, now
          with a rising yell.  A couple of KIDS run up alongside
          the adults, almost leaping with excitement. 

          TOM REED enters frame, looking at the Mob, panic creeping
          into his shell-shocked eyes...

  5252INT. OLDS '88 - DAY

          Man in Red sits in, closes the door, listening to his
          cell.  Cronies in the back - some bruised.  

                                        EXCITED VOICE (PHONE)
                        We got the guy.  We took him! 
                        We're bringing him out to the

                        You better get over here... 

          Man in Red puts it in gear...


  5353EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

          Angle on THE TRUNK as the Olds '88 takes off, passing the
          empty Sebring on the side of the road. 


  5454EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Moving with the mob to the head of the pack, where Johnny
          is prodded along.

          Voice by voice dies to a solemn quiet as they all reach
          the yellow tape that cordons off the crime scene.

          The PENTAGRAM, made of branches, is still there (minus
          one branch), bracketing the TREE STUMP.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT FOUR - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  47.


    54CONTINUED:54

          The tape pleads "DO NOT CROSS" but no one listens, although
          people stop short of the pentagram, divert around it so
          they can still see, forming a circle in the process. 

          A circle of people enclosing Johnny, the pentagram, the
          tree stump. 

          Johnny looks around at them.  Not all have been to this
          place.  Some are so scared, they shudder.  Others look on
          him with open hatred.  

          Tom Reed, looking at the scene with mute anticipation, as
          if he knows something terrible is going to happen which
          he cannot stop, but he cannot look away. 

          Johnny knows that look.  He's wearing it now.  Wolcott
          pushes him and Johnny is thrown to the ground... as he
          touches the earth...

          GASOLINE splashes in his face, thrown by the Man in Red
          and Excited Guy.  They lay it on the makeshift pyre of
          twigs and branches at his feet.

                          Everybody's under arrest, dammit! 
                        Everybody!  Holy, Judas, mother
                        of God.  What have you you people
                        done.  What have you done...

          He glowers at Deputy Simmons, now just one of the Mob. 
          She lowers her head in shame.  Others look around,
          bewildered, like they just woke up.  A few others rabbit
          off into the night in different directions.   

          Then, out of the forest, Dana Bright walks Cathy Reed
          into the clearing.  Johnny sees her, sags in relief. 
          Cathy runs to Tom and into his arms. 

                                        CATHY
                        I tried to stay quiet, Daddy, but
                        they busted in...

          Tom just stands there, a weak man, letting his crying
          daughter hug his shell.  The Mob, the hundred or so PEOPLE
          from Hobbs Landing who were about to burn a man alive,
          stand like silent statues. 

          The only ones who move are Gabe, and Bruce, who move
          quickly to the tree to untie Johnny Smith. 

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  7272EXT. HOBBS LANDING - DAY

          The town that time forgot.  A Norman Rockwell portrait. 
          Except this one has no people. 

          An empty square.  Old Glory at half mast.

          Maybe they'll come out when they can explain what happened.

          Moving to find Johnny and Bruce and Dana at the PT Cruiser
          with Gabe...

                                        GABE
                                (to Dana)
                        I'll see to it that your car is
                          repaired...

                                        DANA
                        No offense, but I'd just as soon
                        not contribute to the economy of
                        this town.  My auto club and the
                          Reverand Mr. Purdy is handling
                        it.

          Gabe nods, he doesn't blame her... turns to Johnny...

                                        GABE
                        'I'm sorry' doesn't begin to cover
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (thanking him)
                        At least one man was willing to
                        stand by me.    

                                        GABE
                        This town... my father grew up
                        here... my father's father... we
                        go all the way back to the American
                          Revolution... this town has always
                        been a place of ideals and
                          principles...
                                (beat)
                        I wish I knew when we lost that...

                                        BRUCE
                                (knows the answer)
                        Today.

          They get into the car and drive out of town... and as we
          pull back --
