      TIGHT ON A WOMAN'S FACE -- bloody, bruised, lip cut and
      bleeding, breath RASPING painfully.

      She's twenty-four, beautiful, and currently getting the shit
      beaten out of her.

      This is JAIME SOMMERS.

      WIDEN to see we're on a ROOFTOP, WIND gusting and eddying
      through a forest of CITY BUILDINGS.

      A WOMAN (we heard her VOICE over black) stands over Jaime,
      back to us -- she continues TALKING in the same calm,
      CONVERSATIONAL tone.

                                      WOMAN
                    Or maybe I should be asking... what
                    are you?

      -- and she KICKS Jaime in the stomach, almost casually. 
      Jaime CURLS in on herself, biting off the urge to SCREAM.

      She rolls painfully onto her hands and knees, wind whipping
      her hair across her face -- then LOOKS UP, eyes fixing on
      the Woman, not in pain or fear, but DEFIANCE.

                                      JAIME
                          (gasping for breath)
                    Shouldn't I -- be asking -- you?

      REVERSE ON THE WOMAN, giving us our first good look at her: 
      strikingly beautiful, sleekly muscled, maybe 30 --

      -- and with brutal, indifferent strength, she GRABS Jaime by
      the hair and JERKS her to her feet.

      Later we'll know her name:  SARAH.                                                                                          2.

      She STARES Jaime in the eye, inches apart, an edge of WEIRD
      INTIMACY between these two people who are obviously STRANGERS.

                                      SARAH
                          (like a dare)
                    So ask.

      Jaime STARES right back at her, bruised and beaten, like
      someone taking a CHALLENGE --

                                      JAIME
                    Who the hell are you?

      Sarah's answer is a GHOST OF A SMILE -- and she raises her
      arm to BACKHAND Jaime.  Her bladed hand comes WHISTLING down --
      and the INSTANT before impact, we --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      The sun is barely rising over SAN FRANCISCO -- hilly streets,
      Victorian houses butting up against sweeping modern buildings,
      quaint and cosmopolitan at once.

        SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO WEEKS EARLIER 

      Follow a FIGURE JOGGING on a road overlooking the water, a
      SILHOUETTE against the brightening sun-streaked sky -- it's

      JAIME, running alone along the water in JOGGING SWEATS.  She
      SPRINTS through the streets, turns INLAND, heading home.


      Jaime picks up the speed, RACING the last few yards through
      the dingy neighborhood, reaching a CRUMBLING EDWARDIAN
      BUILDING, once an elegant hotel, now LOW RENT APARTMENTS.


      A truly tragic Ford Pinto hatchback, circa 1974, makes its
      way through the crowded, steep city streets.


      The Pinto SCREECHES to an uneven halt outside Becca's school.


      The one, the only.  A LINE of patrons SNAKES out the door. 
      We might notice a large, modern HOSPITAL across the street.

      Jaime desperately tries to find a parking place-- between
      two SUV'S, she sees what looks like a space, starts turning --

      -- and realizes too late it's TAKEN, by a small blue PORSCHE,
      parked across two spaces and pulled so far forward it was
      hidden behind the SUV.  Jaime grits her teeth as she starts
      to back up, cars HONKING BEHIND HER.


      JAIME AND ERIC sit on the hood of Eric's CAR, parked on a
      bluff off a windy road.  The OCEAN is CRASHING against the
      ragged cliff far below;  the road is DESERTED.

      They're unpacking fast food bags.  Eric pulls out his fries; 
      Jaime is oddly QUIET, looking DISTRACTED.

                                    ERIC
                    I said you could pick a restaurant. 
                    Burger Boy barely even qualifies as
                    food.
                          (as he unwraps a burger)
                    You really don't want to know what's
                    in this stuff.  It's amazing how
                    much flavor you can get from deep
                    frying something and coating it in
                    salt --

      He notices Jaime's STARING OFF into the darkness.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                          (a little worried)
                    Hey... are you still upset over Becca
                    being pissed at you?  'Cause
                      seriously, she'll pick a fight with
                    you over breathing.  I don't know
                    what her problem is --

                                      JAIME
                    It's me.

      As he looks at her, curiously, Jaime continues:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    They -- were coming out to see me. 
                    My parents.  I'd gotten this Honors
                    thing, there was an award dinner and
                    they were flying out for it.
                          (hesitates, then)
                    I wanted them to come.  I asked them
                    to be there...                                                                                        14.

      Jaime is obviously affected by the memory, but at the same
      time strangely DETACHED -- as if she's been forced to keep
      the full force of the pain at bay, just to survive.

      Eric is watching her, WORRIED, he's clearly never heard this
      part of the story.

                                    ERIC
                    The plane crash -- ?

                                      JAIME
                    Becca was 11.  That's what she
                      remembers... that they left for me,
                    and they never came back.

      Eric reaches over, takes her hand.

                                    ERIC
                    They were your parents, too.  It's
                    not your fault.

                                      JAIME
                    After they died, that first day, I
                    went running.  I ran, and ran, and
                    ran.  Like... if I could just go
                    fast enough, I could get away.  But
                    some things, you can't run away from.

      She looks away, over the crashing ocean waves.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    It felt like the world was falling
                    on me, like this weight that was so
                    heavy it would crush me.  I never
                    thought -- the last thing I ever
                    wanted was more.  More responsibility,
                    more to take care of.
                          (abruptly)
                    I'm pregnant.

      Eric is SURPRISED into total silence.  Jaime starts to speed
      up, her speech becoming NERVOUS and QUICK.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I didn't believe it either. 
                    Turns out, stomach flu?  Not so much.
                    Good thing Mrs. A put two pregnancy
                    tests in the bag.

                                    ERIC
                          (totally confused)
                    What?

      But Jaime doesn't even seem to hear him, just PLOWS forward,
      determined, all of it coming out in a RUSH:                                                                                        15.

                                      JAIME
                          (rapid, nervous)
                    I don't want you to -- I just -- I
                    know this isn't something you just
                    spring on someone, except for the
                    part where that's exactly what I'm
                    doing to you right now.  And I know
                    that you're in a place in your career
                    where you can't even think about
                    this, and god, I'm only twenty-four,
                    it's not -- I mean -- I said to
                    myself, well, there's only one thing
                    to do --

                                    ERIC
                          (breaking in)
                    Jaime --

                                      JAIME
                          (relentlessly)
                    -- but the point is, I couldn't even
                    think about it, not even for a second,
                    not half a second.  I couldn't.
                          (repeating)
                    I never thought I would want more. 
                    But I do.  And it just feels -- like
                    this is something I'm going to do. 
                    I don't know how --
                          (a determined edge)
                    -- but somehow.  And I know this is
                    my choice, and I'll live with it. 
                    I'll take responsibility for it.  I
                    will.

      As she stops to take a breath, Eric finally INTERRUPTS --

                                    ERIC
                    Let's get married.

      A half-second of pure SHOCK before Jaime manages:

                                      JAIME
                    Let's -- I'm sorry?

      His voice is GENTLE, a counterpoint to her staccato, defensive
      speech, like she's a wild animal that might run away --

                                    ERIC
                    You want to keep the baby.  And I
                    want to keep you.
                          (grins)
                    It's a sign from God.

                                      JAIME
                    But --
                            (helplessly)
                    -- you don't believe in God.                                                                                        16.

      Eric reaches out, brushes a strand of hair from her forehead.

                                    ERIC
                          (softly)
                    If you say yes, I might start.

      Jaime just looks at him for a moment -- and then they KISS,
      and it's sweet, and honest, one of those moments you remember
      the rest of your life.

      Even if you don't want to.


      Jaime and Eric, driving down from the bluffs into the city. 
      She's feeding him fries as he navigates the sharp turns.

                                    ERIC
                    You realize this is it.
                          (off her curious look)
                    We're not eating any more of this
                    junk for the next eight months.

                                      JAIME
                    You have serious control issues, you
                    know that?

                                    ERIC
                    Shut up and feed me a fry, woman.


      Eric's car pulls up to a nice VICTORIAN on a steep San Fran
      street.  He pulls into the driveway, unfastens his seat belt.

                                      JAIME
                    I -- I should really get back --

                                    ERIC
                    I'm just going to run up and get
                      something.  It'll only take a minute.

                                      JAIME
                          (unfastens her belt)
                    I'll come with you.

      As he opens his door, Jaime gathers her courage:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    You don't have to, you know.

      He turns back to look at her, not sure what she means --

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                            (explaining)
                    Marry me.                                                                                        17.

      The warm glow of headlights from passing cars WASH over them,
      rising and falling waves of LIGHT and SHADOW --

                                    ERIC
                          (quietly)
                    I know I don't.

      And he leans over to KISS her -- a GLARE of headlights washes
      over them, a HALO of white light -- and without warning --

      AN OUT OF CONTROL CAR sails over the curb and PLOWS into
      them with HORRIFIC force -- no brakes, no swerving, a full-
      speed COLLISION with the passenger side of Eric's car --

      Jaime's side.

      ERIC is THROWN CLEAR, FLUNG from the open driver's door to
      go FLYING through the air -- but

      JAIME is CRUSHED between the crumpled door and the dash, as--

      ERIC'S CAR, with Jaime in it, is LIFTED OFF the ground by
      the SHEER FORCE of the collision --

      -- and goes TUMBLING, side-over-side down the steeply inclined
      street in a SHOWER of SPARKS and SHATTERING GLASS.


      A huge stretch of inland Northern California WILDERNESS --
      craggy, densely forested, peaceful in the moonlight.

      THE CHOPPER comes winging over the countryside.  We FOLLOW
      as it DIPS past a canyon, then crests a RISE -- to reveal

      A HUGE COMPLEX nestled among the hills, utterly UNEXPECTED.

      Long, low CENTRAL BUILDINGS, open paved spaces, what look
      like dorm-like RESIDENCES, all in a loose structure that
      give it the feeling of a SPRAWLING CAMPUS --

      -- except for the WALL topped with razorwire that surrounds
      the whole place.  GUARD TOWERS and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS dot
      the wall, even though we're in the middle of NOWHERE.

      THE HELICOPTER swoops down, aiming for the private LANDING
      STRIP inside the complex --

      -- where a MEDICAL TEAM is standing by, looking up in
      CONFUSION as the chopper lands.


      ERIC jumps down from the chopper, as the LEAD DOCTOR comes
      forward to meet him --

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                          (very nervous)
                    Dr. Masters, surely a, a more
                      conventional hospital would be --

                                    ERIC
                      Facilities are better here.  Better
                    than anywhere.  You've got the whole
                    team?

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                    Just like you said.  But surely -- I
                    don't understand why --

      The MED TECHS are already hurrying to the chopper, expertly
      getting Jaime out on the gurney.

                                    ERIC
                    You don't need to.


      The sun is creeping over the horizon as A PRIVATE JET comes
      to a halt on the landing strip.


      -- to reveal SUNLIGHT and TREES, the hilly terrain surrounding
      the complex.  Jaime STEPS OUTSIDE.


      Jaime turns her face to the sun, just FEELING the light and
      warmth on her -- then she starts to RUN.

      She skims over the rocky earth, ground FLYING beneath her
      feet, RUNNING through the dappled trees, going FASTER and
      FASTER.  There's something FIERCE and DESPERATE in her face.


      JAIME goes FASTER -- VFX/SFX as we SHIFT into BIONIC RUNNING.

      Think the GRACE of "MATRIX" slowmotion, but INTERRUPTED by
      quick CUTS of Jaime RACING almost faster than the eye can
      follow -- a terrible sense of SPEED and POWER, as we see her
      FLASHING between the trees.


      JAIME flashes over the uneven terrain, RACING faster, as if
      she's fleeing MONSTERS that only she can see --

      -- and in her face -- frightened, desperate, determined all
      at once -- we feel the ECHO of how she RAN when her parents
      died, RACING to get away from something that can't be escaped.


      A black SEDAN pulls up to Jaime's decrepit apartment building.
      She gets out, looks up at the building NERVOUSLY.


      Jaime screeches the Pinto up to the Starbuck's -- late again. 
      The parking lot is PACKED, no spaces in front.

      She circles around BEHIND the shop.  The few parking spaces
      here are TAKEN here as well -- but of course, the PORSCHE is
      parked across two spaces, right next to a TOW AWAY ZONE.

      Jaime looks at her watch, getting more and more FRUSTRATED --  
      then stops the car, gets out, looks around.  There's no one
      nearby, the back wall of the coffeeshop hiding her.

      Jaime goes over to the Porsche, looks down at it for a moment --
      then takes her right arm, reaches under the bumper, and LIFTS.

      The front of the Porche RISES, Jaime lifting it as easily as
      if it were CARDBOARD.  She looks down in disbelief, GRINS --
      then PULLS the car out of the spaces, WHEELING it over to
      the TOW-AWAY ZONE and DROPPING it with a heavy THWUMMPP!


      JAIME darts out of the rubble of the restaurant -- she RACES
      behind another building, DISAPPEARING in a flash.


      JAIME races through a MAZE of alleyways, to get BEHIND the
      OFFICE BUILDING where Sarah is STILL FIRING.

      Jaime looks around frantically -- the building TOWERS over
      her, the roof hopelessly high.  But Chinatown is a WARREN of
      buildings, all various heights -- Jaime glances at the several
      APARTMENTS and OFFICES surrounding Sarah's building --   
      and Jaime JUMPS STRAIGHT UP.


      She FLIES through the air, LANDING with a THUMPP! on the
      lowest building, pausing only long enough to look to the
      next, JUMPING again --

      -- LEAPING across the rooftops with feline grace, to get to
      the ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING.                                                                                        52.


      SARAH is perched at the edge of the roof, sighting down the
      sniper rifle for another shot -- when THUMPPP! something
      LANDS on the roof behind her.  She WHIRLS --

      JAIME CRASHES into her full-force --

      SARAH goes FLYING, skidding on the pebbled roof, rifle SAILING
      off the roof, as

      JAIME sweeps up a piece of REBAR, STRIDES toward Sarah like
      the wrath of god itself --

      SARAH rolls instantly to her feet, crouched to ATTACK, as --

      JAIME HURLS the rebar like a javelin -- and THWACKK! the
      metal bar TEARS into Sarah's arm like an ARROW, JERKING her
      backwards to SLAM her against the roof stairway access --

      -- leaving Sarah IMPALED her through the UPPER ARM into the
      crumbling brick of the roof access.  PINNED like an insect.

                                      JAIME
                          (evenly)
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't want to hurt
                    you.  But I had to stop you --

      And unbelievably, Sarah SMILES -- not a hint of pain, she
      actually looks strangely AMUSED.  It's CHILLING.

                                      SARAH
                    Never apologize for success.

      Sarah FIXES her gaze on Jaime, never taking her eyes off her
      as she reaches across with her free hand -- and RIPS the
      rebar out of her arm with a GRUNT of pain, FREEING herself.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    No matter what the cost.

      Jaime stares in disbelief -- BLUE-WHITE BLOOD pulses from
      the GASH in Sarah's arm.  Bionic blood.

      Sarah MOVES slowly toward Jaime, like a STALKING PANTHER,
      swinging the rebar in one hand as she looks her up and down.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Well, well... isn't this interesting.
                          (a wicked grin)
                    Let's see what you've got under the
                    hood.

      Sarah FLINGS the rebar aside and CHARGES.  She's INCREDIBLY
      FAST, punching and kicking -- Jaime barely blocks.                                                                                        53.

      Sarah SWEEPS a kick, Jaime's feet fly out from under her,*
      Sarah PUNCHES her hard in the stomach -- and*

      JAIME goes FLYING, SLAMS hard into the roof access, FALLING*
      to her knees.  Sarah STRIDES up after her.*

      TIGHT ON JAIME'S FACE, bleeding, breath RASPING --*

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (curious, pleasant)
                    Who are you?

      -- and we're back to the OPENING SCENE.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Or maybe I should be asking... what
                    are you?

      Sarah KICKS Jaime in the stomach, almost casually.  Jaime
      CURLS in on herself, biting off the urge to SCREAM.

      Jaime rolls painfully onto her hands and knees, wind whipping
      her hair across her face -- then LOOKS UP, eyes fixing on
      Sarah, not in pain or fear, but DEFIANCE.

                                      JAIME
                          (gasping for breath)
                    Shouldn't I -- be asking -- you?

      Sarah GRABS Jaime by the hair and JERKS her to her feet,
      STARES her in the eye, inches apart.

                                      SARAH
                          (like a dare)
                    So ask.

      Jaime STARES right back at her, a CHALLENGE:

                                      JAIME
                    Who the hell are you?

      Sarah's answer is a GHOST OF A SMILE -- and she raises her
      arm to BACKHAND Jaime.  Her bladed hand comes WHISTLING down --

      -- sending Jaime FLYING to the very edge of the roof, SKIDDING
      up against the concrete lip.

                                      SARAH
                    My name is Sarah Peregrine.

      Sarah picks up the rebar, striding toward Jaime's crumpled
      form, wind WHIPPING the hair back from her face.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I'm the first bionic woman.

                                    END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                        54.

                                            ACT FIVE


      JAIME lies crumpled at the edge of the roof, back against
      the narrow concrete lip -- O.S. SIRENS, coming RAPIDLY CLOSER.

      SARAH strides toward her, rebar in hand, MURDER in her eyes.

                                      SARAH
                    I think one of us is more than enough. 

      JAIME is CORNERED, she glances desperately DOWN --

      VFX BIONIC EYE as Jaime spots THE SNIPER RIFLE she knocked
      from Sarah's hand, lying where it fell on a roof far below.

      Jaime has only an INSTANT to decide, Sarah's almost on her --*
      and Jaime ROLLS off the roof, FALLING into OPEN AIR.*


      Jaime HURTLES downward, TWISTS painfully in midair --

      -- and lands THRUMMP! unsteadily on her legs on the lower*
      roof, hand SHOOTING OUT to SWEEP the rifle up, WHIRLING around*
      with the rifle to her SHOULDER to sight on Sarah --

      VFX BIONIC EYE, looking up -- Sarah has vanished.

      Jaime turns, looks down -- to see an AMBULANCE pulling up to
      the restaurant below, SIRENS BLARING.


      Jaime pulls up LATE -- the school is practically EMPTY, no
      one out front but a kids straggling from late BAND PRACTICE.

                                      JAIME
                    Hey, have you seen Becca Sommers?


      The van drives through the WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, old hulking
      buildings RISING in the dark around them like RUINS of some
      ancient, forgotten city.


      The Van PARKS behind a building.  The SPEC OPS GUYS emerge
      SILENTLY, blending with the surrounding shadows. They all
      wear EARBUDS and THROAT MIKES with their gear.

      POV JAIME, VFX BIONIC EYE, as she looks THROUGH THE DIRTY
      WINDOW that fronts the warehouse -- inside, BLURRED by dust
      and grime on the pane, she sees SARAH sitting at a workbench.

      VFX BIONIC EYE ZOOMING IN -- Sarah has ONE ARM stretched in*
      front of her, using a small ARC WELDER on her inner arm.*

                                    JAE
                          (into throat mike)
                    Control, target sighted.


      Jae CLICKS OFF the safety on his 9mm.                                                                                        67.

                                    JAE
                    I'm not counting on it.

      Jaime follows Jae and Brett toward the front of the warehouse. 
      The building looks ABANDONED, the walls cracked and worn. 
      JAE kneels at the LOCK on the door, starts PICKING it.

      AT THE LOADING DOCK, RADCLIFFE CLIPS the heavy lock;       *
      AT THE BACK DOOR, SHEPHERD expertly PICKS the lock in seconds. *
      BACK AT THE FRONT, JAE is still trying to get the lock open.*

                                      DANNY (O.S.)
                    Team B in position.  Loading dock
                    clear.  We're good to go.

      Brett looks down at Jae, impatiently, Jae can't get the lock --

                                    MAC (O.S.)
                    Team C in position.  East door clear. 
                    Good to go. 

      SCOWLING, Jae moves aside from the door.

                                    JAE
                            (whispering, not happy)
                    Sommers.  Do it.
                          (into headset)
                    On my mark, people.  Three -- two --
                    one -- mark.

      And with shocking grace, Jaime BACK SPIN-KICKS the lock,
      PULVERIZING it, sending the metal doors FLYING inwards.


      JAIME runs like a BLUR through the streets, black fatigues *
      making her almost INVISIBLE.  The city FLIES by her -- she's*
      a FLASH of black in the shadows, moving too fast to follow.*


      A vacant TENEMENT BUILDING in a dark, deserted SLUM, broken
      windows like jagged, blind eyes staring into the night.

      JAIME walks up to the door, ALONE.

      TWO ARMED THUGS melt out of the shadows, blocking her way --

                                      JAIME
                    I hear your boss is hiring. 

      The Thugs GRIN at each other, then motion her through.  She
      walks inside, VANISHING into the inky shadows beyond.


      Jaime climbs smoothly out the window, looking UPWARDS --

      VFX BIONIC EYE, as the TARGETING DISPLAY narrows to THE SAME
      ROOM on the top floor.

      Jaime looks upward, GAUGING the distance -- and JUMPS. 

      She SHOOTS up -- CATCHES herself ON THE LIP OF THE ROOF,*
      bionic fingers DIGGING into the cement like it was CLAY.                                                                                        85.

      She's HANGING right outside the window of the room -- the
      window is BOARDED UP.  She SWINGS backwards like a gymnast --
      and SLAMS her legs feet-first INTO THE WINDOW.


      A black van comes SCREAMING up, door open to reveal JONAS -- *
      The Spec Ops Guys RACE outside, Jaime half-carrying Jae,*
      bullets RICOCHETING off the van as the Team PILES in -- *

                                    MAC
                    Go, go, go!

      RUTH is driving -- she FLOORS IT, Jonas DOGS the door shut,*
      and the van CAREENS away into the darkness.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      The first light of dawn is STREAKING the sky over the peaceful
      acres of Jonas' complex.

      JAIME is sitting on a boulder outside the complex, watching
      the sun rise.  She's beaten up, grimy.  JONAS comes up behind*
      her, sits down beside her.

                                      JONAS
                    Thank you.

      Jaime nods, silent.  

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    I can't ask for your trust.  I know
                    I don't deserve it.  But, the thing
                    is -- you were good at what you just
                    did.

      Jaime just keeps watching the sunrise.                                                                                         87.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    I need you, even though you don't
                    need me.  From what I can see, you've
                    spent a lot of your life trying to
                    rescue people -- like your sister --
                    and not always with the best results. 
                    I think some part of you wants to do
                    more.  I want to give you the chance
                    to do that.  Just... think about it.

      Jaime turns to look at him, inscrutable -- then STANDS.

                                      JAIME
                    It's time for me to get home. 


      Jonas is sitting with his drink, uncomfortably reading a*
      magazine.  Jaime DROPS into the seat across from him. 

                                      JAIME
                    We need some ground rules.

                                      JONAS
                          (startled)
                    We do?                                                                                        89.

                                      JAIME
                          (right to business)
                    This never touches Becca.  She never
                    knows.  You get her a tutor, to help
                    with her grades, and some kind of
                      protection when I'm not around. 
                          (quickly)
                    Although, you know, low-key -- not
                    someone visibly ex-military.  And
                      definitely not male.

      Jonas is trying hard not to smile, not entirely succeeding.

                                      JONAS
                    Not male.  Right.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm working, so I'll want to pull a
                      reasonable salary.  But I'm keeping
                    my day job.

                                      JONAS
                          (not quite sure he
                              understands)
                    You want to keep working -- here.

                                      JAIME
                    Look, I'm not going to spend all my
                    time talking about handguns and who
                    can wire C4 the fastest. I like my
                    job, my friends, my world.  I'm not
                    trading it for yours.  Understand?

                                      JONAS
                    Actually, I do.

                                      JAIME
                    I choose the missions;  I can say no
                    to anything.

      She looks him in the eye, CHALLENGING, for the final thing:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    And you never, ever lie to me again.

                                      JONAS
                    Fair enough.  But I've got a condition
                    myself.

      Jaime looks uncertain --

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    So far, you've cost me a bloody
                    fortune in doors.

      Jonas pulls a PASSKEY from his pocket, like the one we've
      seen him use in the complex.                                                                                         90.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Here.  This is a passkey that opens
                    every door in the complex.  Complete
                    access.

      Jaime takes it, nodding. 

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
