He looks down by his feet and finds the morning
paper, wrapped in blue plastic, lying on the doormat. He picks it up
and goes back inside.
Sadie and Harvey freeze like caught children.
HARVEY, 19, looks younger than his is; his
facial hair isn't capable yet of filling out his meager goatee. He
seems hurt, like a spoiled child who hasn't gotten his way.
ED
What's going on?
SADIE
Christ.
I'm so sorry.
HARVEY
Who's this?
Is this him?
SADIE
Will you shut up?
HARVEY
He's so old.
ED
Excuse me?
SADIE
Can we just go inside?
Please?
Ed lets Sadie inside.
HARVEY
So that's it?
You're going with him now?
SADIE
You really don't understand anything.
HARVEY
You said you loved me.
SADIE
Jesus.
Would you shut up?
You are so embarrassing.
HARVEY
Embarrassing?
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You with this fucking geriatric old man.
That's embarrassing.
ED
You little shit.
Ed makes a move toward Harvey, but Harvey backs away quickly.
HARVEY
Don't touch me!
SADIE
Let's just go in, OK?
He'll leave.
HARVEY
User.
SADIE
Stalker.
Psycho.
HARVEY
Slut.
Sadie slams the door on him.
1tt1Ed, rather than let her in, pushes her outside and shuts the door behind her.
ED
No.
I'm busy right now.
I called the police.
SUSIE
What did they say?
ED
They're working on it.
You can call them if you want.
1tt1Ed finds Derm's card in his pocket and hands it to her.
SUSIE
Aren't you worried?
ED
Of course I'm worried. I'm just working right now. This
girl is one of my students. She wanted some help on an assignment. She
doesn't know anything about Eve being missing.
SUSIE
What happened to you?
ED
George Simian hit me.
SUSIE
George?
ED
You know him.
It figures.
1tt1Susie starts crying.
Ed stares at her helplessly, then goes back inside.
SUSIE
Wait.
1tt1Ed stops.
SUSIE
Can I come back later?
ED
It's late.
I just took some sleeping pills.
I haven't slept much since this all started.
Why don't you come back tomorrow?
SUSIE
Tomorrow?
ED
Good night, Susie.
Ed walks back in, leaving Susie standing on the porch.
