 
 The Enterprise in orbit around a planet. 
 
     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43510.7. 
   The Enterprise has put in at Rutia 
   Four to deliver medical supplies 
   following an outbreak of violent 
   protests. 
 
 
 Shops, a cafe, people strolling. A modern community. 
 Beverly, Data and Worf are walking through the plaza. 
 
     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Although non-aligned, the planet 
   has enjoyed a long trading 
   relationship with the Federation. 
 
 Beverly spots the cafe, and stops. 
 
     BEVERLY 
   We've still got a few minutes 
   before our next meeting... 
 
 Worf scans the plaza. Everything seem calm. They 
 ENTER, and seat themselves at a table. 
 
 A WAITER stands by the door staring intently into the 
 plaza. He does not acknowledge the presence of the 
 Starfleet officers. Beverly is becoming annoyed, she 
 lifts her hand, signalling for service. 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Excuse me --

 Suddenly, a bomb EXPLODES destroying a shop... 
 wounding several passers-by... people react, scared, 
 running... 
 
         QUICK PAN TO: 
 
 
 A scene of chaos. Shattered glass lies glittering on 
 the pavement. Dust and debris from the explosion is 
 settling. A jet of some escaping gas pours from a 
 broken pipe. Three people are down, all of them 
 showing blood. 
 
5    ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN 
 
 ENTER. Beverly starts to move to the first victim, but 
 an officer draws a phaser, and blocks her way. 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Put that thing away. I'm a 
   doctor. 
 
 Beverly isn't waiting for permission. She shoulders 
 past him. Beverly drops down next to a casualty, pulls 
 out her tricorder and examines him... 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Just lie still... don't try to 
   move... 
 
 Turning to Worf and Data -- 
 
 
 



                                                                                                                      Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net

     BEVERLY 
   Lieutenant, I need bandages... 
   Disinfectant... something with 
   alcohol in it ... 
 
     WORF 
   Doctor, it is not safe... 
 
     BEVERLY 
   That's an order, Mister Worf... 
 
 Worf hesitates only briefly, exchanging a glance with 
 Data, goes toward the restaurant... as she moves to 
 look at another victim... 
 
     BEVERLY 
   There's a lot of bleeding, but 
   it's not as bad as it looks. 
   Don't be afraid. 
 
 The policeman looks at Data... 
 
     POLICEMAN 
   The Klingon is right. These 
   Ansata... they're madmen... there 
   could be another bomb. 
    (to the others) 
   Clear this area. Everyone out 
   of the plaza. 
 
     DATA 
   Doctor, a return to the Enterprise 
   would be prudent. 
 
 She just looks at him, continues her work. 
 
     DATA 
   This planet does have 
   physicians... 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Who aren't here yet. I am. 
 
 Worf comes back out of the restaurant with some 
 ripped-up tablecloths, some liquor bottles... he's 
 helped by the waiter who crosses to Beverly... as she 
 takes the materials, immediately begins to utilize them 
 in emergency care... she barely glances up at the 
 waiter who is interested in what she's doing... a 
 throwaway line --

 He moves away... takes a beat at the entrance to the 
 cafe to look back again, thoughtfully, then enters... 
 
6    ANOTHER ANGLE - DATA 
 
     DATA 
   Captain, there has been an 
   incident. 
 
         INTERCUT TO: 
 
 
 The WAILING of emergency vehicles is much closer. 
 Beverly continues to treat the wounded. Worf is 
 running tricorder scans of the buildings. Data moves 
 to him... 
 
     WORF 
   The tricorder is not reading any 
   other explosive devices in this 
   vicinity... 
 
10   ANGLE - AN WOMAN IN AUTHORITY (ALEXANA) 
 
 arrives, accompanied by security guards... glances at 
 Data and Worf as she passes... examines the scene... 
 
11   ANGLE - THE WAITER 
 
 moves barely outside the door of the restaurant to 
 watch... 
 
12   THE SCENE (OPTICAL) 
 
 as an extraordinary arc of light appears... 
 simultaneous with his arrival is a SOUND like lighting 
 finding ground. A CRACK of almost concussive 
 proportions. A MAN who seems to literally appear out 
 of the light. He wears a shoulder device. And he 
 looks to be in definite pain as he arrives. People 
 begin running ... because it is nothing new... in 
 quick cuts -- 
 
13   DATA AND WORF 
 
 react... 
 
14   ALEXANA 
 
 is shielded by her guards...

 turns and finds the man inches away... she recoils, but 
 the man catches her by the arm. 
 
16   ANGLE - A GUARD (OPTICAL) 
 
 goes for his weapon, and the terrorist shoots from the 
 hip killing the guard. The terrorist strengthens his 
 hold on Beverly as... 
 
17   DATA AND WORF 
 
 reach for their phasers... they don't have a clear shot 
 through the crowd... and as they jockey forward for 
 position... 
 
18   BEVERLY AND THE TERRORIST (OPTICAL) 
 
     BEVERLY 
   You don't understand... I'm a 
   doc... 
 
 And then they're gone... VANISHING into a new burst of 
 light. On Data and Worf's reaction... 
 
         FADE OUT.

 FADE IN: 
 
 
 In orbit. 
 
 
 It's a round-up. Uniformed police officers have people 
 stopped. 
 
 The twenty-fourth century version of papers (a transparent 
 triangle shaped card which is read by a light pen) are 
 being checked. 
 
 Alexana and Riker, in the company of her security 
 guards watch the proceedings.

33   NEW ANGLE 
 
 As the waiter we saw in the teaser is taken into 
 custody. He glares at Riker and Alexana as he's taken 
 away. 
 
34   BACK TO RIKER AND ALEXANA 
 
     RIKER 
   This is no way to live. 
 
     ALEXANA 
   For us or them? 
 
     RIKER 
   For both of you. 
 
     ALEXANA 
   I know it's not pretty, Riker. 
   But this is what terrorism has 
   done to this city. 
 
     RIKER 
   There must be a better way than 
   this to deal with it. 
 
     ALEXANA 
   I know my methods seem harsh but 
   believe me, they're gentle 
   compared to my predecessors. 
   Suspects would be brought into 
   police headquarters and... 
   mysteriously vanish. I put a stop 
   to that. 
 
     RIKER 
   And what happened to this 
   predecessor of yours? 
 
     ALEXANA 
   He was murdered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



                                                                                                                      Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net    STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT TWO   27. 
 
34   CONTINUED: 
 
 As Riker reacts, a woman and her son -- a boy about 
 Wesley's age -- are fettered with twenty-fourth century 
 handcuffs are led away. 
 
 For some reason, this arrest affects Riker more than 
 the others, and his tone is sharp. 
 
     RIKER 
   Are you going to tell me that 
   boy's a threat? 
 
     ALEXANA 
   It's possible. 
    (a beat) 
   That shuttlebus I told you 
   about... the bomb was set by a 
   teenager. 
 
 Riker can only shake his head. He's getting fed up 
 with the whole situation. 
 
     ALEXANA 
   And in a world where children blow 
   up children... everyone's a 
   threat. 
 
 And as they watch the round-up continue:
