An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We
hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-
century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past
the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and
CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.
VOICE (V.O.)
There comes a time for every vampire
when the idea of eternity becomes
momentarily unbearable...
As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT
OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:
A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,
silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.
VOICE (V.O.)
The wounds suffered from love and
failed friendships don't heal like
a human's, but seem to only gape
larger. The longing to be mortal
returns, a longing for finiteness.
A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.
VOICE (V.O.)
In 1883 I suffered such a spell
and decided to cease feeding on
blood. Just lie in the earth and
let time return to its natural
state...
As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine
growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER
and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.
Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the
sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months
fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns
all around the tomb.

VOICE (V.O.)
I had hoped the sounds of the
passing eras would fade out, and a
kind of death might happen. A
kind of forgetting where I would
be healed from my wounds.
The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS
DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.
VOICE (V.O.)
But as I lay there, the sounds
didn't fade but grew with the
world.
The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET
STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS
MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK
BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.
VOICE (V.O.)
And gradually the world didn't
sound like the place I had left,
but something different...
better...
As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of
the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...
VOICE (V.O.)
A new fearless attitude had
possessed the world, brave and
Godless. I began to wonder if it
was not time to resurrect. But
the thing that eventually brought
me back -- the decisive thing
really -- came like a bolt out of
the blue.
GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw
and dark.

SERIES OF GLIMPSES

Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and
a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.
Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored
nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the
confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or
girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in
on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and
LOUDER than the rest.

A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the
most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its
emotion.
VOICE (V.O.)
A music so sublime, so deeply
vampiric, I had no doubt it could
be heard in Hades. I had no
choice... it summoned me.
An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a
BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its
energy.

The Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in
tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery
in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the
physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG
plays, drawing the figure toward it.

The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill
of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a
darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements.
He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the
band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a
voice...

Pulling deeper into the shadows, the caped Figure beckons
the dealer over. The man approaches when -- With a wild
animal cry, the Figure lunges like a phantom -- A flash of teeth

upon him. OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again,
reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent
frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's
neck.

WIDER

Rising from his victim we see for the first time the
revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair
frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT --
his bulbous lips glistening red.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Whether it was that first meal,
the music, or the 100 years of
rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I
was feeling better than ever. My
appetite for living was voracious.
My hearing so exact I could locate
precisely the source of the
music...
13
13
In the street, Lestat emerges from the shadows in the
dealer's snug-fitting leather outfit. He looks up at an
extremely run-down flophouse...
LESTAT (V.O.)
My old house.
High in the attic, a single window glows with dim light.
The source of the MUSIC. The whole house is shaking from
the sound of the BAND playing upstairs.

FLYING ACROSS night skies, as the distinctive dark sound
of SATAN'S NIGHT OUT KICKS IN to join Lestat's soaring
voice.

LESTAT (V.O.)
It was a bold move, I admit. But
from that moment on, they were my
friends, my children, my band.
Together we rode on the wave of my
preternatural ambition to
superstardom, giving the world a
new god... me.
We COME ACROSS the city lights of London. Below, police
cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek,
ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has
gathered.
SUPERIMPOSE:
LONDON (6 MONTHS LATER)
16

Through the crowd, a very long, black limousine snakes
its way toward the building. Rows of fans dressed as
Goths, ghouls and vampires scream out...
FANS
Lestat!
Lestat!
Girls press their breasts and necks up against the
limousine. Thump! Thump! Fan after female fan flings
herself on the car. Groupies scream with pure
excitement.
Confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. The
crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... James, Alex
and Maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. ROGER SMYTHE,
their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling
them through the crowd.
A wave of hysteria hits the fans. Roger hustles the
band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church,
past the giant billboard with their own images written
huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the
announcement --
LESTAT -- LIVE & UNDEAD -- OCTOBER 31, ALL HALLOW'S EVE,
DEATH VALLEY, U.S.A.

25A
Lestat walks across his lavish grounds, gazes up into the
night.
Staring up at the dark heavens, Lestat inhales like an
emperor taking in his kingdom, stretches his arms out, still
drinking in the adulation.
Slowly, his grin fades...
A melancholy look comes over Lestat.
LESTAT
(quietly, to world)
Come out, come out, whoever you
are.
As he lowers his arms, the CAMERA PULLS UP and OUT FROM
Lestat, whirling into the dark night...

PULL OUT ON...
A beautiful young woman, JESSE, 22, lays in black satin
sheets. Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as
she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death. Flickering
candles all over the room reveal her lithe, strong body,
pale as the moon. She is surrounded by her work, ancient
language books, her laptop computer. Another book is
clenched in her hand. The Unconscious Vampire. We MOVE
IN ON her fluttering eyes.

opening. Blank. Still. Unsettling. PULL BACK to
reveal these eyes belong to a 19th-century porcelain
doll. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls from
different eras, all exquisitely detailed. TRACK PAST the
billowing floor-to-ceiling curtains to reveal a six-year-
old girl lying awake in a large bed, Jesse, green eyes and
long red curls. LAUGHTER wafts in with the breeze.
28
35
Fluorescence pierces the black night. Jesse comes out
of the tube station in a tight, short skirt, boots. She
looks down the street. In one direction, a busy,
brightly-lit street. Jesse gazes at a group of tourists
coming out of a pub, laughing. Then she turns, looks the
other direction. A dark street. She hesitates a long
moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself,
plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then
DYING.
36
36
Jesse passes "rent-boys" stepping from the shadows as
cars cruise by. Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one
gets in a car. He stares back at her, disappears into
the car.
37
37
Jesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the
dark, filthy streets. She strides past a girl leaning
against a brick wall, the man grunting, moving
rhythmically against her.
38
38
Fog floats in the yellow vapor lights. Jesse pauses at
the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates,
nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into
the blackness...
39
39
Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho
private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign
and a dull blue light mounted above.
Jesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures
moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares,
barely breathing, her heart pounding.
The figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright,
glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment
later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another
creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door
closes quickly.
Jesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer
to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears
something, whirls around.

Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a

girl)
You, in.
Across the street, a figure in the shadows watches.
42
42
Bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy
girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.
A cold WIND suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.
He
looks up. A dark figure stands in the shadows.
BOUNCER #1
Hey, perv, get the hell out of
here.
The figure steps from the shadows.
The Bouncer's face
turns white.
It's Lestat...
The Bouncer starts to back way. The girl starts to
scream. Lestat clamps his hand over the girl's mouth.
To the girl...
LESTAT
You.
In...
He gestures to the club. The girl turns and runs for her
life. As the Bouncer backs away, terrified, Lestat turns
to him.

It was the winter of 1788 and I

LESTAT (V.O.)
... if a man is what you'd call
him.

LESTAT (V.O.)
I impressed my maker with my
thirst for things. He set out to
educate me in the unknown. Taught
me all about the world, its hidden
history... and about myself.
TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as
Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the
fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.

MARIUS
That's enough, my son... When you
feed, you must hold back from the
moment of death. You must never
take the last drop, or it will
draw you in and you will die...
The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering
victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into
a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength,
drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat.
Water starts bubbling in.
MARIUS
Remember, there is wisdom in the
flesh, Lestat. A man wears his
history on his skin...
Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him.
MARIUS
I'm talking about humanity.
As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom
of the boat...
LESTAT
Humanity?
(snort)
We're murderers.
MARIUS
We're more than that. Their blood
that we take into us carries with
it life... their life, their
knowledge, their complexity.
Appreciate your prey, Lestat.
Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire
strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.
55
55
Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and
Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears
to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance,
several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures
gathered around.

LESTAT (V.O.)
My senses run amok, like a newborn
child. And as for my new powers,
I was beside myself with the
pleasure of it all...
MARIUS
The trick is to find the way to
face eternity head on. The
spirit can be annihilated by
boredom just as the body can be
destroyed by sun or fire. My
solace, my delight, is witnessing
the unfolding of human destiny...
Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual
fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers,
just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.
Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden
in shadow.
MARIUS
... From Christ to the Dark Ages
to the enlightenment, I've never
been able to divine what was coming.
That's what keeps me going -- I
can't wait to see what human
beings are going to do next...
Lestat nods, taking it in. They pass another bonfire.
MUSIC floats through the night. An OLDER MAN, 50, plays
balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great
passion.
MARIUS
Who could've predicted the
Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his
elephants?
Marius stops talking, turns. Lestat is no longer beside
him. Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the
shadows, listening to the music. The young woman, sensing
something, turns towards Lestat in the shadows as she
plays. Marius goes to Lestat, pulls him farther into the
shadows.
MARIUS
Careful.

LESTAT
But why must we hide, Marius? We
are the powerful, we are the
immortal. We should walk fearless
in the open!
MARIUS
Shhh. The life of a vampire is a
life of discretion. We must sleep
during the day, when we are
vulnerable to the sun. Mortals
must never know about us. It is
forbidden, for the sake of all our
kind.
LESTAT
(gazing at violin
player as it sinks in)
So I could never know her?
MARIUS
Not unless you wanted to kill her.
LESTAT
(beat, quietly,
intensely)
So I can never be known?
MARIUS
You're known by me. I granted you
that. There are others of our
kind... though most are solitary
creatures.
Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.
LESTAT
My God...
MARIUS
Forget God. You're no longer in
his realm. Now we must leave.
Relenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music
quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is
calling to him.
The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and
plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands
there frozen to the spot. The music pulses through
him. He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate
movements intensely...

Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face
still somewhat obscured by the darkness. Lestat starts
clapping along to the music, exuberantly.
The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play.
Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill
with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that
sitting on the ground by the girl are several
instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a
violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with
his new powers, as if by osmosis...
Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her
movements.
The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new
musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful,
exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers
pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of
notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.
Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into
firelight. The Father and his daughter become less
certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing
skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is
completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father
and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop
playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes.
The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in
horror at Lestat.
FATHER
Fantasma!! Teras!!
Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He
grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts
running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.
MARIUS
Stop her, Lestat!
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.
MARIUS
You must!
Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns
back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream...
Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her
mouth, covering her muffled scream.
Her struggle is no
use against his strength. Reaching up to her neck, he
touches it. He looks into her terrified eyes...

Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's
deserted shoreline. Tosses him in a boat. Lestat gazes
at the lifeless body of the girl. Marius turns to
Lestat, furious.
MARIUS
I will not have you put everything
at risk! You will mind our laws!
Picking up Lestat's victim, Marius tosses her into the
boat as well.
MARIUS
We remain in the shadows.
To do
otherwise is a road to
destruction...
Marius turns to Lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at
the girl and her Father.
MARIUS
(quietly)
I see you still have a few
lingering mortal emotions. They
will serve you no good, Lestat.
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head, speaks in a
horrified whisper...
LESTAT
My God, what have you done to me?
Lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and
her Father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness.
LESTAT

She's just a child... forgive me.

The violin dissolves into Lestat's ROCK MUSIC.

BACK TO JESSE (PRESENT)

Reading the journal, listening to LESTAT'S MUSIC. She
hears the lyrics... "Mine eyes dazzle, she died so
young..." She looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved
by Lestat's loneliness. She gazes into the dark night...
then turns, sees her camera...

Jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened
warehouses. Several bonfires line the lane, illuminating
rows of prone bodies, cardboard shelters, empty bottles.
The drunks look up at her with dead eyes.
60

Jesse goes deeper into a labyrinth of alleys, the street
becoming darker with every step. In the distance she
sees the blue light. Figures moving through the fog.
Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to
get a better look... Suddenly, out of the shadows, a
BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace...
Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises
from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more
scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the
night. Jesse presses her back against the wall.
Breathes. She inches around the corner...
61
61
... and from the shadows, gazes at figures knocking on
the solitary door in the wall up ahead, with the dull
blue light mounted above. The slot in the door slides
open. A moment later, the figures vanish inside.
A moment later, two couples approach, dressed in black.
Jesse takes a deep breath, then...

A face peers out at the group. Steps back. The door

behind her.

Jesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the
three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten
outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind
her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in,
smiling.
PUNK VAMPIRE #3
Now this isn't gonna hurt.
You
might even enjoy it...
He runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to
shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin.
He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the
air...
Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse
hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for
air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley
by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy.
Finds herself staring at...
Lestat...
Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.
He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness
of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks,
her pulsing jugular.

Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to
gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.
They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.
JESSE
You saved me.
LESTAT
Perhaps... So you know Marius...
Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk
Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out. She glances at
Lestat. He mustn't see it. She steps away, tries to
distract him.
JESSE
I know a lot of things.
He gazes at her. Moves closer, breathing her in, making
her flustered. He smiles.
LESTAT
Not how to stay alive apparently.
JESSE
Well I guess we've got that in
common. Although I think I'm a
little ahead in the race here.
LESTAT
(a beat, surprised
at her brazenness)
Well, I can fix that.
He circles her. Jesse is shaking, terrified. Enjoying
the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer. But Jesse suddenly
blurts out.
JESSE
'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so
young.' It's about the girl with
the violin, isn't it?
That stops Lestat. He gazes at Jesse, surprised.
Recovers his composure. Stares at her intensely,
regarding her anew.
LESTAT
Is it? And what else do you think
you know?

Am I?
Tell me all about it.
JESSE
You're... you're both artists.
He's
a painter. You're a singer...
As she speaks, Lestat guides Jesse over to a pile of
crates. She stares at some beer bottles shattered on
the top of one. He guides her hand downward, closer to
the shattered glass.
LESTAT
Is that so?
What I do is art, is
it?
JESSE
Yes... From nothing... you try to
create... something beautiful...
(shaking now as her
hand gets closer
and closer)
... out of the... the cold, dark
wasteland of eternity...
He stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes
her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. She
gasps with pain...
Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear,
glistening on Jesse's finger...
LESTAT
(softly)
Something beautiful...
JESSE
(quickly)
But... but Marius isn't a rebel.
You're different in that way. You
don't want to hide, follow the
laws, concealed in the shadows
like some insect. You... you
still want to walk with the
living, don't you, Lestat?

He stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding
finger toward his mouth.

As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his
mouth...
JESSE
No, but the only time you're not
really alone is when you kill...
But, Lestat, you can't help it...
it's not your fault... He made
you this way...
LESTAT
(with her blood on
his lips, shakes
his head)
Ah.
Poor, poor me...
As he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth.
Their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy
cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her
remarkable, if foolhardy daring. Her eyes gazing
straight into his...
He brings her bleeding finger into his mouth.
She may
swoon.
Lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her
fragility a brief second, listening to her blood.
there's something there that surprises him as he gazes
at this mortal girl. He feels something. Desire...
Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her
rucksack. He sees the journal. It all falls into place.
Lestat's lip curls in anger. He shoves Jesse away.
Wipes his mouth. The mood suddenly changes.
LESTAT
Well, Talamascan, you're certainly
a very clever librarian, aren't
you?
She stares at him, found out. He turns from her,
laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse
think all's well.

LESTAT
(shaking his head)
How sad, you people always trying
to know the unknowable... So, was
it a good read? My diary.
Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all.
He shakes his head.
LESTAT
Talamasca's been following me for
years. I've never known one to be
so brave. Or is it just foolish?
JESSE
I... I'm only an apprentice.
He waves her off, dismissive.
LESTAT
Go. I'm through with you. Your
kind never satisfies my thirst.
He turns, walks away. Jesse lets out a sigh of relief,
then stares after him. She hesitates, then suddenly
calls out:
JESSE
Does anything, Lestat?
A pause in his gait. But he keeps walking away.
Jesse
hesitates again, but still calls out.
JESSE
I mean, what's the point of coming
into the light if not to have
someone really know you?
But he keeps going.
She takes one last chance --
JESSE
You want the world to see you're
real, don't you, Lestat? Don't
you? Well, here I am!
Suddenly Lestat spins. Stares at the fragile mortal girl
risking everything. Flash. Jesse gasps.
He now stands right before her. He grabs her, pulls her
to him close, tight, hard. He could just snap her neck
and be done with it.

LESTAT
You better just stick to your
books, Talamascan. 'Cause you
have it all wrong. I love all
this. I delight in it. The
dark, dreary world I went to
sleep in has burnt itself out and
been replaced by the 20th Century
-- can you imagine my joy at
waking up to discover such a
world? It has outdistanced my
wildest dreams of it. I scream of
good and evil, and mortals stand
and cheer. I adore being back in
action... every moment, every
single drop of it! Now consider
yourself exceedingly lucky and go!
He pushes her away.
She gasps, humbled by his physical
power.
She retrieves her rucksack. Starts away. As she
reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath,
turns back, daring everything.
JESSE
Lestat!
He turns back, stares at her, astonished.
JESSE
There's something you left out of
your diary.
LESTAT
(amazed)
What?
JESSE
(stares right into
his eyes)
You kept her violin, didn't you?
A beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the
absurdity of what she's saying. But Jesse is undaunted.
JESSE
Hey, it's okay. I understand...
(softly)
After all, it's only human.

That stops him. Their eyes bore into each other again.
Electric. Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound
filling the alley. Lestat lunges, fangs bared. Jesse
screams. Turns. Runs. Finds herself --
In the midst of traffic on a busy street.
People walking
by.
JESSE
Jesus Christ.
She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive.
Then it sinks in. She realizes -- Lestat let her go.
She glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone.
She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in,
tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something
else -- desire.
What she doesn't see is...
Lestat in the shadows, silently watching her. He gazes
at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal
passion. She has affected him.
He watches as she turns and runs away.

him. He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of

BACK TO SANCTUARY

Lestat sinks his teeth into Akasha's vein, drawing in the
unimaginable font. A burst of image and color floods
into him, as...

LESTAT'S IMAGES

of Ancient Egypt... power... supremacy... slavery... all
impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red
lips, blood spurting like a fountain...

MARIUS

in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the
stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. Marius looks
down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with
flames. Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...
MARIUS
What have you done, Lestat?
Lestat!
91
92
THROUGH the balcony we see the last warm colors of the
sunset vanish into the blue of night. Lestat awakens,
his manacles removed. He stretches, shakes his head, as
if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop...
Something has changed. Marius's paints have gone. Some
of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes
are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded
marble floor.
LESTAT
Marius!
No response.
93
95
Lestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no
footprints.
LESTAT (V.O.)
Many times since, I have called to
Marius. I howled into the night
in loneliness and pain.
Lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair,
grief. He disappears off into the night.
LESTAT (V.O.)
But there was no answer -- just
the endless procession of days,
months, years... My teacher left
me to my darkest lesson -- that in
the end, we are alone.
Lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal. Wipes the
blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.

SUPERIMPOSE:
LOS ANGELES
PAN DOWN to Lestat standing on the edge of a very high
fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown,
gazing into the dark night. The fence encircles his
Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a
medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in
the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes.
Lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As
we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT
SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC
and with a visual splash we are... MOVING SWIFTLY ACROSS
the globe with the MUSIC -- as we CUT ACROSS the world
INTO the west and INTO... The night fallen over Asia
where we soon find ourselves in...

ASIAN FACTORY

VAMPIRE PANDORA

With one self-assured twist of her head, she shakes the
red dust from her hair to reveal long curling black
tresses falling down over her dark-skinned shoulders.
The MUSIC travels further to...

PORTABLE RADIO

held by a camel driver camping out in the Sahara Desert.
His CAMEL BRAYS fearfully... The camel driver stares
before him, drop-jawed and terrified, and we now see what
he sees...
105
CAMEL DRIVER'S POV
105
A corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begins to move, as
a figure in tattered rags emerges from the sarcophagus and
unbandages his face and neck, shakes the sand from his
hair and eyes to reveal a skeletal form with white
leathery skin bulging with strange blue veins...

The VAMPIRE KHAYMAN offers the driver a polite smile.
The driver faints back into the sand as the camels bolt
off. And still LESTAT'S MUSIC plays as we finally END UP
AT...
107
SANCTUARY OF AKASHA AND ENKIL
107
An OVER the SHOULDER SHOT of Enkil sitting motionless in
his throne, not resurrecting at all. Akasha and her
throne remain O.S. We MOVE CLOSER to reveal... Enkil's
throat gapes, torn open, and whereas before his skin
was pale, it's now a chalkish powder. And next to him...
Akasha's throne sits empty. A god again walks the earth.
A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into
white dust.

Lestat and Marius sit perched on a giant billboard
advertising Lestat's concert. Down below, Sunset Strip
is filled with Goths, club hoppers, HONKING CARS, a
traffic jam.
MARIUS
(sarcastic)
Impressive. Reminds me of mad old
Druids running around chanting in
the forest. Very primitive stuff.
LESTAT
Out there. My fans. Thousands and
thousands. They worship me.
Millions of arms reach out to
embrace, beg me to come into their
lives.
MARIUS
It's what you've always wanted.
LESTAT
With all my black little heart.
MARIUS
Do you think of anyone but
yourself?

LESTAT
I only have myself.
MARIUS
It may be time to get ready for
some company.
LESTAT
What's that supposed to mean?
MARIUS
Your music's woken a very old
friend...
Lestat looks at Marius, trying to understand.
MARIUS
Can't you hear it? Or is the
applause all you can hear now?
Marius becomes eerily still. A deep, somber TONE starts
to VIBRATE. The GROUND RUMBLES. Lestat taken aback,
remembers the scope of Marius's power. Lestat stares at
Marius, then closes his eyes...
120
CLOSE ON LESTAT'S EYES
120
As the sounds of the WORLD seem to FADE AWAY, revealing
beneath the cacophony of mortals a DEEP PULSE like the
beating of a heart the size of a planet.
121
BACK TO SCENE
121
Lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the WORLD
rush BACK IN. Marius stares for a beat, then --
MARIUS
Akasha has risen. She has taken
her King's blood. Absorbed his
power. You've done it this time.
Lestat stares at Marius, letting the knowledge sink in.
Then he grins.
LESTAT
Good! I'm glad she's risen!
Let
her come.
MARIUS
Don't you understand?
You must
stop this concert!
(CONTINUED)
73.

CONTINUED:

LESTAT
(shakes his head at
Marius)
200 years and the same broken
record.
MARIUS
No. Not the same! You've only
known Akasha dormant. She too
will find you. She is choosing
her moment. She has come to
destroy you, Lestat. And in her
wrath, she will devour everything
that moves. Mortal and vampire
alike.
LESTAT
(smiles at Marius,
softly)
Well then, it's every vampire for
himself. Just the kind of rules I
like. The rules you taught me.
Marius is enraged, tries to control himself.
Lestat
gazes at him, speaks steadily.
LESTAT
Do you remember your first words
to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.'
(shakes his head)
I'd rather not exist at all than
have to live eternally as a ghost.
MARIUS
And you're taking everyone with
you, you fool! We were once
mortals, too. It is our heritage
we protect!
LESTAT
(moving away)
Such reverence for mortals! Then
you should have left me as one!
MARIUS
You're a monster.
LESTAT
(shakes his head with a
dark laugh)
Said the vampire to his son.
Lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into
the black night. Marius stands alone.

The vampire doorman opens the door and peers out.
A
figure moves towards him...
124
AKASHA

glowing, beautiful, majestic. The vampire doorman is
frightened, but mesmerized as she moves in...
125
126
Marius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing
down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like
mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the
trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,
peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.
Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.
It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.
MAEL
Marius, you've broken your oath.
You were to watch over Akasha
and Khayman. You are a great
disappointment to me.
Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping
from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in
Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired
beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his
Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her
grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair,
alabaster skin.
MARIUS
Pandora, Armand, it's been a long
time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do
I owe this honor?
KHAYMAN
You have been summoned because of
your errant child...
Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the
distance at Lestat's house.
PANDORA
(giving deep,
sexy laugh)
He's quite the devil, isn't he?
ARMAND
His music mocks us, Pandora!
PANDORA
His music moves my blood.
ARMAND
Keep your amorous thoughts to
yourself. His music is a threat
to all vampires. We will let the
covens dismember him at his
concert.
(CONTINUED)
78.
126
CONTINUED:
126
MAEL
Yes.
It will set an example.
MARIUS
I don't see how this solves
things. This isn't thought
through.
KHAYMAN
Marius, we understand your
affection for Lestat, but your
duty is to us!
He gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening
glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.
KHAYMAN
We could always get rid of him
right now.
MAEL
No. We will contact the covens.
Let them know we condone the
slaying. It will be better for
all to see.
Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael.
Maharet steps up.
MAHARET
Wait. Never mind Lestat!
We
have greater problems...
MARIUS
(stepping up)
Maharet is right. It is Akasha
we face now.
PANDORA
(joyous)
Is it true, Maharet?
Has our
Queen really risen!
MAHARET
Don't be so happy, Pandora. I
knew Akasha when she walked this
earth. I was her slave. I am now
her enemy. I know what she is
capable of.
(CONTINUED)
79.
126
CONTINUED:

126
ARMAND
Yes. We've all felt her presence,
even as she hides from us.
(as others nod,
acknowledging the
truth of this)
What does she want now?
MAHARET
She knows only one thing. Taking
pleasure in destroying life. She
is already killing the young ones
to build her strength.
MARIUS
She's sucked the life out of her
King like a praying mantis. I
sense she is getting closer.
MAHARET
She has come to destroy Lestat,
but he will only whet her thirst
more...
The Ancients look to each other, taking this in.
Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.
MAHARET
If we act together, we have a
chance to destroy her.
They all gaze at Maharet, astonished.
MAHARET
Yes! We must destroy her
immediately! If she is not
stopped, I'm afraid of what will
happen to the entire mortal world.
MAEL
But can she be destroyed? I am
left to bear the scars of the last
attempt on her life. She was
dragged into the sun. She
survived. But we almost didn't...
Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face.
They
all stare at him.
MARIUS
What happens to our Queen happens
to us. If Akasha dies, we die
as well.
(CONTINUED)
80.
126
CONTINUED:
(3)
126
MAHARET
Then so be it! We must take that
chance.
She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her
words sink in.
MAHARET
We must destroy Akasha. For the
sake of humanity! We must find
her. Now!
ARMAND
But perhaps she has come to kill
Lestat and then will go back to her
slumber. That is our only hope.
PANDORA
(eager)
Yes. That's right. She and the
covens will take care of that
brat. We must go to the concert
and pay our respects to our great
Queen.
MAHARET
How? With your own throat!
You've all been asleep too long!
You're still dreaming.
Marius steps up beside Maharet.
MARIUS
Maharet speaks the truth.
It is
our only hope.
Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman.
The others gaze at the three standing together now.
MAEL
No. Armand is right. We will go
to the concert and first see what
she does. There may be no need
for action.
Pandora and Armand nod their assent. The two groups face
each other. Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out
the words.
(CONTINUED)
81.

CONTINUED:

126
MAHARET
Then you go to the concert and you
shall see!
(shakes her head)
And I thought the Ancients became
wise with their years.
As we REMAIN ON the Ancient Ones, AKASHA'S HEARTBEAT
creeps back in over... Marius gazes again down at
Lestat's house, anguish on his face.
Behind him now we see a cab pull over. It's Jesse,
trailing Roger. She gazes at him intently.
JESSE'S POV
Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a
whisper.
BACK TO JESSE
Jesse pays the driver.
Gets out.
Gazes at Roger.
127
128
Lestat stares out at the ominous night. As Maudy and the
band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night
get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The
song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the
band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes
back inside.
129
132
Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't
believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by
the experience.
JESSE
Do that again!
Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For
a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each
other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her.
She knows it. He turns away.
LESTAT
And now for my next trick.
Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.
Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something
stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She
stares, impressed.
JESSE
Did it hurt?
LESTAT
Yes. For just a moment. But as
the pain is more intense for us,
so is ecstacy.
(gazes at her)
You see, we love our victims.
JESSE
Love?
I thought it was the blood.
LESTAT
No, although the taste is so rich
and sweet. Love is the essence of
the dark gift. The connection is
so much more satisfying, brief as
it is, than anything else.
(CONTINUED)
88.
132
CONTINUED:
132
Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular,
the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her
neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch,
terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips
against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her
arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm
of his voice.
LESTAT
As you drink, you feel the heart
weakening... it struggles even
though there's no hope. You feel
the life slipping away, the flash
of those brief years. The taste
of mortality you can no longer
experience... and it is
beautiful...
(pulls away sharply)
No 'relationship,' no commingling
can ever reach the heights of that
experience.
But Jesse steps forward.
Lestat turns, stares at her.
Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.
One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens
her blouse down to her navel.
Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin
from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about
her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at
Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.
With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the
point across her breast. She inhales through clenched
teeth... then settles as we see:
The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,
like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping
down her chest.
Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her
gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound
itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her
face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She
shivers...
LESTAT
(groans)
Your blood...
JESSE
(murmurs)
Do you like it?

LESTAT
(losing himself)
Yes...
He comes down to her slender neck.
Stares at the soft,
pulsing skin. He bares his fangs.
JESSE
(whispering, overcome)
Do it to me... Please... With your
blood I'll know you...
133
CLOSE ON LESTAT
133
He can't help himself.
He moves to Jesse's white neck...
closer... closer...
JESSE
I'll know everything...
But suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he
tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a
desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him,
surprised. He looms over her, angry.
LESTAT
You want to know everything. You
want to see what it's like. Then
come! I'll show you.
134
134
Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat
stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark.
Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to
her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving
across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman
giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she
realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves
forward. Jesse gingerly follows.
Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite
her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches,
fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's
presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes
shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a
street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the
vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone.
Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too.
Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over
the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to
see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the
bench.
(CONTINUED)
90.
134
CONTINUED:
134
JESSE
Is she alright?
Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained
lips. Jesse reflexively looks away.
LESTAT
Come closer, Jesse. You want to
see? You want to know?
JESSE
Lestat, no!
Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his
back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The
woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as...
the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens...
finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm.
Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his
mouth, approaches Jesse.
LESTAT
You see now? Are you ready?
Now
do you want it?!
He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately
wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in
Jesse's face says it all.
LESTAT
No.
Of course you don't.
She backs away from him, now terrified. Something's
changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank.
LESTAT
Well I didn't grant your final
wish.
(shakes his head)
It was an impossible wish to begin
with. You see, I am unknowable.
His eyes still as death, he starts moving away.
JESSE
Lestat!
Wait!
Lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully,
pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.
LESTAT
Good-bye, Talamascan.

Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is
about to be over.
Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched
by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing
her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is
completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she
realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat
disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH
and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams,
backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but
Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides
towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her
cries... WHOOSH.

but unsettling. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls
from different eras. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to-

lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl.
Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood
memory. Is she dreaming now?

Maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty
desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see.
JESSE (V.O.)
Lestat is my destiny... I know
that now. I love you, Aunt
Maharet. Good-bye.
Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway,
she reads a sign -- "DEATH VALLEY 120 miles." Just then,
a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction.
She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop
on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER
leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid
with white face-paint and fake fangs.
VAMPIRE DRIVER
Need a ride?
Jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake
vampires. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT BLARES FROM the SPEAKERS.
JESSE
(smiles)
Yeah.
151

We see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road
toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.
A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is

A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.

I must show you my new paintings
sometime.
Marius smiles. Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a
lifetime's searching. He tries to say something, but
it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the
crowd at unnatural speed. Enormous pipes spout flames
high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light
along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian
effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the
top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of
human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline.
Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the
strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles
around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.
The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit
-- naked
bodies walk across heads of people while others
get
tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to
get
what they were promised... Nothing like they've
ever
seen.

A new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow
managed to include themselves in the select number of
attendees to a sacred rite. And among the mortals are
the immortals. Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires,
the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks
which they use to hide their knives and sickles.

HIGH ABOVE VALLEY

Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires,
except for Maharet. Some of whom can't help but smile
at the scene below. Marius is now with them.
PANDORA
(wistful, to Mael)
It's just like Nero's day.
They scan the horizon, the darkening sky.
MAHARET
Akasha will not be able to resist
this...
The CROWD begins to CLAP -- DRUMS from different circles
begin to impatiently BEAT into one deafening rhythm.

BLACKNESS.

Lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the
desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below.

Lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him Akasha in
an extravagant Egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold
draping her godly form. Lestat is awestruck. Akasha
comes to life...
LESTAT
Akasha...
Akasha still says nothing -- she advances with a
luscious, curling smile.
AKASHA
Why so surprised, my love?
You
called, and I have come.
Lestat is awestruck. There is such an unearthly power in
Akasha's voice. Everything seems to hum and vibrate with
her breath.
AKASHA
Never fear me, Lestat. Your
wishes have all come true.
LESTAT
My wishes...?
AKASHA
You have yearned for a companion
to share eternity. You have cried
out to the world. I have answered
your call.
Akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat.
AKASHA
You are so bold, like your music.
It woke me. You live your life in
the open, like I did long ago,
when I had a King.
LESTAT
Had a King?
AKASHA
He's no more. You are my consort.
I've kept you safe -- alive.
LESTAT
You?

AKASHA
You thought it was all you?
(laughing)
You have the ego of a king as
well. I know you, Lestat. I know
that you crave to have the world
at your feet. I have come to give
it to you.
Akasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across
her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it,
as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at
it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around
Lestat, she braces him, licks his face.
AKASHA
Has your tongue lost its taste for
blood?
LESTAT
(melting)
Never.
AKASHA
But you didn't kill the mortal
girl.
Lestat looks caught.
AKASHA
Instead you kissed her.
Now kiss
me.
(NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night
sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him,
hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill
into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to
meet her as...
Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until
their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into
him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers
in him and floods his body with an electric rush.
AKASHA
Be my King. Forget about
everything else.
Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.
His
eyes are empty of everything except her blood.
AKASHA
What's your answer?

Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth
spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe
over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a
powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin
together, detached from time and space.

FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE
181
All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching.
Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and
lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest,
his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins.
Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly
through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of
his hand.
LESTAT
Can we try that again?
Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a
kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual
hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and
scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.
LESTAT
Show me the world...
Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up
into the air and off into the night.

Lestat and Akasha stand on a cliff-top. WIND rips
through the trees. Everywhere, there are torches, and a
million candles light the vast house. Lestat and Akasha
glide past the forest of exotic flowers... Past the
fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French
doors. Long white curtains billow in the sea wind.
LESTAT
Where are we?
AKASHA
We are home.
LESTAT
You live here?
AKASHA
We live everywhere and anywhere we
choose. The world is our garden.

... out the French windows onto the beach, bodies of
servants and villagers are scattered. Lestat's feet step
down the wooden stairs, onto the sand, through the
bodies...
Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the
pink sky.
AKASHA
Behold our Kingdom.
Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach.
LESTAT
Why?

AKASHA
(puzzled)
Why not?
LESTAT
This is the reason you have risen?
AKASHA
They believed in nothing, now they
are nothing. But you and I will
change all that. We will give the
world something to believe in
again.
Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist
with a knife. Lestat stares at her dripping blood.
She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts
her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's
eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost
again. Akasha smiles.
AKASHA
Come, my King.
We have a score to
settle.
The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness.

The sun has long disappeared as the darkness settles.

Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters.
He takes her hand and together they float up over the
wall and out to the street. Lestat pulls Jesse into his
arms.
They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away,
gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...
And exchange happy, fanged smiles...
LESTAT
Shall we go get a drink, love?
She smiles, nods. Lestat and Jesse take each other's
hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets
at that STRANGE preternatural SPEED...
... and vanish into the night.
FADE OUT.
