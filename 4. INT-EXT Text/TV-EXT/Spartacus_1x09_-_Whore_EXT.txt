  Practice swords clash as the men train under the ever 
  watchful eye of DOCTORE. AGRON presses his younger brother 
  DURO, hammering him. Duro takes a crack across the angry 
  BRAND on his forearm. He GRUNTS in pain, dropping his sword.

                                        DURO
                        Fuck. Two weeks and the mark is 
                        still raw as a whore s cunt.

                                        AGRON
                        I bear the same, brother. Without 
                        pissing about it.

  Agron kicks the fallen sword over to him.

                                        DURO
                        That s because you have the hide of 
                        a goat. And almost as much sense.

  Duro attacks. Agron meets him, half taunting him with a 
  laugh shared only by siblings attempting to brain each 
  other. As they battle past CAMERA, ADJUST to find

  SPARTACUS AND VARRO

  sparring. Spartacus is a thing of physical perfection, his 
  two practice swords slicing the air with balletic 
    malevolence. Varro counters, brandishing sword and shield, 
  looking for an opening. He finds one and charges, but

  SPARTACUS EASILY DEFLECTS

  with one sword, SMACKING Varro across the midsection with 
  the other. Varro grunts, shaking it off. Spartacus circles 
  him.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You lower your guard after each 
                        assault.

                                        VARRO
                        I shall see it raised then...

  Varro rushes, raining blows at Spartacus. Spartacus 
  counters, each stroke sure and swift. Varro thrusts his 
  shield out to defend. Spartacus quickly rolls off it, using 
  his momentum to spin behind Varro and bring his sword up 
  around his throat. He growls in his ear.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                        Your head is mine. How shall I 
                        mount it?

  Varro chuckles in defeat as he pushes the sword away.

                                        VARRO
                        You move well today.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You do not. What distracts you?

  Varro s mood deflates.

                                        VARRO
                        I had Ashur send letter to Aurelia. 
                        More than a week past now, and no 
                        reply.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You expect different? A woman 
                        seldom rushes back to the husband 
                        who calls her whore.

                                        VARRO
                        I said no such thing.

                                  quickly)(
                        The letter was contrite. I admitted 
                        I reacted poorly to the news of her 
                        being with child.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now she makes you wait. The way 
                        women punish us for being fools.

  Spartacus gears up for another round.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Strike it from your mind. Or find 
                        your brains upon the sand...

  Spartacus attacks, hammering Varro. They battle like fucking 
  gods, WIPING US TO --



  SWORDS CLASH as the day s training begins. Spartacus and 
  Varro exchange blows. Varro pauses, catching sight of

  CRIXUS

  as he strides out into the square, looking like he owns the 
  fucking place. The other men pause to watch his triumphant 
  return.

                                        VARRO
                        The Undefeated Gaul returns.

  Spartacus gives Crixus a dismissive glance.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Perhaps it is time he chose a new 
                        name.

  ANGLE ON DOCTORE as he clasps arms with Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE
                      My spirit soars to see you again 
                        upon the sands.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  a vulpine grin)(
                        The underworld would not have me.

  Doctore turns to the men.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Take note, you worthless fucks! A 
                        true champion rejoins the 
                        Brotherhood!

  He tosses Spartacus a pointed look as half the men hustle 
  over to welcome Crixus back. Agron spits in disgust, 
  snorting to Duro.

                                        AGRON
                        Champion of ass and balls.

  ADJUST off Crixus and the men to

  THE BALCONY

  where Lucretia watches with an appreciative smile. Naevia 
  hovers nearby.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                        Has there ever been such a man as 
                        Crixus?

                                        NAEVIA
                        No, Domina. There has not.

  Her eyes fill with longing and regret, unnoticed by Lucretia 
  as Batiatus joins them from the triclinium.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Praise the gods for his return.

                        May they see him to many victories.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And our purse filled by such.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yes. Filled to bursting.

  Lucretia smiles, but as she turns back to Crixus it is clear 
  that her interest has nothing to do with monetary gain. 
  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus slides his arm into a practice shield and takes a 
  wooden sword offered by Doctore. He grips it with deep 
    satisfaction.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You will spar with Duro --

                                        CRIXUS
                        The German? He has yet to step in 
                        the arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                        And you have been long absent. 
                        Prove yourself with the man and see 
                        advancement.

                                        ASHUR (O.S.)
                        And who shall face Ashur?

  They turn to find Ashur striding up with a practice sword, 
  leg brace removed but a slight limp still in evidence.

                                        ASHUR
                        Choose carefully, for I long for 
                        blood.

  Doctore glances at Ashur s leg, locks eyes with a frown.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        I do.

                        The Dominus himself promised that I 
                        would rejoin the Brotherhood as 
                        soon as I was free of that fucking 
                        brace --

                        Ashur.

  Ashur glances up to the balcony. Batiatus motions him up to 
  the villa.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A word.

  Batiatus disappears back inside. Ashur s proud smile wilts. 
  Crixus laughs.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The master calls his dog to his 
                        lap.

  A knot of Gladiators laugh as Crixus moves to spar with 
  Duro.

                                to Ashur)(
                        Consider yourself fortunate. The 
                        lowest among us would have ended 
                        you.

  He takes the practice sword form Ashur, WIPING US TO --



  The Gladiators spar and work various training stations.  
  Crixus, intent on proving that he s in full form, viciously 
  presses Duro.  Duro gets cracked, stumbles back, fighting to 
  catch his breath.

                                        DURO
                        This isn t... the arena...

                        The world is my arena, pup.

  Crixus charges, his sword a blur.  Duro struggling to 
  deflect them, fails.  Crixus sends him crashing to the sand, 
  dazed and spitting blood.  Crixus laughs, turning to 
  Doctore.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

  WHAM!  Agron slams into Crixus, knocking him off his feet.  
  The two men struggle, throwing punches.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Stand down!  Agron!

  He grabs Agron by the hair, hurls him off Crixus.  Duro 
  rushes to help him.  Crixus leaps to his feet.  Doctore 
  restrains him with a palm to his chest.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Enough.

                        and I will see you both to the 
                        mines!

  Duro and Agron move off, glaring at Crixus as they pass 
  Spartacus and Varro drinking from the rain barrel.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus continues making friends.

  Varro nods absently, lost in thought as he drinks.

                        service of letters.

  Spartacus follows Varro s gaze, sees Ashur at the ludus gate 
  with Batiatus, preparing to leave.

                        Perhaps you would care for a real

  Spartacus considers him for a moment.

  Crixus  hand tightens round the handle of his sword.  But 
  before he can respond Hector the guard interrupts.

  ANGLE ON Batiatus and Ashur observing him from across the 
  market.  Batiatus  eyes burn with the cold flame of revenge.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are clear to your purpose?

                                        ASHUR
                                  morose)(
                        Yes, Dominus.

  Batiatus considers Ashur s obvious mood.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I know your desires were toward the 
                        arena.  Do not let such 
                        disappointments cloud the matter at 
                        hand.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                                  hands)
                        They are yours to command, Dominus.

                        Inform when the deed is done.

  Batiatus exits through the crowd, away from Solonius.  Ashur 
  watches him go, his loyal eyes filling with resentment as he 
  considers his options.

  ON SOLONIUS

  as he drops coins in the Merchant s hand with a show of 
  disgust.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Five sacks, for the price of ten.  
                        And see to it they are dry this 
                        time, shit whore.  The last ones 
                        stank of mold.

                      Do not churn, good Solonius.

  Solonius turns to find Ashur approaching.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        The thief will suffer when prices 
                        plummet with the next harvest.

                        I pray his cock follows the 
                        decline.
                                  looks for Batiatus)(
                        You are left off leash?

                      My master is for his villa.  I yet 
                        have business to attend.
                                  a whisper)(
                        And words, searching for receptive 
                        ears.

  Solonius gauges that, nods as he moves away from the 
  Merchant.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                        Batiatus proves himself unworthy, 
                      as you had divined.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Such base character seldom weighs 
                        the true worth of a man.

                                        ASHUR
                        I trust your scales are more in 
                        balance.  I hold valuable news.

                        offered when last we spoke.

                      It concerns your life.  If that is 
                      no cause to loosen your purse...

  Ashur starts to turn away.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Wait.

  Solonius withdraws his purse, slips Ashur a few coins.  
  Ashur stares at him.  Solonius sighs, hands him the entire 
  purse.

                        order given.  You have been warned.

  Ashur slips away into the crowd.  OFF Solonius, darkening...



  Spartacus annihilates RHASKOS in the morning s training. 
  Crixus glances over, dissecting the Champion s moves for 
  future reference as he again spars with Duro.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus grins to Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus breathes fire this 
                        morning.

  Mira appears, setting breakfast on a table.  Lucretia eyes 
  her with a knowing smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I wonder to the cause.  Mira.  How 
                        did your evening pass with our 
                        champion?

                        Many demands!

  Batiatus slaps Mira on the ass as she exits.

                      So our Thracian is ready to stud.

  Lucretia gazes down at Crixus training in the morning sun, 
  her emotions well concealed.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus fends off Duro, who is intent on making up for his 
  earlier defeat.  Crixus laughs, enjoying the challenge.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Finally, the pup bares his teeth.

  Agron glances over from his own sparring, grins at his 
  brother s performance.

  VARRO

  is hauled out into the square by Hector and another GUARD 
  and unceremoniously dumped to the sand.  Doctore frowns at 
  him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Perhaps next time thought will 
                        precede tongue.  Pair with 
                        Spartacus.

  Varro wearily complies.  Spartacus eyes his friend s ragged 
  condition.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        Not yet.  But I have dispatched 
                        Mira, one of the house slaves, to 
                        look for her.  And your son.

  The encouraging words rally Varro.

                        Mira was sent by Domina.  To

  As they clash swords, MOVE ACROSS THE MEN to Crixus, 
  expertly deflecting Duro s assault -- until his attention 
  flickers to NAEVIA

  in the pantry, talking with Hector.  He unlocks the gate 
  from the mess hall and joins her inside.  As he shuts the 
  gate behind him, she LAUGHS shyly, lightly touching his arm.

  CRIXUS FILLS WITH RAGE,

  Duro taking the unfortunate brunt of it.  Crixus attacks, 
  brutally dismantling the young gladiator.

  AGRON

    instinctively moves to protect his brother, but then stops 
  short.  He locks eyes with Spartacus, remembering his words 
  from earlier, thinks better of it.

  CRIXUS

  spins, landing a VICIOUS CRACK TO DURO S JAW, lifting him 
  off his feet, BLOOD SPRAYING.  He CRASHES TO THE HARD SAND. 
  Doctore nods, pleased with the move.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your form returns.  Pair with 
                        Hamilcar.

  Crixus, chest heaving, moves to comply.  His eyes fall to 
  the pantry as he goes, his heart dropping as he finds Naevia 
  and Hector now gone.

  DURO

  spits blood as he painfully rises, looking to his brother 
  for support.  Agron turns away, continues sparring.  Varro 
  catches the silent exchange.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

  Spartacus slams into Varro, SMASHING US TO --
