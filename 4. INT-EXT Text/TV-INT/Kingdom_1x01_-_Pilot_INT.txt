Alvey slams into the stall and DRY HEAVES over the toilet. 
Violent convulsions. It finally passes, he wipes tears, 
gathers himself. Fuck getting old.   



A sweaty, spartan Mixed Martial Arts gym buzzing with the 
slaps, thuds, chatter and grunts of FIGHTERS at work: They 
 roll  Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) on the large practice mat. 6.


Muay Thai Kickboxing with hand-mits and heavy bags. Explosive 
training with plyos and thick ropes. Others sit together on 
the mat, taping hands, stretching, bullshitting. 

The gym is a community. A refuge.  

In the center of it all, where the boxing ring should be, is 
a CAGE OCTAGON. 



Alvey, barefoot with shorts and a  Navy Street MMA  T-shirt, 
circles, dissects, critiques, affirms two of his fighters, 
NATE, 22, and JOSE, 25, as they  roll  through the fluid 
positional transitions of BJJ. Nate (on his back) pulls guard 
from the bottom.   

ALVEY
Very nice, Nate. Very nice. Stay 
active. Keep working. Triangle! 
Triangle!  

Nate tries to slings his leg up over. Jose blocks it. Nate 
tries again.  Blocked again. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Okay, it s not there. That s fine. 
We re not panicking. We know 
exactly what to do, yes? What s our 
transition?   

Nate pops Jose with a couple ineffectual jabs. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
You re not doing any damage from 
that position, Nate. So, what do we 
do? We transition into an Omoplata, 
right? Break the grip and sink your 
hips.

Nate squirms -- seems unsure. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Stop. Stop. Stop. 

Alvey takes Nate s position under Jose to demonstrate (Alvey 
will execute each motion as he describes it).  

ALVEY (CONT D)
(to Nate)
You re here. Break his grip. Sink 
your hips -- push out. Now you re 
in dominant position. 
(MORE)7.

ALVEY (CONT D)
If you can t get the triangle, pass 
the left leg and sit up into an 
Omoplata.  

In a single fluid movement, Alvey transitions from under the 
teammate who is now face-down on the mat with his right arm 
cranked up by Alvey s leg. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Now he s got two choices: tap or 
snap.  

Jose taps on the mat and Alvey releases him.   

ALVEY (CONT D)
Let s see it. On your feet. 

Nate and Jose stand and square. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
(to Jose)
Take him down. 

Jose shoots and Nate pulls him on top into his guard (Nate on 
his back, Jose on top just like before). They jockey for 
position then Nate explodes into a perfectly vicious 
Omoplata.  Jose taps vigorously. Alvey rushes in and pulls 
them apart.  Grabs Nate by the headgear. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Very nice! Excellent work. Make 
sure you control his left arm so he 
can t strike on your roll. 

Off Nate as he listens attentively...



The SOUND of piss on plastic...

RYAN REVIS, 29, clean-cut, all-American handsome.  He pisses 
in a LABELED CUP. Carefully screws the top on. Washes his 
hands. Lingers for a moment over the RAZED SCARS on his 
wrists -- a constant reminder.   

MAN (PRE-LAP)
Number one: You will not own, use 
or have in your possession a 
firearm or any other object 
considered a weapon by the State of 
California. 8.


DAY

Ryan sits by the desk of his parole officer, MARK DANTZLER 
(48), who notes Ryan s FILE. CUP of piss cooling.   

DANTZLER
Is that understood?

RYAN
Yes sir. 

DANTZLER
Number two: As a condition of your 
parole you will be completing an in-
patient drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program at Ocean 
Hills Recovery in Huntington Beach. 

RYAN
Yes sir. 

DANTZLER
So, if I come down there you re 
gonna be where you re supposed to 
be? 

RYAN
Yes sir. 

DANTZLER
What about work? 

RYAN
Nothing yet. But I m looking. 

DANTZLER
Get a job. Fill your days out 
right. Can t stress that enough. If 
at any point your employment 
changes, you have 72 hours to 
notify me.   

Ryan nods. 

DANTZLER (CONT D)
Got a wife? 

The question stabs Ryan. Dantzler s seen it a million times.

DANTZLER (CONT D)
Guess five years is a long time to 
wait.    9.


RYAN
We weren t married.

Dantzler flips through the file.

DANTZLER
Goodness gracious, what a mess 
you ve made.  

Ryan s stoic. 

DANTZLER (CONT D)
You got any kind of support system 
out here? 

RYAN
There s some people I still know. 

DANTZLER
Family? 

RYAN
No sir, just some old friends.  

DANTZLER
Get some new ones. Find a church. 
Fellowship. Accept Jesus Christ as 
your personal savior and get your 
shit together because if you fuck 
up, you drink a beer, you don t 
show up for work, any kind of 
hiccup, I ll lock your ass right 
back up. We clear?   

RYAN
Yes sir. 

Dantzler doubts it. He shuts the file, grabs the piss cup.  

DANTZLER
Alright then, Mr. Revis. I ll be 
randomly collecting your urine once 
a month. Keep it clean, we won t 
have a problem.  Let s take a 
couple pictures, we ll see you next 
month. 

CUT TO:


DAY

FLASH!10.


Ryan, shirtless, stands against the wall -- athletic, raw-
bone strength, expensive ink --  DESTROYER  inked large 
across his abdomen. Dantzler snaps digital photos. 

DANTZLER
(re: tattoos)
Godalmighty, you look like an Iron 
Maiden poster. Used to love them. 
(then)
Turn for me. 

Ryan does and we FLASH to a SERIES OF STILL SHOTS of Ryan s 
abraded body, front, back, profile, face, one last FLASH -- 

CUT TO:



Nate flops on the mat, spent, starts unwrapping his hands. 
Alvey beside him.  

ALVEY
It s very simple, Nate. You ve had 
a great camp, you re healthy, 
cardio s there, you re exactly 
where you need to be. Now it s 
about trusting the process. Stick 
with the game plan, do what you do 
and beat the balls off this kid. He 
can t stay with you. You re too 
explosive. Yes? 

Nate nods. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Okay. How s your weight? 

NATE
Heavy. 

ALVEY
Start cutting. You re two days out. 
Get after it. Let s go.  

A sudden energy surges through the gym. Alvey and Nate look 
over as...

Ryan Revis enters to a hero s welcome. Fighters flock to him. 
Moths to a flame.  

Alvey approaches and the celebration stops. Tense silence -- 
a lot of history between them. Alvey s the alpha. A beat. 11.


ALVEY (CONT D)
(to the fighters)
You guys start training or get the 
fuck out of my gym. 

The fighters scatter leaving Ryan and Alvey alone.  

RYAN
You haven t changed. 

ALVEY
Why should I? 

Ryan wisely doesn t answer.  

ALVEY (CONT D)
When d you get out? 

RYAN
Yesterday. They got me at a rehab 
place in Huntington.  

ALVEY
You fuck it up yet? 

RYAN
(humble)
That s all behind me, Alvey. It s 
different now. I m not here to 
cause problems. 

ALVEY
Then why are you here?

RYAN
So I don t put a bag on my head and 
play hopscotch across the 405. 

Alvey sizes him up. Warms up.     

ALVEY
I guess that s a pretty damn good 
reason. Welcome back. 

Alvey flashes his big smile. Bear hugs him. 


ALVEY (CONT D)
Come on in, tell me where your 
head s at.  

Nate watches. Unsure what to make of Ryan s return.     12.



Alvey s cramped cluttered office. The decor is Ode to Alvey: 
BLACK BELTS he s earned in BJJ, MUAY THAI BOXING, KEMPO 
KARATE mounted on the walls next to old framed fight PHOTOS. 
The glory days.

Alvey kicks his feet up on his cluttered desk. Ryan across.  

RYAN
Was that Nate in the cage?

ALVEY
Oh yeah, we re wrapping up camp. 
He s on the Long Beach card. 

Alvey passes him the FLIER for the LONG BEACH FIGHT NIGHT. 

RYAN
Long Beach. That s big time. 

ALVEY
UFC s sniffing around. 

RYAN
Yeah?

ALVEY
If he beats Walker and looks good 
doing it, he s in the conversation 
at one-fifty-five. 

RYAN
I knew he d be a killer.  

ALVEY
Kid s tough as a coffin nail. Game 
too.  

RYAN
Like his old man. 

ALVEY
Except I never got paid. 
(then)
He s the real deal. And I m not 
just saying that because I m his 
dad. I ve never had an athlete in 
my camp with his kind of ability.  

Alvey catches Ryan s eyes on a PICTURE on the desk: Alvey and 
Lisa in Cabo -- wet, sunny, sandy, in love.   13.


ALVEY (CONT D)
At least, not since you were here. 

They let it lie for now. Ryan gestures to another PICTURE: a 
post-fight photo. A bloody, but smiling Alvey with his two 
sons, Nate (6) and Jay (9) from sixteen years ago. 

RYAN
(moving on)
How s Jay doing anyway?

ALVEY
Jay? Don t even ask. 
(pointing to an empty spot 
on his desk)
He stole my computer, if that tells 
you anything. 

RYAN
Is he fighting? 

ALVEY
Not in two years.

RYAN
I heard he was tearing it up. What 
happened? 

ALVEY
He keeps pulling out of fights. 
Three in a row. Making me look like 
an asshole.  

RYAN
Is he getting fucked up or what?

ALVEY
He s getting fucked up. He s 
fucking shit up. He s a fuck-up.
Kid can t make it through a camp 
without stepping on his own dick. 
I had to eighty-six his ass from 
the gym. I m not gonna let him 
poison Nate s camp. Not with a 
fight like this coming up.   

RYAN
Maybe I could talk to him.  

ALVEY
Can t reason with a drunk or a 
crazy person. But let s talk about 
you. What s up? You look good. You 
in shape? You want to fight? 14.


RYAN
I m not even thinking about that. 

ALVEY
You re still young. Five years off 
saved you a lot of wear and tear.   

RYAN
It s more about what can I 
handle... emotionally. 

ALVEY
Gotcha.

RYAN
Kinda have to ease back into 
things.

ALVEY
Say no more. I get it. 

RYAN
But I was thinking maybe I could 
help out around here. Coach the 
guys up. Whatever you need. 

Alvey considers it. Big risk, big reward. 

ALVEY
I ll be honest with you, Ryan, I m 
sucking wind though my asshole 
right now.

RYAN
I m not asking for money. I d do it 
for free. Fit in wherever I can.  

ALVEY
You are the best goddamn wrestler 
I ve ever seen. Might be good for 
Nate. 

RYAN
Give me two days, I ll tune him up. 

Alvey leans back in his chair, considers it for a beat.  

ALVEY
Let s do it. You can finish up 
Nate s camp with me, we ll take it 
from there. 

RYAN
Yeah?15.


ALVEY
It ll be fun.

They shake hands. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
I m glad you re well. Hey, I wanna 
show you something. 

As Alvey heads for a closet, we go to...



Nate, dressed in full sweats, on the stationary bike. Lisa 
walks up.  

LISA
Where s your dad? 

NATE
Office. 

LISA
Doing what? He doesn t even have a 
computer. 

NATE
He s with Revis. 

LISA
(stunned)
Ryan s here? 

Nate nods. Lisa s pissed. Storms the office. 



Alvey s pulled out several FRAMED POSTERS of RYAN: Magazine 
one-sheets of Ryan at the height of his fame -- FIGHT! 
Magazine, WORLDWIDE MMA, TAPOUT -- all with exalting 
HEADLINES:  This Will Hurt   Ryan Revis. Can Anyone Beat 
Him?   Relentless.   

ALVEY
I was supposed to toss these, but I 
thought you might want m. 

Ryan holds up one of the posters. Lifted by past glory. 

Then Lisa SLAMS in. 16.


LISA
(to Ryan)
What the fuck are you doing here? 

ALVEY
Lisa -- 

LISA
Shut up, Alvey. 
(to Ryan)
Why are you here? What could you 
possibly be doing in this gym?  

RYAN
I just came by to see everyone.

LISA
I m sorry, is this your triumphant 
return? Because we ve all been 
waiting for Ryan and the big 
fucking rapture.

ALVEY
Lisa, relax --

LISA
No, you fucking relax.  

Alvey backs off. She s too hot. 

RYAN
I guess I should ve called.

LISA
You should ve called? You think I m 
pissed because you didn t call 
ahead? Are you fucking psychotic? 

Alvey winks at Ryan -- don t worry about it, she ll calm 
down. 

LISA (CONT D)
I fucking saw that, Alvey. 
(to Ryan)
Goodbye. 

RYAN
Okay. 

Ryan s civil. Politely leaves. Lisa slams the door. 

LISA
I can t believe you. 17.


ALVEY
Me? How am I in trouble? 

Off Alvey in the crosshairs --



Ryan heads for the door. Sees Nate packing up his DUFFEL.  

RYAN
Big Nate. 

Nate greets him with a half-hug. Always been awed by Ryan.  

NATE
What s up, Ryan? 

RYAN
(sizes him up)
Shit, man, you re a big-ass one-
fifty-five.  

NATE
One-seventy-one right now. 

RYAN
And you re fighting in two days? 
(off Nate)
Gonna be nasty cut. Can you do it?  

NATE
Better. Else my dad s gonna kill 
me.

RYAN
You ll be alright. I cut twenty 
pounds every time I fight.  

Nate s clearly concerned. 

RYAN (CONT D)
Your dad said you ve had a great 
camp. You feel ready?  

NATE
Yeah, yeah, for sure.  

RYAN
You re staying away from the girls, 
right? No pussy during camp. Pussy 
steals your Chi.   18.


Nate smiles, painfully shy. Ryan hears Lisa s muffled RANTS 
from the office. Better leave. 

RYAN (CONT D)
You heading out?  

Nate grabs his bag and follows Ryan...



Nate steps through the party; GUYS and GIRLS (19 up to late 
20 s) get fucked up, weed, booze, video games, music, flop-
house, crash pad.  What up, Nate!  He knows them all and nods 
his hellos as he heads down the...

HALLWAY

... to a closed BEDROOM DOOR. He opens -- 



JAY HENDERSON, 26, wire skinny, sleeved tattoos, sweaty 
banshee fucking a GIRL from behind. 

JAY
(still fucking)
Not now!

Nate looks away. Annoyed, but calm. Jay looks up. 

JAY (CONT D)
(still fucking)
Shut the fucking door, man! 

NATE
You re in my room, Jay. 

Jay stops fucking. Scans the room. Sure enough...

JAY
Shit... 

The girl looks up at Nate. 

GIRL
(sheepish smile)
Hi, Nate. 

Nate nods. 

JAY
My bad, dude. Gimme a minute? 

He s fucking again, before Jay s out the door.21.



Nate BLENDS a protein SHAKE. Several CONTAINERS of 
supplements on the counter; Whey Protein, Jacked, branch-
chain amino acids. Nate pours his shake and sits at the 
kitchen table across from CASEY, 22, pretty, blissfully 
stoned, half-cashed bulb-pipe of heroin beside her. She 
watches through slits...

CASEY
What are you drinking?  

NATE
A shake. 

CASEY
Like a vitamin shake or something? 

Nate shrugs. 

CASEY (CONT D)
You re so good.  

 Casey leans into him, syrupy... 

CASEY (CONT D)
How come you never talk? 

NATE
I do.

CASEY
No, you don t. You don t talk to 
anyone. You just work out and drink 
smoothies and eat fucking celery 
and don t talk.   

She slinks off her chair onto her knees, crawls between his 
legs.   

CASEY (CONT D)
Some of the girls... they think you 
might be a fag. 

NATE
Who thinks that?

CASEY
Just some stupid girls. But I don t 
think that. I think you re probably 
just shy.  

She starts for his pants, but Jay enters, still sweaty in 
just a towel.22.


JAY
Party s over. Everybody get the 
fuck out! 

He knocks on the kitchen window leading to the backyard. 

JAY (CONT D)
Out! Let s go, let s go, let s go!

He pulls Casey to her feet, hands her the heroin pipe. 

CASEY
The fuck, Jay?

JAY
 ndale! Let s go. 

Nate suddenly storms out. Jay turns to Casey.

JAY (CONT D)
Fuck did you say to him? 

CASEY
Nothing. You re brother s a freak.  

JAY
Yeah and what the fuck are you? Off 
you go!  

Jay kicks her in the ass, nearly losing his towel.  



A small but stylish Manhattan Beach cottage.

Lisa pours a glass of wine, still fuming. Alvey follows her 
around the kitchen pleading his case.  

ALVEY
The kid deserves a second chance. 

LISA
Ryan s had plenty of chances. 

ALVEY
Why is this bothering you so much? 

LISA
Because it s not bothering you. 

Lisa lights her cigarette and takes her wine outside.23.



A rundown old boarding house. No air conditioning.

A COUNSELOR (female, 40 s, battle-ax) presides over seventeen 
miserable recovering ADDICTS -- all shapes and sizes -- 
sitting in a circle sweating through their clothes and 
reading a HANDOUT. 

Lots of bouncing legs, fidgeting, explosive pent-up male 
detox aggression.  

Ryan quietly follows along as another patient JAVY (24, 
Latino, small) reads aloud.   

JAVY
Those patterns include: isolating 
oneself from others, refusing to 
talk about one s own thoughts and 
feelings, doubting one s ability to 
stay obstinate. 

MICHAEL
Abstinent, you dumb motherfucker. 

Scattered laughter. Ryan locks eyes with the heckler, MICHAEL 
(31, brute, inked). Holds it for a beat then breaks. 

COUNSELOR
You re reading next, Michael. I 
wouldn t get too cocky. 
(MORE)26.

COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
(to reader)
Keep going, Javy. 

JAVY
Becoming overwhelmed by ordinary 
problems. Avoiding people who give 
honest feedback and the last one is 
outbursts of anger. 

Javy looks up from the handout.  

COUNSELOR
Okay, let s take a break. 

They scatter. 

COUNSELOR (CONT D)
Fifteen minutes, guys. 

Ryan files outside with the others...



CLOSE ON CARLOS behind the wheel, eyes rolled back in his 
battered scuffed up head, getting a loud sloppy blowjob from 
MURIEL (20 s). He s got a hand full of her hair. 

CARLOS
Take the head, baby. Work that 
fucking hog... there you go... 

He pushes her down. She struggles. 

CARLOS (CONT D)
Choke it down, baby. That s it... 
yeah... shit yeah... ah shit.  

He cums and convulses. Accidentally hits the windshield 
wipers on. As they move back and forth, we notice a FLIER 
stuck beneath the blades. 

Muriel sits up. Unhappy with the treatment. 

MURIEL
That s too rough, Carlos, damn. 

But Carlos s eyes ping-pong with the flier.

He reaches out the window and grabs the flier. 

FLIER: Navy Street MMA. Alvey s smiling face beams back at 
him. 

CARLOS
Motherfucker. 

MURIEL
You can t treat me like that --31.


CARLOS
Shut the fuck up!

Carlos rolls down his window and calls out to -- 

CARLOS (CONT D)
Hector! 
(showing the flier)
Look who I found. 

Off Alvey s smiling face --



BAD BRAINS cranks from a DOCKED IPOD. Nate and Jay spar hard, 
trading real punches, snapping kicks, in their element as 
brothers. They love it. 

Jay dances, picks his younger brother apart. Smiles. Taunts. 
They don t notice...

Alvey, Lisa, and Ryan watching.  

Nate s the athlete, throws Jay around. But Jay s got a 
fighter s mind, slippery, always calm, sees it all in slow 
motion.  Nate shoots, Jay stuffs it. Dances. Nate pursues 
with a big overhand right, Jay snakes back, counters with a 
right hook, crazy angle, it drops Nate to a knee.     

ALVEY
Hey!

Alvey kills the music. Pissed. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Are you out of your fucking mind? 

Jay and Nate exchange a look -- they re in trouble. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
What the fuck are you doing!?  

JAY
(shrugs)
Training -- 

ALVEY
Get the fuck out of my cage!  

Nate s troubled by the vitriol. Jay senses it.

JAY
(sotto to Nate)
Chin down when you throw that 
overhand. 

Jay touches gloves with his little brother and exits the 
cage. Alvey grabs him by the arm as he passes. 

ALVEY
Your brother s got a fight coming 
up -- you could ve cut him. 34.


JAY
But I didn t, so chill the fuck 
out. 

Jay, manic, upbeat, greets Ryan with a hug. 

JAY (CONT D)
(to Ryan)
Rev, welcome back. Hey, have a 
great workout but watch out.
(sotto for Alvey to hear)
Alvey s getting nasty in his old 
age. Once the mind goes...   

ALVEY
Jay, I swear to God. 

Jay smiles and blows out. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
(to Ryan and Lisa)
You two get out of here. Nobody s 
fucking training today. 

Lisa and Ryan exit. Alvey heads to the cage. 



Nate in a deep athlete s sleep. Until...

Casey, topless, thong, bursts through the door. Full panic. 

CASEY
Nate! 

NATE
(bolting up)
What the fuck? 

Casey tries to drag him out of bed. 

CASEY
Your brother -- he s fucking crazy. 

NATE
(not news)
Go away, Casey. 

Nate rolls over. 

CASEY
Please!37.


GUNSHOTS POP from outside. Nate pushes Casey out of the way 
and we follow down the hall, out the back --



Alvey and Lisa stand by as Ryan helps Nate, already in a 
hooded sweatshirt, into a SAUNA-SUIT (essentially looks like 
a suit made of shiny garbage bags). Weight cuts are a brutal, 
sadistic and necessary ritual. Ryan tapes the suit, sealing 
Nate in. Alvey hands him a JUMP ROPE, hits play on the IPOD. 

As MUSIC RISES. Nate jumps, faster, faster, faster -- 

INTERCUT WITH:



Jay, on the couch hunched over the COFFEE TABLE, crushing 
OXYCONTIN PILLS into powder. The GUN, a SYRINGE, a SPOON, a 
LIGHTER and a loose PHOTOGRAPH spread before him. 



Ryan and Nate (still in the sauna suit) grapple under Alvey s 
direction. Sweat pours off Nate. Lisa watches the intense 
focused energy. 



Jay preps his fix with the same focus. Bends the spoon. Dumps 
the powder. Cooks the dope. 



Nate stares at a torture chamber...  

The SAUNA. A SPINNING BIKE placed inside. Alvey waves him in. 
Nate death-walks inside. Ryan seals the door shut. Nate 
peddles slow, then explodes to maximum intensity.  



Jay sucks the brackish fun into the syringe. Flicks out the 
bubbles. Ties off his arm. Takes a breath before the rush.



Nate peddles, sheets of sweat, eyes blank, mind gone.  39.



Jay touches the needle to vein. Then the pierce. Then the 
plunge. His eyes turtle. Body melts.  



Nate peddles past his limit, somewhere dangerous. Eyes roll.  



CLOSE ON the old creased PHOTO: Jay with his MOTHER after his 
first MMA fight.  

Jay s eclipsed eyes lost in memory. He tosses the photo. 

Picks up the gun. Feels the weight. Sits up. Puts it in his 
mouth. Curls his finger around the trigger and -- 



BOOM! Nate stumbles out of the sauna, severely overheated, 
heaving, clawing at the sauna suit. Alvey and Ryan strip Nate 
out of the suit. Sit him against the locker.  

NATE
I m alright...

ALVEY
(to Lisa)
Get him some water.

NATE
No water. Let s just go. 

Off Nate getting to his feet -- 

CUT TO:



KORN blasts over the PA.

A small stage with a SCALE in the center against a backdrop 
of SPONSOR LOGOS. 

An MC on stage whips up the CROWD flanked by four BIKINI-CLAD 
RING GIRLS. PRESS, other FIGHTERS, FANS in the audience. 40.


MC
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 
Long Beach! We ve got a hell of a 
card tomorrow night! Starting at 
155 in the lightweight division 
it s gonna be Clay Walker versus 
Nate Henderson!  

The crowd erupts. 

MC (CONT D)
First up on the scale, Clay Walker! 

KORN back up as...

CLAY WALKER (33) steps on stage. A granite head, pit bull of 
a man. Battle-tested. His ENTOURAGE in tow. Peels off his 
shirt. Shredded. Steps on the scale. An OFFICIAL from the 
California State Athletic Commission slides it. 

OFFICIAL
154.5.

Clay, howls, flexes, licks his fists then steps to the back 
of the stage. 

MC
Next up. Jay Henderson! 

KORN again.

Nate, Alvey and Ryan step on stage. Ryan gets a reaction from 
the crowd. He s well-known. 

Nate strips down. He s a rung out wisp. Sharp contrast to 
Walker. Alvey holds up a modesty TOWEL as Nate disrobes and 
steps on the scale.

CLOSE ON THE SCALE as the official calibrates. Every 
millimeter, a mile. He taps the scale to the brink of 155. 
The scale finally finds a perilous balance... 

OFFICIAL
155.  

CHEERS erupts. He made weight. 

Nate steps off the scale and squares-up with Walker for pre-
fight photos. FLASHES everywhere. Walker snarls in Nate s 
face. Nate has shark eyes. It s combustible. Goes on forever. 
Then Walker lunges. But Nate doesn t flinch.  41.


MC
Alright, give it up for Clay Walker 
and Jay Henderson. 

The crowd is pumped. Walker plays it up. Nate simply walks 
off the stage.



But as Nate steps into the wings he collapses, landing hard 
on the floor. Alvey, Ryan and Lisa rush to his aid. 

ALVEY
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I gotcha --

Alvey tries to lay him down. 

NATE
Get the fuck off me! I m fine! 
Fuck! For two fucking seconds, 
leave me the fuck alone. 
(beat, emotional)
Please. Fuck, man...

As Nate tries to catch his breath. Walker watches from the 
stage. Saw his weakened opponent. Blood in the water. 



Lisa sets a big plate of PASTA in front of Nate. Alvey sits 
across the small kitchen table. 

NATE
Thanks, Lisa. 

LISA
Eat up. 

Lisa and Alvey exchange a look. 

LISA (CONT D)
I m gonna jump in the shower. 

She leaves them alone. Nate eats. Alvey s not good at this.   

ALVEY
It s actually not a bad thing 
Walker saw that. He thinks you cut 
too much, he ll underestimate you. 

NATE
Can we stop talking about it?  42.


Alvey studies him. Nate tries another bite. Can t eat.  

ALVEY
What s a matter -- you nervous? 

NATE
What if I lose? 

ALVEY
You re not gonna lose. You re gonna 
smash this guy. 

NATE
But what if I don t? What if he 
catches me or I m gassed? Anything 
can happen. Then what?   

ALVEY
Then you start over, fight your way 
back up, and hope for another shot.
(beat)
Everybody loses, Nate. That s just 
part of what we do.   

Nate s emotionally drained, raw, his fight lost with the 
weight cut. Head down, barely there.  

Alvey reaches out to comfort him, but Nate explodes, swiping 
the plate of pasta to the floor. Nate jumps to his feet. A 
beat. He starts to clean it up, erase his outburst. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
(re: the plate)
Leave it. 

Nate looks at his father, tears in his eyes.  

NATE
You should let Jay train again. 

ALVEY
That s what this is about? 

NATE
It s better when he s there. It s 
better for him and it s better for 
me.

ALVEY
Forget about Jay. He made his 
choice. 

NATE
Can t you just talk to him? 43.


ALVEY
You can t be thinking about this 
right now. You gotta fight.   

NATE
He s your son and you can t even 
talk to him? You re a fucking 
asshole, man.  

ALVEY
Hey! 

Alvey pops a nerve. Grabs Nate by the throat and slams him 
against the wall. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
You don t talk to me like that. 
You re a fucking child.   

It s a scary thing when Alvey snaps. He sees the fear in 
Nate s eyes. Guilt and remorse flood him. He lets go.   

Silence... Nate walks out. Alvey s at a loss. He takes the 
plate to the sink, scrapes the pasta down the disposal, then 
leans against the sink. Feels like hell. Hates himself.   



CLOSE ON JAY, face down on the floor -- the GUN on the floor 
beside him. A flip-flopped FOOT comes into view. Nudges Jay 
in the face. Jay stirs, looks up, bleary.   

JAY
Revis. What s up, man?  

Reveal Ryan standing over him. Jay sits up, confused. 

JAY (CONT D)
How d you get in here? 

RYAN
Your front door s wide open. 

Jay surveys the room. Addict filth. 

JAY
What time is it? 

RYAN
6:30. Grab your board.44.


Off Jay s yawns -- 

CUT TO:



Dead silence. Alvey tapes Nate s hands. Lisa bites nails. 
Other fighters in Navy Street T-shirts pace around. Lots of 
support with one glaring omission -- Jay. Everyone feels it. 
Especially Nate.  

Alvey straps on Nate s gloves. Tapes the wrists. Pats Nate s 
hands. 

ALVEY
Let s get lathered up. 

The fighters try to pump him up. 

Then, as Alvey picks up the HAND-PADS, Jay finally enters. 
The room stops. This could explode. Nobody says a word. Then 
Alvey hands Jay the hand-pads.  

JAY
Come on, man. Get hot.  

PUNCH, PUNCH, KICK. Nate works the pads. Crisp. Sharp. Lot s 
of POP. Where he needs to be when he needs to be there. 

CUT TO:



THREE THOUSAND FANS ready for blood. 

HOLDING AREA

Jay in a Navy Street HAT and T-SHIRT, bounces with 
adrenaline. Jay and Alvey behind him. Everyone s waiting.

The LIGHTS SHUT OFF. Then the opening riff for GUNS AND 
ROSES   WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE  pulses in. LOUD AS FUCK.   48.


Jay starts jumping up and down. Like he s the one fighting. 
The MUSIC CRASHES IN and they walk down the aisle toward the 
cage. Crowd s jacked. Reaching out to touch Nate. Jay s 
whipping it up. Alvey rubs Nate s shoulders. Keeps him loose. 
Nate s got his shark eyes. They arrive... 

CAGE-SIDE.

Nate pulls off his shirt. CUT-MAN Vaselines his face. REFEREE 
checks his gloves, body, mouthpiece. Nate taps his CUP. All 
good. 

Alvey puts his arms around his two sons. Pulls them in close. 

ALVEY
Hey, listen up. We ve been through 
a lot of shit together, and we ll 
go through worse. But whatever 
happens... 
(chokes up)
We re a fucking family and that 
can t change. You boys are my 
fucking life and I love you. 

Jay and Nate keep their heads down. Alvey s their father. 

ALVEY (CONT D)
Now go in there and cave his 
fucking face in. 

JAY
Come on, Nate! Here we go! 

Jay slaps the shit out of Nate a few times. Nate enters... 

THE CAGE

Nate sprints the cage. Gets a feel. Clay Walker s in his 
corner. Snarls. Eye-fucks. 

Jay nudges Alvey. Points out UFC CEO DANA WHITE sitting cage-
side in a $5,000 suit. Alvey looks to Lisa in the crowd -- 
big time shit.  

TIME CUT

Jay and Walker stand center-octagon, face to face. The 
crowd s electric. Referee gives instructions. 

REFEREE
Let s have a good clean fight. 
Protect yourself at all times and 
obey my command. Touch gloves. 49.


They do, then bounce back to respective corners. Alvey and 
Nate hanging over the cage. 

ALVEY
Be first, Nate. It s your cage. 

Ref steps in the center. 

REFEREE
(to Walker)
You ready to fight? 
(to Nate)
You ready? Let s fight! 

Walker BLITZES with lightning fast, heavy punches. Nate 
scrambles. Walker runs him down. Wants to end this fast. 
Looks like he might. Nate s overwhelmed. Gets caught on the 
chin and hits the mat.  

The crowd EXPLODES. Alvey and Jay -- oh fuck. 

Walker pounces on Nate. Mounts him, dropping hammers. Nate 
tries to weather it. Grab a leg. Anything. Walker s killing 
him. Nate covers up. The Ref s on it. 

REFEREE (CONT D)
Defend yourself, Nate. You gotta 
fight back or I m calling it. 

Lisa can t watch. Dana White s smiling. Alvey and Jay are 
dying. This thing s over before it started. 

Ref s about to call it. But Nate digs out. Shimmies up the 
cage and gets to his feet.  

The crowd loves it. 

Nate s face is a mess. Big cut. Lot of blood. Walker s 
blasting him with leg kicks. Chopping wood. Nasty welts 
rising on Nate s thighs. Walker shoots, takes him down. Nate 
pulls guard. Tries to survive. Gives up his back. Walker 
sinks a choke. It s tight. Nate s got no air...  

But the HORN sounds. End round one. Got lucky.  

NATE S CORNER

Nate on the stool. Cut-man tends to him. Alvey and Jay 
corner. 

ALVEY
Take some deep breaths. How you 
feeling?50.


NATE
(exhausted)
Fine.

JAY
Fucking fight, dude. What are you 
doing? Let your fucking hands go! 

Nate nods. He knows. Jay gives him water.  

ALVEY
That was his round. But you 
weathered the storm. Now settle 
into your fight. Get him on the 
ground and beat him up.   

REFEREE
Let s go, Nate!

Jay puts his mouthpiece in for him. 

ROUND 2: Walker attacks. Bullies Nate against the cage. But 
Nate s fighting now. Puts him in a Thai clinch, spins him 
around, unleashes vicious knees to the mid-section. Walker 
grimaces, covers up. Nate wraps his legs, scoops him up and 
SLAMS him down on the mat.  

Crowd loves it. Alvey and Jay cheer. 

JAY
Smash him, Nate! 

But Walker recovers. Pushes Nate off. Staggers Nate with a 
SPINNING BACK KICK. Nate with a combination. Both fighters 
let their hands fly. Again, Nate gets caught with an 
uppercut. Drops to his knees. Walker s on him. Nate pulls 
guard. Works his BJJ beautifully. Walker s aggressive. Nate 
looks like he s taking a beating but he baits Walker into a 
TRIANGLE. Sinks it tight.   

Alvey and Jay erupt with the crowd. 

JAY (CONT D)
He s got it. That s deep. Sink it! 
Sink it! Finish him, Nate! Come on! 

Walker s beet red. But too sweaty to hold. He pops his head 
out and gets to his feet. Nate s best chance missed. 

Jay and Alvey deflate. 

JAY (CONT D)
Fuck me! Fuck. 51.


Both fighters dance a little. The HORN sounds. 

NATE S CORNER

Alvey and Jay tending to Nate, dead on the stool.

ALVEY
(very calm)
I don t know who won that round, 
but we re not gonna leave it to the 
judges. Yes? 

NATE
Yeah. 

Nate looks across at Walker jumping up and down in his 
corner. Fresh as a daisy. Jay pulls him close. 

JAY
Hey. You broke him. All that 
jumping and shit. It s fake juice. 
You broke him in the clinch. He 
felt your power and puckered up.  

Nate nods. He felt it too. 

JAY (CONT D)
Go take this shit. 

Lisa and Alvey trade a look. This is it.

CUT TO:

ROUND THREE 

They circle. Trade punches. Then Walker goes for broke with a 
flying knee. Misses Nate by a hair. Nate manhandles him. 
Bullies him into the cage. They lean on each other, 
exhausted. Walker pops a few body shots. Nate answers with 
some dirty boxing... Then it opens up. Both fighters SURGE 
and start throwing bombs. Both blasting. Both connecting.   

The crowd s hot. This is the moment...

They keep trading. Walker breaks. Drops to his knees, back 
against the cage. Nate steps back and CRUSHES HIM WITH A KNEE 
TO THE SOLAR PLEXUS...  OOOOOOHH!  from the crowd. Walker 
falls to the mat. Nate pounces on him, three big punches to 
the head. Walker s out. The ref dives between them.  

Nate jumps to his feet. Arms up. Exalted. He flies. Perches 
on top of the cage, arms out to the crowd. A crying, bloody, 
thrilling mess. 52.


Alvey and Jay go wild. Embrace, then jump into the cage. Nate 
hops down into their arms. Sobs. Lisa s there too. Everyone s 
immersed in... 

Raw, primal, love and joy. An absolute celebration.   

CUT TO:



Cramped, muggy, dorm style room. Two twin beds and a shared 
dresser. Lights still on. 

Ryan lies on the bed reading THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS. His 
ROOMMATE snores in the other bed. KNOCK KNOCK. Roddy, the 
guard, appears in the doorway.

RODDY
Lights out. 

Ryan puts the book down as Roddy kills the light. Ryan lies 
there for a beat, sweating and restless. Then pulls a CELL 
PHONE from under his pillow. Contraband. He shields the glow. 
He lingers on the screen, conflicted. 

Then starts texting.



A CELLPHONE BUZZES a text alert on the nightstand. It s 
Lisa s. She checks it.  

PHONE:  Hey. -RR   

ALVEY (O.S.)
Who s that? 

Lisa startles. Alvey exits the bathroom. 

LISA
My sister. 

ALVEY
Did you tell her about Nate? 

LISA
I just did. She s thrilled. 

ALVEY
What a fucking night. 

She turns off the phone.53.


LISA
It better not be over. 

ALVEY
Yeah? You wanna roll with the big 
dawg?  

LISA
I want you to shut your mouth and 
pound the fuck out of me.  

ALVEY
You re a filthy girl. 

LISA
Then I need to be punished. 

ALVEY
I love you. 

Alvey leaps across the room, scopes her up, pins her against 
the wall. He rips down her underwear and as they kiss and 
claw and fuck we -- 

CUT TO:



Jay hoists Alvey s COMPUTER on the counter. The CLERK counts 
out the CASH. Maybe $150. Good enough. Jay takes the cash and 
leaves. 

CUT TO:



Jay creeps down a sleazy Los Angeles street. Red Light 
District without all the light. 

He finds what he s looking for. Pulls up to a couple HOOKERS 
(40 s). He rolls down the window as one of the women, 
CHRISTINA, approaches, scans the street for cops.  

CHRISTINA
(not looking at him, 
scanning)
You want company? 

Jay can t answer. 54.


CHRISTINA (CONT D)
Yes or no? You re gonna get me in 
trouble.  

Jay looks up at her. 

JAY
Mom. It s me. 

She finally looks at his face. Her big troubled eyes light 
up. 

CHRISTINA
Jay!  Hey, baby! 

JAY
Get in. 

She looks away. Steps backs a little. He knew she wouldn t 
come. Still kills him. 

CHRISTINA
(smiling)
It s good to see you, baby. 

Jay hands her the cash from pawning the computer. 

JAY
Get some food. Love you. 

She takes the money. Nothing else to say. He pulls away.  

Christina watches as his tail lights fade around the corner. 



Sun pours into the gym. Fighters train. Everything hums.

Nate s battered smiling face watches...

Jay sparring with another FIGHTER. Doing his thing, picking 
the guy apart, back in his element. 

Nate loves it. He looks lighter than we ve ever seen him. 
Like the kid he truly is. It s cut by Alvey s loud WHISTLE. 

Alvey enters the gym with Dana White and a LAWYER. The whole 
gym stops.  

ALVEY
Nate! Someone s here to see you. 55.


DANA WHITE
(smiling)
How you doing, kid? 

Jay and Nate exchange a look -- Dana Fucking White.  

CUT TO:



Alvey, Dana White, and the lawyer stand over Nate sitting at 
the desk signing his contract. Jay snaps PICTURES.   

DANA WHITE
(shaking Nate s hand)
Welcome to the UFC. 
Congratulations, kid. You got a big 
career ahead of you. 

Celebration. Nate hugs his father. Jay watches. Love trumps 
envy. Jay pulls his brother in close.   

Dana pulls Alvey aside. 

DANA WHITE (CONT D)
I heard a rumor you re training 
Ryan Revis.  

ALVEY
Word travels fast.  

DANA WHITE
(intrigued)
How s he looking? 

Alvey s got a bite. Get him on the boat. Plays it cool.  

ALVEY
Little ring rust but... he s still 
Revis.    

Dana grins. 

DANA WHITE
Guy s a fucking beast. I d love to 
get him back in the cage. 

ALVEY
He s game, no doubt about that, but 
I m bringing him along slow. Let 
him ease back into things.   56.


DANA WHITE
Is he clean?

ALVEY
Total one-eighty. He s handling 
himself like a man. Living like a 
monk. I ve been very impressed. 

Dana s not sure he believes it, but hands Alvey his CARD.

DANA WHITE
We should keep talking. 

Alvey takes the card. Jay catches the exchange. Sees 
something mercenary in his father. Lets it go. For now.



Group therapy. Visiting FAMILY mixed with patients -- 
including Michael the heckler, still chastened with a big 
WELT on his face next to his dejected PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND. 

Ryan speaks, eyes fixed to the floor.  

RYAN
It was about six years ago. I had a 
place in Hollywood at the time. 
Living like a savage. Drinking, 
snorting, fucking anything that 
wasn t nailed down. I knew it was 
bad when I got ejected from an In 
and Out Burger at noon on a Sunday. 
Literally walked in during brunch 
and yelled  If you don t want to 
get fucked, you better freeze. 
 Cause I ll fuck anything that 
moves.  On a Sunday afternoon.   

Scattered laughter. 

RYAN (CONT D)
But I was the champ. I m doing what 
I want to do and if you disagree, 
fuck you. I ll knock you out or cut 
you off. You serve at my pleasure. 
That was my mentality.      
(beat)
One morning I come home, still 
wasted, and there s my parents, and 
my sister and my girlfriend all 
sitting in my living room. Right 
away I know it s an intervention. 
And I m having none of it. 
(MORE)57.

RYAN (CONT D)
I cuss m out, I m throwing shit, 
trying to leave. But my dad... 
steps in my way... You don t do 
that to me... 
(overcome)
And, uh... I threw him down, he 
fell wrong... hit his head on the 
tiles... on the kitchen floor... 
Killed him.  

Silence in the room. Ryan regains his composure. 

RYAN (CONT D)
I spent my first two years in 
prison trying to figure out how to 
kill myself with a pair of rubber 
sandals.
(shows his wrists)
Almost got lucky with a melted down 
toothbrush... Self-destruction is 
self-obsession, and I m getting 
pretty fucking sick of myself. So, 
it s time to change.     

Ryan looks over to see...

LISA standing in the doorway. She heard everything. Ryan 
takes her in. She s a light for him.   

RYAN (CONT D)
Guys, this is Lisa. 

Javy stands to give Lisa the seat next to Ryan. She sits.

COUNSELOR
Thank you, Ryan. Anyone else?

Off Lisa, beside Ryan. Sucked in.    



Nate heads for the door with his SKATEBOARD. Jay catches up, 
out of breath from training. 

JAY
Where you going? I thought we were 
gonna roll. 

NATE
Taking the day off. 

JAY
To do what? 58.


NATE
I m going surfing. 

Nate smiles. Jay s proud.   

A FIGHTER calls out from the cage. Ready to spar.  

FIGHTER
Jay, what s up? Let s go.

Jay gives his brother a hug.

JAY
(to Nate)
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I m gonna kick 
your ass. 

Jay taunts him as he jogs back to the cage.
