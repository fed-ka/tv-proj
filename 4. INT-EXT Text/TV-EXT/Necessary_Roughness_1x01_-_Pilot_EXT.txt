      We get a glimpse of the Long Island neighborhood.  Big new-
      home constructions of various sizes, but similarly shaped.

      The kids drive off in Ray, Jr s Mini Cooper.


      ...where Ray tries to calm her, as he dodges clothing.

                                  RAY SR
                    Dani, c mon, that s a thousand 
                    dollar suit!                                                                            7.


                                  DANI
                    If you don t want me to pull a 
                    Lorena Bobbitt, you better run like 
                    the wind, Ray. Cause I have a ginsu 
                      collection in the kitchen that s 
                    begging me to do some dicing.

      Ray, Jr. and Lindsay pull up in the Mini Cooper.  They climb 
      out, see Dad s clothes all over the lawn.

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Dad, what the hell s going on?

                                  DANI
                          (shouts out)
                    Daddy s taking a trip, I m helping 
                    him pack!

      A SUITCASE comes flying out the window.

      She slams the window shut, disappears inside.  Lindsay turns 
      to Ray Jr, quietly.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Oh no, did you see Mom s angry neck 
                    vein.  That s not good.

      Now the FRONT DOOR opens...revealing Dani. 

      As the kids scurry inside exchanging looks.  Ray approaches.

                                  DANI
                    Next time you screw someone in the 
                    guest bedroom, remember -- I do box 
                    pleats, not hospital corners.

      As she starts to close the door on him:

                                  RAY
                    What the hell do you want from me 
                    Dani?

                                  DANI
                    I want a divorce.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      SMACK...we re back to that image of the WIDE RECEIVER being 
      PUMMELLED by the opposing team.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EST. LONG ISLAND S NORTH SHORE - MORNING

      ...we re in a New Money GATED COMMUNITY.  McMansion s of 
      various sizes, but similarly shaped.


      Jeanette jumps in Dani s waiting Lexus, Dani in the driver s 
      seat.

                                  JEANETTE
                    I think I drummed up some interest.

                                  DANI
                          (feels horrible)
                    This feels wrong, like you re my 
                    pimp or something.  

                                  JEANETTE
                    Well, I did get you laid.  We 
                    already have a working 
                      relationship.  

      Dani gives her a look...


        Establishing...Dani drives up to the SECURITY GATE.  The 
      guard checks his register, then raises the gate...


      ...where mid game, Terrence runs down the field to receive a 
        pass...(THIS IS THE SAME SHOT OF HIM FROM THE TEASER). 

                                  TERRENCE V.O.
                    Now, every time the ball is coming 
                    towards me, all I see is...   

      TERRENCE S POV on the field:  A BIG ROLL OF TOILET PAPER 
      COMING HIS WAY...

      ...as it slips through his hands we come back to


      Dani watches from her doorstep as TK climbs into the back of 
      a waiting TOWN CAR.  

      As the car drives off, Dani spots a BLACK BMW with deeply 
      tinted glass parked across the street from her house.  What 
      the...?

      She boldly crosses over, knocks hard, the window rolls down.   

      REVEAL the driver: NICO CARELES.  Cool, a little dark.  Don t 
      fuck with this guy.  Former FBI?  Mossad?  Hard to tell.

                                  DANI
                    Can I help you?

      Nico points up to the upstairs of her house.                                                                             34.


                                  NICO
                    Tell your kids to lay off the 
                      binoculars.

      She looks up in time to see the blinds settling. 

      Dani doesn t know who she s more pissed at -- her kids or 
      this asshole invading her space. 

                                  DANI
                    Excuse me, are you staking out my 
                    house? 

                                  NICO
                    I work for the team. 

                                  DANI
                          (confused)
                    Doing...?

                                  NICO
                    Whatever needs doing.

                                  DANI
                    So you re security? 

                                  NICO
                    Something like that.

                                  DANI
                          (firm)
                    What happens here needs to be 
                      completely confidential....  

                                  NICO
                    Tell that to your kids, Dani. 

      He puts the car into gear.

                                  DANI
                    Wait, what s your--

      Too late.  He speeds off.  Dani looks up to the bedroom 
      window -- those kids are so gonna get it.


      Dani escorts Faye out...Faye hugs her. 

                                  FAYE
                    Three pounds down, only three more 
                    to go, Dr. Dani!

                                  DANI
                    You go girl! Go. Go.

      As she shuts the door...she looks for Terrence... no sign of 
      him.  She hears whooping coming from the....


      ...where Nico s in his car, when, in his rear view mirror he 
      spots the SILVER CAMRY that was watching Dani and Matthew at 
      dinner. 

      Parked down the block from Dani s house.  Hmmm.


      The guard waves Dani through.


      ...where Dani is walking towards a lit up FOOTBALL FIELD, 
      talking on her CELL.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, this is Dr. Dani.  Again. 
                    I m concerned about you...your 
                    whole team is. Please, call me 
                    back. Or call...someone...just to 
                    let them know you re okay.  
                    Okay...?   

      She snaps her phone shut, exhales.  She s clearly worried.


      A football is snapped, players collide.  

      REVEAL we re not at a pro game -- this is high school 
      football.  In some ways even more intense.  

        Cheerleading squad (which includes Lindsay) cheers....

                                  CHEERLEADERS
                      BE...AGGRESSIVE!  BE-BE-AGGRESSIVE!

      ON THE FIELD: Ray, Jr. catches a pass for a first down.  

      IN THE BLEACHERS

      Dani and Angela cheering.

                                  DANI
                    Way to go, Ray!                                                                            55.


                                  ANGELA
                    Let s go, Syosset!  Run up the 
                    score!

                                  DANI
                    Please tell me you didn t.

                                  ANGELA
                    Just a friendly wager with a woman 
                    from church.  

                                  DANI
                          (appalled)
                    Ma!

      Ray, Sr. appears next to Angela...

                                  ANGELA
                    Look who s here!

                                  RAY SR
                    Hey, Ma.

      Angela gives Ray a big HUG.  Dani wants to slap her mother.

                                  DANI
                    You don t get to sit here.  And you 
                    don t get to call her Ma, either.

                                  ANGELA
                    It s fine, Danielle.  Sit. 

      She gives her mother a look...how could you??  

                                  RAY SR
                    Don t make a scene, Dan.  We re all 
                    cheering for the same team, right?

      Before Dani can respond, her CELL RINGS.  She checks caller 
      ID.  It s...

                                  DANI
                    Terrence?  Ohmygod, where the hell 
                    are you?

                                  TERRENCE (O.S.)
                    Right behind you.

      She turns around...

      A LARGE MAN with popcorn, wearing shades and a baseball cap 
      pulled down low, is sitting in the BACK ROW.  He waves, no 
      one sitting next to him on either side the wiser.                                                                             56.


      INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM ON THEIR PHONES

      Dani trying to keep anyone from hearing her call...

                                  DANI
                    What are you doing here?

                                  TERRENCE
                    I told Ray Jay I d pop by the game.  
                    He texted me the info.

                                  DANI
                    You re texting with my son?  
                      Terrence....?

                                  TERRENCE
                      Boundaries, I know. But did you 
                    catch that two handed chuck on the 
                    last play -- I taught him that.  
                    Good trick to put some space 
                    between him and the DB.  Boom.

      Off Dani s frustration...she nods for him to meet her.


      Dani meets with Terrence behind the bleachers.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Sometimes a man needs to get up 
                    into the wind, do some thinking.

                                  DANI
                      I appreciate that, but you can t 
                    just disappear like that. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    I ve been thinking about what you 
                    said...

      ...a TEENAGE BOY passes:

                                    TEENAGE BOY
                    Hey, Mrs. Santino.  

                                  DANI
                    Hey, Joey.

      The boy keeps going, but then turns back.  His look says it 
      all -- was that Terrence King?                                                                            57.


                                  TERRENCE
                          (quiet, just for her)
                    -- about making peace with my 
                    mother.  I m ready.

                                  DANI
                          (genuine)
                    That s great, Terrence.  Good for 
                    you. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    I never went to her grave.  She s 
                    buried near Newark.

                                  DANI
                    That would be a big step, and it s 
                    not far at all.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Cool.  We ll be back in a couple of 
                    hours.

      Dani looks at him... Did she hear right?

                                  DANI
                     We ll? 

                                  TERRENCE
                    You ll have to drive.  I can t 
                    really drive.  I mean I can, but I 
                    had my license yanked for a couple 
                    of DUI s last year.

      She looks at him like he s nuts....

                                  DANI
                    Terrence.  I can t take you to 
                    Newark right now...   

                                  TERRENCE
                          (like a child)
                    Okay.

      She sees the look on his face...he s vulnerable.  This 
      opportunity may never arise again.


      Ray Sr watches her as she grabs her PURSE and COAT from the 
        bleachers...

                                  DANI
                    Work emergency, Ray you got the 
                    kids covered?                                                                            58.


                                  RAY
                      Yeah...sure.

      As she rushes off...


      ...where Ray Sr has clearly followed Dani to the parking lot.  
      He watches as Terrence King gets into Dani s car with her.  
      Kids begin to mob the car as Terrence is SPOTTED.  Terrence 
      happily signs some quicky autographs before getting in.

                                  KID
                    That s Terrence King!

      Some more kids go running by...

                                  RAY SR
                    What the hell s he doing with my 
                    wife?  

      Off Ray s perplexed look...


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                            59.


                                        ACT FIVE


      On the road: Dani driving.  Terrence fiddles with her radio -- 
      her preset buttons are all oldies rock or news.

                                  TERRENCE
                    You mind?

                                  DANI
                    Sure.  Just nothing with pimps and 
                    hos.

      He spins the dial to a station playing Miles Davis cool jazz.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Now don t you feel stupid.
                          (then)
                    Jazz and football are the same.  
                    There s a rhythm, a tempo and a 
                    plan, but you gotta be ready to 
                    improvise on the fly.  Seat of your 
                    pants.  Never boring.

                                  DANI
                    Nobody ever tore their ACL playing 
                    bebop music.

                                  TERRENCE
                    True, dat.

      They listen to the music.

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                    So what s your deal, Dr. D?  
                    Where s the pain in your past? 

                                  DANI
                    Why do you assume there s pain?

                                  TERRENCE
                            (undeterred)
                    The only person I know more pissed 
                    off than me is you.  According to 
                    you, where there s anger there s 
                    pain.

                                  DANI
                    I m happy to share my pain...with 
                    my shrink.                                                                            60.


                                  TERRENCE
                    That s all right, I know the drill.
                    Ray was a dog, you kicked his sorry 
                    ass out, and now he wants to screw 
                    you on the cheese.  Why any man 
                    would cheat on a fine looking lady 
                    like you I don t get.

      She shoots him a look: how do you know that?

                                  DANI
                          (peeved)
                    Ray Jay s gonna be in the Guinness 
                    Book for world s biggest mouth.

      Beat.  Then: 

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    We got married very young... and 
                    very stupid.  Dad drank.  Mom 
                    gambled.  I...ran.  Ray rescued me.  
                    Took care of me...and a few other 
                    women along the way, apparently.

      Terrence clocks that.

                                  TERRENCE
                    I guess we re both throwaways. 

                                  DANI
                          (realizing he s right, 
                            painful as that is)
                    Guess we are.

      As they pull off the expressway in Newark....


      A small headstone: Loretta King.  Born 1963.  Died 1990.  

      Terrence stands over the grave, unsure how to proceed.  Dani 
      bundles up against the cold wind. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    How am I supposed to feel?  

                                  DANI
                    There s no playbook for this. 

      He nods, kneels in front of the grave...Dani takes a few 
      steps back to give him his space, watches as he mumbles 
      something barely spoken to his mother/to himself.                                                                              61.


      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Dani watches from a respectful distance, moved by the sight 
      of this HUGE HULK, kneeling over this worn, untended stone.  

      After a moment, she realizes...Terrence is sobbing.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    Couple of mistakes and the team s 
                    just gonna throw me away.  Just 
                    like they all do.

      Finally it all makes sense.  

      She quietly puts her hand on his shoulder, supportive. 

      Something he s just not used to.  He wipes away his tears, 
      pulls it together.  And throws his arms around her.  

      Dani embraces him with a maternal hug.  Something he s 
      probably never had.

      Off that breakdown/breakthrough tableau....


      ...where Dani s drives, on the phone, excited.

                                  DANI
                    I think Terrence had a big 
                      breakthrough last night....  


      ...a tow truck sets down a MINI COOPER, driver s side 
      thrashed, broken side mirror dangling sadly.  

      Ray Jr. gets out of the TOW TRUCK passenger side.

                                  TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    That ll be two hundred dollars.  We 
                    take cash or check.

      Dani looks to the upstairs window.  Lindsay ducks out of the 
      way, but not fast enough.  Dani burns.


      ...where Dani quietly exits the house (dressed down -- jeans, 
      tennis shoes and sweatshirt.)  She climbs into Nico s car.

                                  DANI
                    I need to be back by sun-up.  I 
                    can t have my kids wake up and find 
                    Xeno in the kitchen....

                                  NICO
                    Not a problem.

                                  DANI
                    Is that a promise?

                                  NICO
                    When you know me longer you won t 
                    have to ask that question.

      As they drive away, they pass that SILVER CAMRY up the block 
      from her house, the Weasly Guy firing pictures with a long 
      lens.  Suddenly, Dani puts it all together...

                                  DANI
                    That s how he knows...Ray has that 
                    guy tailing me.  
                          (panics)
                    Ohmygod, I can t do this.  Turn the 
                    car around.  

                                  NICO
                    I can t do that.

                                  DANI
                    Fine, I ll just pull a TK, do a 
                    jump and roll...

      She opens the door...he never slows down.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    DAMN IT NICO!

                                  NICO
                    That guy s not going to cause you 
                    any problems.
                          (looks her in the eyes)
                    You have my word.

      Nico says it with such authority that she can t help but 
      believe in him.  Frankly, at this point, she has no choice.                                                                            71.



      A run down house with bars on the windows, two scary pitbulls 
      at the backyard fence barking.  

      At the curb in the car...Nico kills the engine.   

      Dani realizes how deep in she is in this moment.  

                                  DANI
                          (gallows humor)
                    I ve never been to a crack house, 
                    is there a special handshake?

                                  NICO
                    Start by getting out of the car. 

      She girds herself, climbs out of the car.  Strides up the 
      walkway -- freaking on the inside, but never showing it.

      She knocks tentatively on the door.  No response.  Turns back 
      to Nico (who s leaning against the car) for guidance.  

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Louder.

      She knocks louder.  She hears noises, tries to see through 
      the front window, spots what might be Terrence.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, I know you re in there.  
                    Unlock the door so we can talk. 

      Nothing.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Don t do this, TK.  You re better 
                    than this.

      The eastern sky begins to get light.  Her frustrations with 
      family, divorce, life boil over... she starts banging on the 
      door now: 

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    TERRENCE. I dragged myself out of 
                    bed, left my kids home with a 
                    complete stranger who probably is 
                    scaring the crap out of them right 
                    about now.

      Nothing.                                                                            72.


                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    I gave up my goddamn beauty rest 
                    for you, you selfish sonuvabitch! 
                      Fine...you re not coming out, I m 
                    washing my hands of you...don t 
                    call me at 4 am, don t show up at 
                    my son s football games, and lose 
                    my freakin  number.

      She starts walking towards Nico when...

      ...the sound of the locks being undone, the door cracks open, 
      Terrence comes out...all the bravado gone.

      Dani walks towards him slowly.  Holds out her hand...he 
      doesn t take it.  He sits down on the STOOP.

                                  TERRENCE
                    I m not better than this.  

      She sits down next to him.  Deliberates carefully before 
      choosing her words.  These words may be the difference 
      between TK coming home with her...or not.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, I know what it s like to 
                    come from the wrong side of the 
                    tracks... what it s like to finally 
                    have something worth having, and to 
                    believe deep down, in a place you 
                    never look...that you don t deserve 
                    it. But Terrence, the people who 
                    threw us away, they re the ones who 
                    fumbled.  Our pain is our fuel, 
                    like it or not.  People like us 
                    either kick some ass, or get our 
                    asses kicked.  The choice is ours.    

      Terrence nods a smile of recognition.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    If you walk away with me right now, 
                    I promise I will never, ever give 
                    up on you, whether you like it or 
                    not. But if you go back inside...

      She shrugs as if to say...nothing I can do for you.

      A moment, then...he stands.  What s he going to do?  

      He reaches down for her hand.  He lifts her up.    

      And they walk towards the car...this giant man and this tiny 
      woman.                                                                              73.



      They drive home.  Dani glances at Terrence, curled up asleep 
      in the back seat of the car. 

                                  DANI
                    I don t think he can be left alone.

                                  NICO
                    I ll sleep at his house.  He won t 
                    be out of my sight until the game.  

                                  DANI
                    Then he goes straight to rehab.

                                  NICO
                    I will drive him there myself.  

                                  DANI
                    I ll go with you.

      They drive in silence.  

                                  NICO
                      I couldn t do what you do.

      She looks at him, surprised by what appears to be a 
      compliment.

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Never understood what kind of 
                    person would want to be a shrink.    

      She hadn t thought of it quite like this...

                                  DANI
                    We ve all got our addictions.  Some 
                    people it s alcohol.  Some it s... 
                    bread.  I guess...I m addicted to 
                    being needed.  What about you?  

                                  NICO
                    I m addicted to not being needed.

      She has to laugh.  They exchange a smile for the first time.

      And we suspect that Nico and Dani have more of a spark or 
      connection than we might have initially surmised.  


      The sun is just peeking over the horizon as Nico pulls into 
      her driveway.  Dani climbs out of the car.                                                                            74.



      Cold, blustery fall afternoon. The parking lot is crowded 
      with players, coaches, family, friends, equipment bags all 
      being loaded. 

      Dani parks nearby, Jeanette in the passenger seat.  Kids in 
      back.  They all get out of the car.  She spots Matthew, 
      loading players onto the bus.  He spots her, waves her over.

                                  DANI
                    I ll just be a minute.  Wait here.

      As Dani crosses towards Matthew...Lindsay pulls out her 
      confiscated CELLPHONE from her pocket.
