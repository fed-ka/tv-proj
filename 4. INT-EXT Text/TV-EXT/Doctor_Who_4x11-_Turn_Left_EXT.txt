      FX SHOT DMP: the Chino-planet Shan Shen, a horizon of
      PAGODAS & KITES, hazy against a WHITE SKY.  Craning down...

      CAMERA coming down long, fluttering vertical banners; red,
      emblazoned with Chinese-style writing.  Craning down...

      To the ALLEYWAY, in which there's a tatty STREET MARKET. 
      Wooden stalls, crates, barrels, cages of CHICKENS. 
        STALLHOLDERS & PASSERS-BY, mostly Chinese, in peasant's
      clothes.  Red banners flanking the alley.  Finding...

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA, just wandering, enjoying themselves. 
      At the far end of the alley, way behind them: the TARDIS.

      SERIES OF JUMP CUTS, seen from a distance, observing them,
      dialogue not audible: the Doctor & Donna chatting with a
        STALLHOLDER, who's gesticulating wildly.  They're falling
      about with laughter.

      JUMP CUT TO the Doctor & Donna trying some foamy drink
      from a wooden bowl.  Ooh, it's delicious.

      JUMP CUT TO the Doctor & Donna moving away from some crates,
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
      fast - something stinks!  Cor!  They're hooting!

      JUMP CUT TO Donna, on her own, wandering.  She looks back:

      The Doctor's way back, fascinated by a stallholder's sea
  
      urchins.  Donna just smiles, walks on, leaving him to it.

      She passes a rough DOORWAY.  A WOMAN is sitting outside,
      on a stool.  She's 30's, shrouded in Chinese/Romany robes. 
      Clever eyes.  This is the FORTUNE TELLER.

      She revs the engine.

      CU her hands, turning the wheel, LEFT.

      And as the CAR TURNS LEFT -

      Sc.10 is far away from here, but PEOPLE are beginning to
      run away, in b/g, MOOKY & MATES legging it, panic.  But on
      DONNA.  Tracking into CU, as she watches the far horizon. 
      As though remembering something that never happened...

      She blinks.  Shakes it off.  Looks round.  With people
      running all around...  ALICE is staring at her. 

                                      DONNA
                    Alice, there's a great big web-

      And Alice is terrified.  Of Donna.  Alice turns, runs away.

      Donna looks back towards the direction of the Webstar. 
      Deep breath, then she runs towards it.  Veena calling out:

      But Donna's just running on instinct, keeps going.

      FX: Donna running down the street, with the RACNOSS STAR
      way off in b/g, above the buildings, raining down fire.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      (NB, this street & set-up can double for sc.126 in Ep. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
      4.1.)

  
      The street's sealed off, CROWD at the barriers, AMBULANCES,
      POLICE CARS, ARMY JEEPS.  Donna running up...

      She's behind some people.  Tries to see.  For some reason
      she doesn't understand, that instinct, she's got to see.

      She thinks.  Moves round to the side...

      Like a spy, she goes round the back of a JEEP, no crowd,
      slips through a gap in the barriers, creeps forward...

      Then stops.  Hidden in shadow.  Just watching.

      There's a SECOND AMBULANCE.  UNIT SOLDIERS around it, all
      quiet, standing still, as though bereaved.  One soldier
      with his back to Donna, on radio, and during this,
      PARAMEDICS carry a covered body on a stretcher.

                                      SOLDIER
                    ...from the evidence, I'd say he
                    managed to stop the creature. 
                    Some sort of red spider.  He blew
                    up the base underneath the Barrier,
                    flooded the whole thing, over.

                                      RADIO VOICE
                    And where is he now?  Over.

                    Is it him?

                                      SOLDIER
                    I think so.  He didn't get out in
                    time.  Sorry to report, sir.  But
                    the Doctor is dead.  Over.

      On the stretcher.  An arm slips out.  An arm in a brown
      suit.  Something falls from its grip.

      The SONIC SCREWDRIVER clatters to the floor.

      Donna just stares.  It means nothing to her.  And yet...

      She feels like she's intruding.  Turns away.  Walks back.

      CUT TO Donna, now a distance away from the barriers &
      people, walking away.  Lost in thought.

      REVERSE, Donna's back to CAMERA as she walks; shot on a
      LONG LENS, so her background - and this is a long street -
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
      is just a blur, far-off PEOPLE still running to and fro... 

      And one blur is running towards her.

      Coming into focus slowly. 
  
      A WOMAN.  Running.

      A blonde woman.

      Close and closer

      Focus resolving... 

      Into... 

      ROSE TYLER. 

      And she's desperate.  Rose stops Donna, breathless -

                                    ROSE
                    What happened, what did they find? 
                    I'm sorry, but...  Did they find

                    They took him away, he's dead.

      And Rose is so upset.  Though controlling it.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.  Did you know him?  I mean,
                    they didn't say his name, it could
                    be any Doctor.

                                    ROSE
                    ...I came so far.

                    Could be anyone.

      Now, Rose looks at her properly.  Studies her.

                                    ROSE
                    What's your name?

                      I shouldn't even be here.  This is

                          (colder)

                                    ROSE

      Said, trying to look left and right, though she can't see
      properly, can't reach.  A quiet hisss-tic-tic-tic...

      And when she looks up -

      Rose Tyler has gone.

      WIDE SHOT, no one near Donna.

      She's a bit freaked out.  Walks away, down the dark street.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    ...it sounds impossible, but the
                    entire hospital has disappeared. 
                    The Royal Hope no longer exists. 
                    It's not been destroyed, there's
                    no wreckage, it's simply gone. 
                    Reports from bystanders say that
                    the rain lifted up around the
                    hospital, that the rain actually
                    went up, into the air.  This was
                    followed by a flash of lightning. 
                    And when it cleared... the Hospital
                    was gone.  Literally, lifted out
                    of its foundations.  To repeat: no
                    wreckage, no rubble, no debris. 
                    Simply, gone.  And we're being
                    told that CCTV footage from
                      surrounding buildings has confirmed

                    to its original position.  But

      In the distance, in the direction she's heading, an
      ALLEYWAY.  And it's flashing with PRAC WHITE LIGHT. 
      Blinking, with a sizzling sound.  Getting stronger.

      Donna closer, curious, and when she's a few feet away -

      A BANG!! of LIGHT - a WOMAN comes belting out, like she's
      been shot from a cannon, runs to a halt, in the road...

      It's ROSE TYLER.  In the same clothes as sc.13.

                    I can try.

      As they approach number 29 -

                                      SYLVIA
                    What happens, do we get keys?  Who
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
                    do we ask, the soldiers - ?

      But the door of no.29's thrown open by a big, smiling 50
        www.thewriterstale.com
      y/o Italian man, MR COLASANTO:

  
                                    MR COLASANTO
                    Is big house!  Is room for all! 
                    Welcome, all!  In you come, in, in -

                                      DONNA
                    I thought this was our house.

                                    MR COLASANTO
                    Is many people's house!  Is
                      wonderful!  In!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MR COLASANTO, WILF & DONNA step out - couple of HOUSEHOLDERS
      appearing in the doorways, SYLVIA standing in no.29's.

      Two SOLDIERS with their ATMOS-sticker JEEP, PRAC SMOKE
      pouring out of the exhaust.  (No other cars in the street.)

      One soldier fires again at the exhaust.  It won't stop. 
      All reeling, the gas is noxious.

                                    MR COLASANTO
                    Firing at car, not so good, you
                    stupid or what?

                                      SOLDIER #2
                    It's this ATMOS thing, it won't
                    stop, it's like gas, it's toxic -

                                    WILF
                    Then turn it off!

                                      SOLDIER #2
                    I have done!  It's still going! 
                    It's all the cars, every single
                    ATMOS car!  They've gone mad...
                          (suddenly)
                    Turn around!

      And he's pointing his gun at Donna!  All at once, wild:

                    SOLDIER #2 (CONT'D)MR COLASANTO
          I said, turn around!You gone crazy, boy?

                      WILFSYLVIA
        Put that down!Donna, do what he says!

                    SOLDIER #2MR COLASANTO
        Turn around, now!Put the gun down!

          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
                      WILFSYLVIA
        She's a civilian!Just turn around!

        www.thewriterstale.com
                    SOLDIER #2MR COLASANTO
        Show me your back!! She's done nothing!
  
      But Donna, scared, hands in the air, turns, shows her back.

      Nothing there.

      Soldier #2 disturbed, shaken, lowers his gun.

                                      SOLDIER #2
                    I'm sorry...  I thought I saw...

                                    WILF
                    Call yourself a soldier?!  Pulling
                    guns on innocent women!  It's a
                    disgrace!  In my day, we'd have
                    you court martialled for that!

      But Wilf b/g: on Donna.  She looks at the end of the road.

      Far off, where the road turns, around the corner... the
      walls bouncing, the FIZZ, POP! of flashing PRAC WHITE LIGHT.

      And very calm, Donna walks towards it.  Ignoring:

                                      SYLVIA
                    Donna, where are you going?  It's
                    not safe at night!  Donna!

                                                                            CUT TO:  Doctor Who 4 - Episode 11 - Pink Pages - 26/11/07 - Page 30.




      DONNA walks round the corner.  Expecting to see...

      ROSE.  Standing centre of the road. 

                                      DONNA
                    Hello.

                                    ROSE
                    Hi.

      Cold and bleak.  DONNA & ROSE on a bench.  Very far away,
      DRIFTS OF SMOKE.  Sirens from the city.  Both quiet:

                                    ROSE
                    It's the ATMOS devices.  You're
                    lucky, it's not so bad here, Britain
                    hasn't got much petrol.  But all
                    over Europe.  China.  South Africa. 
                    They're getting choked by gas.

                                    ROSE
  
                    They're trying.  Right now.  This
                    little band of fighters, on board
                    the Sontaran ship.  Any second now -

      She looks up...

      FX: FIRE rips across the sky!

      HIGH ANGLE, Donna & Rose, lit in red, Donna boggling.

      FX: FIRE rips away, into nothing.  All back to normal.

      Donna lets it sink in, then:

                                      DONNA
                    And that was..?

                                    ROSE

                    And Captain Jack Harkness has been
                      transported to the Sontaran
                      homeworld.  The last of the heroes,
                    all gone.  There's no one left.

                          (pause)
                    Why won't you tell me your name?

                                    ROSE
                    None of this was meant to happen. 
                    There was a man.  This wonderful
                    man.  And he stopped them.  The
                    Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS,
                    he stopped them all from happening.

                                    ROSE
                    I think you dream of him, sometimes. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Man in a suit.  Tall, thin man.
                          (smiles)
  
                    Great hair.  He had this really
                    great hair.

      Donna disturbed.  Rose is right; she's dreamt of this.

                                      DONNA
                    ...who are you?

                                    ROSE
                    I was like you.  I used to be you. 
                    Cos you travelled with him, Donna,
                    you travelled with the Doctor.  In
                      a different world.

                                      DONNA
                    But I never met him.  And he's
                    dead.

                                    ROSE
                    He died underneath the Thames on
                    Christmas Eve.  But you were meant
                    to be there.  He needed someone to
                    stop him, and that was you.  You
                    made him leave, you saved his life -

      During that, on CU Donna -

      Whoosh, she's hit by FLASHBACKS, feels them, fierce images
      from 3.X, the water, the fire.  'You can stop now' -

                                      DONNA
                    Stop it!  I don't know what you're
                    talking about, leave me alone -

      She's turning to go, Rose stands, calls after her, strong:

                                    ROSE
                    Something is coming, Donna. 
                    Something worse.

      Donna stops.  Looks back.  Reluctant, but...

                                      DONNA
                    The whole world is stinking.  How
                    could anything be worse than this?

                                    ROSE
                    Trust me.  We need the Doctor,
                    more than ever.  I've been pulled
                    across from a different universe,
                    because every single universe is
                    in danger.  It's coming, Donna.

      FX: simply fades away.

      Donna upset, bewildered.  Starts to cry.  Just a little.

                    They can't send us home, the oceans

                    I know, but labour doing what? 
                    There aren't any jobs.

                    Wilfred!  My capitano!

      He gives Wilf a salute.  Wilf salutes back.  Both grave.

      Then Mr Colasanto heads for the truck. 

      Donna goes to stand next to Wilf.

                                      DONNA

                    What is?

      She looks at the truck.

      Mr Colasanto is hugging his wife.  And the pretence has
      fallen away.  Both are crying.

      The soldiers getting into the driver's cab.

      But the truck starts off.  The Colasantos staring at Donna.

      She runs after them, but it's useless, the truck drives
      away, she's left standing in the middle of the empty street -

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 11 - Shooting Script - 20/11/07 - Page 51.




      DONNA & SYLVIA in the car -

                                      DONNA
                    Well that decides it, I'm not
                    sitting in a traffic jam.  We're
                    going left!

      MASSIVE CU, the CHUNK! of the indicator.  LEFT!

      FLARE OF RED LIGHT, car indicator.  LEFT HAND SIDE.

      And the car pulls out...

      TURNING LEFT!

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      DONNA runs out -
  
                                      DONNA
                    Doctor, what is it - ?

      And she stops.  Looks up.  In horror.

      The VERTICAL BANNERS are still fluttering, flanking the
      length of Shan Shen Alley.  And every single one of them
      now says, in black Chinese lettering, against red -

      BAD WOLF.

      The Doctor, Donna, look round -

      Scrawled on the walls: BAD WOLF.

      - and the Doctor is running, like a mad thing, down the
      alley, towards the Tardis - Donna desperate, following -

      And as they run towards the Tardis...

      They see...

      The POLICE BOX sign above the door has changed.  The
      lettering now says BAD WOLF!

      The Doctor slams inside -

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 11 - Shooting Script - 20/11/07 - Page 55.
