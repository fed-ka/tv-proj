DERELICT STREET
TWILIGHT
Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.
The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.
Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this
dark and derelict street.
Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are
abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.
Stores
are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.
At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can
fires.
ANGLE ON TWO BUMS
- as their eyes move, following something moving down the
street.
Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
engine.
ANGLE ON STREET
Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is
going shopping.
The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
open store on the block.
ANGLE ON STORE
A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
store is still trading.
Its windows are grimy, its door
defaced.
Above the door - barely legible through the accrued
dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.
ANGLE ON CAR
The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.
JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with
designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather
jacket.
For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
glances up and down the ruined street.
He shows no anxiety at
being in this twilight part of town.
Cocooned in the
confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.
Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through
the doorway.

DENSE JUNGLE
DAY
(JOEY'S DREAM)
The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage.
The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of
Helicopter blades, one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying the
sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine
gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries.
A POV camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery.
The camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this
way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside.
Voices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-screen
as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal.
SOLDIER 1
(off)
Call for a Medi-Vac!
16
SOLDIER 2
(off)
Don't die, man!
Don't fucking die!
The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the
POV camera.
Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage,
it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead.
In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially
obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over
the prone body of a third.
It is unclear due to distance but
there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic,
ringing sound.
The other elements die away until only this is
left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we
CUT TO
DERELICT STREET
DAY
Joey's Mazda 323 drives down the street.
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No
bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.
It has the feel of a ghost
town, as if nothing has breathed here for years.
ANGLE IN CAR
Joey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face.
Terri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window.
JOEY
Jesus.
Are you sure this is the street?
TERRI
Yeah.
Happening, isn't it?
JOEY
What on earth were you doing down here?
An evasive silence.
JOEY
Terri?
TERRI
Buying some drugs, alright?
JOEY
Oh, Terri ...
31
TERRI
For somebody else, alright?
Not for me.
I don't do that shit anymore.
JOEY
Then you shouldn't even be around it.
You know, it's ...
TERRI
Here!
Here!
Pull over!
Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store.
Terri scrambles out of the passenger door.
TERRI
Yeah.
See.
I told you it was here.
CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY
- as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her
new and screwed-up friend.
CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB
NEXT DAY
The sun is high.
It's about noon.
Like most clubs of its type, Under The Underground's exterior
is far from prepossessing.
It's set in an old brick warehouse
in a run-down section of town.
JP's Range Rover pulls up and JP gets out, carrying a long slim
black bag.
He glances round the all-but-deserted street and
enters the club.
DENSE JUNGLE
DAY
(JOEY'S DREAM)
Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera.
The sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun-
fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded
Leaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen
dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest.
The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are
heard over the roar of battle.
SOLDIER 1
(off)
He's going.
He's going.
He's going ...
SOLDIER 2
(off)
We're losing him.
We're losing him.
We're losing him ...
The sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to
more furious endeavor.
It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the
greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage
thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely.
FLANDERS FIELD (WW I)
DAY
(JOEY'S DREAM)
The POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one
of a different character.
It appears to be early morning.
The skies are grey and
overcast.
In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward
No jungle, no trees or grass.
The ground is baked mud
disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats.
The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no
cries or sound of machinery.
Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers.
58
Nothing moves.
No birds sing.
It is a horrible, desolate
image from the bloody pages of history.
The fields of Flanders
in World War One.
A noise begins to be heard OFF.
A low angry BUZZING.
ANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER
A cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor
dead face.
JOEY
(off)
Noooooooooo .......
The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we
CUT TO
FLANDERS FIELD
DAY
Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most
recent dream.
She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable
figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the
trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke.
JOEY
What's going on?
Is this a dream?
She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left.
JOEY'S POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR
Within the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits.
ANGLE ON JOEY
- as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes
wide in shock.
Standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield
skies, is Elliott.
Joey walks toward him.
Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey.
ELLIOTT
Joey.
How kind of you to come.
A beat.
Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible
presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field.
71
JOEY
Wait ... wait.
You ... you have to help
me.
I don't understand.
Am I dreaming
this?
ELLIOTT
You have to help me.
You will
understand.
And no, you're not
dreaming.
Do you know where we are?
JOEY
It's ... I don't know.
First World War,
right?
ELLIOTT
Correct.
The fields of France.
And
many dead flowers ... Oh.
Forgive me.
My name was Spenser.
Elliott Spenser.
Captain.
He extends his hand.
Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his.
JOEY
Joey Summerskill.
Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand.
ELLIOTT
Well done.
Brave girl.
You've probably
never shaken hands with a ghost before,
am I right?
JOEY
Captain Spenser.
Elliott.
I ... What
the Hell is going on?
ELLIOTT
Hell is precisely what is going on,
Joey.
And we have to stop it.
I
because of a special obligation, you
because you're the only person who can
help. And because you know what is
right, and just, and true.
Will you
walk with me a while?
He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.
72
ELLIOTT
There were days in this war, days right
on top of each other, when the newly
dead were numbered in the tens of
thousands.
They called it the war to
end all wars.
Though it didn't.
You
know that.
There were more wars.
More
dead.
Your father's war.
Your dream
search for your father led you here.
To
me.
Joey, we need to talk.
Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or
snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without
moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut.
FLANDERS FIELD
DAY
Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock, Joey
standing close.
ELLIOTT
Because something worse is coming.
(a beat)
I opened the Box, Joey.
I found the
monster within it.
And it found the
monster within me.
For decades I served
Hell with no memory of my former life
until a friend released me.
You saw
her.
JOEY
Kirsty Cotton.
Yes.
But ... if your
soul was freed, why are you back?
ELLIOTT
Because - monster as I was - I was bound
by Laws.
The protocol of Hell.
The Box
had to be opened to let me out.
The
truly innocent were safe.
That's no
longer true.
The shell of the beast has
been fleshed.
What I was is out there,
Joey.
In your world.
Unbound.
Unstoppable.
JOEY
What will he do?
What does he want?
ELLIOTT
He'll do what he does best.
But he'll
do it unfettered.
He wants to walk the
Earth forever, indulging his taste for
all the myriad subtleties of human
suffering.
JOEY
What can we do?
74
ELLIOTT
I like you, Joey.
You ask all the right
questions.
There is something we can do
but it will require great courage.
JOEY
I don't know ...
Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek.
Gently.
Lovingly.
We see in Joey's eyes that there is a response there.
A
response beyond the comradely.
ELLIOTT
Joey, you walked through your window
from one reality to another.
You're
stronger than you think.
JOEY
Then tell me what to do.
ELLIOTT
This is his first night on Earth.
He
wants to close the door behind him.
Like all Lieutenants, he covets command.
There's a gateway to Hell through which
he can be taken back.
He has to destroy
it.
JOEY
So where is it?
ELLIOTT
Your apartment.
Joey gasps.
JOEY
Wha .... ?
ELLIOTT
The Box, Joey.
He wants the Box.
CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB
NIGHT
The images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary
loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage.
Doc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying
to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening.
Sirens howl, red emergency lights flash.
77
It becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster.
Or a massacre.
The club building looks like a bomb hit it.
Smoke and debris
litter the street.
So do corpses.
Some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies.
Others -
glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and
bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively.
In fact they bear
hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the
club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with
machinery inside instead of muscle.
DOC
(off)
Judas Priest!
Will you look at ...
Suddenly, the images are blocked by a very BURLY COP pushing at
the camera and talking directly into it.
BURLY COP
Move it!
Now!
No pictures!
DOC
(off)
W-QQY.
I ...
BURLY COP
I don't give a shit!
Move it or lose
it!
ALLEYWAY
NIGHT
BACK ON TV SCREEN
The hubbub and noise has died away.
Doc's camera is advancing
up a very dimly-lit alley.
Hardly any detail can be seen.
The
camera creeps forward ... forward ... forward ...
Then suddenly a barely-glimpsed movement very close to the side
and the camera swings wildly toward it.
DOC
Shit!
What was ...
The face of Pinhead, almost lost to the darkness of the alley,
is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens.
The image disappears to darkness, over which Doc's SCREAM of
mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is
suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then a
very harried anchorperson at a studio desk.
ANCHORPERSON
Well, we've ... er ... yes, we've
temporarily lost our pictures there and
... and ...
Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
JOEY
Doc!
DOC!!
Joey leaps to her feet, grabs the box from the TV, and stares
at it in her hand.
SMASH-CUT TO
INT/EXT
JOEY'S CAR/CTTY STREETS
NIGHT
Joey's hands grip her steering-wheel tightly.
Her face is
drawn and grim.
The Box is on the seat beside her. She is
driving very fast.
She has to slam on the brakes at a red light.
She pounds at
the dashboard in frustration.
JOEY
C'mon.
C'mon!
79
THE STREETS OF THE CITY
NIGHT
CLOSE on a terrified face.
The face belongs to EDDIE, a 20 year old runner for a drug
gang.
His head is pressed tight against a brick wall.
His
nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise.
EDDIE
I'll get it!
I promise!
I'll ...
A fist slams into Eddie's face.
WIDER ANGLE REVEALS -
An alley.
Eddie is being held against the wall by two
uniformed COPS, one in his 40's, one in his 20's.
The elder
cop has just punched Eddie in the face.
ELDER COP
Don't promise me shit, you little fuck!
You know what your promise is worth to
me?
Huh?
Fifty per cent of fuck-all!
YOUNGER COP
Give him the money, Eddie.
EDDIE
I don't ...
A big back-handed slap from the Elder Cop.
YOUNGER COP
Give him the money, Eddie.
EDDIE
Just listen to me, Please!
I ...
The Elder Cop gut-punches him and Eddie doubles up.
ELDER COP
I'm done listening, shit-brain!
Where
you been all day?
They shut the school?
Kindergarten closed?
No customers?
Huh?
Huh?
YOUNGER COP
Give him the money, Eddie.
Tell ya, I'm
gonna puke if he beats on you any more.
Just give him the ...
The Younger Cop pauses, looking beyond them down the alley as a
long black shadow falls over them.
80
YOUNGER COP
... money.
What the ... ?
The Elder Cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up.
Standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light
coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead.
ELDER COP
(Calm. Expecting obedience)
You, fuckoff.
He turns back to Eddie.
ELDER COP
Get your head outta your stinkin' ass
and look at me, boy.
YOUNGER COP
(still looking down alley)
Hey ...
Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action.
Elder Cop shoves Eddie away.
ELDER COP
(to Eddie)
Get lost.
Eddie doesn't waste time with questions.
He's gone.
The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead.
Pinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black
shape moving forward.
ELDER COP
I have the distinct impression I told
you to fuckoff.
Unless I miss my guess,
you've just disobeyed an officer of the
law.
Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley.
PINHEAD
I am the Law.
Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them
instinctively drawing their guns.
And both instinctively
beginning to back up.
ELDER COP
You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and
you're about to dead meat.
81
PINHEAD
I am the son of eternal night and you
are about to discover pain has no
ending.
Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
law.
Both cops fire their guns.
Once.
Twice.
Three times.
Pinhead keeps walking.
He spits out the bullets that his body
has absorbed.
YOUNGER COP
Oh shh ...
They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run
down the alley.
And then stop short.
There is a sudden wall
of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet.
The cops turn, terrified, to look back.
Instinctively, they
spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls.
The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.
He glances
up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.
No.
Too high.
Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command.
Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
speed and force.
The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.
The ladder
smashes right through his body, impaling him.
His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped
around the ladder.
Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
ELDER COP
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly.
PINHEAD
Curb your tongue.
The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily.
His
movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
fight what his body is trying to do.
Pinhead's head moves through various positions.
His face is
calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new-
found skills.
82
The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
from his belt.
His eyes show terror.
Everything else is beyond his control.
He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open.
His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes.
The fear in his eyes increases.
He moves the open cuff over his tongue.
He's making panicked
moaning noises as if trying to scream.
SLAM!
He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue!
And SCREAMS (as best he can).
Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes
another commanding gesture with his head.
A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
other cuff.
The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along
the alley into the blackness.
The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.
CITY STREETS, NEAR CLUB
NIGHT
A Paramedic is attempting to hold Joey back.
In the distance
behind them is the wreckage of the club.
They are standing
near the alley into which Doc's camera disappeared.
JOEY
But I have to see him!
I'm his friend!
PARAMEDIC
Lady, trust me!
You really don't want
to go ...
But Joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into
the alley.
And pulls to a horrified stop.
JOEY
No!
NO!!
REVERSE ANGLE - JOEY'S POV
83
The scene is well-lit by Police emergency lights.
It is taped
off by yellow DO NOT CROSS banners.
Paramedics and cops stand
around in various states of shock or disgust.
In the middle of it all is Doc.
Quite dead.
The body is kneeling up, its cold hands resting on its lap and
holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders.
The
camera has been shoved deep between the corpse's shoulder
blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face.
CLOSE on Joey's devastated face.
INNER-CITY CHURCH
NIGHT
An establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill.
