    Jammer and his squad of NCP Officers come around a corner and 
  stop.  Jammer swallows nervously, settles himself and gives a 
    salute to someone o.c.  REVEAL BROTHER CAVIL, who mockingly 
    returns the salute.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                You understand your orders, 
                  Captain?  Everything clear?

                                JAMMER
                  Yes, sir.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Good.  
                        (beat)
                  Don t worry.  We have your back.

    REVEAL a PLATOON OF CENTURIONS standing to one side.  Jammer 
  looks at the mechanized soldiers and nods grimly.

  Cavil hands Jammer a LIST of names.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  These are the names.

                                JAMMER
                      (off list)
                I, uh... I know some of these 
                  people.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                I m sure you do. 

                                JAMMER 
                      (to his men)
                  Okay.  Suit up.

  They each pull out a BLACK SKI MASK and pull it over their 
    faces, obscuring their features.  Cavil watches with sympathy 
  as Jammer fumbles with his mask for a moment.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                      (re: mask)
                  That won t be necessary much

  Their weapons at the ready, Jammer s squad YANKS OPEN a tent 
  flap and bursts inside.  


  The NCP and Cylon forces are leaving in their trucks as Tyrol 
  walks through his neighborhood.  He hears the sound of his 
  baby CRYING as he comes up to the entrance of his tent.  He 
    rushes inside, then comes back out again with his child in 
  his arms.  He looks after the trunks --

  But Tyrol is trying to convince himself more than his son 
  that everything s really going to be all right...

  Tyrol is meeting with GAETA somewhere in the city.

                                TYROL
                  Why d they pick her up?  She hasn t 
                  done anything!  We ve got a baby, 
                for gods  sakes!

                  out.  

                                TYROL
                How long will she be held?

                                GAETA
                  Detention s run by a separate 
                  ministry, they don t give us the 
                  reasons why they detain any --

                For gods  sake, Felix!  She hasn t 
                  done anything!  We have a son!  

                                GAETA 
                  I know, Galen.  I m sorry.  

                                TYROL 
                How can you do this?  How do you 
                  help them day after day?  How do 
                you look yourself in the mirror...?

  Tyrol suddenly realizes just how pointless this conversation 
  has become.  He turns to leave.

                  Yeah, see if you can do something.  

  Tyrol EXITS and Gaeta lets out a long breath.


    Jammer, in civvies, walking down the road, his hands deep in 
  his pockets.  He sees a piece of PAPER blown across the 
    road...


    Jammer licks his lips, doesn t want to think about this, 
  can t help himself...


    Jammer has trouble breathing, has to stop and put his hands 
  on his knees...


    Jammer hyperventilating in the road.


    Jammer looks up to see Tyrol standing next to him, a 
    concerned look on his face.  It s apparent that Tyrol has no 
  idea that Jammer is with NCP.

                                JAMMER
                  Yeah... yeah, I m okay, Chief.  

  Tyrol nods, gets ready to head off.  Jammer watches him for a 
  beat, then finds himself offering up:

                                  JAMMER(cont d)
                  Hey, I uh... I heard about last

                  Yeah, well... some of those guys 
                who joined up -- I bet they got in 
                  over their heads.  Especially now, 
                  with these suicide bombings... but 
                at first, they probably thought 
                  they were doing a good thing, you 
                  know?  Get the Cylons off the 
                  streets, let us police our own -- 
                  probably sounded like a good idea 
                at the time.

                  I don t know.  She hasn t done a

                  Gaeta and he doesn t know squat -- 
                or so he says.

                                JAMMER
                  Gaeta s a good guy, if he says he--

                                TYROL
                  He s a frakking collaborator.  When 
                  this is all over -- and believe me, 
                  someday it is gonna be over -- guys 
                  like Gaeta are gonna be strung up 
                and you and me are gonna be right 
                  there tying the knots and making em

                                JAMMER
                  Yeah.  

  Tyrol heads off, leaving Jammer to deal with his guilt and his 
  fear all alone.  He looks around the city, suddenly feeling 
    vulnerable, and then heads away, keeping his head down.

    Jammer looks tired, drawn.  Across the courtyard he sees 
    BOOMER and CAPRICA SIX walking toward one of the entrances.  
  He turns to an NCP sergeant.

    Jammer heads toward the two Cylons.

                  I know.  But we have to present an 
                  alternative -- another way to send

                  list.

    Boomer s surprised, not sure how to react...


    A SECURITY CHECKPOINT against a large compound.  TWO Masked 
  NCP Guards are checking ID s on a few humans before they pass 
    through the checkpoint and go into the compound.  A WOMAN 
    casually walks up to the checkpoint, waves at the Guards and 
  tries to pass through.  Guard #1 waves her off, tries to stop 
  her.  Suddenly the WOMAN SHOOTS Guard #1 and bolts past the 
    checkpoint and into the compound just beyond as Guard #2 
    reacts a second too late and tries to shoot at her.  Then -- 
  AN EXPLOSION from within the compound ERUPTS and BLOTS OUT

  piece of wood, but actually keeping a close eye out as people 
  move back and forth through the area.


  Tyrol and Anders are going over a hand-transcribed message 
  with Tigh.

                                TYROL
                  Tomorrow, Galactica s sending a 
                  Raptor, a few Marines and a ground 
                  liaison officer to brief us on the 
                  rescue plan and coordinate our evac 
                  plans with them.

                                TIGH
                  I ll be damned... it s really 
                  happening.  Who s the liaison 
                  officer?

                                TIGH
                  I hope that s your idea of a joke.

                                TYROL
                  Nope.  The Admiral s given her a 
                  uniform and a billet.  She s a 
                  serving officer now -- which is 
                  more than you can say about us, 
                  technically.

  Tigh shakes his head for a moment.

                                TIGH
                Old Man s lost his mind.  All 
                  right.  Where s the rendezvous?

                                TYROL 
                  They left it up to us.

  He takes out a folded MAP of the surrounding area from his 
    pocket and starts to go over the markings with Tigh.

                                ANDERS (cont d)
                If they Jump into Breeder s Canyon 
                out here in the southern range, 
                  they probably won t get picked up --

    Suddenly there s a BANG-BANG from outside.  Tigh moves to 
  peer through the flap --  sees Ellen is standing outside, 
    waiting patiently by the Man guarding the entrance.  Tigh 
  picks up a CUP and BANGS once on the tent pole and Ellen is 
    cleared to ENTER.

  She gives Tyrol and Anders a quick smile.

                                ELLEN
                Hi, guys.

  Ellen busies herself in the tent, but she s also nervously 
    listening to every word and surreptitiously watching the map 
    discussion.

                  Gotta be sure... may be the most 
                  important meeting we re ever gonna 
                  have.

  That registers on Ellen s face... she doesn t want to do 
  this, but Cavil s words echo in her ears.  She takes a deep 
    breath...

                I m sure.  This is the place.  
                  Cylons ll never find em up here.

                                TIGH
                  Okay.  Gimme the map.  You got the 
                  message memorized?  All the 
                  wireless freqs?  Then gimme the 
                  message too.

  Tigh reaches out for his cane, starts to drag himself to his 
  feet -- but Ellen moves to him quickly.

                                ELLEN
                  I ll do it, Saul.  Don t get up.

                                TIGH
                  Thanks.

  She takes the message and the map, turns her back to them and 
  then leans down to OPEN the TRAP on the small STOVE in the 
  tent.  Out of their sight, she tosses in the message, but 
    POCKETS the MAP inside her clothes.


  NCP OFFICERS are moving through the streets...


  Gaeta is surreptitiously planting a copy of the death list 
  and a note in a hidden place among the garbage.  He walks 
  away quickly, heading for...


  Gaeta is walking fast, but trying not to draw attention as he 
    rounds a corner and stops.  JAKE the dog is still there, but 
    before he can reach him, Gaeta sees the TRUCKS and NCP 
    officers moving through the streets, rounding people up -- 
  he s too late.

    Anders is leading a group of INSURGENTS through the forest.

    D Anna is confronting Boomer as a long LINE OF DETAINEES are 
    marched out of the building in the b.g. and loaded into the 
  backs of TRUCKS parked just inside the blast wall.

                                BOOMER
                  Killing Tyrol s wife will only embitter 
                him against us.  He s the head of the 
                  labor union -- an organized faction 
                  that could cause us real trouble if 
                  they took to the streets.

                                D ANNA
                  Boomer, let s be honest with one 
                  another.  This isn t about Cally.  
                In your view, there s no reason to 
                  kill any of them, right? 

                                BOOMER
                  Right.

                                D ANNA
                  We ve made a decision, Boomer.  All 
                of us.

                  Just like when we listened to you 
                and Caprica Six and came here to 
                  start what we all hoped would be a 
                new chapter in human/Cylon 
                  relations.  What s the human saying 
                  about wishes and horses...?

                                BOOMER
                  This has nothing to do with whether 
                or not we execute Cally.

                                D ANNA
                No one enjoys the thought of mortal 
                  death, Boomer.  But she did try to 
                  murder you.  Maybe this is God s 
                  justice...

    D Anna walks away just as the doors SLAM shut on the TRUCKS 
  and they MOVE OUT.  Boomer looks up just in time to see Cally 
    herded into a TRUCK along with the other detainees.


    Anders and his men are hidden in the trees, awaiting the 
    rendezvous.  Suddenly they hear:

                                SHARON S VOICE
                Go Panthers!

    Anders grins, it s the right code phrase and he gives the 
    counter-sign.

                  C-Bucks rule!

    Anders and his men break cover and walk out into the open -- 
  at the same time, Sharon walks out alone toward them.

                                SHARON
                  Hey, Sam.  Been a while.

                                ANDERS
                  Funny.  I feel like I see you every 
                  day.


  The truck with Laura and Zarek has stopped on a desolate 
    plain, far from prying eyes.  Jammer comes up to Brother 
    Cavil.  Other NCP Officers wait in the b.g.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                      (to Jammer)

                few minutes.

                  Yes, sir.

    Jammer pulls his mask down over his face and OPENS the back 
  of the truck.

                                Jammer (cont d)
                  Everybody out!  Five minute rest

    Sharon is meeting up with the rest of Anders  group.

                                ANDERS
                  We ll wait until nightfall before 
                we go back into the city... there s 
                  a system of tunnels we re using 
                  that run-- 

                                SHARON
                You hear that?

    Everyone is instantly on guard and scanning the surrounding 
  area -- and suddenly MACHINE GUN FIRE comes roaring out of 
  the trees, cutting down men and women left and right.  Sharon 
  and Anders dive for cover --


  The detainees are jumping down out of the Truck.  Cally is 
  one of the last ones out, and (masked) Jammer pulls her 
    aside.  Some CENTURIONS are moving about.

                                JAMMER
                  You.  Over here.

  Cally doesn t resist as Jammer pulls her over to the opposite 
  side of the truck, out of sight from the rest of them.

                                JAMMER (cont d)
                        (low)
                  Run.

  Cally looks at him in confusion -- did he just say that?

                                JAMMER (cont d)
                        (urgent, low)
                  Run.  Don t look back.  Go.

  She doesn t need to be told a third time.  She bolts for the 
    treeline and freedom.    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 47.




  Laura and Zarek are standing with the rest of the group of 
  human prisoners, getting a little fresh air and stretching 
    aching bodies.  The NCP Officers and the Centurions watch 
  from a short distance away.

                                ZAREK
                  Tell me something, Laura.  Last 
                  year -- you tried to steal the 
                  election, didn t you?

                                LAURA
                  Yes, I did, Tom.

                                ZAREK
                  I wish you d gone through with it.

                                LAURA
                Me too.

    There s a brief moment where they grin at each other... and 
  then they hear a MECHANICAL SOUND and turn to see --

  THE CENTURIONS

  Are standing in a line.  It s a firing squad.  They turn 
  their hands into WEAPONS and point them right at the human 
    prisoners --

  LAURA & ZAREK

  React in shock.  

  CALLY

    Running like hell.  Suddenly we hear the o.c. SOUND OF 
    MACHINE GUN FIRE, and Cally is KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --

                                                                FADE TO BLACK.
