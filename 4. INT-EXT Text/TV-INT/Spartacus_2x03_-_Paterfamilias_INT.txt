  FOLLOW Melitta as she escorts Oenomaus and Gannicus through 
  the villa. A tense silence hangs between the three, all 
  weighing thoughts of how their lives have forever changed.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                (finally; to 
                                  Gannicus)
                        The primus. To gain such position, 
                        Varus must truly have been 
                        impressed by your prowess. As am I.

  Gannicus awkwardly dismisses the praise.

                                        GANNICUS
                      It was nothing.

  An unintentional slight, but it stings Melitta nonetheless.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It is a great honor. For yourself, 
                        and this ludus.

  They arrive at the door leading down into the ludus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Both of you bring honor to this 
                        ludus. Each in his own way.

  Melitta signals to the GUARD to open the door. She turns to 
  Gannicus, quiets her nerves best she can.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                        I would have private word with my 
                        husband.

  Gannicus glances at Melitta, barely manages a nod to 
  Oenomaus before exiting. Oenomaus frowns, picking up on his 
  discomfort.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Did you note how he could scarce 
                        meet my eye?

  Melitta tenses, heart in her throat.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                      He must now heed my commands, and 
                        does not embrace it. Will the other 
                        men share sentiment towards my 
                         honored  position?

  Melitta sees that he doesn t suspect Gannicus  true reason. 
  Covers to ensure it remains that way.

                                          MELITTA
                      It is his position that stirs 
                        troubled thoughts. He sets mind to 
                        the primus. As you must to training 
                        the men.

  She sees the pain in his eyes.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        I know this is not what you wished 
                        for.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Yet here I stand. Elevated.

                                          MELITTA
                      As you deserve.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        For taking a life? For betraying 
                        hand that forged the man before 
                        you?

                                          MELITTA
                        There was no betrayal in what you 
                        did. Some acts cannot be avoided, 
                        when stripped of choice.

  She bites back her own guilt, barely concealing it.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        Now turn thoughts from unfortunate 
                        past. We must look towards days to 
                        come, and embrace them.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A task made less difficult, with 
                        you among them.

  He kisses her deeply, heads down to the ludus. OFF Melitta, 
  eyes welling with hot tears of shame...



  Batiatus shouts to the heavens, a cup of wine in hand.

                                        BATIATUS
                      At last, the gods remove cock from 
                        ass!

  POP WIDE to find he s with Lucretia and Gaia in the 
    curtained-off area. Naevia and Diona fill their cups. 
  Melitta stands a fair distance behind, nods for Naevia and 
  Diona to join her.

                        The House of Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus -- rises to the fucking 
                        heavens! Soon my champions will be 
                        carved in stone, towering above all 
                        who came before. And Gannicus will 
                      be the first of them after fucking 
                        victory in the primus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A position not gained absent aid.

  She smiles at Gaia with appreciation and love.

                                        GAIA
                        I offered naught but introduction. 
                        And a few selective words of 
                          suggestion...

                                        BATIATUS
                        You could wile the Goddess Laverna 
                        herself! Your place in this will 
                        not pass without much fucking 
                        gratitude.

                                        GAIA
                        The kind I favor most...

  She slides a hand across Lucretia s lap with a wry, 
  salacious smile. Batiatus laughs.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Has a man ever been so blessed?

  He kisses Lucretia passionately, fueled by wine and triumph. 
  She responds, hungry for his touch. His hand finds its way 
  to Gaia as he kisses Lucretia. Gaia responds with a laugh, 
  undoing her dress.

  MELITTA

  escorts Naevia and Diona out, closing the curtains behind 
  her. Passions rise, clothes fall. Gaia pours wine over her 
  breasts with a smile. Batiatus and Lucretia attend to it 
  with willing tongue.

                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Quintus.

  Batiatus whirls in shock and horror.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

                        Father...?

  REVERSE to find TITUS LENTULUS BATIATUS looming. A stricken 
  Melitta stands by the curtain. Titus is a stern, elderly man 
  in his 60s. The anti-Batiatus: honest, accepts his station, 
  and has gained respect from those above it.

                                        TITUS
                        Gather yourself. I would have 
                        words.

  Titus sweeps out. OFF Batiatus, the gods fucking him once 
  again...



  ON Titus, seated at the desk, reviewing the ledgers. 
  Batiatus enters, hastily adjusting his robes. A long beat as 
  Titus ignores him. Batiatus stands silent, stripped of his 
  sure-footed demeanor in the presence of his father.

                                        TITUS
                                  without looking up)(
                        I leave this house in your care, 
                        and this is what greets me upon 
                        return?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I was not expecting your arrival.

  Titus finally looks at him.

                                        TITUS
                      Am I to announce myself to the 
                        walls that I own?

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of course not. Yet if I had known 
                      of your return from Sicilia --

                                        TITUS
                        The knowledge would have produced 
                        what result? Flowers and scented 
                        oils laid to meet me, masking sight 
                      of a son gone to shit?

                        I but celebrate.

                        Upon what cause? Angering Tullius 
                        with refusal of reasonable offer? 
                        Your exclusion from the games?

                      my name in regard, and would see me 
                        well informed. Good Solonius 
                        counted among them.

                        Nothing with a man such as Tullius 
                      is ever minor. A fact obvious to 
                        the simplest of minds.

  Batiatus simmers, barely holding his tongue.

                        Then it is a blessing a greater one 
                        than mine has arrived.

  Titus sighs, softening.

                        I bluster, when soft breeze would

                      My frustration is more with myself. 
                        You never wished for this. The 
                        ludus, gladiators, the blood, the 
                        sand. Your eyes were always towards 
                        the horizon, to glories and 
                        triumphs forever out of reach of a

                        And yet here I stand. A lanista. 
                        Like my father.

                                  a beat, sadly)(
                        No. Not like him at all. You have 
                        never been able to look into the 
                        eyes of a man, and gauge his true 
                        heart.

                        Only days past, I looked into the 
                        eyes of Quintilius Varus. And 
                         gauged  way to secure the primus 
                      in his games.

  Titus eyes him, more suspicious than surprised.

                                        TITUS
                        Varus has never employed a lanista 
                        not blessed by Tullius. Why now 
                        break tradition?

                                        BATIATUS

                        The man is a jest, inciting more 
                        laughter than awe. Now I find him 
                        desired by half of Rome?

                        Much has changed in your absence.

  Titus considers that, a sadness creeping into his eyes over 
  the state of his son.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        would review my men, and see how 
                        they have fared, denied proper 
                        guidance.

  He exits, not waiting for a reply. Batiatus seethes as he 
  follows, WIPING US TO --

                        Very well. I will be a vision of 
                        demure obedience and propriety.

  Lucretia shoots her a look as Titus enters. Batiatus trails

  Lucretia forces a smile. Gaia swoops in.

  Titus stares at her. Gaia laughs uncomfortably, reintroduces 
  herself.

                        Perhaps you do not recall me. Gaia,

                        faded. Quintus.

  Titus heads off for the ludus. Batiatus hisses to Lucretia 
  and Gaia.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We must prove this fucking house in

                        quick return to Sicilia.

  Batiatus heads after his father. Gaia sips her wine, fumes.

  OFF Lucretia, deeply disturbed by the turn of events...



  Titus pours a cup of water.

                                        TITUS
                        Many regrets haunt a man, as life 
                        draws nearer its end.

  He offers the cup to Oenomaus, who s clearly in awe of the 
  mentor seated before him. Titus smiles sadly, filling his 
  own cup.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Being too ill to witness your 
                        battle with Theokoles in Pompeii 
                        counted deeply among them. A fight 
                      of legend, I have been told.

  Oenomaus frowns, not holding the match in the same regard.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A defeat of equal proportion.

                                        TITUS
                        Defeat? You did not lose.

                        has brought honor to this house. As 
                        you have always done.

  Titus eyes him in surprise.

                        Are you not pleased with elevation

                        Give command, and I would gladly 
                        release title in favor of sword and 
                        shield.

  Titus regards Oenomaus, sees the longing in his eyes.

                                        TITUS
                        Words I am reluctant to speak. The 
                        Doctore is second in importance 
                        only to the lanista himself. I 
                        chose Ulpius many years ago. This 
                        ludus was his beating heart. The 
                        stilling of it is unfortunate news 
                      -- tempered by you assuming his 
                        place. The sole decision my son has 
                        made that I find agreeable.

  Oenomaus fills with regret, knowing how the promotion was 
  obtained.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It is a position I am not worthy to 
                        hold.

                                        TITUS
                        There are none more so. From the 
                        moment I laid eyes in that awful 
                        place, I knew. That wild boy, so 
                        filled with rage and hate, would 
                        grow into the man I see before me. 
                      We have traveled a great distance 
                        together, Oenomaus. I would finish 
                      my journey comforted by thought of 
                        you maintaining honor within these 
                        walls. A comfort I am certain your 
                        wife will share, knowing you will 
                        not die beyond them.

  Oenomaus nods, disappointed yet deeply affected by Titus  
  belief in him. OFF Oenomaus, struggling to accept his 
  fate...                                                                                    16.



  Melitta removes Lucretia s robes, readying her for bed.

                        could imagine. He will see this, 
                        and bitter tongue will turn to 
                        praise.

                        have it betray him so.

  His anger gives way to the hurt of his father s 
    disappointment in him.

                        You recall my associate, Vettius?

                                        TITUS
                        Vettius? You were but a child last 
                        I knew. How the years flee from us. 
                        How fares your father?

                                          VETTIUS
                        Dead.

  Vettius eyes Batiatus coldly, wishing him the same fate.

                                        TITUS
                        Oh. Apologies. How terrible.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The boy is ill-starred acquaintance 
                      to such misfortunes. Why only days 
                        past he was set upon in our own 
                        streets, on way to appointment with 
                        Quintilius Varus.

  Tullius glances at Batiatus, suspicions stirring. Batiatus 
  avoids the gaze, squirming.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The same man who, absent Vettius  
                        presence, managed to find way to 
                        your ludus --

  Vettius erupts out of his seat, accusing Batiatus.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Where this fucking cock eater stole 
                        the primus from me!

                                          TULLIUS

                        Reclaim your chair.

  Vettius reluctantly obeys. Titus fumes at his son.

                                        TITUS
                        How do you answer this?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He accuses absent cause. My wife 
                        and her friend Gaia came upon good 
                        Varus in town, baking under noon-
                        day sun.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Gaia?

                                        BATIATUS
                        She knew Varus from her days in 
                        Rome, offered respite at my villa 
                        while he waited for the absent boy 
                      to come to purpose. A fortunate 
                        coincidence for all involved.

                                          VETTIUS
                        And was it this same fortune that 
                        saw me set upon by your fucking

                        street.

  Batiatus whirls in surprise at the command, starts to 
  protest.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Go. And leave reasonable men to 
                        discourse.

  Batiatus fumes as he complies, glaring at Vettius as he 
  exits. Vettius sees him off with a smug smile.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Your son has much to learn in the 
                        ways of diplomacy.

                        A subject all young men struggle to 
                        master.

  Tullius laughs, pouring wine.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Come then. Let us school them in 
                        its ways.

  OFF Titus, forcing a smile in reply, knowing his next words 
  must be chosen with deadly care...



  VARUS waits with COSSUTIUS, a wealthy, handsome Roman in his 
  30s. ATTENDING SLAVES accompany. Diona waits with them. 
  Lucretia and Gaia enter, Melitta and Naevia trailing.

                        from Rome to celebrate the Vinalia. 
                        After I extolled the virtues of the 
                        house of Batiatus --

                        Oh. How disappointing.

                                        GAIA
                        Yet we could remove ourselves to 
                        the balcony for proper viewing of 
                        his gladiators until his return.

  Varus and Cossutius share a look, laugh uncomfortably.

                                        VARUS
                        I fear you mistake intent. I was 
                        not regaling Cossutius with tales 
                      of your men. But of your house s 
                        more... intimate delights.

  Varus  gaze falls on Melitta. Lucretia laughs nervously.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I fear that was a... special 
                          consideration.

  Varus  smile fades.

                                        VARUS
                        Was it? Perhaps Vettius will be 
                        more accommodating then. Concerning 
                        this and my primus.

  Lucretia squirms. Gaia intercedes.

                                        GAIA
                      It would be unfortunate to come so 
                        far, and find hands empty.
                                (pointedly, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                        Would it not?

  Lucretia shifts, realizing they will lose the primus if she 
  doesn t relent.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would not have it so.

  Melitta s heart sinks.

  Cossutius grins at Varus. Varus laughs.

                        paired with a slave yet 
                          untouched...?

  Lucretia indicates Naevia and Diona. They glance at each 
  other nervously, but with an air of excitement that they 
  have caught the eye of a rich, handsome Roman.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Untouched?

  Cossutius  eyes crawl over them. Melitta tenses, concern 
  shifting from herself to her young charges.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        A delicacy no longer present at the

                        yourself in ours.

  OFF Lucretia s forced smile...



  A sweaty, dirt-caked Gnaeus stands for inspection. Cossutius 
  eyes him with Varus. Lucretia, standing with Gaia and 
  Melitta, barely conceals her distaste for the choice.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Are you certain you would not

                      He stands perfect towards his 
                        cause.

  His attention shifts to Naevia and Diona. Their excitement 
  has been considerably dimmed by the introduction of Gnaeus.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        I would, however, gauge the 
                        freshness of your offerings.

  Lucretia forces a smile, nods to Naevia and Diona.

  Naevia and Diona shyly comply. Gaia grins, titillated by the 
  whole unseemly affair. Varus laughs in appreciation at their 
  young bodies.

                        They are of a form. But a woman s 
                        worth is not always revealed to the 
                        eyes. A man must probe deeper for 
                        true value...

  His hands drift below FRAME. Naevia and Diona wince as he 
  fingers them. Sympathetic tears well in Melitta s eyes. 
  Lucretia whispers to her, worrying over the time.

                                        LUCRETIA

  Melitta casts a worried look to Naevia and Diona as she 
  goes. Cossutius smiles, steps away to address Lucretia.

  Cossutius  smile widens, his eyes dancing. OFF DIONA, her 
  own eyes filling with fear...

  PRE-LAP: Stifled CRIES coupled with animalistic GRUNTS...



  A filthy Gnaeus is on top of Diona, grinding into her. She 
  fixes her eyes on the CEILING, attempting to block the pain. 
  ADJUST to find Cossutius watching them.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Move on top of him.

  Diona obeys, straddles Gnaeus. Winces as he roughly 
  penetrates her. Cossutius circles them, his eyes studying 
  Diona s face. Absorbing her pain and revulsion. He whispers 
  to her, soft and gentle.

                        shit hot upon his breath?

  Diona shakes her head, biting back the tears. Cossutius 
  disrobes as he answers...

                        the grotesque. And the divine. They 
                        exist together, two sides of a 
                        coin. You cannot have one... absent 
                        threat of the other. Yet words do 
                        not convey the true nature of this. 
                      It must be experienced. It must be 
                        felt...

  He climbs up on the bed behind her while Gnaeus continues 
  fucking her.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        And never forgotten.

  He enters her anally. She cries out, caught between Gnaeus 
  and Cossutius. OFF Diona s anguish...



  Gaia lounges beside Varus, flirting. Lucretia sits nearby, 
  anxiously awaiting an end to Cossutius  visit before Titus 
  returns. Naevia pours wine, barely hiding her own growing 
  anxiety for Diona.

                                        VARUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Your absence has been missed in 
                        Rome since your husband s passing. 
                        Your charms could brighten darkest 
                        night.

                                        GAIA
                        I long to return. And crest dawn 
                        upon a husband yet of this world.

  Varus considers that with a noncommittal smile.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

                        How does your dowry stand? I was 
                        under impression you were absent 
                        family of means.

  That catches Gaia by surprise. She sputters to answer. 
  Lucretia intercedes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia is a treasure within herself.

                        One to be coveted. By a man 
                        untethered to the burden of 
                        position and appearance.

  Gaia forces a smile to hide the sting of that. Cossutius 
  appears, bringing welcome distraction.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Cossutius. You were well satisfied?

                        Praise laid upon your house has not 
                        been exaggerated.

                                        VARUS
                      It is a wonder. Such base diversion 
                        would be impossible to conceal in 
                        Rome.

  Lucretia s smile tightens.

                        Capua is city of many pleasures.

                          A regrettable necessity. Gratitude 
                        for your hospitality. I look 
                        forward to seeing you at the games. 
                        And your man Gannicus upon the 
                        primus.

  Lucretia presents a genuine smile. Mission accomplished.

  Lucretia and Gaia escort them out. Diona returns, absently 
  adjusting her robe. She locks eyes with Naevia. She looks 
  away, the hot flush of shame staining her cheeks. OFF 
  Naevia, her heart constricting for her friend...



  Barca and Auctus move through the barracks. A small clutch 
  of men play bones and dice in the background.

                                        AUCTUS
                        Crixus begins to show promise.

                        You would but try, you oaf.

  Auctus smacks Barca in the face. Barca reacts with a laugh, 
  exchanges mock blows. Auctus grabs Barca roughly and kisses 
  him. Barca returns it, hands exploring, passions rising. 
  They half tumble into their cell. But Auctus pulls away, 
  eyes widening as he sees

  SEVERAL PIGEONS

  shock turning to rage...                                                                                    37.



  Gnaeus snatches a PARCHMENT from a disappointed Rhaskos. The 
  other men crowd and jockey to get their hands on the list.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  Auctus grabs the list, growls at what he sees.

  Crixus approaches, having overheard.

                        spear.

  Auctus slams the list into Crixus  chest as he exits with 
  Barca. Gannicus eyes him with a frown.

  Auctus HOWLS from inside, delighted by his lover s prowess. 
  PUSH THROUGH the bars and past Auctus to find Crixus sitting 
  alone. Silent and focused, recounting the bruises on his 
  body. And the lessons they imparted. Oenomaus approaches 
  with an old helmet and Murmillo octopus shield (from season 
  1).

                        years. For the blood and the sand, 
                        the roar of the crowd. It lifts 
                        spirits more than change of clime 
                        could hope to offer. No, I will 
                        stay at your side, and together we 
                        shall see the House of Batiatus 
                        rise to former glories.

  Batiatus covers his disappointment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You remain here?

                                        TITUS
                        Until breath flees wearied flesh, 
                        calling me to the afterlife.

  Titus exits with a warm smile. OFF Batiatus, his own smile 
  fading as he realizes he is once again condemned to live in 
  the overpowering shadow of his father...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
