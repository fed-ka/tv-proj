The small yellow plane veers left.
Clears a mountain top and
gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.
The green
of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock
of the beaches.
Enormous.
A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.
Halibut
Fishing Capital of the World!
PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,
corrugated building.
The "airport."
Nothing else for miles
around.
A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.
Brakes
SCREECHING.
A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.
About 23.
Petite with
short, brown hair.
Peers up at the sky.
Brightens at the sight of the BUSH
PLANE coming in for landing.
Smooths down her down vest.
Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.
Nervous.
Excited.
OLD MAN (O.S.)
Eleanor?
ELLIE BURR turns.
Shields her eyes from the sun.
An OLD MAN
hosing down the side of the building.
ELLIE
Hey, Mr. Angstrom!
MR. ANGSTROM
What're you doing here?
Ellie puffs up.
ELLIE
Police business.
MR. ANGSTROM
Police business?
The old man screws up his face, confused.
MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)
Didn't you used to baby-sit for us?
ELLIE
I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.
Just made detective three weeks ago.
A CAT jumps down off the roof.
Angstrom sprays it.
MR. ANGSTROM
Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at
the station.
Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.
Turns back to THE
ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.
Coming to
a stop.
She hurries over as the door swings open and...
WILL DORMER steps down.
Slipping on his sunglasses.
Scanning the nothingness around him.
Spots the swinging
sign.
WILL
"Halibut fishing capital of the world."
Hap, right behind him.
Rubs his neck.
HAP
This ought to be interesting.
ELLIE
(over the engine)
Detective Dormer!
They look down.
Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.
Then
his hand.
Shakes it vigorously.
ELLIE (cont'd)
It's a huge honor to meet you!
Ellie
Burr.
I'm here to take you to the
station!
Will motions to Hap.
WILL
My partner...
ELLIE
Detective Eckhart!
I know!
Welcome to
Nightmute!
She leads them away from the plane.
Takes Will's briefcase.
ELLIE
I just want to say how incredible it is
to have you working with us, Detective
Dormer.
I've followed all your cases.
Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey
Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...
Opens the back of the Jeep.
Puts the bags inside.
ELLIE (cont'd)
...And especially the Leland Street
Murders.
That was my case study at the
Academy.
The Pilot walks by.
Taps her on the shoulder.
PILOT
Tell your dad the game's gonna start late
this week, Ellie.
ELLIE
Sure thing, Spence.
She looks back at Will.
Can't help but focus in on his scar.
Touches her own smooth neck.
In awe.
ELLIE (cont'd)
That's where Ronald Langley cut you in
the basement of his father's house on 325
Leland, isn't it?
Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.
WILL
You did your homework, Officer.
ELLIE
Actually...
She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.
Out of ear-shot.
ELLIE
I just made detective three weeks ago.
The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-
storey building.
The Nightmute Police Department.
A totem
pole stands out front.
CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
Will Dormer!
Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.
FRED
We can walk from here.
He heads off across the parking lot.
Will and Hap exchange a
glance.
WILL
Guess that's what they call Alaskan
hospitality.
ELLIE (O.S.)
Don't worry about him...
They turn.
Ellie's come up behind them.
Looks over at the
hunched figure to Fred.
ELLIE (cont'd)
He's just mad 'cause you're taking over.
Fred stops up ahead.
Sees her.
Annoyed.
FRED
Ellie!
Go type something!
Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat
around his collar.
He looks out over the harbor.
Fishing
boats coming in with their early morning haul.
More halibut.
He checks his watch.
Slows to a walk.
Looks up and sees...
Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
Smiles.
Holds up some car keys.
ELLIE
Fred wants us to meet him at the
Connell's.
Ellie driving.
A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view
mirror.
Will in the passenger seat.
Wearing a crisp suit.
Ellie hands him a take-out bag.
ELLIE
Brought you a bear claw.
Just in case
you were hungry.
Will takes the bag.
Looks inside.
Yikes.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Local delicacy.
WILL
Think I'll pass.
He puts the bag on the dash.
Looks out the window.
Nightmute's main street.
A line of shops.
Undistinguished
Town Hall.
Elementary school up on a hill.
Sign out front:
Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!
WILL (cont'd)
What kind of calls you get around here?
ELLIE
Oh.
You know.
Small-time stuff.
Nothing like what you must get.
Mostly
drinking-related problems.
Domestic
abuse.
Barroom fights.
Stuff like that.
She shifts down.
Takes a steep turn.
ELLIE (cont'd)
In the summer months it's pretty quiet.
That's when there's work out on the
boats.
The rest of the year, though...
They pass a MAN walking along the road.
Gnarled walking
stick.
Ellie calls out the window.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Hey, there, Joe!
JOE waves.
They pass.
ELLIE (cont'd)
That's Joe Willy.
Took his family
hostage in November.
That was the most
exciting thing that happened last year.
I wasn't there, though.
(grinds gear)
Chief barely lets me handle anything
above a misdemeanor.
Will looks over at her.
Smiles.
WILL
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
ELLIE
But they're so boring.
All small stuff.
WILL
It's all about the small stuff.
Small
lies.
Small mistakes.
Small oversights.
People give themselves away in a traffic
violation just as much as they do in a
murder case.
It's human nature.
He looks over.
Ellie's listening intently.
WILL (cont'd)
Aren't you going to write that down?
Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...
ELLIE
Let me just...
Stops.
Looks over.
Realises Will's teasing her.
A small ranch house.
Aluminum siding.
FLOWERS piled up by
the front door.
TEDDY BEARS.
RIBBONS.
Left by well-wishers.
MRS. CONNELL (O.S.)
I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me
not to touch anything.
POV through BINOCULARS
A WOODEN CABIN comes into focus.
Right by the water.
Hasn't
been used in years.
Weathered, slate roof.
Algae growing up
the sides.
HAP (O.S.)
Nice.
Lighter than I remembered.
WILL lowers his binoculars.
He's standing on the black rocky
beach.
It's damp, slick, and cold.
A fog's rolling in.
Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.
A
couple paper bags and a megaphone.
They're comparing guns.
FARRELL
Glock 40.
All plastic save the barrel
and firing pin.
Never rusts.
What do
you carry down in Seattle?
Hap reaches into his holster.
Pulls out a...
HAP
Smith and Wesson 45.
FARRELL
Excellent!
Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.
He's got a
pair of binoculars, too.
They're staking out the cabin.
Been there a while.
ELLIE (O.S.)
Brought some coffee...
Ellie appears with a thermos.
Crouching down.
Fred turns,
annoyed.
FRED
What are you doing here?
WILL
(answering for her)
I told her to come.
Fred shoots Will a look.
Down at his cowboy boots.
Will
gives him a smile.
ELLIE
Anything yet?
WILL
FRED
Nothing.
Nothing.
Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.
FARRELL
Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.
HAP
Or goes straight to the Sports Section.
Hap and Farrell chuckle.
Hap unscrews the thermos.
A cloud
of steam.
HAP (cont'd)
Who gets first dibs?
(looks up at Will)
Will?
Will looks down at his partner.
Holding out the thermos like
a weird kind of truce.
Will turns away, rejecting it.
A
swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...
Fred tenses.
FRED
(looking through binoculars)
I see someone!
Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.
Will whips up his
binoculars.
POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to
the cabin.
Furtive.
WILL (O.S.)
That's him.
Will lowers the binoculars.
Snaps his fingers at the men.
WILL (cont'd)
Fan out.
Fred, Farrell and Hap.
Start spreading out.
Ellie steps
up.
Will looks back at her.
Too dangerous.
WILL (cont'd)
Stay here, Ellie.
ELLIE
But...
Will puts up his hand.
She stops short.
He plunges ahead.
Hap.
Will.
Farrell.
Fred.
Fanning out.
Silent.
Keeping
eye-contact.
Will points to Farrell.
Wants the megaphone.
Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.
Accidentally
keys it.
The feedback SQUAWKS.
Fuck.
FRED
He's bolting!
POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around,
running towards the cabin.
Leaping from rock to rock.
WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.
WILL
Go!
Go!
Go!
The men jump into action.
Race down towards the cabin.
Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.
Will and Hap,
harder going.
Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small
crevices.
Rocks sticking out every which way.
The fog,
thick and white...
THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.
FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.
Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...
WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.
Joins Fred
and Farrell at the door.
Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod
to Fred as he KICKS it in...
...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.
Stops short.
FOG
has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all
sound.
Like a strange dream.
Eerie.
Will blinks against the thick whiteness.
Strains to hear any
sound, anything.
There's only the distant LAPPING of the
water.
He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.
Quick, careful steps.
Stumbles over a rock.
Waves his gun
in defense.
Eyes wide open like a blind man...
SUDDENLY
a GUNSHOT.
Off to the right.
Will whips his head around.
Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound.
Reaches for her weapon...
Will heads towards the sound.
Reaching out for approaching
rocks.
Scrambles over a small bank and finds...
FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground.
Clutching his thigh.
Blood seeping through his fingers.
He
looks up.
FARRELL
Sorry about...
WILL
Where is he?
Farrell can't answer that.
WILL (cont'd)
(impatient)
Where'd the shot come from?
Farrell lifts his bloody hand.
Points off towards the water.
FARRELL
Over there.
Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.
Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few
seconds to listen, to adjust.
Heart POUNDING.
Blood
pumping.
Like an animal tracking its prey.
Leaps up onto a
plateau of rocks when...
SUDDENLY
a DARK FIGURE
flashes past him.
The killer!
Inches away.
Will wheels
around...
WILL
Freeze!
CRACK!
Squeezes off a shot.
Misses!
Can't believe it.
Goes for another... Nothing!
Jammed!
The figure,
disappearing.
Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches
behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...
Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.
A HAND
suddenly grabs her arm.
VOICE (O.S.)
Dammit, Ellie!...
Fred emerges from the fog.
FRED (cont'd)
Put that thing away!
Farrell's down!...
CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.
Fred and Ellie
freeze.
Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.
Getting closer to
the water.
Hear a voice ring out...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hap!
The fog starts to dissipate.
They reach the water to see...
WILL DORMER
kneeling beside the body of his partner.
Lying in the water.
Shot in the stomach.
Blood dribbling from his mouth.
Will
grabs him up by the collar.
WILL
Hap!
Starts shaking the limp body.
Teeth clenched.
WILL (cont'd)
Hap!
Hap's head, rolls back.
Mouth agape.
Face white...
Will, rips off his tie.
Presses it to the gaping wound...
trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the
water...
Ellie watches.
Horrified.
Fred races over to the body.
Feels for Hap's pulse.
FRED
Dormer...
Will, shaking Hap again.
Jaw set.
Eyes intense.
Veins
popping up along his temples.
Fred catches his shoulder.
FRED (cont'd)
Dormer!
He's gone.
Will looks up at Fred.
His face contorts.
Suddenly leaps to his feet.
Grabs a rock and hurls it
savagely into the thick fog.
CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...
Will driving.
Speeding.
Scenery whipping past the window.
His hands, tight around the steering wheel.
The hula-girl,
dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to
her face.
He grows suddenly pale.
Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.
Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open.
Runs
down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.
Fog everywhere.
Dense.
White.
Suffocating.
We're running through it.
Clambering over rocks.
Hearing
the sound of our own BREATHING.
Our own HEARTBEAT.
Adrenaline pumping.
An animal tracking its prey...
SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE
flashes past.
Just inches away.
Playing with us.
Taunting
us.
We whip round with our weapon and...
CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac.
PULL BACK to
reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street.
Eyes
bloodshot.
A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store.
Stop
talking and glance over at him.
A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt.
Lifts her small
KIDS into the cab of a 4x4.
Watches him pass.
AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front.
Turns
at the sound of Will's footfall.
Everyone edgy.
Cautious.
A murderer amongst them.
Will continues on.
Looking straight ahead.
Wipes the sweat
from his neck.
Slows to a stop just outside the...
LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE
A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window.
Below, a
painted sign:
We miss you, Kay.
A stack of newspapers by the front door.
The "Nightmute
Ledger."
The headline:
Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.
Will picks one up.
Stares down at it.
Rain starts to dot
the paper.
CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)
...We're going to bring down a couple of
guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to
step up the investigation here...
Back at the beach.
We see nothing but fog.
A VOICE comes
through.
ELLIE (O.S.)
...and it was at this point that Detective
Dormer headed towards the noise...
Ellie emerges from the fog.
Carrying the map and talking
into a small tape recorder.
She's climbing over the rocks,
wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.
A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.
She turns to
him.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Remember, Kepp, shoot everything...
(back to the tape recorder)
...wherein he discovered the wounded
Detective Farrell Brooks, having been
shot in the vastus externus of the upper
left thigh...
She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two
evenings before.
Finds...
ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Francis!
He looks up.
Pimples on his chin.
FRANCIS
What?
ELLIE
You're supposed to be Farrell.
Shot in
the thigh and writhing in pain.
FRANCIS
C'mon, Ellie.
What's it matter?
ELLIE
Accuracy.
That's what.
(points to the ground)
Now get down.
Francis looks up at her.
Flicks his cigarette away and gets
down amongst the rocks.
Holds his thigh like he was shot.
FRANCIS
Ow.
CLICK!
Kepp takes the picture.
Ellie sloshes through the water.
Ankles getting cold.
Cheeks pink.
But it doesn't matter.
She's investigating.
ELLIE
(into tape recorder)
...shortly after hearing the second shot,
Detective Dormer continued through the
water until he spotted the body, lying
approximately fifteen feet away.
She stops.
Looks at the map.
At the spot Will pointed out.
Looks back up.
Fog.
Clicks off the recorder.
Calls out.
ELLIE (cont'd)
You there, Rich?
A VOICE calls back.
Someone pretending to be Hap.
VOICE (O.S.)
Yeah.
And I'm freezing my nads off!
Ellie furrows her brow.
Just then...
FRANCIS appears.
Slips on a rock but catches his fall.
FRANCIS
Ellie!
Think I found something!
CLOSE ON a row of FEET.
Mostly boots.
Some more beat-up
than others.
Inching forward along a road.
WILL (O.S.)
...Anything catches your eye, you put it
in a bag.
Anything looks strange, you
put it in a bag...
PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out
across the road about a mile up the beach.
Some old, some
young.
Linking arms and moving forward.
Looking down.
The
SEARCH PARTY.
Will, walking up and down behind the line.
Talking through a
megaphone.
WILL (cont'd)
...Anything he may have dropped, moved,
kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag.
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper
clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of
ten a suspect leaves something behind...
VOICE (O.S.)
Detective?
Will turns.
A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.
BURLY GUY #1
Where do you want us?
Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.
WILL
The woods.
One group heading south, the
other heading north.
Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.
He hands the guys two
radios.
FRED
Make sure they're set to channel 6...
Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.
Young
and apple-cheeked.
The first one holding a piece of paper.
OFFICER #1
We did the interviews with all the nearby
houses like you asked.
WILL
Anything?
OFFICER #1
(shakes his head)
Here's a list of who we talked to.
Hands the list to Will.
He glances it.
WILL
Alright.
Go back and set up some follow-
ups for this afternoon.
The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.
Fred saunters
over.
Nods towards the searchers.
FRED
You don't think they should start further
back?
Will shakes his head.
WILL
He had to have exited here.
Over those
boulders.
I saw him move, he's nimble.
Would have taken the hardest way out.
Fred shrugs, skeptical.
Just then, his cell phone BLEATS.
He reaches for it.
FRED
(into phone)
Duggar...
Will looks back at the search team.
Slow.
Meticulous.
FRED (cont'd)
(into phone)
Where was it?
A local WOMAN.
At the end of the line.
Glances over her
shoulder.
Looks at Will.
Smiles.
You'll help us catch him.
FRED (cont'd)
(into phone)
Okay.
(slaps phone closed)
That was Ellie.
Will turns back to him.
FRED (cont'd)
They found Farrell's bullet.
Says it
looks like a 357.
After the autopsy Rich
can drive 'em both to the lab in
Anchorage.
Have a murder weapon by
morning.
Fred crosses his arms.
Sarcastic.
FRED (cont'd)
That is, if it's alright with you.
Thunder RUMBLING.
Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of
the Pioneer Lodge.
Jams his hands in his pockets.
The walk
of an insomniac.
Will walking down main street.
In the middle of the road.
The dead of night.
No cars.
The sky a blinding white.
Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights
flickering.
A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.
Birds SINGING.
Not day.
Not night.
Stuck somewhere in between.
Like a
dream.
Turns down a side street.
Passing more stores.
Guns and
Ammo.
Patty's Hair and Nails.
General Store.
Comes upon
THE ALLEY
where he vomited the day before.
Stops.
Sees the DEAD DOG,
still down at the end.
Half obscured by the dumpster.
Will wavers, pale.
Suddenly...
A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.
Big.
Wild-eyed.
Awakened from his sleep.
Will, quickly backtracks to the
sidewalk.
Spooked.
JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.
He turns.
In the
distance.
Nightmute Elementary School.
A Little League game in full swing.
The uniforms, a little
faded.
The diamond, a little unkempt.
A smattering of
SPECTATORS.
Mostly dads with six-packs.
Will wanders over to the fence.
Spots Ellie sitting alone on
the bottom bleacher.
CUT TO:
POV OF SOMEONE
WATCHING HIM.
From afar.
The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a
few seconds.
Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers...
CUT BACK TO:
...and sits down next to Ellie.
She turns, surprised.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Detective Dormer!
What are you doing
here?
(looks at watch)
It's two-thirty in the morning.
Shouldn't you be asleep?
Will glances out at the game.
WILL
I could say the same thing about you.
ELLIE
Oh.
We always have play-offs in the
middle of the night.
It's the best time.
WILL
Who's playing?
ELLIE
The Puffins and the Hawks.
We're in
extra innings.
The Hawks have a really
good line-up this year.
She sips on a take-out coke.
Looks back at the game.
A
plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.
Blows a bubble.
ELLIE
That's my sister.
Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss
by a mile.
Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.
ELLIE (cont'd)
(calling out)
That's okay, Lib!
(to Will)
Usually she's better.
WILL
She your only sibling?
ELLIE
(nods)
Twelve years younger.
Libby takes another swing.
Connects with the ball.
Drops
the bat and runs to first.
Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.
ELLIE (cont'd)
What about you?
You have any siblings?
WILL
No.
(rubs his eyes)
Well.
I had a brother.
He died when I
was eleven.
Ellie, sits up...
ELLIE
Oh, I shouldn't have...
WILL
It's okay.
Happened a long time ago.
He
was killed in a fire.
In New Mexico.
ELLIE
That must have been awful for you.
Will leans back.
Stretching his legs.
Remembering.
WILL
Not really.
(slight smile)
I remember I was more embarrassed that he
had died.
Embarrassed that it made me
different.
So I didn't tell the other kids
at school what had happened.
They'd ask
me where he was, where he'd gone.
And I'd
make up stories.
He was visiting an aunt up
north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a
Swiss boarding school.
Stuff like that.
(shakes his head)
Nice kid, huh?
Just kept making up more
and more lies...
Suddenly, he stops talking.
Slowly sits up.
Sensing
something.
Ellie, noticing the shift.
ELLIE
You okay?
The row of DADS behind them.
Jump up and start CHEERING.
CUT TO:
POV OF THE PERSON
WATCHING WILL.
Sees him sit up.
Look around.
That same
prickle at the back of his neck.
A KID slides home just as...
CUT BACK TO:
...Will stands.
Trying to shake the feeling.
WILL
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.
Still need to go through some of Kay
Connell's school records.
ELLIE
(unsure)
Okay.
He turns to go, scanning the area.
Ellie calls after him.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Try to get some sleep!
The Nightmute morgue.
Next morning.
A SQUAD CAR pulls up.
Francis gets out, whistling.
Starts for the morgue's
entrance.
Will in the Cherokee.
Dark circles under his eyes.
Suit
jacket wrinkled.
Pulls in next to Francis' squad car.
WILL
(calls out window)
Officer!...
Francis turns.
WILL
I'll pick it up.
You head back to the
station.
Will, heading for the Cherokee.
Clutching the box.
Face
pale, pace quick.
Everything's different now.
ELLIE (O.S.)
Detective Dormer!
He closes his eyes.
Now is not the time.
Reaches the
Cherokee.
Yanks open the driver's side door.
Ellie catches
up with him.
Out of breath.
ELLIE
You look like you're in a hurry.
I just
wanted to ask you about these pictures.
She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.
They're of the BEACH.
The ones Kepp took.
Almost all fog.
ELLIE (cont'd)
I know they're not great quality, but
this is where you said you were when you
first saw Detective Eckhart, right?
Will.
Barely glancing at them.
Tosses the box into the car.
WILL
Right.
Gets in and closes the door.
Puts his hand over the box.
Ellie comes up to the window.
ELLIE
But here's the thing.
I retraced your
exact steps according to your statement.
You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart
from there.
I mean, not in that fog.
WILL
Then change it.
ELLIE
How much closer would you say you were?
WILL
I don't remember.
ELLIE
Five feet?
Seven feet?
Will, about to seriously lose his shit.
Looks at Ellie.
Eyes dark, distant.
WILL
Listen, Ellie.
I don't have time for
this shit.
Five feet, seven feet, twenty
feet.
Put down whatever you want in your
report, alright?
He turns the ignition.
Pulls out with a SQUEAL.
Ellie
steps back, watching him drive away.
More curious than
stung.
The Cherokee.
Parked off-road.
A remote spot by the water.
The driver's side door, left open.
The PING-PING-PING of the
interior BELL.
Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront.
Aimless.
One foot
in front of the other.
Staring out at nothing.
The endless
sea.
Waves CRASHING.
Wind HOWLING.
Seagulls SCREECHING.
Everything.
Closing in on him...
He stumbles over a rock.
Grabs his head in his hands.
Stunned.
Guilty.
Ashamed.
Fucked.
He saw it.
He saw it!
A WAVE, explodes nearby.
Drenching him in sea spray.
Will turns, raking his hand across his face.
Blinking.
Eyes
stinging.
Trying to focus.
Trying to think this through...
Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.
Shakes his head.
Looks at his watch.
Got to deal with the problem at hand.
The rear of the Nightmute PD building.
Will, looking around,
heads briskly for the back door...
CLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.
Dark hair held up in two
barrettes, wind tousling the curls.
Reading from a piece of
paper.
YOUNG GIRL
...And that's how I think Kay would want
us to remember her...
PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.
PEOPLE standing
by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.
The sky's a
brilliant blue.
Red fireweeds blanket the hillside.
YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
...Swimming, reading, hiking through the
Kebaughs...
FRED, ELLIE AND WILL
stand off to the side.
Dressed in black.
Fred looks like
he's never worn a tie before.
Ellie holds a potted plant.
A
gift for the bereaved.
YOUNG GIRL (cont'd)
...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's
after school...
Will.
Eyes bloodshot.
Not really listening.
Not really
paying attention.
A thousand miles away.
Tugs at his
collar.
Feels tight.
YOUNG GIRL
...And always, always with a smile on her
face.
The young girl looks up.
Folds the paper closed.
People
SNIFFLE.
Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.
Some CHILDREN.
Start circulating with plastic buckets.
Filled with white carnations.
Handing them out.
VOICE (O.S.)
Want one?
Will, startled, looks down.
A LITTLE GIRL stands before him.
Curly hair.
Glasses.
Holding up a bucket.
He shakes his
head.
Looks back up at
THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's
casket.
AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.
Two GIRLS, look like
sisters, holding each other up.
A MAN with a thick red
beard.
A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with
a pink ribbon...
Will, looks away.
Then.
At the end of the line.
Something
catches his eye.
RANDY STETZ
in tight jeans and a down vest.
In front of him stands a
GIRL with white-blonde hair.
From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room.
Will, straightens at the sight of her.
Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass.
The service is over.
People are heading back to their cars.
Fred yanks off his tie.
Looks at Ellie.
FRED
We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.
He starts off.
Ellie, looks back at Will.
WILL
You go ahead.
I'll be there in a second.
Ellie nods.
Catches up to Fred.
Will turns his attention
back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.
Over at the far end of the
cemetery.
Standing next to Randy's motorcycle.
Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.
The girl's
about to get on behind him.
WILL (O.S.)
Why don't I give her a ride?
They look over.
WILL walking towards them.
The wind
whipping his jacket.
His tie.
Randy makes a face.
RANDY
Thought I smelled something.
WILL
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Will arrives at the bike.
The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at
him curiously.
Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost
translucent.
Something sexy about her.
Has the carnation
stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket.
TANYA
Who're you?
Fred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.
Ellie waits.
Looks over
and sees
WILL standing with Tanya and Randy.
Shifts the plant in her hands.
Will shows the gold shield on his belt.
RANDY
Fuckin' cop.
Randy kick starts the bike.
It dies.
He kicks it again.
Calls out over his shoulder.
RANDY
You coming or not?
SCREECH!
The Cherokee whips around a curve.
The Cherokee breaks free from the forest.
Racing along a
coastal road.
Water CRASHING against the rocks.
Up ahead, a LOGGING TRUCK coming the other way.
The Cherokee
shifts lanes.
Heading straight for the truck.
The gap's closing fast.
The truck BEEPS again.
The truck and the Cherokee.
On a collision course.
The
truck BEEPS wildly.
The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at
the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way...
...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery.
Gravel flying.
Will gets out.
Slams his door.
Rounds the
car and opens Tanya's door.
She's screaming at him.
TANYA
You crazy son-of-a-bitch!
You could have
killed us!
Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car.
TANYA (cont'd)
Ow!
You're hurting me!
Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates.
Pushes her down the other side.
She stumbles.
TANYA (cont'd)
You want to tell me what the fuck this is
all about?
Will stands above her, on the hill.
His face set like stone.
WILL
You and Kay were like sisters?
TANYA
That's what I said.
WILL
Told each other everything.
(heads down the hill)
That why your picture's torn up in the
top drawer of her bureau?
Tanya steps back.
WILL (cont'd)
Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on
your ass at her funeral?
He grabs her by the arm.
Jerks it up.
She CRIES out.
Will
leans in.
WILL (cont'd)
You like games, little girl?
Well how
about this one - you're standing right
where her naked body was found wrapped up
in a garbage bag.
Tanya's eyes grow wide.
She looks around her.
Disgusting,
rotten.
A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.
She
tries to break away...
TANYA
No...
WILL
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Tanya looks away.
WILL (cont'd)
Who gave her those dresses?
She struggles more.
No good.
Will's grip is like a vice.
WILL (cont'd)
I need a name.
TANYA
I don't know.
WILL
You don't know.
TANYA
She wouldn't tell me!
WILL
But you were such good friends...
Tanya, squirming.
Angry.
TANYA
It was like some big fucking secret!
WILL
What was?
TANYA
She kept saying she was gonna get out of
here.
Leave us all behind.
That he was
going to take her!
WILL
Who?
TANYA
My arm!
WILL
Who?
TANYA
She used some stupid code name.
WILL
What was it?
TANYA
Brody...I don't know...
(crying)
...Something Brody!
Will straightens.
He's heard that name before.
Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.
He CRIES out.
She breaks away from him.
Runs up the hill.
Turns.
Tears
streaking her face.
Throws the carnation to the ground.
TANYA (cont'd)
You happy now, you fucking bastard?
Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.
Trying to fight the
stinging in his eyes.
Passes a sign:
Umkumiut, 30 miles.
Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station.
Flips
through the phone book.
His finger tracing down the "B"s.
Finds it:
Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B.
Sky's become overcast.
Will stands across the street from a
pale blue building.
On the ground floor, a tackle store.
Above, looks like several apartment units.
He starts across.
CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.
Scrawled in pencil:
8:30.
Dr. Agee.
PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.
The
appointment book on the passenger seat.
Been there all night.
Insomnia.
Taking its toll.
His hair, no longer neatly
combed.
His face, pale and unshaven.
His eyes, dragged open
from fatigue.
Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.
Staring down the street at a
BRICK BUILDING on the corner.
A placard by the front door:
Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.
Will checks his watch.
Rubs his eyes with the heels of his
hands.
Suddenly.
Something tells him to look up.
A MAN
in the distance, walking along the road.
Towards Dr. Agee's.
He's in his forties.
Short, shoulders sloped.
Wears a
beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.
WALTER BYRD
has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.
Is looking down at the
road.
Glances up.
LOCKS EYES WITH WILL
Byrd, slows his pace.
Will, reaches for the door handle.
SUDDENLY
Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.
Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.
WALTER BYRD
his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.
Veers over to it.
WILL
a runner's stride.
Weaves through PEOPLE.
Closing in on
Byrd.
Sees his plan.
Cuts across the road just as...
A PICK-UP
rounds the corner.
THUMP!
Broadsides him.
Will's pitched
up and over the hood.
Falls hard on the tarmac.
Dazed for a
second.
Blood, gushing from his forehead.
Hears the PICK-UP
DOOR open...FEET running over to him.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Are you alright?
You popped out from
nowhere!
More FEET running over.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
He okay?
Will opens his eyes.
Trying to focus.
Looks up and sees, in
the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.
Will struggles to his feet.
The OLD LADY who hit him,
wearing overalls.
Reaches out.
OLD LADY
I don't think you should move.
Will stands, wavering.
Flashes her his badge.
The old lady rips along in the truck.
Will sits in the
passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.
It's soaked
with blood.
The lady looks over.
OLD LADY
You sure you're okay?
WILL
I'm fine.
OLD LADY
Careful not to bleed on my interior.
Will looks over at her.
Shifts in his seat.
Ouch.
Feels
like a couple cracked ribs.
Peers out the windshield at the
TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.
AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.
A windy
coastal road.
Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.
A FERRY at the end of the pier.
A small wooden booth for
selling tickets.
Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains
on the other side of the bay.
Nothing else for miles around.
The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.
Will jumps out.
Scans the area for Byrd.
Nothing.
Then,
sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.
Gendreau Glacier.
Spilling down between two huge mountains.
Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.
Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other
tourists.
Walter leads the way.
Hands in his pockets.
WALTER
You know this glacier moves a quarter of
an inch every day?
He points off to the horizon.
WALTER (cont'd)
And on a clear day you can see all the
way over to Newtok.
There's a beautiful
aviary over there.
We can go sometime.
Will's lip curls.
Watching him.
WALTER (cont'd)
It's actually cool for this time of year.
Normally the temperature runs about...
SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.
Walter's eyes widen in surprise
as he grabs him up by the collar.
Nose to nose.
Will barely
keeping control.
WILL
You think this is a nice meeting we're
having here?
Friendly?
Two people
getting acquainted?
(jerks him harder)
You sick, coward, fuck.
I get up every
morning of my life just to bring someone
like you down.
Beating a seventeen year-
old girl to death.
Washing her
afterwards, cleaning her.
Make you feel
like a real man?
(tightens his grip)
Huh?
Walter flounders.
WILL (cont'd)
I outta end this right now.
Take a rock
and smash your fucking skull in...
His jaws tense, nostrils flare.
Walter, red-faced,
sputtering...
WALTER
I stood right behind you...I saw you look
right into his eyes and shoot him...
Will clenches his teeth.
WALTER (cont'd)
...Seattle's great hero.
Shooting his
own partner.
I saw it all...
WILL
That was an accident!
You hear me?
I
didn't know it was him!
(shakes him hard)
I didn't know it was him!
Just then a SHRIEK.
Will looks over
A COUPLE KIDS.
Further down the glacier.
Having a snowball
fight.
Will looks back at Walter.
Has to take it easy.
Shoves him
away in disgust.
Walter falls down onto the snow.
Dislodges
his hearing aid.
Watches Will pace.
Head throbbing.
Ribs, screaming in pain.
WALTER
Then why lie about it?
Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.
Puts
it back around his ear.
WALTER (cont'd)
I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.
That's what I do in my novels.
It's my
trade you might say.
But why cover it
up?
Gets up.
Brushes the snow from his butt.
Checks something
in his pocket.
WALTER (cont'd)
You don't have to tell me if you don't
want to.
I'm sure you have some reason.
Something noble.
I have faith in that.
Looks down at the kids.
Shakes his head.
WALTER (cont'd)
They should be bundled up better.
WILL
What's your game, Byrd?
Walter turns back to him.
WALTER
No game.
WILL
The phone call.
The knapsack.
Walter shrugs.
WALTER
I figured we're partners on this one.
I
mean, after what I saw...
Will stops short.
Eyes burning.
It's all he can do not to
throttle this weed.
WILL
Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.
We are
partners on nothing.
Walter looks at him.
Scratches his head.
WALTER
I research my novels.
I know the
procedures.
You'd have cuffed me back at
the ferry.
You'd have called for back-
up, read me my rights, and gotten a
search warrant for my apartment.
You're
a well-respected detective.
There's
no reason for you to be talking to me
right now...
He takes out a handkerchief.
Blows his nose.
WALTER (cont'd)
...except that we could help each other.
Will stares at him.
WALTER (cont'd)
So.
We're at an impasse.
Will runs his hands through his hair.
Half-crazed.
Heart
pounding.
Turns to watch...
THE KIDS down the glacier.
Making angels in the snow.
Their
GIGGLES carried along by the wind.
Will, squeezes his eyes shut.
Trapped.
About to defy every
instinct in his body.
WILL
(sotto)
You're going to get a phone call.
Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.
WALTER
I'm sorry?
WILL
I said you're going to get a phone call.
WALTER
(perks up)
Oh?
WILL
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of
your books.
WALTER
Thought you might find that.
WILL
You're going to be brought in for
questioning.
Walter smiles.
Pleased.
WALTER
Down at the station?
WILL
(hisses)
Yes down at the station.
Walter rubs his hands together.
Thinking.
WALTER
Okay.
Okay.
Brought in for questioning.
Good.
I can write this.
JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.
Low and loud.
Walter
looks down at it.
WALTER (cont'd)
Ferry's leaving.
He starts down.
Will watches him pass, has no choice but to
follow.
Walter, going over the details in his head.
WALTER (cont'd)
Something to divert...
Snaps his fingers.
An idea.
WALTER (cont'd)
My gun.
You still have my gun, right?
Will nods.
Walter smiles.
Spreads out his hands.
WALTER (cont'd)
Then that's the wild card.
Every
detective story has a wild card.
WILL
What do you mean, "wild card?"
TOURISTS.
Boarding the ferry.
WALTER
Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.
Walter heads over to the ramp.
Will stops, grabbing his
side.
A PANG through his ribs.
Excruciating.
Calls out to
Walter.
WILL
What do you mean "wild card?"
Walter looks back.
Waves.
WALTER
You'll know.
At the questioning.
Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.
Gets on.
Walks back
to the stern.
Looks out at Will.
The HORN sounds again.
Walter, at the rail.
Smiles.
The ferry's engine, churning
up water.
Starting forward just as...
Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.
Holds
it up for Will to see.
Will, on shore, sees it.
A cold flash ripping through his
body.
That motherfucker.
Bolts through some tourists
towards the ramp but...
A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.
The Ticket Taker,
grabs his arm.
TICKET TAKER
(to Will)
Full up.
Will, jerks his arm away.
Stares off at the ferry.
Walter
Byrd and his tape recorder.
Receding into the distance.
Will exits the store.
A bag under his arm.
We Miss You, Kay
looming over his shoulder.
Steps out onto the sidewalk and
sees...
ELLIE leaning against her truck.
Waiting for him.
Smiles.
ELLIE
Which way are you walking?
A tingle, all across Will's body.
Christ.
This girl's
everywhere!
He hunches into his coat.
Flicks up his collar.
Doesn't want her to see him fully.
Nods down the road.
WILL
Back to the Lodge.
Ellie grabs her bag.
Joins him.
They start walking.
ELLIE
I needed to get your signature on
something.
She pulls a folder from her bag.
ELLIE (cont'd)
The report on Detective Eckhart.
Chief
made me finish it this morning.
Said it
was taking too long.
Will takes the file.
Flips it open.
The death of his
partner.
Neatly typed.
Neatly stapled.
Pulls out a pen.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Aren't you going to read it?
WILL
I trust you.
He signs.
Hands it back to her.
She slips it into her bag.
ELLIE (cont'd)
Now I can help you with the Connell case.
That writer's coming in tomorrow.
Walter
Byrd.
A slight stutter in Will's step.
WILL
Duggar called him?
ELLIE
About an hour ago.
Said he was more than
happy to cooperate.
Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.
Studying
his face.
His gait.
Noticing the slight limp in his right
leg.
The cut on his forehead.
ELLIE (cont'd)
You haven't been sleeping much, have you,
Detective Dormer?
They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
WILL
Not really.
ELLIE
Isn't that the difference between a good
cop and a bad cop?
A good cop can't
sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's
missing.
A bad cop can't sleep 'cause
his conscience won't let him.
(smiles)
You said that once, remember?
Will, finally looks at her.
WILL
No.
But it sounds like something I
would've said.
Turns and starts up the steps.
WILL (cont'd)
See you tomorrow, Ellie.
Ellie, watches him for a second.
Then calls out.
ELLIE
Oh!
I forgot to tell you.
The Puffins
won.
Will stops, turns to look back at her.
Confused.
ELLIE (cont'd)
The baseball game.
Our team...
Slings the bag over her shoulder.
ELLIE (cont'd)
...We won.
...The DARK FIGURE.
Disappearing back into the fog.
Closing
in around him like milky water...
We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking
chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG,
blanket thick...tightening around us...
Our feet.
Hit water.
Up to our ankles.
Icy cold.
We
run...sloshing through...when...
SUDDENLY
A DARK FIGURE.
Appears ahead.
Big and hulking...CRASHING
towards us...
We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE
emerges...
And in a split second...
WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...
CRACK!
We fire!
The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the
water.
Heart POUNDING.
Adrenaline PUMPING.
We slosh towards the
body.
Something...catching our eye...
A 357 RUGER
lying in the rocks.
Off to the side.
We grab it.
Turn back
to the body...
And stop cold.
That's when it hits us.
That's when we realize...
Ellie.
Sitting in her truck.
Parked behind the Pioneer
Lodge.
Rubbbing her eyes.
Sleepy.
Looking up at
WILL'S WINDOW
concerned.
CUT BACK TO:
CLOSE ON a BOOT.
Jumping down onto a black rock.
PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach.
Heading
down towards the water.
Thinking.
The sound of waves.
A slight breeze.
Ellie walking along
the water.
Looking down.
Brow furrowed.
Stops and puts her hands on
her hips.
Something catches Ellie's eye.
GLINTING from between the
rocks.
She bends down.
Pulls a pencil from her backpack.
Spears something and holds it up.
A SHELL CASING.
Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.
UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place.
Tearing down
pictures.
Turning out doors.
Ripping up carpet.
Randy's
voice.
In protest.
RANDY (O.S.)
You can't fucking do this!
Will hears some SCUFFLING.
The sheet being pulled down.
The
CLATTER of tools.
RANDY (O.S.)
Hey!
I'm working on that!
Parts pulled off the shelves.
The bike, shoved to the side.
Then.
A SILENCE.
Followed by...
OFFICER (O.S.)
Found something.
Will shuts his eyes.
Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.
Someone's pulled the gun from the can.
RANDY (O.S.)
What the fuck is that!
Fred's voice, calm.
FRED (O.S.)
That's it.
Let's bag it.
More FOOTSTEPS.
Randy, desperate.
RANDY (O.S.)
That's not mine, man!
That's not mine!
Will opens his eyes.
Fred's voice.
Almost sympathetic.
FRED (O.S.)
Randy...
RANDY (O.S.)
No way, man!
More SCUFFLING.
A chair knocked over.
Something SMASHES.
Will looks down at the floor as
FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the
doorway.
Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.
Screams.
RANDY (cont'd)
That ain't mine!
Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.
FRED
C'mon, Randy.
Randy squirms.
Turns.
Looks right into Will's eyes.
Gone
is the bluster.
Gone is the attitude.
Randy Stetz, lost
kid.
Tears streaming down his face.
RANDY
I swear to God.
I didn't kill her.
I
swear to God...
Will stands outside the garage apartment.
Wind whipping his
coat.
Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with
Randy Stetz in the back.
Fred sees him, heads over.
FRED
You look like shit, cowboy.
Will shifts his eyes to him.
WILL
That's an understatement.
Fred half-smiles.
Watches the receding squad car.
FRED
Looks like we can wrap this one up.
Will barely nods.
Fred pulls his baseball cap on.
FRED (cont'd)
We're getting together for a couple of
beers later on.
Might not be the Seattle
thing to do.
But you're welcome to come.
Fred puts out his hand to shake.
Truce.
Will looks at him.
Takes it.
Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.
She jumps
out.
CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall.
Spray flying.
PULL BACK to reveal a small monument by the sea.
A stone
cupola with a bronze statue underneath.
The sky, black with
clouds.
Will, driving down Nightmute's main street.
He takes a left.
Goes up a hill.
Glances out the window.
Passing by
THE CEMETERY.
A cluster of headstones.
Something catches
his eye.
He stops the car.
Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the
cemetery.
Stops.
Puts his hands up to the bars.
KAY CONNELL'S GRAVE
on the other side.
Newly dug.
A mound of dirt.
Flowers,
scattered by the wind.
Daughter and Friend...1982-1999.
Will.
Grips the bars.
As if he's seeing it for the first
time.
Really seeing it.
Closes his eyes.
What have I done?
Will driving along a forest road.
Eyes dead ahead.
A map on
the passenger seat.
By the fold, Kgun Lake circled in pencil.
AERIAL VIEW of the silver Jeep Cherokee.
The only car on the
road.
The sky, white-grey.
The trees, a blanket of green.
The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve.
Will, scanning the treeline.
Takes a left fork then stops.
Thought he saw something.
Grinds the gear, backs up.
Takes
another look.
IN THE DISTANCE, a radio tower.
WKOZ.
Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway.
Looming before him...
A HOUSE right on the lake.
Tall, wooden, in disrepair.
Chipping yellow paint.
A ghost of what it once was.
The
house from the photograph.
Ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck.
Gripping
the wheel.
The photograph pieces, taped together on the
passenger seat.
Ellie, jumping out of her truck.
Hears the sound.
Looks up
at the big, yellow house.
Pulls out her Glock 40.
Ellie, heart POUNDING.
Kicks the front door open...
The sky, heavy with clouds.
The air, foreboding.
Will
steals out the screen door.
Gun cocked.
Eyes scanning.
Wind, bending the weeds, the trees.
BAM! a shot.
Out of nowhere.
Rips into his thigh.
Will
CRIES out.
BAM! a second shot.
Whizzes past him...
Will.
On the ground.
Gripping his leg.
Looking wildly
around.
No sign of Walter.
Then.
He sees it.
Lucy and Desi.
Down by the boathouse.
Will.
Pulling himself through the weeds.
Losing blood fast.
Dragging his body.
Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE.
WALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out.
Will ducks his head.
Winces in pain.
Breathing, becoming
ragged.
Rounds to the other side.
Hoists himself up to
another WINDOW.
Cautiously looks in...
WALTER at the far window.
Will jerks back.
Steps on the dock.
A plank CREAKS.
Shit.
Peers back through the window.
WALTER.
Still looking out.
Didn't hear a thing.
Will remembers.
Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.
He's
deaf on that side.
Will staggers out on to the dock.
Drops his gun.
Crashes to
his knees.
Falls back.
His face, pale.
Lying against the
wood of the dock.
RAIN DROPS.
Start to fall.
Washing the blood from his skin.
Puckering the lake water.
Will's eyes...flutter...
FOOTSTEPS...running along the dock.
Heavy boots...
ELLIE (O.S.)
Detective Dormer!
Will squints against the rain.
Makes out the face of
ELLIE hovering over him.
He gives a half-smile.
WILL
God, you're a pain in the ass.
Ellie kneels down next to him.
Pulls over her vest.
Covers
him.
ELLIE
You're shot.
Will looks at her bloody shoulder.
WILL
You, too.
Ellie, tearing off her boot.
Yanks off her sock.
ELLIE
I'm going to make a tourniquet.
Will, fading fast.
WILL
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.
Her
things are in the house.
ELLIE
I know.
WILL
Byrd's dead.
Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.
Starts twisting.
Will
grimaces.
Ellie swallows.
Doesn't want to ask this.
ELLIE
You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?
Will nods.
WILL
Yes.
A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.
ELLIE
Did you mean to?
Will shakes his head.
WILL
No.
But I covered it up.
I lied.
ELLIE
Why?
RAIN, drumming down around them.
Will, takes a deep breath.
WILL
Because I just couldn't be wrong.
(looks at her)
Don't ever get that way, Ellie.
Don't
ever lose your way.
It blurs the line.
His blood, pumping out in rivulets.
Ellie looks down at him.
Her hero.
Moves up to the wound in his arm.
ELLIE
This one looks worse.
Will reaches up a feeble hand.
Stops her.
WILL
(whispers)
Just let me sleep, Ellie...
His eyelids, growing heavy.
WILL (cont'd)
Let me sleep.
Ellie blinks away the tears.
Knows what he means.
What he
wants.
Watches as the calm spreads over him.
Will closes his eyes.
ELLIE
No!
Will opens his eyes.
She ties the second sock around his
arm.
ELLIE (cont'd)
I will not let you sleep.
If you've lost
your way then you have to make it right.
That's the only way.
That's what you'd
tell me.
I've been a detective for four
weeks and I say you're coming with me.
She gets up.
Slips her arms under his shoulders.
Starts
hoisting him up.
ELLIE (cont'd)
C'mon...
Will.
Struggling to his knees.
Every inch of him, screaming
in pain.
Gets to his feet.
Arm slung around this tiny,
young woman.
WILL
What about your shoulder?
ELLIE
Don't worry.
I'll have a cool scar.
And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
FADE OUT.
