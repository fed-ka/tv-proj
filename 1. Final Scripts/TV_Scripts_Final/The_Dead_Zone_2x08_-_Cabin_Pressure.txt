  11INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT - NIGHT

          We join a commercial flight in progress.  Captain MICHAEL
          KLEIN is piloting.  He's in his late-40's, confident and,
          at the moment, looks a little bored.  His first officer,
          COLIN BLACK, keeps an eye on the controls.

                                        BLACK
                          Justine's already told me if I
                        fly on our anniversary again,
                        it'll be the last one.

                                        KLEIN
                        There's the leading edge of that
                        cold front.  You think we're gonna
                        top it at flight level three-five-
                        zero?

                                        BLACK
                        We should, but we might get a few
                        bumps.

          (NOTE: A two-way radio channel is tuned to Washington
          Center Air Traffic Control and the chatter will play softly
          in the background throughout the cockpit scenes.  It's a
          constant stream of instructions to various flights.)

                                        KLEIN
                        I've given up on finding my
                          Justine. 

                                        BLACK
                        And yet you keep auditioning them.

                                        KLEIN
                        Just playing the odds.

          The cockpit door intercom BEEPS. 

                                        NICOLE (O.S.)
                        It's Nicole.

          Black presses a button.  A pretty flight attendant in her
          early 20's, NICOLE, enters.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - TEASER -1/6/03 YELLOW      2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        NICOLE
                        Okay.  First casualty of the day. 
                        We've got a cranky doctor who
                        missed his connection to London.

                                        BLACK
                                (checks his watch)
                        We're only thirty minutes behind
                          schedule.

                                        NICOLE
                        Well, he left himself a whopping
                        fifteen minutes to change planes
                        in Washington.

                                        KLEIN
                        I'm not losing any sleep over
                        that one.

                                        NICOLE
                        You guys need anything up here?

          Klein turns to admire Nicole's lovely young figure.

                                        KLEIN
                        Ahh... such a leading question.

                                        BLACK
                        We're good.

          Nicole ignores Klein's flirtation and turns to exit.  We
          move with her...


  22INT. AIRPLANE - FORWARD GALLEY - NIGHT

          The cockpit door closes behind Nicole with a solid THUNK
          as it auto-locks.  In a tracking shot, we follow Nicole
          as she pauses to chat with the other flight attendant in
          the forward galley, an older, more jaded woman named
            LORRAINE.

                                        LORRAINE
                        You know you broke Michael's heart
                        when you got engaged.

                                        NICOLE
                        Hardly.  He just flirts 'cause
                        he's bored.  Pilots don't have
                        enough to do anymore. 

                                        LORRAINE
                        The cookies will be ready in a
                        minute.

                                        LORRAINE (CONT'D)
                        I'll go round and pick up some
                        trash.  

          Lorraine moves into the cabin with a plastic bag and we
          TRACK WITH HER as she moves to...


  33INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS - NIGHT

          Lorraine enters and surveys her domain.  There are about
          twelve people sitting in the large business class section,
            including JOHNNY (aisle seat) and PURDY (window seat). 
          Some people are reading, working laptops, listening to
          earphones; several are asleep. 

          She moves through, picking up drink cups and other trash. 
          As she passes Johnny and Purdy, we stay with them...
          Johnny's looking at a schedule of events at a convention
          they're going to and is very uncomfortable with it all...

                                        PURDY
                        People want to hear what Johnny
                        Smith has to say...

                                        JOHNNY
                        About what, Gene?... I'm no public
                        speaker...

                                        PURDY
                        About the future.  In troubled
                        times like these, everyone wants
                        to know there's hope...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (with private irony)
                        Boy, did you pick the wrong guy.

                                        PURDY
                        Don't think of it as a convention. 
                        Think of it as another classroom. 
                        Thirty or thirty-thousand... it's
                        all the same...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reading)
                        You've got me scheduled to speak
                        after Alan Greenspan...?

                                        PURDY
                        Alan's been an old and dear friend
                        to Faith Heritage.

    3CONTINUED:3

                                        PURDY (CONT'D)
                        Be sure to shake his hand; it
                        would be nice to know if the Fed
                        will be lowering interest rates
                          again...
                                (off Johnny's look)
                          Kidding.  I'm kidding. 

          Johnny shifts uncomfortably.

                                        PURDY
                        Are you alright?  You've been
                          restless the entire flight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm fine, but whoever sat in this
                        seat last was scared of flying.

          He realizes that he's gripping the arm rests with white
            knuckles.

                                        NICOLE
                          Chocolate chip cookie?

          They look up to see Nicole has arrived with the plate of
          cookies...

                                        PURDY
                        Ah, temptation.  
                                (sighs)
                        But no.  Thank you.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nervous)
                        Sure.  How long 'till we land?

                                        NICOLE
                        About an hour I think.  Maybe a
                        little less.

          Nicole hands Johnny a plate with a cookie on it.  On this
          connection, RAMP TO HIS FACE... and we're in --


  44OMITTED


55A VISION

          Chaos.  Johnny's in his seat, but the world seems to have
          tilted 45 degrees.  The plane is going down.  People SCREAM
          in the background.  Several passengers are groggy, pulled
          out of sleep by the emergency.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - TEASER -1/6/03 YELLOW      5.


    5CONTINUED:5

          Several feet away now, Nicole, is scared herself but moves
          down the aisle, helping them tighten their seat belts. 
          {Note: she should not be in a matching shot in proximity
          to Johnny when we cut to the vision - as called for in an
          earlier draft - or it might look like continuous action
          and be confusing.}

          But, as the dive goes suddenly and violently steeper, the
          g-forces YANK Nicole, slamming her against the wall of
          the plane.  Her neck snaps.


  66INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS

          And just like that, Johnny's back.  Nicole still stands
          over him with her tray of cookies.

                                        NICOLE
                        Would you like milk with that?

          ON JOHNNY'S STUNNED REACTION...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          Nicole returning, Lorraine is loading up more cookies...

                                        NICOLE
                        We've got a seat gripper in 3-B,
                        poor guy.  

          Lorraine grins sympathetically.  They've seen it all
          before.


  77INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS - NIGHT

          Turbulence shakes the plane again.  Johnny is spooked as
          he looks around, trying to get a sense for what's going
          to go wrong.  Mid-conversation, urgent, sotto to avoid
          alarming other passengers...

                                        JOHNNY
                        All I know is it looked like we
                        were going down.

                                (mouth dry, shaken)
                        But when you... you got on the
                          plane... you didn't feel
                          anything... one would think...

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...yeah, I should be the safest
                        guy in the world to travel with. 
                        But you and I both know my
                          abilities don't always work that
                        way.

          Purdy looks for some way to explain this away...

                                        PURDY
                        You said you were picking up fear
                        from the last passenger in the
                        seat... maybe it's the paranoia
                        you're feeling... the idea that
                          something could happen...  Or...
                        or God forbid... you could be
                        picking it up from a future
                          flight...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw the stewardess thrown against
                        the wall and killed, Gene.  It
                        was this flight.

    7CONTINUED:7

          Purdy's look is almost comical.  This is a man who knows
          how to delegate.  How to move masses with his words. 
          But, at this moment... he's helpless.  All he can say is --

                                        PURDY
                        When?

          Johnny doesn't know.  Lorraine is walking by with another
          plate of cookies.  Johnny quickly hands Purdy his cookie
          and stops Lorraine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.  Could I get another
                        cookie?

                                        LORRAINE
                        Sure.

          As Lorraine hands Johnny a cookie, on their connection,
          we're back in --


88THE CHAOTIC DIVE VISION - MAIN CABIN

          As before, the plane is tilted alarmingly.  People SCREAM.  

          But, Johnny isn't in his seat.  He stands at the front of
          the main cabin next to Lorraine as she braces herself and
            instructs the passengers... (note: the earlier vision was
          in business class)...

                                        LORRAINE
                        Stay in your seats with your seat
                        belts fastened!  

          The scene freezes.  Loose luggage, coffee cups, cell
          phones, etc. are suspended mid-air.  Johnny takes in the
          panicked eyes and tightly-gripped hands of his fellow
          passengers.

          Johnny approaches the husky business suit GUY in 10B. 
          He's bent over awkwardly with his head between his knees
          and his hands interlaced over his neck.  Johnny reaches
          out to look at his watch.  It reads: 10:54 PM.


  99JOHNNY

          SNAPS out of the vision and takes the cookie.  Lorraine
          notices his shaky post-vision expression... tries to
          comfort him...

                                        LORRAINE
                        That's just normal turbulence. 
                        Nothing to worry about.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - ACT ONE -1/6/03 YELLOW     8.

          And she moves on.  Purdy looks to Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        10:54.

          Purdy looks at his own watch.

                                        PURDY
                        Forty-four minutes.

          A beat, then Purdy begins to unbuckle his seat belt...
          what else can they do?

                                        PURDY
                        We have to tell the pilot.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really think he's going to
                        believe me?

                                        PURDY
                        I'll vouch for you.  We'll tell
                        him about your track record...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (sarcastic)
                        Sure and we can show him one of
                        the tabloids while we're at it...
                        the Elvis cover ought to convince
                        him to land the plane...
                                (beat)
                        I need more, Gene... I need to
                        know how and why... or who...

          Johnny turns to survey the passengers.  In business class,
          we see professional-looking MEN and WOMEN.  A young
          Japanese FAMILY, all listening to headphones.  A young
          kissy COUPLE, probably on their honeymoon.  One elderly
          MAN with a loosened bow tie around his neck SNORES softly.

          Beyond the mid-section, several FACES are visible in the
          main cabin.  Oblivious faces... or are they all oblivious?

                                        PURDY
                        You don't think someone on board
                        would be planning something...

          Unfastening his seat belt, Johnny rises.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm gonna go for a little walk.

          (Note: assume the cane is stowed in overhead compartment

          and he gets it out during the time cut.)

  1010INT. AIRPLANE - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

          Johnny is walking down the aisle in the main cabin,
            appearing to stretch his legs, casually touching aisle
          seats on both sides of him as though to help maintain his
          balance.  As he touches the seats, his eyes and our camera
          glance at --


          P.O.V. - SCAN THE FACES

          Looking for a clue, a vision, anything.  Three on one
          side of the aisle.  Three on the other.  Then the next
          row, the same thing... some passengers he might see:

          A beautiful blonde WOMAN tries to keep her toddler GIRL
          from WHACKING the morose elderly MAN on the other side of
          her.  A trio of COLLEGE GIRLS eye Johnny back
            speculatively.  An obese BUSINESSMAN is squeezed between
          two elderly WOMEN who obviously want to sit together. 
          They whisper (out of earshot) obliviously over the
            miserable man.


          JOHNNY

          Is getting nothing... continues his walk...

          And then as he reaches the next row and touches both aisle
          seats...


  10A10AA JOHNNY FLASH - A HOLSTERED GUN HIDDEN UNDER A SHIRT

          Someone in this row has a gun.

          Johnny reacts, pauses in his walk, studies the passengers
          in the row.


          P.O.V.

            A greasy-haired GUY wearing a collegiate sweatshirt, a 20-
            something brunette WOMAN (KELLY PARK) with a colorful
          70's style sweater and an older blue-collar MAN who keeps
          checking his watch.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - ACT ONE -1/6/03 YELLOW    10.


    10BCONTINUED:10B

          Johnny looks on the other side of the aisle and sees a
          MAN in his 40's with olive skin and dark expressive brown
          eyes.  He holds Johnny's gaze longer than is comfortable. 
          Johnny walks back to business-class. 


  1111INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS

          Johnny returns to his seat.  Purdy gives him a questioning
          look.  Always sotto, with a concern for raising fears
          among other passengers:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone in row 26 has a gun.

                                        PURDY
                        How could they get it past the
                          screening devices...?  You're
                          certain...?

          Johnny nods, sure.  Purdy takes that in.  He's recovered
          from the shock by now.  He's scared to death but this is
          a man who's at his best in a crisis.  And this certainly
          qualifies.

                                        PURDY
                        All right.  I think I should speak
                        to the pilot first.  I have a
                        certain credibility, I think, and
                        I can be very convincing when I
                        need to be.

          As he rises, Johnny moves to let him out...

                                        PURDY (CONT'D)
                        I'll call you when I need you.

          Johnny nods.  Purdy walks to the forward galley.


  1212INT. AIRPLANE - FORWARD GALLEY

          Lorraine is cleaning up dishes as Purdy enters.

                                        PURDY
                        Excuse me, Miss, I was wondering
                        if it's possible for me to speak
                        to the Captain for just a moment?

                                        LORRAINE
                        I'm sorry... but under the new
                          security precautions, once the
                        flight is underway, the Captain
                        doesn't...

                        concern about the plane.

                        It's really quite urgent.

                        I have information that someone
                        on this flight has managed to
                        bring a gun on board.  The lives
                        of every passenger are in imminent
                        danger, Lorraine.  Believe me:
                        neither of us has time to stand
                        on ceremony.  Get me the Captain.

          Off her reaction...


  1313INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT

          Captain Klein turns to Lorraine as the cockpit door opens
          and she enters.

                          A passenger needs to speak to
                        you.  He says someone on board
                        has a gun.

                          television.

                        Go on.  I got it.

          Klein undoes his seat belt and follows Lorraine out.


  1414INT. AIRPLANE - FORWARD GALLEY

          Klein steps out to greet Purdy.  Generally brisk dialogue,
          again keeping in mind that they don't want to scare
          passengers:

                                        KLEIN
                        I'm Captain Klein.  What's this
                        about a gun?

                                        PURDY
                        Yes, someone in row 26.

                        Get me the passenger manifest.

          As she does...

                                        KLEIN (CONT'D)
                                (to Purdy)
                        You saw this gun?

                                        PURDY
                        No.  But my colleague did.  In a
                        manner of speaking.

          Klein throws him a look...

                                        KLEIN
                        'Manner of speaking'?

                                (full of confidence)
                        I'm travelling with a man named
                        Johnny Smith.  Perhaps you've
                        heard of him.

          Klein hasn't.

          Lorraine hands the captain the list of passenger names
          and seats. 

                                        PURDY
                                (disappointed but
                                  pushes ahead
                                  vigorously)
                        No.  Well.  That's... too bad. 
                        You see, he has sort of a 'second
                        sight'.

          And now Klein does a take... glances at Lorraine...  Purdy
          signals Johnny through the curtain to come forward...
          Klein looks over the manifest...

                                        PURDY
                          Johnny's really quite remarkable...
                        he's helped the police with several
                        major cases...

          Klein is unimpressed.  As Johnny arrives...

                                        PURDY
                        John Smith, Captain Klein.

          Klein glances ever so briefly away from the manifest,
            acknowledges Johnny, wondering how the hell he ever got
          into this situation.

                                        KLEIN
                                (to Johnny)
                        And... what was it exactly you...
                        'saw'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I couldn't tell which passenger
                        it was but I got a vision of...

                          A vision.

                                        PURDY
                        He has psychic visions.  If you
                        recall the Markoff kidnapping...

                                list of names)
                        Was one of the people in that row
                          a Korean woman?

                        Yes, there was a Korean woman on
                        the left side of...

                                        KLEIN
                        She's an air marshal, Mr. Smith. 
                        You're not supposed to know that. 
                        And I don't know how you do.  But
                        there's nothing to worry about.    

          He hands the manifest back to Lorraine...

                        Sir, no, I... there is something
                        to worry about.
                                (beat, off Klein's
                                  reaction)
                        I saw this plane go into a dive
                        at 10:54 tonight.  

          Klein glances incredulously at Lorraine...

                                        KLEIN
                          I thought this was about a gun...

                        He was trying to find a cause for
                        the dive before we came to you
                        which led him to the gun...

                                        KLEIN
                        Are you both aware that it's a
                        felony to disrupt a commercial
                          flight--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir, we have less than forty
                        minutes to figure out what is
                        going to go wrong with this plane.

                                        KLEIN
                        Nothing is going to go wrong with
                        this...  
                                  (interrupts himself)
                        Whether I believe that you have
                          'visions' or not, Mr. Smith, on
                        this plane, I deal in facts.  Not
                        bad feelings.

                                his composure)
                        We're experiencing turbulence
                        this evening.

                        Maybe it could cause an abrupt
                        change in altitude that might
                        look like a dive.  But it's my
                          responsibility to prevent that
                        so...  I'd better return to the
                        cockpit and I'd like you both to
                        return to your seats.  Now.  

          Johnny exchanges a desperate look with Purdy, but Klein
          isn't asking.  Purdy and Johnny head back to their seats. 
          We STAY WITH Klein as he turns to Lorraine.

                                        KLEIN
                        Thanks a lot.

                        didn't know.

          We TRACK with Klein back into the...


  1515INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT

          Klein eases back into his seat.  Klein is very low key
          about the whole thing.

                          Somebody got the jitters?

                                        KLEIN
                        You could say that.  We have a
                          self-proclaimed psychic with the
                          unlikely name of John Smith.  Has
                        a bad feeling about the flight.

          Black reacts, takes this a bit more seriously than Klein.

                        John Smith?  I saw something about
                        him on the news.  He's supposed
                        to be the real deal.

  1616INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS

          Johnny and Purdy ease back into their seats.  Always sotto --

                        You know, he could be right.  It
                        might just be turbulence.  You
                        saw a dive, but you didn't see a
                        crash.  

          Johnny is thinking carefully about what he saw.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The plane was tilted.  People
                        were screaming...

          Johnny closes his eyes and tries to concentrate... in
          recent weeks, he's just beginning to learn how to reach
          out for a vision (like he did in SCARS when he touched
          the podium)... it's a sign that deep within himself he
          has the ability to harness his power... but it isn't easy
          for him so this should not come too quickly... maybe he
          reaches down to the floor first, eyes closed... and gets
          nothing... then tries again, reaching up to the console
          above him and tries again - HE TOUCHES THE AIR VENT THAT
          BLOWS COOLING AIR ON PASSENGERS' FACES and this time on
          his touch -- RAMP TO HIS FINGERS --


  1717AND SUDDENLY WE'RE BACK IN THE VISION

          The plane's going down.

          Johnny's in his seat.  Around him, people SCREAM.  Cell
          phones, coffee cups and pieces of loose luggage fly through
          the air.  As before, Lorraine is in the main cabin as she
          braces herself and instructs the passengers...

                        put your own mask on before helping

          Johnny calmly (as calmly as he can under the circumstances)
          looks around the plane.  There's no sign of structural
          damage.  He looks at the cockpit door -- it's closed and
          secured.

          Johnny frowns.  Finally, he turns to Purdy, whose eyes
          are closed as he prays.  Johnny reaches across him and
          looks out the window. 


    17A17AJOHNNY'S POV: THE ENGINE EXPLODES AND PIECES OF IT RIP A
          HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE PLANE WITH CONCUSSIVE FORCE.

          Johnny turns and watches in horror as the cabin starts de-
            pressurizing and oxygen masks fall.  Flames from the
          burning wing ROAR into the plane and are just as quickly
          sucked back out.  But none of that matters as Johnny
          watches...

          The hole in the side of the main cabin expanding.  Rows
          of seats filled with screaming PASSENGERS are sucked out
          ...and just as Johnny is about to fly out himself...

                        know people who know people who
                        know him.  I'm almost certain
                        he's a member of the Harvard Club.

          Johnny acknowledges, moves to the front...

                        The starboard engine. 
                                (double checking,
                                  pointing)
                        That is starboard?

                                        NICOLE
                                (shaken)
                        Yes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to tell the captain.

          Lorraine has had enough of this. 

                                        LORRAINE
                        I have to go to the main cabin,
                        but I'll be right back.

          Lorraine gives Nicole a "watch him" look.  She heads for
          the rear of the plane.  Nicole looks at Johnny worried...

                                        NICOLE
                        I read about what you did last
                        May... that graduation party, the
                        fire.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impatient)
                        Then, please, help me, tell them
                        to take me seriously.

          Nicole's mind is racing as she figures something out.

                                        NICOLE
                        It happens when you touch people.
                                  (realizing)
                        You saw something before... when
                        I gave you your cookie.  Didn't
                        you?  About me. 

          Johnny hesitates... and that hesitation chills Nicole to
          the bone; she talks to him as though she's pleading with
          the grim reaper -- 

                                        NICOLE
                        I just got engaged.  I'm getting
                        married in June.

                        Nothing has to happen.  We can
                        change things.  But we have to

          He moves toward the cockpit door... she grabs his arm to
          stop him...


2121A VISION FLASH

          Changes her lovely hand in the blink of an eye.  Now it's
            a charred post-crash hand sticking out from under a piece
          of burned wreckage.  Even the beautiful diamond engagement
          ring is the same.


  2222RESUME - JOHNNY REACTS

          And she can tell he saw something... her eyes fill with
          fear...

                                        NICOLE
                        The door is locked from the inside. 
                        I'm sorry.  You can't go in there.

                                        FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Smith?

          Johnny turns to see that Lorraine has brought the young
          WOMAN in the 70's-style sweater forward.  Her name is
          KELLY PARK.

                                        KELLY
                        I'm Special Agent Park.  Lorraine
                        told me about your concerns.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to warn this crew about
                          a legitimate problem.

                                        KELLY
                        I'm sure it seems very legitimate
                        to you, but these people have
                        jobs to do and you're making that
                        difficult.

          Kelly's eyes dart to Johnny's cane.  She's sizing him up
          as if ready to restrain him.

                                        KELLY
                        You'll be sitting with me for the
                        rest of the flight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen to me, if we don't...

                        If you don't come with me, right
                        now, I will have to take
                          restraining action.  And I assure
                        you I'm fully capable of using
                        any force necessary.

          He studies her a beat...

                                        KELLY
                        Let's not do anything that might
                        get other passengers upset.

          She gives him a hard look and Johnny knows he has no
            choice... he gives a knowing look to Nicole...  

                                        JOHNNY
                        The starboard engine.  Get him to
                        check it.  

          Kelly starts to lead Johnny towards the rear of the plane. 


  22A22AINT. BUSINESS CLASS - CONTINUOUS

          We TRACK WITH THEM.  As we pass Johnny's row, we stay on
          Purdy.  He's still on the phone as he watches Johnny being
          led past.  Their eyes connect.

                        because I'm on one of his planes;
                        yes, there's a bit of a problem...

          The CAMERA eases away from Purdy back to the front galley. 
          Nicole still stands watching Johnny being led away.  A
          beat on Nicole's eyes...


  2323INT. AIRPLANE - REAR GALLEY

          Kelly has led Johnny to the small rear area of the plane. 
          Besides the galley and bathroom, there are two jump seats
          and an emergency door.  (Note, several back rows of the
          cabin are unoccupied which will allow the action to go
            unnoticed back here.)   Still, they will keep their voices

                                        KELLY
                        No. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just want to hold the medal.

                                        KELLY
                        Mr. Smith, sit down.

          He doesn't sit.

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a bluff)
                        Let me hold it or I'll start
                        yelling that the plane is going
                        to crash.

          She stares at him.

                                        KELLY*
                        What happened to, "I'm a rational
                        person; I don't cause trouble"?

          He holds out his hand for the medal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not asking for much.

          Her eyes say: Okay, fine.  She unsnaps the necklace and
          hands him the medal... again the DZ WHOOSH sound as it
          touches his hand...


          JOHNNY'S FACE

          shows the strain of a difficult vision...


          THE MEDAL

          is clamped so tightly in his right hand that the cords in

          his wrist stand out... and then


          TWO SHOT

          His eyes penetrate hers... she reacts, unsettled...

                                        KELLY
                        Can I have it back now?

          Johnny doesn't give it back... begin a slow push to an
          extreme closeup of his face...

          (Note: the following dialogue is taken almost verbatim
          from the book, which we like to do when we can: see page
          157, signet edition.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's your sister's medallion. 
                        You gave it to her.  Her name was
                        Anne but everyone called her Terry. 
                        Your older sister.  You loved
                        her.  You almost worshipped the
                        ground she walked on.

          Kelly's eyes narrow... her mouth goes dry... we continue
          the slow push to the ECU of Johnny as his voice gets
          softer, younger... (Note: softly in the background, we
          hear, as Johnny is hearing, the actual voice of the teenage
          Kelly saying the same words so in fact, Johnny is talking
          in unison with her.)

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (as young Kelly to
                                her older sister)
                        "It's for when you cross Lisbon
                        Street against the lights, Terry. 
                        Or when you're out parking with
                        one of those guys from E.L.  Don't
                        forget, Terry... don't forget..."

                                        KELLY
                                (whisper)
                        Stop it.

          (Note: All of her lines should overlap his.)  The slow
          PUSH is incredibly CLOSE on Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (normal voice)
                        It was speed, wasn't it?  Then
                        meth.

                        she died, but you didn't call her
                        back 'cause you had midterms. 
                        You've always blamed yourself...

                        She was wearing the medal when
                        they found her.  She'd worn the
                        medal ten years.  She remembered
                        you, Kelly.  She never forgot.

                        Shut up!

          She grabs the medallion back and slams Johnny against the
          wall...


          CLOSE ON HIS HAND

          As she pulls out handcuffs from her belt and cuffs Johnny's
          hands in front of him.

                        going to die.  How many brothers

          Captain Klein's on the radio.

                        Yes, Mr. Ghent.  I understand. 

          Klein listens to the voice on the other end.

                                        KLEIN
                          Alright.  I'll hear him out.  No
                          problem.  Thank you.  Goodbye.

          Klein's polite "company voice" disappears the moment he
          hangs the phone up.

                                        KLEIN
                            Un-frigging-believable.

          Klein removes his seat belt and headset and walks out.

          Captain Klein stalks past Purdy giving him a look as he
          passes towards the rear galley.  Purdy watches him go,
          hopes... a few passengers glance over but go back to their
          own personal activities...


  2929INT. AIRPLANE - REAR GALLEY

          Kelly's mind is still working when Klein arrives.  Johnny
          and Kelly stand...

                                        KLEIN
                        Mr. Smith, I've been instructed
                        by the CEO of this airline to
                        treat you with courtesy and listen

                        You have three minutes.

          Johnny doesn't waste any time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need you to check the starboard
                        engine.

                                        KLEIN
                        Yes, I just did a computer
                        diagnostic of the entire system  
                        at the request of my boss.  The
                          computer says the plane is fine.

          Johnny takes that in a beat...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Isn't it possible that the

                                (just to get this
                                over with)
                          I suppose a bird strike or other
                          obstruction in flight could damage
                        an engine, but these things are
                        rarely catastrophic.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Tonight, something will be.

          Klein studies Johnny, he's done what he promised his
          boss... but he's still trying to mend fences...

                          Captain, perhaps we should consider
                        landing early...

          Klein gives her a sharp look.  This is not what he wants
          to hear from the air marshal who's supposed to have a
          level head.  She modifies her suggestion on the fly...

                        We're about to begin our descent

                        I'm sorry about these.

          He touches the handcuffs and as he does...  RAMP TO
          JOHNNY'S FACE...


  3030INSIDE THE COCKPIT.

          One pilot sits in the left chair.  CLOSE ON: The grim
          unblinking face of Captain Klein.  Behind him, Johnny in
          omniscient vision presence watches:

                                        KLEIN
                        God forgive me.

          Klein's right hand pushes both throttles forward full
          force.  Johnny reacts as the plane goes into the dive...

          We rapid DOLLY back out of the cockpit and down the aisle,
          as the action we've seen once before replays: pieces of
          the engine PIERCE the side of the plane, oxygen masks
          fall.  (Note: Johnny cannot be in his seat with Purdy as
          previously scripted because he has changed the future and
          would now be in the rear galley - you can, however, find
          him watching in omniscient vision presence again if you
          wish).  A fireball shoots into the hole in the side of
          the plane... and is just as quickly sucked back out. 
          This is a catastrophic depressurization.  And then people
          SCREAM as rows of seats are sucked out.           DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - ACT TWO -1/6/03 YELLOW    31.

          Snaps out of the vision and looks at Klein in horror. 
          Johnny struggles to process the new information.  It's a
          whole new ball game.  In continuous action from pre-vision
          (which is a standard rule, by the way) Klein studies him...
          senses something just happened, just wants to get out of
          there...

                                        KLEIN
                        Mr. Ghent asked me to convey his
                          apologies for the discomfort you've
                          experienced.  As a token of our

                        I won't be needing it.

          They lock eyes for a long beat and then the Captain moves
          back toward the cockpit.  Johnny reacts, but it is on
          Kelly's face that we...

          The plane SHIFTS slightly.

          Klein keys his mic off.  Black looks at him with Johnny
          on his mind.

          And we have to wonder what he's thinking...


  3333INT. AIRPLANE - REAR GALLEY

          As Purdy arrives... Johnny's mind works...

                                        PURDY
                        Was he prepared to listen finally? 
                        Martin Ghent promised me that...

                        Sir, please return to your seat.

                        Miss, I'm Eugene Purdy of the

                        I don't care if you're the Pope,
                        I want you to return to your seat.

                        He's going to take the plane into
                        a dive.  

          That gets both Kelly and Purdy's full attention.  Off
          their looks --

                        He says "God forgive me", he pushes
                        two levers, the dive, then a moment
                        later, the engine explodes... the
                        fuel ignites, the cabin hull
                          breaches...

                        You're suggesting Captain Klein
                        is deliberately going to destroy
                        this aircraft.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw it, Kelly... as clearly as
                        I saw you and your sister...

                        I've flown with him at least a
                        dozen times.

                                        PURDY
                                (to Kelly)
                        Do you know anything about him? 
                        What's going on in his personal
                        life?

          Kelly feels like she's being pulled in all directions at
          once... she wants it to stop...

                                        KELLY
                        Sir, please, I have to insist
                        that you return to...

          But Purdy bores in with every verbal skill he knows how
          to summon...

                          {RUNNING TIME CHECK} to live,
                        Kelly, is it?, and I'm not going
                          anywhere.  If you want to handcuff
                        me too, be my guest.  But you're
                        going to hear me out.

          She stares at him, but her mind is working...

                                        PURDY
                          I believe that God had a very
                          specific purpose for putting Johnny
                        Smith on this plane.

                        We were supposed to fly tonight
                        on a private jet but it was
                          grounded  for repairs.  Then we
                        missed our first flight.  Call it
                        "fate", "destiny" or "God's will",
                        but it's no coincidence that
                          Johnny's here.  It is also God's
                        will that you're aboard this plane,
                        Kelly.  Because Johnny cannot
                        hope to save these passengers
                        without your help.  The only
                          question now is whether you will
                        accept the role that fate has
                        created for you.  Or will you
                        regret it for the rest of your
                        very short life.

          A beat, she stares at him.  He sees the medal on the
          necklace around her neck again, uses it to make a point...

                                        PURDY (CONT'D)
                        I see you're wearing a St.
                          Christopher medal.  Patron saint
                        of travelers?  Perhaps it's no
                          accident you're wearing it tonight.

          Purdy doesn't realize the full impact of his comment but
          Johnny does... she exchanges a glance with Johnny...

                                        KELLY
                        What do you expect me to do --
                        relieve the captain of command?

          Purdy and Johnny exchange a look - she may not have been
          entirely serious but hey, that's a pretty good suggestion.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can the co-pilot land the plane?

                                        KELLY
                        Of course but...

                        That could solve a lot of problems.

                                        KELLY
                        How am I supposed to explain that
                        when we land?

                                        PURDY
                        At least this way, we land.

          A beat, she shakes her head, can't quite believe she's

                        Go back to your seats.  I'll speak

          She moves forward.  After a beat...

                        I told you I can be convincing

                        what's going to happen.  

          And this bolsters Kelly's decision even more...


  3434INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT

          There's a knocking at the cockpit door.  Black presses an
          intercom button.

                                        KELLY (O.S.)
                        It's Kelly Park.  May I speak
                        with you, Captain Klein?

          Black lets Kelly in.

                        We'll be on the ground soon.  Is
                        he giving you any more trouble?

          Klein looks at Kelly closely.  She motions for him to
          join her at the rear of the cockpit.  He does.

                                        KELLY
                          Captain, I'd like to ask you to

          He throws her an incredulous look...

                        What in God's name, are you...

                        plane down.

          Kelly watches closely as Klein reacts to the ridiculous
          suggestion.  When he sees that she's serious...

                                        KLEIN
                        Are you telling me you're actually
                          worried?

                                        KELLY
                        I'd just feel better if Mr.
                          Black... 

                                        KLEIN
                        This flight is becoming absolutely
                          surreal.  Go back to your seat
                        and let me do my job...

                        I'm sorry.  I can't do that.

          That's when Klein sees the gun in Kelly's hand.  It's not
          exactly pointed at him, but it's ready to be.

                        Mr. Black, can you land this plane
                        by yourself?

          Black can't quite believe what's happening.

                                        BLACK
                        I'd rather not.

                        Or what?  You'll remove me by
                        force? 

                                        KELLY
                        I'd rather not alarm the
                          passengers.

                                        KLEIN
                        By all means, let's not do anything
                        rash like that...

          Klein precedes Kelly out of the cockpit.


  3535INT. AIRPLANE - BUSINESS-CLASS

          Johnny and Purdy have returned to their seats.  They watch
          as Kelly leads Klein to a vacant jump seat in the forward
          galley.

          Johnny looks around for reactions from the passengers. 
          But, most of the people in business-class are sleeping. 
          A pretty young EXEC checks her e-mail.  It's a surreal
          collection of faces... none panicked or disturbed.

                                        PURDY
                        So that's it.  We've stopped it.

          Johnny breathes deeply, hopes that it's true and to test
          it, he reaches up to touch the console where he got the
          last vision - AGAIN HIS FINGERS BRUSH AGAINST THE AIR
          VENT and as he does...


  3636THE VISION RETURNS - SEEING THE CATASTROPHIC BREACH

          In the hull.  But, now we're moving BACKWARDS IN TIME
          within the vision.  The deadly fire and wind is sucked
          back out of the hole in the plane and the breached wall
          re-forms (the explosion footage played backwards).  We
          ZIP up the aisle past Johnny's seat straight into...

          THE COCKPIT.  Only one chair is occupied, but it's the
          RIGHT one.  As we spin around to face the lone occupant,
          we see the sweating panicked face of the first officer,
          COLIN BLACK as his left hand PULLS THE THROTTLES back
          (because we're still in reverse).

          And now Time begins forward again like a rubber band
          snapping back and this time it's Black who says a quiet
          good-bye to his wife.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - ACT THREE -1/6/03 YELLOW   39.

          As he pushes the throttles forward and the plane goes
          into the dive...

  3838JOHNNY

          Comes out of the vision.  Purdy waits anxiously.  Johnny
          shakes his head, he can't believe it.  This is impossible. 
          Purdy sees his face... voices remain low as always...

                                        PURDY
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now it's the co-pilot.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't understand what you...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now, it's the co-pilot who destroys
                        the plane.  Exactly the same way
                        the pilot did.

          Purdy stares at him... for the first time, has real
            doubts...

                                        PURDY
                          Johnny... that's... that's... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...I saw it, Gene...

          His mind works...

                                        PURDY
                        ...I don't question that but...
                        Johnny, a conspiracy?  I think we
                        have to begin to ask ourselves...
                        is it possible you've been wrong... 
                        I mean, maybe your abilities have
                        been affected by the pressurized
                        cabin or...

          But during the above, Johnny is getting an insight...

                        No, no... I think I understand... 
                        I have to talk to the captain
                        again.

          Purdy reacts curiously as Johnny moves to the forward
            galley...


  38A38AINT. FORWARD GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          Klein and Kelly look up... and boy, Klein is pissed...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me a good reason why you
                        would put this plane into a dive.

                                        KLEIN
                        There is no good reason.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, there has to be.  A good
                        reason, Captain.  It's the only
                        thing that makes any sense. 
                        Because your co-pilot is going to
                        try the very same thing in ten
                          minutes.

          Klein and Kelly react...

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's only one reason I can
                        think of why both pilots would do
                        that.  You're not trying to destroy
                        this plane.  You must be trying
                        to save it.

          Off their reactions...

  4141INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT 

          Klein enters trailed by Johnny and Kelly.  Black looks
          up.

                                        BLACK
                        Everything okay now?

                                        KLEIN
                                (still entirely
                                  skeptical)
                        I've made a bargain to get my
                        plane back.  Mr. Smith is going
                        to tell us exactly what he saw. 
                        He believes that we will respond
                        to some emergency condition in
                        seven minutes by taking the plane
                        into a rapid descent...

          Klein sits back down in his chair.  Johnny stands, taking
          in the details of the cockpit, trying to find... something.

                                        KLEIN
                                (to Johnny)
                        So, please.  Tell me exactly what
                        you saw me doing.

          Johnny looks over the controls.  He points to the
          throttles, located on the pedestal between the pilots.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your hand was there.

                                        KLEIN
                        Those are the throttles.  They
                        control the engines.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        You pushed them both all the way
                          forward.  Then the starboard engine
                          exploded and the cabin
                          depressurized.

                                        BLACK
                        That's impossible.  Even if we
                        did go to max power, which we
                        never do, the engine wouldn't
                          explode.  It just doesn't happen.

          But, Klein doesn't dismiss it so quickly.

                                        KLEIN
                        Let's just think about it.  If we
                        stalled and we were trying to
                          recover, we'd go to max power.

          Black is thinking through the possibilities.

                                        BLACK
                        I guess if there was an oil problem
                        in the engine and we were trying
                        to shut it down...

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I touch the throttles?

          Klein is hesitant; there's a warning in his voice.

                                        KLEIN
                        Touch, but don't move.

          He nods.  Johnny reaches out and touches the throttles. 
          He shakes his head... nothing.

          He touches another set of controls in the right side of
          the instrument panel.  EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio), N1,
          N2, EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature).  

          Johnny shakes his head in frustration.  He's getting
          nothing.  But then he feels the air coming from...


          THE AIR VENT

          above the command seats...


          JOHNNY

            remembers how he got the other visions from the vent as
          his seat... reaches up to touch this vent...


  4242*VISION FLASH - SUBJECTIVE POV

          Johnny just gets quick disorienting glimpses.  He's
          surrounded by a gray fog.  A floor of dark gray clouds.

          A freezing cold wind buffets him.


  4343JOHNNY

          Snaps out of the vision.  Standing in the cockpit.  He
          sways briefly, disoriented.

                                        KELLY
                        Are you okay?

                        Where does this air come from?

                        The bleeds?  The air comes in
                        from outside.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (urgent)
                        But, where?

                        Through the engines.

          Johnny puts both hands on the air vent, closes his eyes
          and CONCENTRATES.  Klein and Black exchange incredulous
          looks.  On JOHNNY: And a new VISION hits --


  4444JOHNNY IS STANDING ON THE STARBOARD WING OF THE PLANE

          Unlike the explosion vision Johnny has had over and over,
          this vision is serene.  The scene is frozen.  Johnny is
          standing in an icy fog.   

          Johnny takes a step (he doesn't have his cane) and his
            footsteps are loud in the mid-air silence.

          Johnny approaches the engine, bends down and examines it
          carefully.  There's no outward sign of stress or damage. 
          He leans over to look at the air intake.  But, there's
          nothing obstructing the air flow.  Johnny frowns.

          And then Johnny notices something else.  Ice particles
            suspended in the air.  Millions of them.  They sparkle
          like a mist made of diamonds.  Johnny runs his hands
          through them, but he doesn't disturb them.

          Slowly, with a sense of foreboding, Johnny bends down
            carefully to look at the leading edge of the wing.

          ANGLE FROM UNDER THE WING: Johnny's face slowly lowers
          into view from above.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CABIN PRESSURE - ACT FOUR -1/6/03 YELLOW   44.


    44CONTINUED:44

          His eyes fill with dread as he sees... ICE.  A huge layer
          of ice has built up on the forward edge and all across
          the wing. 


  4545INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT

          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's ice on the wing.  A lot
                        of it.

          Klein scans for a warning light.  After a second...

                                        KLEIN
                        No.  Both wings are clear. 

          Black looks forward out of the front window.

                                        BLACK
                        All the anti-icing is on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not working.  Not on the
                          starboard side at least.

                                        KLEIN
                        My instruments say it is.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then your instruments are wrong.

                                        KLEIN
                        First thing you learn as a pilot
                        is, "Instruments don't lie."

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't think it's possible?

                                        KLEIN
                        It's not that it's not possible,
                        but it's improbable.  I've never
                        had a problem with this system. 
                        I've been flying commercial jets
                        for fifteen years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If ice has built up on the
                          starboard wing, how would that
                        affect the flight?

                                        KLEIN
                        Depends on how bad it is.

                        Could you land the plane?

                                        KLEIN
                        We'd have trouble maintaining
                        lift.

                        Then what?

                                        KLEIN
                        The aircraft could stall. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How would you fix that?

                                        KLEIN
                        First, I'd go to max power on
                        both engines...

          Klein trails off as he looks at the throttles.  Johnny's
          eyes follow his to the throttles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Max power.

                        All the way forward.

          Klein stares at him; for the first time, he's beginning
          to have second thoughts.

          The "fasten seatbelt" indicator comes on.  Purdy reacts. 
          Checks his watch: it's (RUNNING TIME CHECK) 10:44.

          Lorraine picks up the intercom and speaks to the

          The plane BUMPS.  A plastic cup of coffee spills on the
          female EXEC seated in 1C.

          As Nicole moves to help clean up the mess, the plane
          LURCHES even more violently, almost knocking Nicole off
          her feet.  She looks scared as she glances towards the
          cockpit.  People MURMUR worriedly, but the elderly MAN in
          the bow tie still snores peacefully in the last row.

          As the ride gets rougher, Johnny grabs onto Black's chair
          to steady himself.  Black's face falls as he figures
            something out.

                                        BLACK
                        Mike... the auto-pilot.  That's
                        why it's been jerking us around. 
                        It could be compensating for the
                        ice.  That's what happened in '94
                        on that American Eagle flight.  

          And Klein can sense... we can sense... the plane straining. 
            Something CREAKS with effort.  A mechanical WHIRR which
          should blend into the background seems louder.

                                        KLEIN
                        Go back to the main cabin and
                        check the wing for ice.
                                (to Johnny and Kelly)
                        You two better find yourself
                          seats...

          Black leaves the cockpit.  Kelly follows him out.  Johnny
          lingers.  Captain Klein looks up: what now?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Captain, I might be able to help...

                                        KLEIN
                        You know planes...?

                        may need to know the consequences
                        of your decisions moment by moment.

          Another lurch.

                                        KLEIN

          The plane begins to shake more violently.

          Klein motions for Johnny to sit down in the co-pilot chair.

                        Sit down, before you kill yourself. 
                        Fasten the belt and don't touch

          Johnny moves into Black's seat.  Violent shaking.

          Horrible shaking now...  The passengers are getting very

          into a jumpseat.


  4848INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

          The auto-pilot is practically GROANING with the effort of
          controlling the plane.

                                        KLEIN (CONT'D)
                        I'm taking it down to a warmer
                          altitude.  We need to break that
                        ice off.  Besides the friction,
                        we'll gain about two degrees
                        Fahrenheit for every thousand
                        feet.

          But, before Klein can begin the descent, an ALARM sounds,
          filling the cockpit with sudden noise.

                                        KLEIN
                          Auto-pilot's failed!

          The plane LURCHES upwards.  Klein grabs the yoke and pushes
          forward on it, struggling to keep the nose down.  The
          plane is losing speed, threatening to stall.  Klein keys
          his headset mic.

                                        KLEIN
                        Mayday, Mayday, Washington Center,

          All CHATTER on the radio goes silent as Washington Center
            responds.

                        I am at flight level one-nine-
                        zero with an icing problem.  I
                        need to descend immediately.

          And suddenly, Washington Center goes to frantic work to
          clear the path.

                                        WASHINGTON CENTER
                                (on radio)

          As the radio chatter continues,  Klein pushes the yoke
          forward, still trying to get the nose down.

          Klein glances over at Johnny.

                                        KLEIN
                        Grab that.

          Klein nods to the identical yoke in front of Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And do what?

                                        KLEIN
                        Push forward on it as hard as you
                        can.  We need to keep the nose
                        down.

          Johnny grabs the yoke and pushes forward.  The controls
          resist, but together, Klein and Johnny make some headway.

                                        WASHINGTON CENTER
                                (on radio)
                        TCA 2413, you're cleared to descend
                        to eight-thousand feet.

                          Eight-thousand.  TCA 2413.

            Suddenly, the plane drops like an elevator for a few
          seconds then lurches up as it regains some lift.  Then it
          bumps again then flies (the plane is stalling; throughout
          this scene, it will bump then fly, bump then fly, etc.)
          At the same time, the yoke in Johnny's hand starts
          vibrating.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The stick's shaking.

          A different ALARM blares.  It's a harsh and strident BRACK-
          BRACK-BRACK sound.

                                        KLEIN
                        That's the stall warning.

          Klein's right hand goes automatically to the throttles,
          then pauses, looks at Johnny, remembering the warning. 
          But this is everything he's been trained to do...

                                        KLEIN
                        We've got to get some airspeed. 
                        All my training tells me I have
                        to go to max power.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you push the starboard engine
                        to max power, it will explode.  

                                        KLEIN
                        The odds against that happening
                        are astronomical.

          The clock ticks to 10:54.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told you the time it would
                        happen.  I told you about the
                        ice.

          Klein moves his hand off the throttles.  Mind racing...

                        slats, I can get some speed...

          His hand reaches for the slats control (just to the right
          of the throttles on the pedestal)...

          Now they're going down.  The stick stops SHAKING.

                        You can let go now.

          Johnny releases the yoke, Klein maintains his hold on it. 
          The plane SURGES as they descend rapidly.

  5151INT. AIRPLANE - MAIN CABIN

          People SCREAM as the plane dives.  More people in this
          cabin means more panic.  The baby still CRIES.  But, there
          is one infinitely-calm face in the crowd.  Kelly.  She's
          back in her old seat.

          Everyone's strapped in, but their faces are white. 
          Lorraine stands at the front, holding on for dear life...
          it's a dive just like we saw in Johnny's vision...

                                        LORRAINE
                        Stay in your seats with your seat
                        belts fastened!  Please remain
                        calm.  If oxygen is needed, the
                        mask will drop.  Please remember
                        to put your own mask on before
                        helping others around you.

          As we pull back from her and down the aisle, we see...

          - Hands gripping armrests.

          - Wide frightened eyes

          Is about to be thrown to her death as we saw earlier in

          her arm and holds on... she reacts, looks to see...


          PURDY

          is the one who grabbed her...


          HER ARM

          the engagement ring showing... and we certainly recall
          seeing the dismembered arm earlier in the show.

          Both men appear to be leaning back slightly as they descend
          rapidly.

                                (under his breath)

  5555INT. AIRPLANE - COCKPIT - NIGHT (+ FORMER SCENE 58)

          The plane jerks as Klein feels a response in his controls. 
          He pulls back on the yoke and the plane begins to pull
          out of its dive.

          The horrible WHINE of a 5000 ft/minute dive eases down to
          the steady HUM of normal flight.

                                        KLEIN
                        I've got control back.
                                (laughs in disbelief)
                        It worked. 

          Johnny exhales in relief.  Klein keys his headset mic.

                        We'd like to continue to Dulles
                        to land.

          Black enters.  He nurses a cut on his forehead, but
          otherwise, he's fine.  Johnny stands to leave.  Klein
          stops him.

                                        KLEIN
                        Mr. Smith... about some of the
                          comments I made earlier...

          And exits.

          As Black settles into his seat, he notices an engine gauge. 
          He WHISTLES softly under his breath.

                        It was fine when we checked.

                                        BLACK
                        Yeah, before the descent.  Now,
                        we're losing oil quantity.   

          They pause and look at each other in simultaneous
            realization.

          People are still seated with their belts on.  The Captain's
          voice comes over the intercom.  The flight attendants are
          back on the job.  Johnny approaches his seat.

                                        KLEIN (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, this is
                        Captain Klein.  I apologize for
                        the disturbance.  We had an
                          emergency situation, but we've
                          resolved the problem.  Flight
                          attendants, prepare for landing. 

          He sits down next to Purdy and buckles his belt.  Purdy
          just stares at him for a moment.  They share a silent
          moment; no words are necessary.
