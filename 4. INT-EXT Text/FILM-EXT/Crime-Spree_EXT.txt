A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
nervously.
A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.
Daniel and Julien run towards the street.
DANIEL
Start the car! Start the car!
Raymond starts the engine.
Daniel and Julien rush across the street
and get in the back seat.
Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.
A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks
with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.
The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
he sees...
HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:
of two police officers moving
towards him .
He knows he has no more time.
He takes off running, disappearing
into the crowd.
8.
Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door
to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH.
BASTALDI
(to Daniel)
I thought I would accompany you to the
airport to say bon voyage... and tell
you that Marcel will be going with you.
DANIEL
What?
BASTALDI
This is a considerable move up for you,
Daniel. The temptation of having so
much money might be too much for you.
12.
DANIEL
You don't trust me?
BASTALDI
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to
the top of this game by trusting people...
and after all, you are a thief. It's in
your nature to steal. I'm just protecting
my investment.
Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi.
Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building.
Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each
successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are
in...
13.
An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down
buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned
cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.
TAXI DRIVER
Are you sure you guys have the right
address? This ain't no tourist area.
Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.
MARCEL
Yes.
We are sure.
The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their
bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS
appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another
two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of
the suitcases.
SAMI
Let me handle this.
LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.
SAMI
Hey, brother.
What's happening, man?
Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar.
LAMAR
Don't you brother me, motherfucker.
Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air.
He casually
lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.
LAMAR
What's in the bags?
JULIEN
Dirty underwear.
Lamar forces a laugh.
LAMAR
Dirty underwear. That's a good one.
Let me explain something to you. This
is my street and you're gonna give me
want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads
open.
Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.
RAYMOND
Lamar, violence is never an answer to
settling disputes. I can see you have a
lot of anger... but this is not the way
to get it out.
14.
LAMAR
Get outta my face!
Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an
assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.
LAMAR
Now, are you going to give me the
suitcases? Or are we going to have to
take them?
Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.
ZERO
Va te faire foutre!
LAMAR
What did he say?
DANIEL
He said to go fuck yourself.
ZERO
We are tired and bored with your bullshit.
So, put that stupid little knife away
before Zero shoves it up your ass.
LAMAR
Who is Zero?
JULIEN
He is.
LAMAR
(to Julien)
He speaks about himself in the third
person?
Julien shrugs his shoulders.
LAMAR
Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass
and take my knife from me?
ZERO
If you insist.
Zero stands up and raises his hand.
He is holding a .9mm Glock.
He aims it at Lamar's head.
Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down
the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away.
Zero aims the gun at his groin.
ZERO
Leave now before Zero shoots off those
little raisins you call balls.
Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick
up their bags and walk towards a building.
15.
Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.
SAMI
You put a loaded gun in your bag and
brought it through customs? How stupid
is that?
ZERO
Zero did not put it in his bag.
He put
it in yours.
Zero grins and walks away.
The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks.
A peep-hole in the
door is opened and an eye looks them over.
MARCEL
We are looking for Sophie.
Laurant send
us.
The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's
computer). She is late 20's, beautiful.
SAMI
(softly)
Ouh La La.
Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO
TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY
"THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they
both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers.
Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise
guy, tough as they come. He wears a well tailored suit, black
leather gloves and polished shoes.
VINNY
(frightened)
I'm sorry, Frankie.
Really.
Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito.
ZAMMITO
You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.
Vinny takes a step back.
ZAMMITO
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd
I tell you when you came to me for money?
Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I
not say that?
(to Joey)
What'd I say to him?
JOEY "TWO TONS"
You said don't do it, boss.
ZAMMITO
That's right. I said don't do it. Did
you listen to me? No. You wanted the
money. So, I lent you twenty large.
Now it's been three weeks and you ain't
paid a dime. What do you think that
makes me look like on the street? I
don't do something to you and everyone
will think they can skate.
VINNY
Frankie, I --
ZAMMITO
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me
feel bad about this. You knew what would
happen to you if you didn't pay. This
is on your head, not mine.
(to Joey and Nicky)
Break his arm.
Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes.
VINNY
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
19.
ZAMMITO
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar
of loud MUSIC.
Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC
grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a
very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several
long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE.
Behind him are two other rough-looking men.
21.
RAYMOND
(cheerfully; loudly
over the music)
Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting
next door and I was wondering if you
could make your music a little less loud.
The Biker takes a sip of his beer.
BIKER
No.
RAYMOND
But the music is very--
Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer
over Raymond's head.
BIKER
Fuck off!
He slams the door in Raymond's face.
Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He
reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.
He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.
The Biker opens the door.
BIKER
Listen asshole, I told you --
Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of
his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.
Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.
A plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city.
A car drives up. We can only see the outline of an old Chevy
Impala. Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as
they head for the liquor store.
Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but
stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard. He
looks across the street and sees the Impala.
They run out and remove their masks. RAPHAEL RUIZ, 20's, Latin,
tough, shaved head, neck covered with tattoos. HECTOR, Latin,
small, cubby, stops and stares at something with confusion.
HECTOR
Hey, Vato, where's your car?
Raphael stops as he sees the street is empty.
RAPHAEL
My car!
Hector has to grab Raphael who is too stunned to move and drag him
down the street.
The crew steps out to find Raymond in the IMPALA. We can see it
clearer now. It's a low rider car. Bright orange flames are
painted on the side, wire wheels and chrome exhaust pipes.
SAMI
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
RAYMOND
Watch this.
Raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up
and down. Sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car.
ACROSS THE STREET -- Lamar is standing in the shadows with one of
his friends, watching.
The Impala is stopped in the parking lot.
RAYMOND (V.O.)
I think we went the wrong way.
SAMI (V.O.)
Oh, you think?
MARCEL (V.O.)
The map said to go left.
JULIEN (V.O.)
Yeah and if you turned it around it would
say to go right.
MARCEL (V.O.)
(amused)
Oh yeah.
The Impala is by the pumps. Sami leans out the window holding the
map as he speaks with the station attendant.
An upscale neighborhood. Expensive homes line the wooded street.
The Impala stops and the crew gets out.
DANIEL
(to Raymond)
Park on the next street over.
We'll
meet you when we're done.
Julien attaches a device to the alarm panel. A series of numbers
flash by as the computer cracks the code. One by one, the numbers
stop until the entry code is displayed on the screen. He enters
the numbers on the alarm and nods to the others.
32.
Julien and Zero move around to the side of the house as Daniel,
Sami and Marcel wait in the shadows.
Julien places a retractable ladder against the wall and climbs up.
He pries open the window and climbs in. Zero follows.
Daniel uses a locksmith tool and quickly pries the lock out of the
door. They go inside.
Raymond waits in the Impala.
He can't resist using the hydraulics,
raising the car up and down.
The crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence.
The crew arrives to find Raymond still playing with the hydraulics
of the Impala. They get in.
The Impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the
building, out of view from the street.
The crew waits as the door is unlocked.
Wayne opens the door in a
stoned haze.
A beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing
from the tail pipe.
A motel like any other.
Sami stands outside the office with Daniel,
Raymond and Zero.
RAYMOND
How do we know what room she's in?
SAMI
Wait here.
Sami knocks. The others stand off to the side of the door. Sophie
opens the door and sees Sami. Before she can slam it he pushes it
open.
Daniel, Sami, Raymond and Zero walk to the Impala.
DANIEL
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
ZERO
You want Zero to kill him?
54.
DANIEL
I'm going to kill him myself!
ZERO
What about the money?
SAMI
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't
have time to go anywhere else before she
came here.
ZERO
We don't know that for sure.
DANIEL
Forget the money! We've got bigger
problems than the money right now.
RAYMOND
She probably hid it at her place.
The
six of us could find it in --
SAMI
(overlapping)
-- We don't have time to look for it.
Hadley's first move is going to be to
look for us there.
Daniel dials a number on his cell phone.
DANIEL
We're moving. Pack up and be on the
street in five minutes.
Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up.
Raymond hops out of the car.
RAYMOND
I would like to thank you for your
hospitality.
(hands him a card)
If you are ever in Paris here is my
number.
WAYNE
Cool.
Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car.
Daniel sees
Lamar standing across the street.
DANIEL
(to the others)
I'll be right back.
He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
56.
LAMAR
What do you want now?
DANIEL
Guns.
Can you get them?
LAMAR
Man, I can get anything.
DANIEL
Don't bullshit me.
LAMAR
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns.
I can get any kind of gun you want. But
they ain't gonna help your sorry ass.
You ain't been in town one day and already
you got two of the toughest people in
Chicago looking for you. How is that
possible?
DANIEL
I've got a way with people.
LAMAR
I can see that. The man's car you stole.
Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th
Street gang and one crazy motherfucker.
And Frankie Zammito's got the word out
he's looking for some French dudes.
You're French ain't ya?
DANIEL
I'm from Belgium.
LAMAR
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was
you. You know Zammito just put his own
brother in the hospital? Broke his arm
cause he was late on a debt. I mention
this to illustrate the kind of people
who are lookin' for you.
DANIEL
Why haven't you turned us in?
LAMAR
I ain't no rat.
(beat)
You got money, right?
Daniel nods.
LAMAR
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you
a commission... kind of like a brokerage
fee.
57.
DANIEL
How much?
LAMAR
A thousand dollars?
DANIEL
Fine.
Daniel hands him his cell phone.
DANIEL
Take this. I'll call you in a few hours.
You tell me where we meet.
A MAID stops her cart in front of room fourteen.
She KNOCKS.
MAID
Maid service.
No answer. She uses her key and steps into the room.
A beat.
We
hear a loud scream.
HOLIDAY HOTEL -- EVENING
A large building near the freeway.
A Lincoln Town Car drives up. Zammito gets out with Joey "Two
Tons" and Nicky "The Rake. They wait outside. Zammito enters.
Zammito steps out onto the street. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
Rake" are pitching pennies against the wall. They start arguing
about something.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
Frankie, come here a second.
Zammito walks over.
NICKY "THE RAKE"
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
ZAMMITO
(impatiently)
Get in the car.
NICKY "THE RAKE"
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
Zammito grabs him by the neck and smashes his face into the wall.
ZAMMITO
You are!
Now get in the fuckin' car!
Both men walk to the car. Zammito starts after them, then stops.
He turns back, picks up the coins and puts them in his pocket.
Sami passes the shop. He stops. In the window is BLACK CANVAS
BAG that is identical to the one that they used on the job. He
goes into the store.
An old building that has seen better days.
Daniel and Zero get
out of a Taxi and go inside.
Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He
stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope.
DANIEL
There's ten grand in here. It's yours.
I'm going to call you again. There's
one more thing I need you to do.
LAMAR
What?
DANIEL
I'll tell you when it's time.
In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black
guy as he finds Ellwood's body.
69.
Several low-rider cars are parked on the street.
Raphael and Hector
are with several GANG MEMBERS.
GANG MEMBER
I ain't seen it your car. Sorry man.
Hey, you know who you should talk to is
Freddy O.
RAPHAEL
I thought he was in prison.
GANG MEMBER
Got out last month. He's trying to go
straight but he's still wired in.
(More)
72.
GANG MEMBER (Cont'd)
He's working at some restaurant. I'll
find out where and call you.
A Lincoln pulls up. Zammito gets out and walks over to three
WISEGUYS in another Town Car. One of the Wiseguys points to the
window of the rental agency. Zammito looks at Raymond and Julien.
ZAMMITO
I don't know the little one, but the
other guy is definitely one of them.
Follow them and call me when you find
out where they go.
Zammito walks back to his car and drives off.
73.
An EMPLOYEE drives up in a CADILLAC DE VILLE.
He gets out and
Julien grabs the keys from him.
JULIEN
(in French)
I'll drive.
RAYMOND
(in French)
I'm the driver.
JULIEN
(in French)
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat.
The Cadillac moves down the street.
The Lincoln follows a few
cars behind them.
Agent Hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses.
As he approaches, Sami steps out.
SAMI
You set me up, you piece of shit!
Hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him.
SAMI
What are you doing?
AGENT HADLEY
You think I'm going to talk to you until
I know if you're wired.
SAMI
Wired?
I ain't wired.
74.
Sami lifts up his shirt showing Hadley his bare chest.
He drops
his pants down to his ankles.
AGENT HADLEY
Okay.
Okay.
I believe you.
SAMI
You killed her!
AGENT HADLEY
No. You killed her. Manager remembers
you going into her room. Your
fingerprints were found all over the
place.
SAMI
Bullshit! She was alive when we left
her with you.
AGENT HADLEY
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.
That's
why you're here.
SAMI
Look, I just want out of this nightmare.
I don't know these guys. A few days ago
I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm
America's most wanted.
AGENT HADLEY
Where are the tapes?
SAMI
I can get them -- but what do I get if I
do?
AGENT HADLEY
A pass.
SAMI
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass?
A witness can put me at the crime scene.
AGENT HADLEY
Witness' can be convinced they made a
mistake. Without the murder weapon the
D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
SAMI
They don't have a murder weapon?
AGENT HADLEY
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with
your fingerprints and her blood on it?
(holds up his burned
hand)
Remember?
75.
Sami is stunned, then his thoughts snap back to...
CUT TO:
Sami stares angrily at Hadley who appears to be enjoying his
frustration.
AGENT HADLEY
Of course they could always get an
anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster
behind the motel.
Sami stares at him a long moment.
SAMI
You want the tapes for yourself.
You're
going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
money. Find me a small country that
doesn't have an extradition treaty with
the States and live the good life.
SAMI
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY
Yes I did.
Lose ends are messy.
SAMI
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
AGENT HADLEY
When this is over you can say whatever
the hell you want. I'll be long gone.
Besides, who's going to believe you?
You're just a two-bit crook.
SAMI
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't
pretend to be something different than
what I am.
Hadley hands him a card.
76.
AGENT HADLEY
When you've got the tapes call me on
this number. We'll make the exchange
and that'll be the end of it.
Hadley leaves.
Julien drives the Cadillac along the North River.
The Lincoln
keeps pace with them several cars behind.
The Cadillac cuts across the right lane almost hitting a car and
turns onto another street. The Lincoln makes a sharp move to stay
up with it.
The Cadillac speeds down the street, weaving in and out of traffic.
The Lincoln does the same. The Cadillac reaches an intersection.
The traffic ahead of them is stopped for a red light. The Cadillac
veers onto the sidewalk. Pedestrians jump out of the way and the
car streaks down the pavement. Behind the Lincoln follows.
The Cadillac screeches around the corner, onto a ONE WAY STREET.
The oncoming traffic veers off. Cars collide. The Lincoln clips
a car, loses control for a moment, then continues after them. At
the corner the Cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic
in the right direction.
The Lincoln moves up along side the Cadillac. Two WISEGUYS lean
out the window with guns in their hands. The Cadillac veers away
just as they start shooting. Bullets riddle the car.
The Cadillac turns the corner. The Lincoln follows. The traffic
is heavier here. The cars have to slow down. The Lincoln moves
beside them again. Raymond fires his last shot. His gun his now
empty. Several rounds of gun fire come from the Lincoln.
Julien steers the caddy onto another street.
The towncar follows.
The Lincoln slams on it's brakes in the middle of an intersection.
Raymond is dazed from his fall. He gets up slowly, his pants torn
and sees..
P.O.V. RAYMOND OF THE TOWNCAR -- DAY
The driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and
is just about to shoot when...
Julien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes
into the Lincoln. The impact sends the Lincoln spinning around.
When it stops the driver's window is facing the front of the caddy.
The driver of the caddy takes aim and fires.
The bullet goes
through the windshield and kills Julien.
The driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see...
P.O.V. A LARGE TRUCK -- DAY
Speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the
Lincoln. It crumbles like a toy under the weight.
79.
Raymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic.
He stares sadly at Julien.
Tow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars.
Only a few POLICE CARS are there.
81.
A UNIFORMED COP looks over and sees Joey "Two Tons" on the sidewalk.
Joey motions with his head to an alley.
The Uniformed Cop enters the alley and joins Joey.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
What'd you guys find?
UNIFORMED COP
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln
are your... associates.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
And the other car?
UNIFORMED COP
Some French guy. At least that's what
his passport said. You know Joey, I
shouldn't be talking to you about this.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
Are you forgetting who supplements your
income?
UNIFORMED COP
No. It's just that the French guy had a
gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is
a homicide. Are you guys involved in
this?
JOEY "TWO TONS"
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full
confession later. Right now, tell me
what else you found?
UNIFORMED COP
A Wallet.
A hotel room card.
Some cash.
This sparks Joey's interest.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
What hotel?
UNIFORMED COP
The Holiday Hotel.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
What room number?
UNIFORMED COP
I don't know.
I didn't look.
JOEY "TWO TONS"
Go look.
82.
A group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate.
Sami steps outside.
Daniel is staring at him.
SAMI
What?
DANIEL
Can I trust you, Sami?
SAMI
Hey, who warned you that they were coming
up to the room?
DANIEL
If they had taken us by surprise they
would have gotten the tapes back. That
would have left us with nothing.
SAMI
No, that would have left me with nothing
because all of you would be dead.
DANIEL
You haven't answered my question.
SAMI
Does it really matter what I say?
DANIEL
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm
trusting you to do the right thing today.
SAMI
I will.
DANIEL
You better.
Daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell.
Half Tooth
Tony opens the door and looks him up and down.
HALF TOOTH TONY
Yeah?
92.
DANIEL
I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.
HALF TOOTH TONY
Who the hell are you?
DANIEL
Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie
Zammito.
Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone
and dials. A taxi pulls up.
SAMI
Same place.
One hour.
Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away.
A beat.
A moment later
another taxi pulls up. Daniel gets out.
Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box.
Sami
walks towards him holding the black canvas bag.
SAMI
What the fuck was all that about at the
hotel last night? I thought we had a
deal?
AGENT HADLEY
Hey, you're not exactly the most
trustworthy guy in the world. I took a
shot. It didn't work. Did you bring
the tapes?
Sami holds up the canvas bag.
SAMI
The lamp?
Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base.
Sami hands him the canvas bag.
95.
AGENT HADLEY
Just a second. You must think I'm a
real moron.
Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.
He picks
a tape and inserts it into the player.
ZAMMITO'S VOICE
I just came by to tell that "piece of
work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks --
It's done.
BONANNO'S VOICE
Good.
How'd he go?
ZAMMITO'S VOICE
Like the crying rat bastard that he was.
Hadley stops the tape.
He inserts another one.
ZAMMITO'S VOICE
Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this
guy. He's a congressman.
BONANNO'S VOICE
I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We
pay him each month to look after our
interests.
Hadley grins.
This is great stuff.
He looks up at Sami.
AGENT HADLEY
Here you go, sport.
Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and
walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops
out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.
LAMAR
I'll take the bag.
AGENT HADLEY
You don't think I see through this?
You
tell Sami he's dead.
One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his
gun, then takes his wallet.
AGENT HADLEY
You're making a big mistake.
I'm an FBI
agent.
Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
the canvas bag.
Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there
fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.
ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE
96.
Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag.
As Lamar
passes they quickly exchange bags.
From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue
as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.
Lamar's buddies are already at the street.
LAMAR'S BUDDIES
C'mon, man!
Let's get out of here.
Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked.
He runs
off leaving the bag laying on the grass.
ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.
ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as
Hadley walks off in the other direction.
Daniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar.
SAMI
See, I told you that you could trust me.
Daniel grins and pats him on the back.
LAMAR
Okay, we're square now, right?
DANIEL
There's just one more thing I need you
to do.
Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills.
LAMAR
I'm listening.
Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" rush to the car carrying a briefcase.
Raymond knocks on the door.
Vinny answers it, his arm in sling.
RAYMOND
Mr. Zammito?
VINNY
Uh huh.
RAYMOND
I represent a person who wishes to remain
anonymous, but is aware of your current
financial problems with your brother.
VINNY
I don't know what you're talking about.
RAYMOND
I understand. The person who sent me
wishes to help you.
VINNY
How?
RAYMOND
You see that car?
Vinny looks on the street and sees the Impala.
VINNY
Yeah.
RAYMOND
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could
give to your brother... or anyone you
owe money to as partial payment.
VINNY
No shit?
RAYMOND
The papers for the car will arrive
tomorrow.
99.
MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY
An old building, dirty windows and peeling paint.
The main door
is open.
The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building.
WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
Pictures show, second balcony, was the
place we'd meet...
Through the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills
with gunfire.
100.
WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
... second seat, go Dutch treat, you
were so sweet...
Zammito's Lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the
street.
Sami, Marcel and Raymond help Zero out of the taxi and towards a
small plane. Off to the side Bonanno is standing with Half Tooth
Tony. Daniel walks over to him.
BONANNO
This plane will take you to Canada.
From there you can fly back to Paris.
DANIEL
Thank you.
BONANNO
You have something for me?
Daniel hands him the cassette case with half the tapes. Bonanno
hands it to Half Tooth Tony who takes them into the car and listens
to a tape.
HALF TOOTH TONY
They're good, boss.
BONANNO
And the other half of the tapes?
DANIEL
You have my word. I'll destroy them.
The Lincoln pulls up. Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" get out.
Vinny
is waiting beside the Impala.
ZAMMITO
What's this?
101.
VINNY
A car.
ZAMMITO
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a
sewing machine. What the hell is it
doing here?
VINNY
It's for you.
ZAMMITO
For me? What am I going to do with a
piece of shit like this?
VINNY
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be
worth something. Someone gave it to me.
C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good
here.
ZAMMITO
Okay.
Okay.
VINNY
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Vinny starts to walk away.
ZAMMITO
(yelling after him)
Hey, if you're well enough to be walking
around you're well enough to start working
here.
A gang hang out. Raphael is with several hard-looking gang-bangers.
Lamar arrives with two of his friends.
RAPHAEL
You lost?
LAMAR
Don't come off like a hard-on with me.
I'm about to make you a very happy man.
Several Gang Bangers stand around their low rider cars. Sananta's
"Oye Como Va" plays loudly on one of the radios. Raphael talks
heatedly with several of the gang bangers.
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
Music continues as several gang members check their guns.
102.
The Santana song continues as several car loads of Gang Bangers
drive down the street.
Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street.
He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune.
JERRY VALE'S VOICE
My love, please kiss me...
Zammito turns around to see
ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through
the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.
The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.
He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.
The Lincoln speeds off down the street.
JERRY VALE'S VOICE
Arrivederci amore kiss me...
Jerry Vale continues singing as the plane glides through a clear
blue sky. Music fades.
DISSOLVE TO:
Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air.
He takes a few
steps, then stops.
BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
stare at Bastaldi.
A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.
When it passes
the crew it gone!
Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.
Bastaldi looks around, but there
is no sign of them.
A DIFFERENT ANGLE
We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel
peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure
out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's
bewilderment.
RAYMOND
What's he doing?
105.
MARCEL
He's looking around for us.
ZERO
Zero can't stay like this much longer.
His leg is hurting.
Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment.
Bastaldi drives up.
He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously
walks to the boat.
Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat.
Daniel continues his
conversation on the cell phone.
DANIEL
(in French)
Put the money in the rowboat and untie
it. The current will carry it down river.
When we see that the money is there I'll
call back and tell you where the tapes
are.
DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in
the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.
The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel
is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long
pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside
are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to
Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.
Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat.
Sami's
cell phone rings. He answers it and listens.
RAYMOND (V.O.)
We're in business.
Sami nods to Daniel.
Bastaldi's cell phone rings.
He answers it.
DANIEL (V.O.)
(in French)
Go down into the main cabin.
The tapes
are in the wooden chest.
107.
The line goes dead.
Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts
flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.
DANIEL
This is for Julien.
He presses the button.
The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of
wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke
swirls in the wind.
Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering
wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that
justice has been done.
SAMI
Did you have to use that much explosive?
DANIEL
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.
DANIEL
You didn't check it?
108.
The five of them walk across the bridge.
MARCEL
I'm sorry! I was caught up in the
excitement of the moment. I should have
checked. I made a mistake. I suppose
that none of you have ever made a mistake
before?
No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.
SAMI
This is great. After everything we've
been through we've got eight hundred
euros and an autographed baseball.
MARCEL
The baseball is mine.
SAMI
No! You can't have the baseball! You're
not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.
MARCEL
I'm the one who took it.
It's my
baseball!
ZERO
If you say baseball one more time Zero
will shoot you.
MARCEL
Raymond, don't you think they're over
reacting a little?
RAYMOND
No. I think they have a right to express
their anger with you in light of the
fact that you're...
(something in him
snaps)
A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK
THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!
Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise.
Even Raymond is
surprised by his outburst.
MARCEL
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be
angry... but I'm the one who took the
ball and that makes it mine.
SAMI
No.
109.
MARCEL
Give it to me, Sami.
SAMI
No!
Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
off the bridge into the river.
SAMI
Perfect.
Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
Something catches Daniel's attention.
DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
twelve sunflowers".
Daniel's jaw drops.
The others notice his stunned expression and
follow his stare.
THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.
They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.
They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.
They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all
jump off the bridge. As they fall towards the water we...
