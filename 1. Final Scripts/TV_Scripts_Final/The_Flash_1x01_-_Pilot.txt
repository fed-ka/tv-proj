11FROM THE BLACK:  

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    To understand what I m about to 
                    tell you, you need to do something 
                    first...  you need to believe in 
                    the impossible.  Can you do that?  

      FADE UP ON: A BUSTLING CITY -- MODERN SKYSCRAPERS reaching up 
      to a BLUE SKY above -- THE SUN warming everything below --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    Good.  Now, imagine you could run 
                    faster than the speed of sound.  

      PEDESTRIANS speed-walking to work, heads down, TEXTING, 
      TALKING INTO PHONES, a CACOPHONY of VOICES -- RUNNERS jogging 
      -- A BUS KIOSK advertising  HI-SPEED INTERNET...  --  

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    That s approximately 765 miles-per-
                    hour.  Over a thousand feet per 
                    second.    

      TAXIS and CARS HURTLE down the streets -- HORNS HONKING -- 
      the world and everyone in it move at hyper speed -- 

      THIS IS CENTRAL CITY -- WHERE EVERYONE IS ON THE GO --

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY STREETS - DAY22

      CLOSE ON: A TRAFFIC SIGN -- WE VE SEEN THE WORDS A MILLION 
      TIMES --  SLOW AHEAD. 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    I am that fast.  

      And then we see something we haven t seen a million times -- 
      as the CARS speed down the busy street -- something speeds 
      past them -- a CRIMSON BLUR -- a FLASH of ELECTRICITY -- what 
      the hell was that?  

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    And the faster I go... the more the 
                    world slows down.   

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY SQUARE - DAY33

      Central City s version of TIMES SQUARE -- JAMMED WITH CARS 
      and CITIZENS -- A GIANT LED SCREEN flashing an AD for  SPEED 
      DATING!   Into this maelstrom of motion -- when --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      2.

        CONTINUED:33

      THE WORLD SUDDENLY STOPS!  The people -- the cars -- the 
      flags blowing in the wind -- EVERYTHING FREEZES -- (this 
      effect will come to be known as  FLASH TIME ) 

      But the world isn t really frozen -- this is how our HERO 
      experiences time -- everything so slow -- except him -- and 
      we finally glimpse the blur -- A MAN -- in RED -- he takes in 
      the city, watching, observing.  

      We move to our HERO S FACE -- eyes peer through the ICONIC 
      COWL -- SPARKS in his pupils -- confident grin on his face -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    I have the ability, to move through 
                    my city like a guardian angel...  

      A BIKE MESSENGER -- talking on his CELL -- stacked PACKAGES 
      blocking his view -- runs a RED LIGHT -- a TAXI threatens -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    To make sure no one loses someone 
                    like I did... 

      The same FLASH OF LIGHT ROARS by -- FLIES OVER THE TAXI -- 
      the bewildered Messenger and his bike are suddenly on the 
      street corner -- each RECEIPT stamped:  DELIVERED

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    I am the fastest man alive. 
                          (beat)
                    But I m getting ahead of myself.

      As he shifts himself into the next gear -- we re BLINDED BY 
      THE YELLOW ELECTRICITY exploding from the symbol as THE 
      SCARLET SPEEDSTER RACES FORWARD!

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    It all started that day nine months 
                    ago.  

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY - ALLEY - NIGHT44

      CLOSE ON:  Our hero -- BARRY ALLEN -- getting SMACKED IN the 
      face by a LAPTOP BAG -- Hard --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    Actually, earlier that day... 

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY STREETS - DAY55

      Barry racing down a CROWDED street -- lugging his METAL 
      SUITCASE with him -- winded -- COLLIDING with PEDESTRIANS --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    As usual, I was late...

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY BANK - DAY66

      POLICE TAPE cordons off the crime scene -- A SEA OF UNIFORMED 
      OFFICERS corral the area as two DETECTIVES emerge from the 
      bank -- JOE WEST (50) -- good cop, good man -- salt-of-the-
      earth and seen-it-all -- he walks with his partner, FRED 
      CHYRE (50) --  out of shape  would be a kind description.

                    Then for a chaser, they shot Mr. 
                    Brian Cunningham here.  

      They look at the TARP-COVERED BODY --

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY - STREETS - DAY77

      Barry -- still running -- KNOCKS into a WOMAN carrying 
      GROCERIES -- BOXES, CANS and FRUIT hit the pavement -- Barry 
      has to stop and help her re-bag her fallen food -- 

                                  BARRY
                    I am so sorry.

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY BANK - DAY88

      Back with West, Chyre and Singh -- 

                                  SINGH
                      Detective, you can t keep covering 
                    for him.  If he s not here --

                                  BARRY (O.S.)
                    Sorry, I m late, Captain Singh. 

      They turn -- Barry FLASHES his BADGE -- ducks the tape -- 

                                  SINGH
                    At least you re consistent.  What 
                    was it this time, Mr. Allen?  Did 
                    you forget to set your alarm?  
                    Before you answer, I should remind 
                    you, that the excuse you used last 
                    time was car trouble.  Want to know 
                    why that one was particularly 
                      memorable?

                                  BARRY
                    I don t own a car.

                                  SINGH
                    So which is it?  Are you just a 
                    giant flake?  Or are you off doing 
                    something I wouldn t approve of?

      Barry isn t fast enough with an excuse -- 

                                  DET. WEST
                    He was running an errand for me.  
                          (turns)
                    Barry, did you get me what I asked 
                    for?

                                  BARRY
                    Uh... yeah... I, um... I have it 
                    right here.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      5.

      Barry checks his pockets -- searching -- pulls out a HALF-
      EATEN CANDY BAR -- sheepishly hands it to West -- 

                                  BARRY
                    I may have had a few bites.  

                                  SINGH
                    Impress us with your forensic 
                    acumen, Mr. Allen.  

      Suddenly in the spotlight, Barry sees the BODY on the 
      sidewalk.  He lifts the tarp -- begins to examine --  

                                  BARRY
                    Multiple gunshots to the chest...  
                    You ll want to notify his wife.  He 
                    was married.    

                                  DET. CHYRE
                    There was no wedding ring.  

      Barry points to a RED SCAR visible under the man s shirt --

                                  BARRY
                    He s had heart surgery.  Fairly 
                    recently.  A side effect of which 
                    can be edema -- fluid retention.  

      Barry reaches into the man s shirt -- pulls out A WEDDING 
      RING ON A CHAIN -- West smiles to Singh -- the kid s good -- 
      Barry moves over to the TIRE MARKS on the ground -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Getaway car is a Corvette.  
                      Corvette s have a rear super wide 
                    tire.  Specific to that model.  12 
                    inches.  I wear a size eleven shoe.  
                    I just added an inch.  And there s 
                    something else...

      Barry takes Chyre s pen and picks at a STICKY BROWN SUBSTANCE 
      on the pavement -- sniffs it -- winces --

                                  BARRY
                    Fecal excrement.  Animal, I d

                                  DET. CHYRE
                    My dad gave me that pen.  Before he 
                    died.

      Singh gets right up in Barry s face -- 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      6.

      Singh walks away, pissed -- Off West, staring at Barry -- 

99EXT. CENTRAL CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER 

      West and Barry, just past the crime scene, the streets are 
      FILLING UP with PEOPLE.  In the distance we can see a clear 
      view of S.T.A.R. LABS.  A GLEAMING GLASS and STEEL STRUCTURE.

                          (busted)
                    I spent a few days in Starling 
                    City.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    You can t keep ducking work so you 
                    can go off chasing down one of 
                    these urban legends. 

                                  BARRY
                    There were reports of a man in 
                    Starling who could bend steel with 
                    his bare hands.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    Yeah.  And last month, you took off 
                    to Blue Valley because you heard 
                    about a girl who could defy 
                    gravity.  

                                  BARRY
                    You know why this is important to 
                    me.  I have to figure out what 
                    happened to her.

                                  DET. WEST
                    You know what killed your mother, 
                    Barry.  You just won t accept it.  

                                  BARRY
                    I know no one believes me about 
                    what happened that night, Joe.  But 
                    I ve always wished you did.

      The great mystery of Barry Allen s life hangs in the air 
      between them for a beat -- and then West puts a comforting 
      hand on Barry s shoulder --

                                  DET. WEST
                    Get yourself back to the lab.  Have 
                    that... specimen analyzed. 

                                  BARRY
                    The S.T.A.R. Labs event is in a few 
                    hours.  I was supposed to go with 
                    Iris. 

      The look on West s face is all the answer Barry needs -- but 
      for further clarification --

                                  BARRY
                    But not while the Mardon brothers 
                    are still on the loose.  I get it.

      West walks off -- Off Barry, looking at S.T.A.R. Labs --  

      INT. CENTRAL CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT - BULLPEN - DAY1010

      A bustling hive of activity -- COPS, DETECTIVES, PERPS and 
      LAWYERS all zipping about -- through the throng, we find:

      IRIS -- 25, a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN -- carrying a TAKE-OUT 
      TRAY OF COFFEE, a LAPTOP BAG slung over her shoulder -- 
      everyone knows her, says hi, as she makes her way --

                                  UNIFORMED OFFICER 
                    Hey, Iris!  One of those for me?

                    I don t know, Iris.  Your Rockets 
                    aren t looking so good.  Not sure 
                    they can cover the spread.

                    Keep betting those paychecks on the 
                    Combines, Chyre.  You ll be able to 
                    retire when you re ninety.  

      Iris reaches Det. West -- puts one coffee on his desk -- and 
      we suddenly get why she s well known at the station house --

                    I have the week off to work on my 
                      dissertation.  I picked up some 
                    extra shifts at the coffee shop.  
                    Found myself in possession of a 
                    double cap, no foam, one sugar.

                                  BARRY
                    There was a shooting today.  Your 
                    dad needs me to process some 
                    evidence.  Which means I don t know 
                    if we can go to S.T.A.R. Labs.  

                                  IRIS
                    But seeing this thing go on is like 
                    your dream.  Your sad little, nerdy

                                  BARRY
                    I prefer  geek  to  nerd. 

                                  IRIS

                    If I don t graduate soon, I m going 
                    to be more muffin top than woman.  

                                  BARRY
                    Please.  You look amazing.  

      The way Barry looks at her -- it s clear he s smitten -- 

                                  IRIS
                    Which would be a compliment, except 
                    you re Barry.  Which means your 
                    opinion of my looks is meaningless.

      Iris looks out the window at the skyline -- another shot of   
      -- the world s grandest testament to science: S.T.A.R. LABS

                                  IRIS
                    What s so important about this 
                    Particle Accelerator anyway?   

                                  BARRY
                    Only everything.  Harrison Wells  
                    work in Quantum Theory is light 
                    years ahead of anything they re 
                    doing at CERN.  

                                  IRIS
                    You re doing that thing where 
                    you re not speaking English.

      Barry goes to the DRY ERASE BOARD -- DRAWS A DOT -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Imagine this dot is everything the 
                    Human race has ever learned until

                    Does that include twerking?

      Undeterred, Barry DRAWS a GIANT CIRCLE around the dot -- 

                                  BARRY
                    That is everything we can learn 
                    from the particle accelerator.  
                    It s a whole new way of looking at

                    his getaway vehicle, it was cow 
                    manure.  There are ten dairy farms 
                    within a hundred mile radius of 
                    Central City.  But there was also 
                    trace elements of Oxytetracycline, 
                    an antibiotic.  Only four farms 
                    still pump their cattle full of 
                      antibiotics.  Bet you find a really

      EXCITED OBSERVERS and REPORTERS outnumber the PROTESTORS ten-

      The crowd CHEERS (some BOOS) cutting Barry off as HARRISON 
      WELLS (40) strides onto the stage with a smile -- He s Steve 
      Jobs and Elon Musk rolled into one -- and this is his day -- 
      he is flanked by several YOUNG SCIENTISTS we will meet later.

                    work my team and I do here will 
                    change our understanding of 
                    physics.  It will help us bring 
                    about advancements in power and 
                    medicine.  I want to live in that

      Suddenly -- Barry s shoved aside by a THIEF (late teens) -- 
      the Thief grabs Iris s LAPTOP BAG -- runs off --

                    My laptop!  It s got my dissertation!

      Barry doesn t hesitate -- he takes off after the Thief --

      Barry, huffing and puffing, tries to keep up as the Thief 
      turns around a corner -- Barry rounds it --

      -- and GETS WHACKED in the face by Iris  laptop -- catching 
      us up to the scene we saw at the top of Act One -- before the 
      Thief can take off again --

                    Hey man, you don t want to do this.  
                    Just give me back my friend s bag.  
                    And we ll call it even.  

      The Thief looks like he might do the right thing... until 
      Barry reaches for it -- and THWACK!  The Thief takes Barry 
      out with a FEW QUICK PUNCHES -- Barry goes down just as Iris

      freedom when -- CLICK!  The Thief looks down to see --

      GUNSHOTS ricochet off the farm equipment forcing the cops to 
      take cover -- we get a good look at CLYDE MARDON (late 20 s,

                                  BARRY 
                    Or something else...

      Barry approaches the clock --the SECOND HAND moves -- the 
      AMBIENT SOUND in the room changes -- Barry looks at the 
      computer, confused -- RECORD TIME: 00:00:01 --

      Barry hits PLAYBACK -- a BLURRED IMAGE -- A BRIEF HIGH-
      PITCHED sound -- Barry types -- PLAYBACK set at one tenth of 
      the speed -- hits PLAYBACK again -- it s still distorted, but 
      BARRY S VOICE is now audible -- and he sees himself moving 
      around the room -- impossibly -- in the blink of a second --

      Then Barry realizes -- the lab is a mess -- papers strewn, 
      chairs knocked over -- the truth now unassailable --

                    The world s not slowing down... I m

    Off Barry, what the hell is going on?

      Barry emerges from the station house -- every nerve in his 
      body tingling -- as if his body were a race car at the 
      starting line -- desperate for motion... 

      And so Barry puts his weight on his toes -- leans down -- a 
      tiny SPARK in his eye -- an ignition... and then --

      FTHWOOM!  Like a bullet FIRED from a gun -- Barry hurtles out 
      of the alley at a hundred miles an hour -- SHATTERING a

      EXT. FERRIS AIR - TEST FIELD - DAY3838

      Nothing but flat arid OVERGROWN TARMACS in all directions -- 
      a gleaming stainless steel S.T.A.R. Labs MOBILE UNIT is 
      parked in the wide expanse -- Wells, Caitlin, Cisco and 
      Hartley, at their stations, look down from the truck.  

                                    HARTLEY
                    This is a joke.  There s no way he 
                    can run that fast.  This is a 
                    complete waste of time.

                    We ve been wasting the last nine

      Cisco calls out to someone behind the truck --

                                  CISCO
                    How does it fit?  

      A beat of anticipation -- as we wait for Barry Allen to step 
      out -- dressed as the iconic superhero -- but instead --

      Barry comes into view wearing an ILL-FITTING HELMET with 
      GOGGLES -- RUNNER S SHIRT, SHORTS, ELBOW and KNEE PADS, a 
      MONITORING BAND around his bicep, and RIDICULOUSLY SOLED 
      BOOTS WITH TREADS -- FAR FROM the Flash... for now.

                                  CISCO
                    At least you ll be moving so fast

                    Ferris Air sold it off.  There was

      Cisco hands Barry a SMALL GOLD HEADSET with an ANTENNA -- 

                                  CISCO
                    This is a two-way headset with a 
                    camera I modified, typically 
                    designed to combat battlefield 
                    impulse noise, or in your case, a 
                    potential sonic boom.

                                  BARRY
                    Maybe you guys should cover your 
                    ears.

      Hartley flares as Cisco moves off -- Barry turns to Caitlin -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Something I said?

                                    CAITLIN
                    Hartley s deaf.
                          (off Barry s surprise)
                    The night of the explosion, he lost 
                    his hearing. 

                                  BARRY
                    It doesn t seem like he s --

                                    CAITLIN
                    He designed a cochlear device that 
                    restored partial hearing.  It s not 
                    the same.  And it left him in a 
                    perpetual state of being unpleasant 
                    to be around.   

                                  BARRY
                    I notice you don t smile too much.  

                                    CAITLIN
                    My once promising career in 
                      bioengineering is over, my boss is 
                    in a wheelchair for life, and that

                    What happened out there today?  You 
                    were moving pretty well when 
                    something caused you to lose focus.  

                                  BARRY
                    For some reason... I started 
                      remembering something. 
                          (a beat, never easy)
                    When I was eleven, my mother was 
                    murdered.  It was late.  A sound 
                    woke me up.  I came downstairs and 
                    I... I saw what looked like a ball 
                    of lightning.  Inside the 
                      lightning, I saw a man.  He killed 
                    my mother.  They arrested my dad... 
                    he s still sitting in Iron Heights 
                    for her murder.  
                          (then)
                    Everyone, the cops, the shrinks, 
                    they all told me what I saw was 
                      impossible.  But what if the man 
                    who killed my mother was like me?     

                                  WELLS
                    I think I can say unequivocally 
                    that you are one of a kind.

      Barry looks on as Wells continues --

                                  WELLS
                      Anti-matter, Dark energy, x-

                                  BARRY
                    Those are all theoretical.

                                    HARTLEY
                    How theoretical are you?

                                  BARRY
                    That s the real reason you kept 
                    this place open.  To find them.

                                  WELLS
                    And you were the first.

      Wells types, a MAP OF CENTRAL CITY appears on the monitor -- 
      glowing white spots blink on -- a large one in the center -- 

                                  WELLS
                    We mapped the dispersion throughout 
                    Central City, though we have no 
                    real way of identifying exactly who 
                    or what was exposed -- we ve been 
                    searching for other meta-humans 
                    like yourself.

                                  BARRY

                    he can control the weather.

      Barry looks up -- A CITY SKYLINE -- on the roadside, a LARGE 
      SIGN reads  Welcome To Starling City.

      Overlooking the city -- as we realize the VOICE OVER we heard 
      at the beginning has been Barry speaking to someone...

                                  BARRY
                    I ve spent my whole life searching 
                    for what might have killed my mom. 
                    Searching for the impossible.... 
                    Never imagining I would become the 
                      impossible.   

      The camera PANS OFF Barry -- coming around to find -- A 
      HOODED FIGURE -- all in DARK GREEN -- A BOW in his hand -- 
      his mask down -- it is OLIVER QUEEN -- AKA THE ARROW -- 

                                  ARROW
                    So why come to me?  Something tells 
                    me you didn t just run six hundred

                    bad guy and... someone died.

                    If you do this, you re going to make 
                    mistakes.  I have.  But the good you 
                    do will far outweigh the bad.

                    right?  What if I m not a hero, 
                    what if I m just a guy who was 
                    struck by lightning?

                                  ARROW

                    struck you, Barry.  I think it 
                    chose you.

                    can give people hope in a way I

                    city like a guardian angel.  Making 
                      a difference, saving people... in a 
                    flash.  

      Yeah, Oliver just said that...

                    Wear a mask.

      With that, the Arrow NOCKS an ARROW and FIRES -- THWIKT! -- a 
      CABLE trails after the arrow -- which pierces a nearby CRANE  
      -- The Arrow LEAPS off the roof -- Barry smiles --

      Then, Barry turns and super-speeds away --

      Where the Arrow has landed -- looking down and seeing Barry 
      ZOOM DOWN the street -- Arrow can t help but smile.

                    killed Clyde and Mark Mardon.  
                    Neither of their bodies were 
                      recovered.  Plotting a course from 
                    their takeoff would have put them

                      dispersion caused by the explosion 
                    here.  They got a full taste of

                    Your meta-humans have been busy.
                    I m not blaming you.  I know you 
                    didn t mean for any of this to 
                    happen.  I know you all lost 
                      something.   But I need your help 
                    to catch Mardon.  And anyone else 
                    out there like him. 

      Barry looks to them.  Are you guys with me?

                    This whole city s been angry and

                    came out of it.  I m with you, bro.

      Hartley turns to Caitlin -- sees she s wavering --

                    For the past nine months I have

                      tri-polymer, it s heat and abrasive 
                    resistant so when you re moving at 
                      high-velocity speeds, it won t 
                    shred like your normal clothing.

                          (off his tablet)
                    I ve been tracking meteorological 
                      abnormalities over Central City.  I  
                    just got a ping from the S.T.A.R. 
                    Labs satellite.  Atmospheric 
                    pressure dropped 20 millibars in a 
                    matter of seconds.

                                  BARRY
                    Where?

6666EXT. BROWN DAIRY FARM - NIGHT 

      Det. West and Det. Thawne s CAR pulls up -- no sign of Mardon 
      or any other car -- the cops alight -- 

                                  DET. WEST
                    I m not saying Mardon s alive, but 
                    if he was, this was the last place 
                    he and his brother hid out.  

                                  DET. THAWNE
                    Why would he come back here?

                                  DET. WEST
                    Criminals are creatures of habit.  

      They draw their GUNS as they hear A CREAK from THE BARN -- 

      INT. BROWN DAIRY FARM - BARN - NIGHT6767

      West and Thawne enter, GUNS raised -- BALES OF HAY everywhere 
      -- they see Mardon standing alone -- his back to them -- 

                                  DET. WEST
                    Put your hands on your head.  Get 
                    down on the ground.  Do it.

                                  MARDON
                          (unconcerned)
                    You got me.

      Mardon complies -- as West FRISKS Mardon -- 

                                  MARDON 
                    I can almost hear it talking to me.  
                    The wind.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      49.

                    Shut the hell up.  

      Then, suddenly, HAY on the ground flutters from a cold breeze 
      -- the breeze becoming A HARSH WIND -- West sees his BREATH --

      As West CUFFS Mardon s hand -- the wind PICKS UP -- LIFTING 
      BALES OF HAY into the air -- SWIRLING around the barn -- 
      Thawne gets THWACKED in the head  -- KNOCKING HIM against a 
      wall -- dazing him -- 

                                  MARDON
                    Looks like you re going to need 
                    another new partner...

      Mardon KNOCKS the gun from West s hand -- the wind carrying 
      it away  -- Mardon stares at a shocked West -- 

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY STREETS - NIGHT6868

      GOLDEN BOOTS pound across the pavement -- an arm covered in 
      METALLIC RED slices the air -- LIGHTNING conducting down his 
      arm -- light glints off the end of a GOLDEN WING -- 

      INT. BROWN DAIRY FARM - BARN - NIGHT6969

      West shirks before the whipping wind -- Mardon unaffected -- 

                                  MARDON
                    It s getting easier to control.   I 
                    used to think a gun made me strong.  
                    But this.  This is real power.  The 
                    power of nature.  Of God.  You 
                    think your guns can stop God?

                                  DET. WEST
                    What the hell does God need to rob 
                    banks for?  

                                  MARDON
                          (ominously)
                    You re right.  I ve been thinking 
                    small...

      Mardon raises his hands -- and the wind gets stronger -- West 
      scoops up the dazed Thawne and rushes them towards the door --  

      EXT. BROWN DAIRY FARM - NIGHT - INTERCUT7070

      West lugs Thawne out of the barn -- rushing for safety when --

      BOOOMMM!!  The barn roof explodes into the sky!  A SECTION OF 
    THE BARN ROOF heading straight for West and Thawne -- 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      50.

      CONTINUED:7070

      The cops hit the ground -- Thawne out of it -- West bracing 
      for the end -- when --

      -- a CRIMSON BLUR miraculously TACKLES the debris away from 
      the cops -- a shaken West looks up, amazed -- 

      And we finally get our first look at Barry as THE FLASH 1.0 -- 

      Barry tears off the gas mask -- which leaves the cowl with 
      its iconic design -- before West can speak -- Barry ZIPS away 
      -- coming face to face with the GROWING TORNADO generated by 
      Mardon --

                                  CISCO (O.S.)
                    Barry, can you hear me?

                    Yeah, loud and clear.

      INTERCUT INSIDE THE CORTEX --70A70A

      Where Hartley, Caitlin and Cisco man their stations --

                                    HARTLEY 
                    Barry, wind speeds are 200 miles-
                    per-hour and increasing.  If it 
                    keeps up, this could become an EF-5 
                    tornado.

                                  BARRY
                    How do I stop it?  Guys??

      BACK IN THE CORTEX -- The threesome all look at each other -- 
      they don t know...

                                  BARRY
                    What if I unravel it?

                                    HARTLEY
                    How the hell are you going to do 
                    that?

                                  BARRY
                    Run around it -- in the opposite 
                      direction.  Cut off its legs.   

                                    HARTLEY
                    You d have to clock 500 mph to do 
                    that.

                    Your body may not be able to handle 
                    those speeds.  You ll die.

                    I have to try.  

      Barry takes a breath.  And then runs -- ducking and dodging 
      debris -- racing towards the tornado --  

      Barry becomes a RED BLUR moving faster and faster, running 
      counter to the tornado --

      BACK IN THE CORTEX 

      The trio monitor Barry s vitals -- they re not good -- 

                                    HARTLEY
                    The suit is holding up.

                    But he s not.  

                                  CISCO
                    He can do it.  I know he can do it.

      But the cyclone is too powerful -- A TENDRIL whipping out -- 
      SLAMMING into Barry who SKIDS out -- out of breath -- 

                                  BARRY
                    It s too strong...    

      Mardon looks out at CENTRAL CITY in the distance -- 

                                  MARDON
                    Time to think big...

      The TORNADO begins to move -- towards the city -- Barry is 
      overwhelmed -- until he hears --

                                  WELLS (O.S.)
                    You can do this.

      Barry reacts -- IN THE CORTEX -- Wells has wheeled into the 
      Cortex, moved by Barry s heroism --

                            (passionate)
                    You were right.  I created this 
                    madness.  But you can stop it.  You 
                    are more than your speed.  You can 
                    do this.  

      Invigorated by Wells  words -- Barry takes off again -- this 
      time running harder -- crackling with lightning -- faster and 
      faster -- until the tornado is violently unraveled --




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      52.

      Barry on the ground, struggles to rise, pulls off his cowl -- 
      can t catch his breath -- CHAK!  Mardon stands over Barry 
      with a gun, out of power and winded himself --

                                  MARDON
                    I didn t think there was anyone

                    I m not like you.

      Barry braces for the end -- when:  BLAMM! BLAMM! BLAMM! -- 
      Mardon s body falls, dead -- Barry looks up and sees -- WEST!

    IN THE CORTEX -- our team breathes a sigh of relief -- and 
    for the first time since we ve met her... Caitlin smiles.  A 
      small one.

      BACK AT THE FARM -- West slumps down beside Barry -- West, 
      finally having seen the impossible -- as the SUN BEGINS TO 
      RISE -- off the two men -- the two partners -- facing a new

      Now a crime scene -- POLICE CRUISERS surround the property -- 
      Mardon in a BODY BAG -- Thawne is getting his head bandaged 
      by an E.M.T. -- West crosses to Barry -- a quiet beat -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Thanks for covering for me.  As

                                  BARRY
                    More or less.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    You weren t crazy to chase the 
                      impossible.  You really did see 
                    something the night your mom died.  
                          (then)
                    Your dad is innocent.  

      Barry reacts -- words he s longed to hear his whole life --

                                  BARRY
                    I could free him, Joe.  I could be 
                    in and out of that prison with both 
                    of us before anyone could even see 
                    me.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    And then what?  You d make your 
                    father a fugitive.  He d be running 
                    for the rest of his life.  And he s 
                    not nearly as fast as you.  
                          (beat)
                    But things are different now.

                                  BARRY
                    How?

                                  DET. WEST
                    Because I believe you.  And you and 
                    me, we re going to get him out 
                    together.  And catch the son-of-a-
                    bitch who really killed your mom.

      Barry nods, grateful beyond words -- 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      54.

      Just then, West and Barry see Iris arrive, she looks at 
      Thawne, who nods her way -- I m okay -- so that Iris  dad 
      does not realize -- West turns back to Barry --

                                  DET. WEST
                    But you do not tell Iris.  She can 
                    never know about what you can do.  
                    About any of it.  I want her safe.  
                    If there s more people out there 
                    like Mardon, or the man who killed 
                    your mom, I don t want her anywhere 
                    near this.  

      As Iris reaches them --

                                  IRIS
                    Are you both, alright?  I was at 
                    Jitters when half the cops got 
                    called out here.  They said there 
                    was a shooting. 

                                  DET. WEST
                    We re fine.  We re all fine. 

      West flashes Barry a warning look before walking away -- 

                                  IRIS
                    What happened here?    

                                  BARRY
                    Just your every day kind of bad guy 
                    shoot out.  Promise.

                                  IRIS
                    The news report said there was a 
                    tornado.  More freak weather.  Just 
                    like the other day.  You ve been 
                    saying your whole life you ve seen 
                    the impossible.  I feel like I ve 
                    seen it now too.  C mon Barry.  You 
                    can t lie to me.  I know you too 
                    well.  

      Barry catches sight of West looking back, challenging Barry 
      to keep his promise --

                                  BARRY
                    I would never lie to you, Iris.  

      Barry wants so badly to share -- but instead --

                    I ll always be here for you.  Maybe 
                    a little late... but I ll be here.   

      She gives him a platonic hug -- as she walks away -- back to 
      Thawne -- off Barry, we FLASHBACK one last time -- 

      INT. WEST APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)7272

      Young Iris watches from the top of the stairs as Det. West in 
      officer s uniform and Young Barry enter.  West sees her.

                                  DET. WEST
                    Why aren t you asleep?

                                  IRIS
                    I was waiting for you to bring 
                    Barry home.  

                                  DET. WEST
                      Sweetheart, why don t you show 
                    Barry the guest room?  He s going 
                    to be staying with us for a little 
                    while.  I m going to go talk to 
                    Mom.     
                          (to Barry)
                    It s going to be okay, son.

      West heads upstairs -- Iris holds out her hand -- a beat 
      before Barry takes it -- looks at her -- needing someone, 
      anyone, to understand --

                                  BARRY
                    Iris, my dad... he didn t do it.

                                  IRIS
                    I believe you...

      Off the two children -- so close --

      INT. IRON HEIGHTS PRISON - VISITORS ROOM - DAY7373

      Barry waits on one side of A TWO-WAY GLASS PARTITION -- A 
      PRISON GUARD leads in a PRISONER -- DR. HENRY ALLEN -- 
      Barry s father -- he sits as they pick up their PHONES -- 

                                  HENRY
                    Hey, slugger.  

                                  BARRY
                    I ve been worried about you.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      56.

                                  HENRY
                    Me?  You were the one in the coma.  
                    Are you doing okay? 

                                  BARRY
                    Dad, don t ask me how I know but... 
                    I know what happened to Mom now.  I 
                    mean, I don t know who killed her 
                    but I know how.  And I m going to 
                    find them and get you out of here.  

                                  HENRY
                    Barry, we ve talked about this.  
                    You need to stop worrying about me.  
                    And live your life.  

                                  BARRY
                    For the first time, I feel like 
                    maybe I can...

      INT. JITTERS - DAY7474

      Thawne is there with Iris -- drinking coffee --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    The truth is, since the night Mom 
                    died, I ve been stuck in one place.  
                    I missed out on a lot of things...  

      Thawne gets up to pay the check, kisses Iris on the cheek  -- 
      as she looks up at a TV SCREEN showing CHANNEL 52 NEWS REPORT 
      -- The headline reads,  UNEXPLAINED DEATHS IN KEYSTONE 
      CONTINUE  -- off Iris, her curiosity piqued --

      INT. S.T.A.R. LABS - THE CORTEX - DAY7575

      Hartley, Cisco and Caitlin hover around the suit -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    But I m different now.  I met some 
                    new people.  They re helping me 
                    find my way...   

                                    HARTLEY
                    The faster he runs, the greater the 
                      electrical discharge.  We could add 
                    metallic conducting points to help 
                    separate and safely draw off the 
                    energy.  Here and here...

      Cisco affixes A LIGHTNING BOLT SHAPED ICON to the chest --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      57.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Why is it shaped like a lightning 
                    bolt?

                                  CISCO
                    So it s not boring.

      As the trio bicker, Wells wheels out -- seemingly content --

      INT. CENTRAL CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT - BARRY S LAB - DAY7676

      West and Barry stand before the MURDER BOARD for Barry s 
      mother -- West picks up the FILE BOX labeled  NORA ALLEN  -- 
      as the two men -- two partners -- reexamine the evidence --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    No more living in the past.  I m 
                    ready to start moving on...

      INT. IRON HEIGHTS PRISON - VISITORS ROOM - DAY7777

      Henry s eyes moist at his son s new happiness.

                                  HENRY
                    I love you, son.

                                  BARRY
                    I love you too, Dad.

      Barry puts his hand on the glass -- his dad follows suit --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    My name is Barry Allen.

      EXT. CENTRAL CITY STREETS - DAY7878

      A reprise of the teaser -- a city in motion -- and a MAN 
      speeding through it -- ZIPPING through traffic -- enjoying 
      every second -- a celebration of his powers -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    And I am the fastest man alive.

      Back to Barry -- whipping through the streets -- FLASH TIME!

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    A friend recently gave me the idea 
                    for a new name.

      A virtual SNAP-SHOT of our hero -- THE LIGHTNING EMBLEM in 
      place on his chest -- the scarlet speedster frozen in motion 
      for just a second, and then -- WHOOSH -- 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      58.

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    And something tells me... it s 
                    going to catch on.

      Time resumes -- as he rushes at us, smiling -- LIGHTNING 
      blinding us -- AS WE CUT TO THE TITLE CARD -- THE FLASH  

      INT. S.T.A.R. LABS - WELLS  PRIVATE LAB - DAY7979

      Making sure he s alone, Wells places his hand on A HIDDEN 
      SENSOR in the WALL -- scans his FINGERPRINTS -- and a SECTION 
      OF THE WALL BECOMES TRANSLUCENT AND SLIDES OPEN -- 

      INT. S.T.A.R. LABS - TIME VAULT - CONTINUOUS8080

      Wells enters the clean and antiseptic, seemingly empty area -- 
      until SOMETHING RISES UP from the floor -- a GLASS CASE 
      containing a BLANK TABLET -- 

      And then, Wells stands up -- not paralyzed after all --

      He places his hand over the tablet which becomes a NEWSPAPER 
      FRONT PAGE -- The HEADLINE reads,  THE FLASH SAVES CENTRAL 
      CITY  -- below it is a BLURRY PHOTOGRAPH of THE FLASH -- not 
      Barry in his suit from the pilot but the finished costume 
      from the comics  -- and then we see the date:  April 25th, 
      2024 ...

      The newspaper is from a decade in the future...  

      Off Wells -- keeping secrets far greater than we could have 
      imagined...
