        under the bed.  Peter sits up and addresses her backside.

                                    PETER
                      Checking for monsters?

                                    NANCY
                      What?  Oh.  No.  I can t find my 
                      shoe.  Sandal.  It s a sandal.  

                                    PETER
                      So I m guessing no breakfast.

                                    NANCY
                      No.  I m not really a breakfast 
                      person.  I have to have coffee in 
                      the morning, but after that, I m 
                      good  til lunch.  Usually.  
                      Sometimes I have a bagel around ten-
                      thirty...  

                                    PETER
                      I ll make you some coffee.

                                    NANCY
                      No.  I should go home.  Ah. 
                            (holding up sandal)
                      Found it.

                      Wow.  You ve got big feet.

                      Why do you have a gun in your 
                      dresser?

                      Were you snooping?

                                    NANCY
                      My feet used to be smaller, but I 
                      went up a size with each kid.
                            (then)
                      It s just sitting there on your 
                      dresser.  I saw it when I went to 
                      pee.

        Peter gets out of bed and walks up to her.  He s naked.

      He grabs a shirt from nearby and ties it around his waist.

                                    PETER
                      I want a kiss goodbye.  Otherwise, 
                      I ll feel cheap and used.

        She kisses him.  He kisses her.  They kiss.

        Isabel rummages through a grocery bag that s sitting next to 
      her.  She pulls out a bag of peanut butter-filled pretzels.

        Celia reaches back to grab the bag and her foot slips off the 
        brake.  She rolls into traffic and an oncoming car clips her.  
        The bag splits open and pretzels go flying.

        Celia pulls over and the luxury car that clipped her pulls up 
      next to her.  Isabel eats pretzel pieces off the seat.  Celia 
      gets out of the car.

                      This is how we got in the pot 
                      business.  The pain killers I got 
                      from the doctor made me sleep all 
                      the time so Heylia switched me to 
                      weed and started to meet people in 
                      the industry.  Before that, she 
                      worked at Price Club. 

        Sanjay comes out of the back of the store.

                                    SANJAY
                      Hey team!  You solve all our 
                      problems yet?

                                    NANCY
                      I think I may shoot Silas in the 
                      leg.

                      That s confusing.

                                    CONRAD
                      Right now, if we liquidated 
                      everything and got out of the 
                      lease, we re looking at maybe half 
                      of what we need.

                                    NANCY
                      What about insurance?

                                    CONRAD
                      You got some sneaky arson plot 
                      behind them crazy eyes?  

                                    NANCY
                      Could we?

                                    CONRAD
                      Baby, that shit only works on the 
                      Sopranos.  I guarantee the fire 
                      chief is better at investigating 
                      arson than you are at committing 
                      it.  You re a drug dealer, not a 
                      fire bug.

                                    SANJAY
                      Hey, but what if--

                                    CONRAD
                      What?  What if what?

                                    SANJAY
                      Nothing.  Except, why do you call 
                      Nancy baby?

                                    CONRAD
                      It s a black thing.  

                                    SANJAY
                      I m... not white.

                                    CONRAD
                      You ain t black neither.

                                    NANCY
                      He s got you there.

                                    SANJAY
                      Are you making fun of me?

                                    SANJAY
                      Fine.  Can I get a little help 
                      here?

        Sanjay grabs the last of the flour and goes back inside.  
        Conrad puts down the papers.  

                                    CONRAD 
                      Anyway, baby, we got problems.

                      Did I mention that I slept with a 
                      DEA agent last night?

        Nancy stands with Andy and a FIREMAN.  The place is 
        destroyed.

                                    FIREMAN
                      So it looks like your employee was 
                      firing up an oven when his 
                      cigarette lit a gas line.  
                      Negligence and stupidity, pure and 
                      simple, Ma am.

                                    NANCY
                      Oh, my god.

                      I hope you re insured.

                                    NANCY
                      Does insurance cover an employee s, 
                      um, negligence and stupidity?

                                    FIREMAN
                      Should.  You ll have to check with 
                      your carrier. 

        The fireman walks off.  Nancy looks over at Sanjay who is 
        slightly singed and giving a statement to another fireman.  
      He cracks the thinnest of smiles for her benefit.

                                    ANDY
                      Something tells me you re covered.  

                                    NANCY
                      He could have been killed.

                                    ANDY
                            (quietly singing)

                      business, like no business, I 
                      know...

        She shoots him a look.  Celia, laden with shopping bags, 
        walks up to Nancy.

                                    CELIA
                      Oh my God!  Nancy!  Your little 
                      bakery burned down.

                                    ANDY
                      Doesn t it smell like toast?

                                    NANCY
                      Yeah.  Accident.  

                                    CELIA
                      Well, this is just awful.  But 
                      maybe now you ll have time to do 
                      some work on my campaign?  I m

                      you ll be there for me.  That s 
                      what friends do for one another, 
                      right?  And to be honest Nancy, 
                      this was a blessing.  A few more 
                      years in the muffin business and 
                      your ass would have been big enough 
                      to hatch the Cinerama Dome.  So God
