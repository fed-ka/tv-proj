  OVER BLACK

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    My name is Moriarty.  I believe 
                    we re overdue for a chat. 

  FADE IN:

  INT. BROWNSTONE - STUDY - NIGHT11

  Picking up where we left off in Episode 120: SHERLOCK has The 
  Actuary s phone on speaker and is holding it up so JOAN can 
  listen.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    If you re Moriarty, I concur.  Long 
                    overdue. 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                     If?  

  And as Joan produces her own phone, hits  RECORD  --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You re a voice on the other end of 
                    a telephone.  You haven t even a 
                    first name as far as I can tell.
                          (beat; off the man s 
                            silence)
                    Would you like to tell me your 
                    first name?

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                      I appreciate you passing my message 
                    along to Sebastian Moran.
                          (beat)
                    I hear his prognosis is quite 
                    grave. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Yes.  Well.  If you expect me to 
                    feel any sympathy for a taker of 
                    nearly 40 lives --

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    I expect you to feel angry because 
                      I manipulated you.  Rather easily, 
                    I might add. 

  Sherlock is angry.  And after a beat --

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    Chin up, Holmes.  Manipulation is 
                    my business.    ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       2.

    CONTINUED:11

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Seems more to me that murder is 
                    your business.

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    A part of it.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Explain. 

  Moriarty takes a moment.  We can  hear  his smile in his voice. 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    Consider me a spider. 
                          (then)
                    I sit motionless at the center of 
                    my web.  That web has a thousand 
                      radiations, and I know well every 
                    quiver of each of them. I do 
                    little myself.  I only plan.  But 
                    my agents are numerous and 
                      splendidly organized.  Is there a 
                    crime to be done, a paper to be 
                      abstracted, a house to be rifled, a 
                    man to be removed -- the word is 
                    passed to me, the matter is planned 
                    and carried out. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You re a pimp.  Assassins are your 
                    whores. 

  This gets a small laugh from the man.

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    Yes.  I suppose that s one way of 
                    putting it. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Irene Adler.  Did you have her 
                    killed? 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    That is the question, is it not?  
                    The one that s haunted you these 
                    many months?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Why did you do it?  What s your 
                    interest in me? 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    You want answers.  I don t blame 
                    you.  But first I require something 
                    from you.

                    I d like to hire you.
                          (clarifies)
                    Not as an assassin -- though I do 
                    believe you d excel in the 
                    position.
                          (then)
                    I d like to secure your services as 
                    an investigator.  

  Sherlock looks to Joan.  Neither could have expected this. 

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    A man named Wallace Bishop was 
                    murdered in Brooklyn several months 
                    ago.  The New York Police 
                      Department investigated but failed 
                    to find any leads. 
                          (then)
                    Bring his killer to justice, and I 
                      promise... I ll give you all the 
                    answers you can handle. 

  We HEAR a  click  as he hangs up.  And we --

  FADE IN:

  INT. BROWNSTONE - STUDY - NIGHT22

  We re CLOSE ON A MONITOR as a newspaper article appears:  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Here we are: New York Post from 
                    December.  

  ANOTHER ANGLE finds Sherlock hunkered down at his computer, Joan 
  looking on from behind him.  

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Wallace Bishop, mechanic, aged 43, 
                    was found stabbed to death in an 
                    alley in Brooklyn --

                                  JOAN
                    Can we please take a minute to talk 
                    about what just happened?

  Rather than actually saying no, Sherlock just keeps reading:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Mr. Bishop s missing wallet and 
                    watch led the police to suspect he 
                    was the victim of a mugger. 

                                  JOAN
                    Moriarty, or at least someone 
                    claiming to be him, just called 
                    you.  He asked you to take a case.  
                    And you re doing it.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Why wouldn t I?  

                                  JOAN
                    For one thing, he s dangerous.  For 
                    another, you think he s behind 
                    Irene s death --

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (turning to her)
                    Yes, and in the course of one brief 
                    exchange, I ve already gleaned that 
                    Moriarty is between forty and forty-
                    five years of age, hails from 
                    Sussex, and has some interest in or 
                      connection to Mr. Wallace Bishop.  
                          (then)
                    As the case continues, there will 
                    be more interactions.    ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       5.

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And with every interaction, more of 
                    the man will be revealed to me.  

                                  JOAN
                    Assuming the man on the phone 
                    actually is Moriarty.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Even if he s a mere  minion,  
                      identifying him will move me one 
                    step closer to the man himself.  

                                  JOAN
                    What if it s a trap? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s not.

                                  JOAN
                    How can you be sure?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Because.  Three years ago, Moriarty 
                    ordered Daniel Gottlieb not to kill 
                    me.  Last night, I was in the 
                      crosshairs of another assassin s *
                    rifle.  Yet here I sit.*
                          (then)
                    It couldn t be clearer: Moriarty 
                    doesn t want me dead.

                                  JOAN
                    Then what does he want?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That is precisely what I intend to 
                    find out.  

  And as he MOVES PAST HER... 

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:

  Before Sherlock can deflect, Joan steps in.

                                  JOAN
                    We took on a client recently.  He 
                    asked us to take a look.  If it 
                    heats up, we ll let you know.

  Bell accepts this and moves off.  Sherlock spreads out the 
  papers --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not much here that we don t already 
                    know.  Mr. Bishop was accosted by 
                    an unknown assailant.  His watch, 
                    wallet, and cell phone were taken, 
                    he bled to death in an alleyway...

                                  JOAN
                          (off a particular paper)
                    He was married.

                    Perhaps a condolence call to his 
                    widow is in order...

  Just then, an ND DETECTIVE sticks his head in the room --

                    Captain Gregson wants a word with

                    passwords in one place.  He made a 
                    fortune, sold his company, moved 
                    his family down to Boca Raton.

  Beat.  Joan still doesn t see what this has to do with her.

                    Good for Eddie.

                    Yeah.  But not so good for his 
                    daughter, Kelly.  She was just 
                    starting high school when they made 
                    the move.  She wasn t ready for 
                    it... or the money. 
                          (then)
                    She ended up with a pretty serious 
                    drug problem.  Just turned 25, and 
                    she s finishing up her forth stint 
                    in rehab in Boca.

                                  JOAN
                    I m sorry to hear that.

                                    GREGSON
                    Eddie and I talked on the phone the 
                    other day.  He happened to mention 
                    that he and his wife were looking 
                    to pair Kelly up with a sober 
                    companion after she gets out.  And 
                    so it hit me: I know a great one.

  Gregson passes Joan a piece of paper with a number on it.

                    Eddie has the money.  And he wants 
                    what s best for his girl.

                    I m... flattered you thought of me.  
                    And this is an incredibly generous 
                    offer.

                                    GREGSON
                    I do.  But I figured for money like 
                    this, it might be worth taking a 
                    break from what you ve been doing

  But before Joan can reiterate her  no , her phone CHIRPS with a 
  text.  And as she glances down...

                    ...I m sorry.  But I ve never heard 
                    the name  Moriarty  in my life. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Did your husband do business with 
                    any Brits? 

                                  EILEEN
                          (confused)
                    Wallace worked in a garage.
                          (does this help?)
                    He knew a couple Dominican guys...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    When the police questioned you, you 
                    said something about Wallace 
                    thinking he was being followed...

                                  EILEEN
                    Yeah.  A few weeks before he died.  
                    He kept seeing the same car in his 
                    rearview mirror.  It only happened 
                    the one time.  The cops didn t 
                    think it had anything to do with 
                    the mugging...  

  Joan indicates the storage boxes atop the desk:

                                  JOAN
                    Those are your husband s things?

                          (nods)
                    Wallace was sort of a packrat.  
                    Saved everything.  I figured it was 
                    time to start cleaning out his 
                    stuff, see if there s anything for 
                    Goodwill.

                    lead...?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not exactly.  But new eyes on a 
                    case can sometimes be as useful as 
                    new information.
                          (re: the clutter)
                    In fact, it might be useful to have 
                    more time with his belongings.  
                    Perhaps we could borrow them for a 
                    few days?

                    Wallace got killed in a mugging. 
                    You really think his old junk is 
                    gonna point you towards who did it?

  Actually, Sherlock s much more interested in Wallace s 
    connection to Moriarty, but...

                                  EILEEN (CONT D)
                    Sure.  Fine.  Take whatever.

  As she and Sherlock start to gather up the piles on the desk,  
  Eileen hovers, unable to walk away while strangers comb through 
  her husband s things.

                                  EILEEN
                    Just makes me so angry.  I m here 
                    sorting through Wallace s crap and 
                    he s dead.  All because he didn t 
                    want to hand over his wallet to a 
                    guy with a knife...
                          (then)
                    I thought he knew better.  He 
                    always said being in the Army, 
                    seeing violence firsthand, that was 
                    enough to cure him of being brave.

  CLOSE ON A HANDWRITTEN CARD that says  WALLACE BISHOP .  

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.)
                    Judging from Wallace Bishop s 
                    financial records, he and his wife 
                    were living close to the bone.  

  REVEAL the card is taped to a RICKETY CHALKBOARD.  Joan is 
  taping up autopsy photos and other items from the case file.  
  Sherlock sits at the table, poring over papers recovered from 
  the boxes Eileen gave them.

                                  JOAN
                    Is that significant?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Moriarty paid Sebastian Moran and  
                    Daniel Gottlieb quite handsomely.

                    You think Bishop was working for 
                    him, too? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Moran and Gottlieb were assassins.  
                    Perhaps Bishop did something less 
                    dangerous for Moriarty.  Or perhaps 
                    he was good at hiding his money...ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       12.

                    Maybe... but do you really think 
                    Moriarty would draw our attention 
                    to another of his employees?  
                    Doesn t that seem risky to you?

  ask him something.  But then she loses her nerve.  Holmes gives 
  no indication that he sees her there.  And yet --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Out with it, Watson.  Or are you 
                    going to spend all night almost 
                    saying something?

                    What was she like?  

  Sherlock turns to her and she clarifies:

                    Irene.  You ve talked about what 
                    happened to her... but not who she 
                    was. 

  Another beat.  Is he going to answer?  Finally:

                    She was... difficult to explain.

  Joan smiles, she knew that.  Because she knows him.

                    Several months ago you or one of 
                    your employees ran into Mr. Bishop 
                    and made sure his cell phone met 
                    its end via a cup of French Roast.  
                    He ordered a new phone from his 
                    provider, but according to them, he 
                    never turned it on.  Probably 
                    because it was intercepted en route 
                    by you or another of your 
                      employees.  Instead, unbeknownst to 
                    him, Mr. Bishop received and began 
                    using an identical cell-phone 
                    supplied by your company.  
                          (holds up MAILING LABEL)
                    We found the shipping label for the 
                    phone in Bishop s things.

                                  JOAN
                    The return address is for a 
                    shipping store right around the 
                    corner from here.  And a helpful 
                    gentleman who works there 
                      identified your company as the one 
                    that paid to have it sent.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Once Bishop activated your phone, 
                    you were able to monitor his every 
                    move.  And I believe you did... 
                    right up until the moment he was 
                    stabbed to death three months ago 
                    in Brooklyn.

  A beat as Daren sizes Sherlock up.  Can t help but be impressed 
  by his investigative skills.  Finally admits --

                    Actually, we only surveilled Bishop

                    We looked into Mr. Bishop based on 
                    threats he allegedly made against a 
                    client.  After a short period of 
                    legal surveillance, we realized the 
                    claims were unfounded and stopped 
                    the surveillance.

  INT. BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - NIGHT1111

  Sherlock makes a sandwich as he explains his thinking to Joan, 
  who is seated at the table with their copy of  Friend or Foe. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    ...Daren Stalton s book amounts to 
                    a virtual confession to the murder 
                    of Wallace Bishop.

                                  JOAN
                          (re: the book)
                    This was published five years ago.  
                    How d he confess to something he 
                    hadn t done yet?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The book isn t simply a mass market 
                    pr cis of Stalton s valid, if 
                      simplistic, insights into security 
                    and risk management.  It s a window 
                    into what drew him to the field in 
                    the first place.

  And as Joan complies, discovering a PHOTOGRAPH of a smiling 
  woman in her late 20s --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    February, 1991, Westport, 
                      Connecticut.  Stalton was 23.  His 
                    older sister, Leah, was brutally 
                    murdered during what the police 
                    believe was a home invasion 
                    robbery.  

  INT. LEAH STALTON S HOME - NIGHT11A11A

  We re TIGHT ON THE SAME WOMAN from the photograph -- LEAH 
  STALTON -- as TWO HANDS choke her neck.  She s lying on the 
  floor, clearly dying --  

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.)
                    Stalton was staying with her at the 
                    time...

  ANOTHER ANGLE gives us an incrementally better look at Leah s 
  attacker, but does not feature his face.  He HEARS a key stab 
  into a lock... and as his head whips around in the direction of 
  a FRONT DOOR, and the door begins to OPEN --ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       22.


  INT. BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - NIGHT11B11B

                                  JOAN
                          (from the book)
                    ...he got home just as the 
                      perpetrator fled the house...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    More than that: He came face-to-
                    face with the man.  He gave the 
                    police a full description.  Enough 
                    to generate a detailed sketch...

  He takes the book from her, opens it to display a POLICE SKETCH.  
  Sets it down on the table beside an old PHOTOGRAPH of Wallace 
  Bishop.  And as Joan notes the striking similarities...

                                  JOAN
                    You think Wallace Bishop is the one 
                    who killed Stalton s sister twenty-
                    two years ago. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The police never caught the 
                    culprit.  Stalton was tormented by 
                    his failure to protect her as well 
                    as law enforcement s failure to 
                    apprehend her killer... It became 
                    his raison d' tre.
                          (then)
                    Stalton dropped out of business 
                    school.  Began studying law 
                      enforcement, security... and 
                    Kyokushin karate.  A style that 
                    utilizes mastoid strikes --

                                  JOAN
                    Just like the blow used to stun 
                    Wallace Bishop before he was 
                    stabbed to death.

  A beat as she considers.  Sherlock makes a decent case but...

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    All we really know is that Bishop 
                    has a passing resemblance to an old 
                    police sketch.  Did he have any 
                    criminal history?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    According to his Army record, 
                    Bishop enlisted under a waiver.  
                    That means a judge gave him a 
                    choice between the Army and prison.   
                    His arrest was for breaking and

  So that s a yes.

                                  JOAN
                    Can we place Bishop anywhere near 
                    the murder?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Following his discharge from the 
                    Army in November 1990, Bishop moved 
                    back to his mother s house in 
                    Stamford, Connecticut.  Which I 
                    believe is about a thirty minute 
                    drive from where Leah was killed.

  Joan takes all this in.  Sherlock s theory is pretty convincing.

                                  JOAN
                    So it s possible that, over two 
                    decades ago, Wallace Bishop killed 
                    Stalton s sister.  And that 
                    Bishop s recent death was the 
                    result of Stalton tracking him down 
                    and killing him in retribution.
                          (then)
                    Question is... why does Moriarty 
                    care about any of it?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I d venture it s because he wants 
                    us to bring down Stalton.  His 
                    security firm, as you yourself 
                    pointed out, is one of the best in 
                    the country.  Removing Stalton 
                    would, in theory, make his clients 
                    more vulnerable.  Moriarty probably 
                    has one in his crosshairs. 

                                  JOAN
                    ...which means our work on this 
                    case could end up costing someone 
                    their life.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not if our work leads to Moriarty s *
                    undoing first.  In which case we ll *
                    have saved that person and all of *
                    the people Moriarty would have *
                      victimized in the future.*

  Joan considers, not sure this makes her feel better.  And then:

                                  JOAN
                    Let s say you re right: Moriarty 
                    planned this.  That would mean he 
                    already knew that Stalton murdered 
                    Wallace Bishop.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       24.

                    That s why I ve arranged to speak 
                    with Mr. Stalton in private first 
                    thing tomorrow morning.

                                  JOAN
                     In private?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s going to be a very... delicate 
                      conversation.  And for what it s 
                    worth -- he s not bringing his wife 
                    either.  

  Before Joan can protest, Sherlock is out the door.  A beat as 
  Joan considers the latest developments, and then her phone 
  CHIMES on the table.  She scoops it up, finds and opens  1 NEW 
  EMAIL  from Captain Gregson:  My friend in Boca upped his offer.  
  You sure you re not interested? 

  And ON Joan, something about this bothering her...

  Daren Stalton sits on a bench as Sherlock approaches. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Mr. Stalton, thank you for meeting 
                    me.  Kindly stand up.

  Puzzled, Daren stands.  Sherlock pulls a handheld DEVICE out of 
  his pocket, waves it over Daren s body.

                    ...want to tell me what you re

                     mystery man  who s plotting my

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Some proof then.  Given the 
                    precision with which you murdered 
                    Mr. Bishop -- not to mention 
                      Moriarty s resources -- I would not 
                    be surprised if he learned of your 
                      transgression via listening devices 
                    in your office and/or home.

                    can t predict his next move, I can 
                    certainly expect him to make one.

                    You want the whole truth?  I know a 
                    good deal more than you think.  I 
                    know Stalton was your target all 
                    along.  I know you had him under 
                      surveillance.  I know you didn t 
                    want to reveal that surveillance to 
                    the authorities, so you utilized me 
                    to expose him --

                    You re slipping, Holmes.  I m 
                    referring to the truth about Leah 
                    Stalton s murder.

                          (huh?)
                    Wallace Bishop killed her.

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    No, in fact, he did not.  He had an 
                    alibi.  

  Not buying this at all, Sherlock pushes back --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Let me guess: his mother swears she 
                    dealt him into her bridge game that 
                    night.  

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)
                    After Bishop left the Army, his 
                    mail went to his mother s house in 
                      Connecticut.  But Bishop did not.  
                    He was in Saudi Arabia doing off-
                    the-books work for an American oil 
                    company.  He didn t return until 
                    March 1991.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Impossible.  Stalton swears that he 
                    saw Bishop --

                    Stalton is wrong.  He killed the 
                    wrong man.

  FADE IN:

  INT. BROWNSTONE   STUDY - NEXT MORNING2020

  CLOSE ON JOAN, asleep in a chair in sweats.  A BRIGHT LIGHT *
  flashes directly onto her face.  It turns off, then on again as 
  she stirs, reacting to the GLARE.  

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.)
                    Good -- you re awake.

  REVEAL Sherlock is FLASHING a floor lamp (which he s positioned 
  for this purpose) into Joan s face.  His mood is intense.  FILES 
  and PAPERS are everywhere and Sherlock s CHALKBOARD has been 
  divided into two columns --  Wallace Bishop  at the top of one, 
   Leah Stalton  over the other.

                                  JOAN
                    How long was I out?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    107 minutes.  Precisely enough time 
                    to cycle through all five stages of 
                    REM and non-REM sleep, leaving your 
                    mind clear for the day s labor.   

  Joan sits up and takes in the scene, as...

                                  JOAN
                    Have you made any progress?

                                  SHERLOCK
                            (frustrated)
                    If by  progress  do you mean have I 
                    proven that Moriarty was wrong? 
                    Have I proven that Wallace Bishop 
                    did kill Daren Stalton s sister as 
                    Daren and myself had come to 
                    believe?  Well, in that case, I 
                    have made the opposite of progress.     

                                  JOAN
                    So Bishop was in Saudi Arabia at 
                    the time of the murder?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I cannot prove that, nor, 
                      unfortunately, can I prove he was 
                    anywhere else.  After Bishop left 
                    the Army in 1990, his mail and 
                    personal effects went to his 
                    mother s residence in Connecticut, 
                    but nothing suggests that Bishop 
                      accompanied them.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       35.

                    No credit card purchases, no bank 
                      withdrawals, no financial activity 
                    at all.  Monetarily, the man was a 
                    ghost.    

                                  JOAN
                    Maybe his mother paid for 
                      everything.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    An arrangement that is not unheard 
                    of.  However, Bishop s medical 
                    records show that shortly before he 
                    left the Army, he refilled his 
                    malaria pill prescription and 
                    received a Typhoid booster. 

                                  JOAN
                    Maybe he was planning to stay in 
                    Kuwait.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Bishop also received a vaccine for 
                      meningococcal disease.  That 
                      inoculation is only required for 
                    travel to the Kingdom of Saudi 
                    Arabia.    
                          (then; angry with himself)
                    Again, not proof.  But a suggestive 
                    detail that I should ve noticed 
                    earlier.  Much like the $30,000 
                    deposit made to Bishop from a shell 
                      corporation in April 1991.  Most 
                    likely a payment for his services 
                    to the oil company.  

  He s clearly frustrated.  Joan attempts to bolster him.

                                  JOAN
                    It s still not conclusive.  And our 
                      assignment was to figure out who 
                    killed Wallace Bishop, not Leah 
                    Stalton.   

                                  SHERLOCK
                    A case in which, as I just bothered 
                    to learn, unidentified fingerprints 
                    were found on Leah s door after her 
                    death.  The prints may have been 
                    left by someone not involved in the 
                    murder -- a delivery man, the pizza 
                    boy.  But the police have long 
                    assumed they were left by Leah s 
                    killer.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       36.

                                  JOAN
                    I m guessing those prints weren t a 
                    match for Wallace Bishop?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Correct.  All of which suggests 
                    that Moriarty may be right, Daren 
                    Stalton killed an innocent man.

                                  JOAN
                    Maybe Moriarty was right because 
                    he s the one who set Stalton up. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    An excellent theory, hindered only 
                    by being nigh impossible.

                                  JOAN
                    It s completely possible.  Moriarty 
                    said he did stuff like this for a 
                    living -- 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Daren Stalton saw his sister s 
                    killer running away from her dead 
                    body.  The man s face was etched 
                    into his memory.  How does anyone -- 
                    including Moriarty -- trick him 
                    into killing a different man than 
                    the one he saw?

                                  JOAN
                    It has been over twenty years.  *
                    People forget things.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not this, Watson.  Not the person 
                    who took everything from you. 
                          (he stands)
                    It s a conundrum.  But once solved, 
                    we will have the  complete truth  
                    that Moriarty has requested.
                          (beat; realizing 
                            something)
                    This taste in my mouth.  It s 
                    horrid. 

  He exits.  ON Joan, troubled by this conversation.

                                                                            CUT TO:

  INT. BROWNSTONE - BATHROOM - DAY2121

  Sherlock is brushing his teeth.  The door is partially open, so 
  clearly he s not naked.  Joan steps in.  Sherlock pauses his 
  brushing to ask --ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       37.

                    If you need to use the loo, I ll 
                    turn away.
                          (then)
                    No asparagus last night, correct?

  But that s not why Joan is here.

                                  JOAN
                    Why do you think Moriarty is 
                    putting you through all this? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He considers me an enemy. 

                                  JOAN
                    Yeah, but why?

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Presumably because I disrupted some 
                    criminal enterprise of his in 
                    London.  

                                  JOAN
                    Then why didn t he just kill you?  
                    Why do what he did to Irene?  And 
                    why is making you jump through 
                    hoops now in New York?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat; confessing)
                    He s a more... complex opponent 
                    than I ve dealt with in a while -- 

                                  JOAN
                    Opponent?  You make it sound like a 
                    game.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I believe it is to him.

                                  JOAN
                    And what is it to you?

  Sherlock just looks at her, unsure of her point.

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Are you even... afraid of him?

                    I find fear to be an unproductive 
                    filter through which to view the

                    Can t you ever just answer a 
                    question like a normal human being?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    As I mentioned earlier, Moriarty 
                    clearly doesn t want to kill me.  
                    So, no, I m not afraid.

                                  JOAN
                    But there are other ways to hurt 
                    you.  Including ways that don t 
                    involve hurting you.  

  Now Sherlock knows what s bothering her.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Watson, you know there are risks 
                    entailed in the work that I -- that 
                    we -- perform.  You can t do the 
                    work without undertaking the risks.  
                    But know that where Moriarty is 
                      concerned, I will never allow any 
                    harm to come to you.  Not ever.   

  A long and quiet beat as Joan considers that.  And then...

                                  JOAN
                    You can t promise that.

                    And yet, I have.

  A moment between them, and then Sherlock is back to business:

                    Given the many questions in need of 
                    answers, I propose we split up.  
                    I ll talk to Mr. Stalton, see if he 
                    can t shed more light on the 
                      situation.  You pay a visit to Mrs. 
                    Stalton, try to convince her that 
                    access to the firm s client list 
                    might help us find the man who 
                    placed them in this predicament. 

  And ON the plan --

                                                                            CUT TO:

  INT. RIKERS ISLAND - VISITING AREA - DAY2222

  Daren Stalton, attired now in a DARK GREEN JUMPSUIT and WHITE *
  CANVAS SNEAKERS, sits at a table.  Sherlock is across from him; *
  an ND GUARD stands in the background.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       39.

    CONTINUED:2222

  A file is laid out on the table; Daren holds a piece of paper.  
  Sherlock has just finished walking him through Wallace Bishop s 
  alibi.  Daren hands the paper back to Sherlock, as:

                                  DAREN
                    So Bishop got immunized for 
                      meningococcus.  That doesn t prove 
                    anything. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That s only one piece of the 
                    puzzle.  As I explained -- 

                                  DAREN
                          (cutting Sherlock off)
                    You don t need to go through it 
                    again.  Wallace Bishop killed my 
                    sister.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The evidence suggests --

                                  DAREN
                          (re: papers on the table)
                    What evidence?  This is an 
                      assortment of facts arranged to 
                    support what you want to believe.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I don t  want  to believe you were 
                    set up.  I want to be able to make 
                    sense of this.
                          (then)
                      I acknowledge the proof that Bishop 
                    was out of the country is far from 
                    ironclad.  But I believe it is 
                    unwise to ignore the possibility 
                    you were misled.  If you were, who 
                    might be behind it?  Who benefits 
                    if -- ?

                                  DAREN
                    You re being played.  Manipulated.  
                    By whoever sent you down this 
                    path... 

  A beat as that LANDS for Sherlock.  Certainly Moriarty might be 
  capable of this.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I am well-aware of that 
                      possibility.  Especially because I 
                    have a personal stake in this case.  
                    The man I mentioned to you -- 
                    Moriarty -- he and I are not 
                      strangers.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       40.

                    He took someone from me.  Much like 
                    your sister was taken...

  Daren can t help but sympathize.  His tone shifts somewhat.

                                  DAREN
                    I m sorry to hear that.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m revealing this in the hopes 
                    that you understand I would not 
                    lead you astray.  As unlikely as it 
                    seems, it is at least possible that 
                    someone tricked you into killing 
                    the wrong man --

  Daren leans forward, looks right at Sherlock, as:  

                                  DAREN
                    You said the other day I m a 
                    terrible liar.  Tell me if I m 
                    lying right now... Wallace Bishop 
                    murdered my sister.  

  Daren s statement is damn convincing.  OFF Sherlock, not sure 
  how to make sense of this, we... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

  CLOSE ON Joan s CELL PHONE.  It sits on a desk, and a RECORDED 
  VOICE emanates from it:  

                                    BRITISH MAN (V.O.)

                    the word is passed to me, the 
                    matter is planned and carried out.

  As we hear the recording, we WIDEN OUT to reveal Kate Stalton 
  behind the desk, a confused look on her face.  Joan sits across 
  from her.  Kate stops the playback, returns Joan s phone.

                                  KATE

                    As far as your theory that this man

                                  KATE
                    Let s say we did.  There are lots 
                    of people who d like to know what s 
                    said within these walls.  Even if 
                    the man you re referring to was 
                      surveilling us, he couldn t 
                    possibly have set Daren up to kill 
                    the wrong man.  Daren saw Wallace 
                    Bishop s face that night --  

                                  JOAN
                    Isn t it possible that he got it 
                    wrong?  That after so many years of 
                    wanting to find the killer, he was 
                    ready to believe he had?

  Kate takes a beat, collects herself...

                    no way he d make a mistake about 
                    this.
                          (then)
                    You need to understand: for Daren, 
                    life is divided into two halves: 
                    Before Leah s murder, and after.

                                  JOAN

                    Daren was so broken... but still so

                    for coming... even though he was

2424INT. BROWNSTONE   FOYER/LOCK ROOM - NIGHT  

  Joan enters the brownstone, pulls off her coat, as: 

                                  JOAN
                    Sherlock?  You here?

  Silence.  Joan hangs her coat, finds Sherlock in front of his 
  CHALKBOARD, which has been rotated to display its OPPOSITE SIDE.  
  This side has been labeled  DAREN STALTON: FOES  and papered 
  with PICTURES and DOCUMENTS.  And as Sherlock sits cross-legged 
  atop the table, staring at the packed board...

                    As the head of a successful risk 
                      management firm, Stalton has put 
                    away a very long list of stalkers, 
                    abusive husbands, and other 
                    dangerous obsessives. 

  Joan takes in the board: it is packed with photos and papers. 

                                  JOAN
                    Looks like a pretty competitive

                                  SHERLOCK
                    On top of that, Stalton shared his 
                    obsession with his sister s killer 
                    with the world.  So there s no 
                    shortage of people who knew about 
                    his Achilles heel. 

  Sherlock rubs his forehead, frustrated.  He gets to his feet, 
  begins to pace.  Joan considers him with a touch of concern.  

                                  JOAN

                    long.

  He pauses to stretch his arms.  Still looking at the board.  And 
  then he suddenly SLAMS the board to the ground in a fit of 
    frustration.  Photos and documents fly everywhere.  

  For a beat, both he and Joan just stare at the mess.  Then, 
    quietly...

                    again. 

  Sherlock moves to pick up the mess he s made.  Joan crosses to 
  him, puts a gentle hand on his arm, stopping him.

  Joan pauses, holding the photo, staring at it.  Something about

                    I was just thinking about how hard

                    And, I thought: I wish I could make 
                    that hurt go away.

                    Your sentiment is much appreciated, 
                    Watson.  But I fear your goal may 
                    be unobtainable.

                                  JOAN
                    That s what I m afraid of, too.  
                    And then I thought about Daren 
                    Stalton, that he s a lot like you.  
                    Except he got what he wanted.  He s 
                    at peace now. 
                          (then)
                    We ve been trying to identify 
                    people who wanted to tear Stalton 
                    down.  But what if he was tricked 
                    into killing Wallace Bishop by

2626INT. STALTON RISK MANAGEMENT   WAITING AREA - NEXT MORNING  

  Elevator doors SLIDE OPEN to REVEAL Kate Stalton.  She 
  disembarks, stops short when she SEES...

    ...Sherlock, Joan, Gregson, and Bell have been standing there, 
  awaiting her arrival.  And as Gregson holds up his badge:

                                    GREGSON
                    Mrs. Stalton.  I m Captain Thomas 
                    Gregson.  I was wondering if we *
                    could ask you some questions. 

  And ON Kate --

                                                                            CUT TO:

  Kate leads our foursome inside, sets her bag down...

                                  KATE
                    If this is about Daren, I don t 
                    feel comfortable answering 
                    questions without his attorney --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Actually, Mrs. Stalton, this is 
                    about you.  We were hoping you 
                    could confirm exactly when you and 
                    your husband first met.

  Kate glances in Joan s direction, recalling the two of them 
  spoke about this just yesterday.  Then, to Sherlock --

                                  KATE
                    As I told Miss Watson, we met in 
                    1991 at a vigil for his sister, 
                    Leah.

                                  BELL
                    So that would be after her death.

                                  KATE
                      Obviously.

  Sherlock looks to Joan, who addresses Kate --

                    Being with Daren for as long as you 
                    have... I d assume you know as much

                    So surely you know there were some 
                    partial fingerprints found on her 
                    front door that night.  They were 
                    never identified, but the police *
                    thought there was a chance they 
                    belonged to the killer. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Only they didn t, did they?  They 
                    belonged to you.  

  EXT. LEAH STALTON S HOME - NIGHT2727

  Leah Stalton is being strangled to death by a man whose face we 
  cannot see.  And as we realize we have seen this before... we 
  HEAR a key stab into a lock.  And as the man s head whips around 
  to the FRONT DOOR, and the door begins to OPEN --

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.)
                    You were the one who came in the 
                    door that night.  Not Daren.  

  -- REVEAL a YOUNGER KATE (early 20s) standing in the doorway, 
  stopped cold by what she sees. 

  INT. STALTON RISK MANAGEMENT - DAREN S OFFICE - DAY2828

                                  JOAN
                    You handled my phone yesterday.  We 
                    were able to lift your prints and 
                    compare them to the ones from 
                    Leah s house.  They matched. 
                          (then)*
                    That means you lied to me.  You did *
                    know Gavin before Leah died. *

                                  GREGSON*
                    We checked public records and found *
                    out you were married to another man *
                    at the time.  You and Mr. Stalton *
                    were having an affair.    *

  Kate s armor cracks slightly.  She admits with frustration:*

                                  KATE
                    Okay.  So Daren and I were involved 
                    before Leah died.  So what? *

                                  SHERLOCK
                    So now we know why Daren is so 
                    certain he killed the right man 
                    several months ago.  Because you 
                    told him it was the right man. ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       47.

                                  JOAN
                    He never saw the killer s face.  
                    You did.  But you couldn t admit to 
                    it without revealing your affair.  
                    And so Daren became the  official  
                    witness, relaying all the details 
                    you saw as if he were the one who 
                    came in the door that night. 

                                  BELL
                    Problem solved... until the police 
                    couldn t find the man you described 
                    to Daren.

                                  JOAN
                          (genuine sympathy)
                    That was hard on him... and you.

  Holmes holds up the old police sketch of Leah s killer:

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Twenty-two years later, you 
                    stumbled across a man who could 
                    pass for an older version of the 
                    man in this sketch.  Wallace 
                    Bishop.  And in order to give your 
                    husband the peace he d always 
                    craved... you told him you were 
                    certain Bishop was the man you saw 
                    that night.  

  Kate s eyes well with tears, but her voice stays steady.

                                  KATE
                    He was the man I saw.  He killed 
                    Leah.  

                                    GREGSON
                    As a matter of fact... he didn t.  
                    We were able to confirm a little 
                    while ago that he was out of the 
                    country at the time of the murder. 

  INT. LEAH STALTON S HOME - NIGHT2929

  Young Kate is still standing in the doorway, FROZEN with horror.  

  REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL Leah s killer is a MAN we ve never seen 
  before.  He strongly resembles the sketch... but he is not a 
  younger Wallace Bishop.

                    sooner or later.  Might as well 
                    tell us the whole story now. 

  A long and quiet beat.  Kate turns, stares out the window...

                                  KATE
                    I loved Leah, too.  But she wasn t 
                    my sister, she was Daren s.  What 
                    happened that night... it changed 
                    him.  I didn t love him any less.  
                    In some ways... I loved him more.

                    Doing the kind of work we do, doing 
                    it well... it helped him.  He got 
                    better.  But then, as we were 
                    coming up on the 20th anniversary 
                    of Leah s death... he started 
                    slipping away again. 
                          (turning to them)
                    We tried everything.  All kinds of 
                    therapy, anti-depressants.  None of 
                    it helped. 
                          (pained memories)
                    A few months ago I came home and 
                    found him with a gun.  He d already 
                    written me a note, saying good-bye. 
                          (beat)
                    I talked him down... but I knew it 
                    was only a matter of time before he 
                    tried again.  I had to do 
                      something.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And so when you came across Wallace 
                    Bishop during a routine background 
                    check, you devised a plan.  

                                  JOAN
                    He looked enough like the sketch to 
                    fool Daren.  That, combined with 
                    your insistence it was the same 
                    man, was all it took. 

                                  KATE
                    It was the only way to save Daren.

                    a hard choice.

                    Why do I feel so lousy? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Probably because that was 
                      Moriarty s intention.
                          (off her look)
                    I think this was an object lesson.  
                    Show me, a man who craves 
                      vengeance, how it can spread like a 
                    cancer... 
                          (re: Kate)
                    ...how it can infect and destroy 
                    the lives of others. 

                                  JOAN
                    You think this was all about 
                    getting you to back off? 

  Sherlock gives a small shrug.  Beat.

                      I guess... in a way... that means 
                    he s afraid of you.  Doesn t it? 

  Holmes hasn t time to process this possibility yet.  And so:

                    Your wife loves you very much, Mr.

                    ease your pain...

  A long beat as Daren reels, then he looks at Sherlock.  With 
  rising anger:

                                  DAREN
                    And what about you?  Why are you 
                    the one telling me all of this?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I thought you deserved to know --

                                  DAREN
                    You said that you understood me.  
                    That you experienced loss, too.  
                    But you couldn t even let me have 
                    one more night of peace.  After 
                    I ve suffered for twenty-two years.

  This lands on Sherlock.

                    I promise that I ll delve into your 
                    sister s case.  I ll do everything 
                    in my power to bring her killer to

                    The truth, Holmes, is that I hope 
                    we never meet.  My sense is that 
                    would be a great shame.

  nothing.

3333EXT. SECLUDED HOME / SIDEWALK   DAY  

  We re looking THROUGH THE BARS OF AN IRON GATE at a rambling but *
  rickety home on the outskirts of the city.  Sherlock steps INTO 
  FRAME.  Checks the address on The Actuary s phone against the 
  one he s arrived at.  He notes the CHAIN that binds the two *
  doors of the gate.  The ends of the chain are linked by a HEAVY *
  PADLOCK that s already been UNLOCKED.  And after he STUDIES the *
  house for the longest moment...

                    What do you think is inside?

  Sherlock TURNS to find Joan approaching.  Hard to say if we ve 
  ever seen him so surprised.  And as Joan holds up a CELL PHONE 
  that displays the same address and note that Sherlock received 
  via The Actuary s phone, she quotes something he said earlier:

                    I did.  Right after you told me 
                    you d never let Moriarty hurt me.

  She s obviously angry.  Which only serves to add to Holmes  
    confusion.  She explains:ELEMENTARY - EP. 121 - "RISK MANAGEMENT" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3-26-13       53.

  INT. SECLUDED HOME - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS3535

  In a room as spacious as it is spartan, Sherlock and Joan find a 
  WOMAN (30s) painting a canvas, a MONITOR strapped to her ankle.  
  Her back is to them as a dusty STEREO SYSTEM plays music.  *

  ON SHERLOCK -- suddenly frozen in his tracks.  He knows this 
  woman.  

  ON JOAN -- realizing something s come over him.

                    Sherlock, what is it?

  But Holmes STUMBLES.  Has to reach out to the wall to keep 
  himself upright.  And as he shakes his head --

  ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the woman at the canvas STARTLES, WHEELS to 
  face them.  And as we SEE she s frail but beautiful, a certain 
  pallor to her features as though she s been kept indoors a very
