      A DOOR sits in the woods.

      It's not in a wall, or even the remnants of a wall.  The
      doorframe stands in the woods, alone.  The frame is sturdy,
      maybe a little more hand-made than one might expect.  The
      door, however, is perfectly ordinary.   

      There's a growing ROAR.  It builds, builds --

      The door FLIES open.  Flynn, Baird, Ezekiel and Stone tumble
      through it from ... nowhere.

      As soon as they hit the ground, the Door SLAMS shut.

      They stumble to their feet.  Flynn grabs the door handle.

                                      BAIRD
                    What.  The.   Hell?

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson!  Judson!

      He throws the door open.  Nothing on the other side.  Not a
      void, just the forest.  He can walk through the empty frame.                                                                                        7.

                                      STONE
                    Where are we?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    When are we?
                          (off Stone)
                    It's day.  We time-travelled. 

                                      FLYNN
                      Time-travel, ugh, time travel's not
                    all it's cracked up to be. 
                          (looks down)
                    Hey, that is a lot of blood.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Let's not panic.  There's a logical
                    way to approach being trapped in the
                    past.  

                                      STONE
                    Okay.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    We find the local king.  Tell him we
                    have powerful magics, invent a steam
                    engine, and he gives us a duchy. 
                      Eventually we use our superior
                      technology to take over the land.

                                      STONE
                    ... you have put a lot of thought
                    into that.

      Baird's looking at her cell.

                                      BAIRD
                    I hate to break it to you, King Jones
                    the First, but I've got cell
                      reception.  American carrier.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course, we didn't travel through
                    time, just space.  We came west --
                    it's night in New York, but the sun's
                    still up on the West Coast.

                                      BAIRD
                    GPS coming online.

      Flynn does the latitude trick with his fingers.

                                      FLYNN / BAIRD
                    Latitude puts us in Oregon. / Oregon.                                                                                        8.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hah, still got iiiiiit --

      Flynn stumbles, semi-conscious.  Stone and Ezekiel grab him.

                                      BAIRD
                    He needs a hospital, now.  
                          (off cell)
                    Road's that way, but I don't see a
                    hospital.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    He's bleeding real bad.

                                      BAIRD
                    So we'd better move then.

      Baird sets off ahead to trailblaze.  Ezekiel looks at Stone.
      Stone shakes his head.  Flynn's not going to make it.


      They break through the treeline.  Damn well in the middle of
      nowhere.  Baird looks at the empty highway.

                                      BAIRD
                    C'mon, c'mon, a little luck.

                                      JENKINS  (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      JENKINS stands by a CLASSIC TRUCK parked by the side of the
      road.  He's in his 50's, oddly formally attired.  A suit, a
      waistcoat, just ... odd.

                                      JENKINS (CONT'D)
                    Your friend does not look well.  You'd
                    be needing a ride, then?

                                      BAIRD
                    Yes, I'm Colonel Eve Baird, this is
                    Flynn Carsen.  Stone and Jones, look,
                    can we talk on the road?

                                      JENKINS
                    No need to talk.  I hate to pry into
                    people's business. 

      As they load into the truck:

                                      BAIRD
                    What were you doing out here?

                                      JENKINS
                    Waiting.  I do that.                                                                                        9.


      The truck makes its way into the main highway artery bisecting
      the city of Portland.  But instead of heading into the center
      of the city and a hospital ...


      The truck picks its way through the old original waterfront
      area of Portland.  Trains still move through here, the
      buildings date back to the bad old Shanghai Tunnels days.

      IN THE TRUCK Flynn struggles to stay awake.

                                      FLYNN
                    Where are we?

                                      BAIRD
                    Almost to the hospital.

                                      JENKINS
                    The hospital?  No, no, why on earth
                    would we bring him to a hospital?
                    Ah, here we are.


      The truck stops outside a century-old ramshackle BRICK
      BUILDING.  Jenkins hops out, fishes out HEAVY KEYS.  Baird's
      already on him as Stone and Ezekiel ease Flynn from the truck.

                                      BAIRD
                    We need a hospital because he's been
                    stabbed!  He's bleeding out!

      Jenkins unlocks the door and enters the building.

                                      JENKINS
                      A hospital won't do him any good. 
                    Wounds caused by Excalibur don't
                    heal.  Magic.

      Flynn pulls himself awake.  He lurches out of Stone and
      Ezekiel's grasp, stumbles after Jenkins.


        ESTABLISHING a high-end PRIVATE JET over the Atlantic Ocean.


      Charlene finds Baird outside, keeping an eye on Stone and
      Ezekiel.

                                      BAIRD
                    They need Flynn to pull it together. 
                    They're too new to this world.

                                      CHARLENE
                    What about you?

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm a soldier.  Flynn's my assignment.

                                      CHARLENE
                    No, you're his Guardian.  That means
                    more than keeping him alive.  It
                    means keeping him in one piece,
                    mentally and physically.

                                      BAIRD
                    Didn't do a great job of that.

                                      CHARLENE
                    So he's been stabbed.  He's been
                    stabbed or shot or bitten or cursed
                    so many times in ten years I've lost
                    count.

                                      BAIRD
                    Charlene.  He's going to die.  Soon.

                                      CHARLENE
                    We're all going to die soon if you
                    don't get in there.  Look, action
                    hero, if you were out in Madagascar
                    or India or wherever and he fell
                    into a river, you'd reach in and
                    pull him out, right?  Before he could
                    drown.

      Baird nods.  Charlene's facade cracks for just a second.

                                      CHARLENE (CONT'D)
                    Judson was everything to Flynn.  To
                    both of us.  If he feels what I'm
                    feeling right now, he is drowning. 
                    Right now.  
                          (beat)
                    Go save him.

      Baird considers Charlene a moment.  Nods her curt soldier's
      nod, enters the Annex.                                                                                         17.


      CHYRON: "LONDON"

        ESTABLISHING the city, the landmarks.  Ending on (STOCK) of
      the TOWER OF LONDON.                                                                                        21.


      Flynn, Baird, Stone and Ezekiel cross to the RAMPARTS, look
      out over the city.

                                      FLYNN
                    Right.  Magic Stone hidden somewhere
                    out there.  About 12 hours left before
                    I die, end of the world probably
                    coming sooner than that.  Full day
                    ahead.

                                      BAIRD
                    How do we find the Stone?

                                      FLYNN
                    We need a compass.

      He starts walking, they follow. 


        Re-establish the city.  


      Flynn waits by the exit, chewing gum.  Ezekiel arrives with
      the Gem.  Flynn takes the Gem and presses his GUM onto it.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Yes, put your gum on a stone with
                    seven million euros.

      Flynn attaches a STRING to the Gem.  He lets it hang.

                                      FLYNN
                    Omnius arcunum directio.

      The Gem RISES, like a free-hanging pendulum, pointing off.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    That's pretty amazing.

      Baird and Stone RUN out.  Flynn and Ezekiel watch them pass.                                                                                        24.

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    He ... should not be running.

      They pile into a car.  Baird fires it up as more ALARMS SOUND.

                                      BAIRD
                    Where to?

                                      FLYNN
                    Follow the gem!

      They PEEL OFF as Guards exit the Tower.


      ON THE GEM at the end of the string, pointing straight ...

      ... at Buckingham Palace.

      Flynn and the others stare.

                                      BAIRD
                    That's Buckingham Palace.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes.

      Ezekiel checks his cell.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Good news.  There's a Charity event
                    tonight.  I bet I can forge us some
                    invites.

                                      BAIRD
                    We've just robbed the Tower of London,
                    and now you want me to break into
                      Buckingham Palace.

                                      STONE
                    It's more fraud than breaking and
                    entering.
                          (to Ezekiel)
                    Could you make me, like, a Duke?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Sure.

      Baird just walks off.

                                      FLYNN
                    She'll be back.  Possibly.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      THE RECEPTION.  Flashbulbs flash, Limos come and go.


        Re-establishing the palace.


      Stone, Ezekiel and Cassandra sit outside the Annex.  Stone
      and Ezekiel are close by, chatting. Cassandra has self-
      segregated, sitting miserably on a large suitcase.  

      They look up as Jenkins ENTERS with WHITE ENVELOPES,
      accompanied by Charlene. As he hands them out:

                                      JENKINS
                    I've completed your airplane tickets --

                                      CHARLENE
                    We completed.

                                      JENKINS
                    We did, that's right, and I have to
                    say, Charlene did a magnificent job
                    aligning your flight schedules and
                    payment process with the airline
                    mileage system for maximum savings
                      and mileage credits.

                                      CHARLENE
                    All the air miles the Librarian racks
                    up every year, you could trade those
                    in to fly to the moon!

                                      JENKINS
                    Oh, so you've flown on the --

                                      CHARLENE
                    Shh. No, they don't know about that.

                                      JENKINS.
                    Ah.
                          (beat)
                    Ah-hah!  "Fly to the moon", what a
                    colorful ... metaphor.  For a thing
                    that does not happen.  Well, I'd say
                    thank you for visiting, but I loathed
                    having you here.

                                      STONE
                    So that's it.

      Flynn and Baird cross in.

                                      FLYNN
                    For you, yes.  We've transferred
                    some pretty generous --                                                                                        47.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Not too generous.

                                      FLYNN
                    -- consulting fees into your bank
                    accounts, and arranged travel home. 
                    Thank you.  For everything.  But
                    it's not fair, or safe, I think, for
                    you to stay involved in this life.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    A life that would've been our life,
                    if luck had broken just a little
                      differently.

                                      STONE
                    Now we go back to our lives, knowing
                    the magic is real, knowing the world
                    is --

                                      CASSANDRA
                    -- so big, knowing the world is so
                    big.  What if we can't move on?

      She's suddenly embarrassed she spoke.  Looks down.  Flynn
        sympathizes, but he's made his choice.

                                      FLYNN
                    It's for the best.

      Flynn gestures for Jenkins to step aside with him. Baird
      comes forward, puts on her soldier voice.

                                      BAIRD
                    You've also all signed non-disclosure
                    forms so you will not tell anyone of
                    the events which occurred, the
                    existence of the Library or the
                      Librarian, of magic and secret
                      conspiracies and, well, anything. 
                    At all.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Or?

                                      BAIRD
                    Please, tell people all about the
                    magic Library, and Excalibur, and
                    how you broke into Buckingham Palace
                    because King Arthur is really Roman. 
                    I'll come visit you and make sure
                    the straight jacket's not too tight.

      ON FLYNN AND JENKINS                                                                                         48.

                                      FLYNN
                    Have you tried Temporal resonance,
                    how about if we find a Crystal Skull -

                                      JENKINS
                    Sir, I have tried everything. 
                      Everything.  The Card Catalogue is
                    still anchored to this reality.  It
                    can still access the records of the
                    Library, the books and manuscripts. 
                    That much of a connection still
                    exists.  But the Library itself,
                    with all it artifacts --

                                      FLYNN
                    And Judson.

                                      JENKINS
                    -- is cut loose from this world. 
                    The Library is adrift in time and
                    space.  The Library is lost.

      Flynn fights his emotions.  He heads inside.


      The same seating arrangement, with Jenkins and Charlene in
      the BG chatting.  

                                      EZEKIEL
                          (to Stone)
                    Come on.  Paris to Moscow to Tokyo,
                    all these great works of art you've
                    only seen in books are hanging on
                    museum walls.

                                      STONE
                    Until we take them off those walls,
                    that's what you're saying'.                                                                                        51.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    You are wasting your talents.

                                      STONE
                    I'd say the same.  How about you
                    consider going straight?  You got a
                    good man in there.  Deep, deep in
                    there under the jerk, but a good
                    man.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Being good's easy.  Being good at
                    what I do's hard.

                                      STONE
                    Brother, being a good man, just a
                    good man -- that's the hardest damn
                    thing in the world.  Sorry you don't
                    feel like you're up to the challenge.

      Flynn and Baird burst out.

                                      FLYNN
                    New plan!  Although I have the feeling
                    it's the old plan, and I just realized
                    it.  Please open your envelopes.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Our plane tickets?

      Flynn gestures impatiently.  They open the envelopes ... and
      REACT as GOLDEN LIGHT shines on their faces, and WORDS appear
      on BLANK PAPER:

      "YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO INTERVIEW ..."

      ON EZEKIEL as he realizes, despite himself, that perhaps
      redemption is at hand.

      "... FOR A PRESTIGIOUS POSITION ..."

      ON STONE as he sees a new chance at a life he gave up, a
      life the world told him isn't possible for men like him.

      "... AT THE METROPOLITAN LIBRARY ..."

      ON CASSANDRA as she sees a chance to finally, finally belong
      to something.  Where her curse is a blessing.

      ON FLYNN as he turns to Baird.

                                      FLYNN
                    Open yours.                                                                                        52.

                                      BAIRD
                    I lost mine back --

      She pulls a NEW ENVELOPE out of her jacket. Her eyes reflect
      GOLDEN LIGHT as she unfolds the paper within.  Jenkins and
      Charlene exchange looks, Flynn positively BOUNCING with glee. 
      He leads them all inside.

                                      FLYNN
                    Come on, come on.  We've got work to
                    do. 


      Flynn and Baird cross to Flynn's car.

                                      BAIRD
                    We'll have to find a Guardian for
                    them.  Only Stone can handle himself
                    in a bar fight, and I don't know how
                    many magical artifacts you're going
                    to find in dive bars.

                                      FLYNN
                    Actually, no.  I've found their
                    Guardian.

      Baird stares at him.

                                      BAIRD
                    Flynn, no.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hear me out.

                                      BAIRD
                    With Judson gone, who else can you
                    trust?

                                      FLYNN
                    No one, and that's the point. 
                    Judson's gone, the Library's gone,
                    if something happens to me -- they're
                    the future.  You're the first person
                    I've met in five years I trust.  So
                    you're the one I trust to watch them
                    and keep them safe.

                                      BAIRD
                    I thought you needed ... a Guardian.

                                      FLYNN
                    I need the Librarians protected more
                    than I need, want to be traveling
                    the world with you.  

      A beat.  She squares her shoulders, the old soldier back.

                                      BAIRD
                    Librarian and Guardian.  The job's
                    more important --                                                                                        55.

                                      FLYNN
                    No.  Don't say that, that's the old
                    way.  But for now, we need to work
                      separately.

                                      BAIRD
                    And who'll keep you alive?

                                      CHARLENE
                    Hold on, hold on!

      Charlene hustles out, pulling together her coat and luggage.

                                      CHARLENE (CONT'D)
                    I've arranged the plane tickets
                    online, we need to get to Madagascar,
                    there's an outbreak of the undead.
                          (off their look)
                    You don't think he'd actually last
                    five minutes without me, do you?

                                      FLYNN
                    I think --

      Charlene affectionately slaps his cheek, moves on.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Don't think too hard, Flynn, bad
                    things happen.  Come on, plane to
                    catch, zombies to fight.

      Flynn turns to Baird.  In one smooth move she grabs him and
      sweeps him in for the long hero kiss.  (The chemistry here
      makes it a little hard to tell exactly who thew hero's
      supposed to be.)  They separate.  She drops to parade rest.

                                      BAIRD
                    Come back alive, Librarian.

                                      FLYNN
                    I will.   Call.  Next time.  Be ...
                    wow.

      Flynn crosses to Charlene.  They get into the car and drive
      off.  There's just a beat of regret on Baird's face, then
      the professional is back.
