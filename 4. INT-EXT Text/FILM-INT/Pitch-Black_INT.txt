A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...
CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
The world is dying around her.
Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
in the next cryo-locked...
The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
Slapping an intercom:
FRY
Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
I'll get the warm-ups out while --
PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
HISSING in the air.
Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...
Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:
OWENS
Why did I fall on you?
FRY
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
looking right at him when --
OWENS
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
I mean, why did I fall at all?
FRY
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
OWENS
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
wait. I'm Owens. Right?
They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
identities.
FRY
Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
brain cells.
They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.
FRY
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
took a swipe at us.
OWENS
Just tell me we're still in the shipping
lane. Just show me all those stars, all
those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
That's why they have gravity.
FRY
Jesus God....
Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
steady herself. Over a headset:
OWENS (V.O.)
They trained you for this, right? Fry?
FRY?
She doesn't answer.
Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
open to reveal...
CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.
OWENS
... crisis program selected Number Two of
this system because it shows at least some
oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
(hammers a button,
SILENCES ALARMS)
-- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
did something right for a change....
As Fry runs more switches.
As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.
As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.
Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
actuators...
OWENS
...showing no major water bodies...maximum
terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
largely cinder and gypsum with some
evaporite deposits....
JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.
OWENS
Fry? What're you doing?
Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:
OWENS
Fry?
FRY
Can't get my nose down...too much load
back there....
OWENS
You mean that "load" of passengers?
FRY
So what, we should both go down too?
Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.
SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
from his, finding...
RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
"LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
RELEASE."
OWENS
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
for every one of those --
FRY
Company's not here, is it?
OWENS
When captain went down, you stepped up --
whether you like it or not. Now they
train you for this, so --
FRY
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
crash site! That's how they train you!
On a fucking simulator!
Owens unbuckles from his chair.
OWENS
Don't touch that switch!
Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.
FRY
I'm not dying for them.
She pushes it. But this time...
Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
blocked them open.
FRY
Owens!
OWENS
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
level this beast out!
Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...
The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
just a glimpse of landscape before...
The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
impossibly it holds. For now.
OWENS (V.O.)
What the shit was that?
Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...
A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.
INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
claws at safety restraints.
Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.
Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
into view. Land.
40 meters...30...20...10....
Fry braces.
IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.
IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
Owens slams into the ceiling.
IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
would've stayed inside, because just beside him...
The hull is cracking open.
NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
40 lives.
Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.
FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.
Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.
BLACKOUT
Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
Arabic. Soon we find...
Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...
Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
spooky combination. Nearby he sees...
The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...
AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.
AUDREY
Somethin' went wrong, huh?
Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...
Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.
Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
the chained feet so that...
Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
his neck.
JOHNS
One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
Never cease to disappoint me.
Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
elsewhere, Johns turns back at...
FRY (O.S.)
Hey.
JOHNS
Hey, who?
FRY (O.S.)
Hey, me. Over here.
His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
her. Fry. Buried to the gills.
JOHNS
Amazing. I'm Johns.
FRY
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
to ask:
FRY
Are there any others, Johns?
Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.
Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
to uncover...
Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.
OWENS
Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!
She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:
VOICES
Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
fast....
Fry grabs the rod.
OWENS
Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!
VOICES
You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
you got some drugs for this poor man....
OWENS
Don't touch that switch!
FRY
Awright, awright, someone...there's
Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
the cabin...next to....
But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
beings witness to such raw suffering.
FRY
Get away. Everybody.
The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
Leaving, they pass...
Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.
As Fry holds Owens, now dead.
Breaking out pressure suits:
FRY
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
to make it last.
AUDREY
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
we all just gonna die of exposure or
dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
something worse?
(off their looks)
Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
me.
SHAZZA
We're worried you'll scare us.
(ushering her away)
Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
goin' to Taurus Three like we were?
AUDREY
Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
to get there? Or will we have to resort
to cannibalism?
ZEKE
(to Fry)
I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
further, cap'n. With your permission,
a' course.
Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the
others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
problem. Riddick.
FRY
And him?
JOHNS
Big Evil?
FRY
We just keep him locked up forever?
JOHNS
Be my choice. Already escaped once from
the max-slam facility on --
FRY
I don't need his life story. Is he really
that dangerous?
JOHNS
Only around humans.
Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.
FRY
Oh, Christ....
They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...
And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
interior. Her face dies.
ZEKE (V.O.)
(shouting)
Well? Is it just the pump?
FRY
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
Anything to drink!
Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
has an access door.
PARIS
Mine here....
As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.
FRY
S'matter?
JOHNS
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Paris opens his container to reveal...
Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.
JOHNS
King Tut's tomb....
PARIS
Be surprised what these will fetch in the
Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
easy, easy. Very rare.
They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.
FRY
This is it? Booze? That's what you have
to drink?
PARIS
(educating her)
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
"booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
JOHNS
(cracking a bottle)
A toast to whatever he just said.
PARIS
I'll need a receipt for that.
(to Fry)
For all these.
FRY
Top of my list.
She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
both envy and aversion.
FRY
I don't suppose....
IMAM
One of the Christian habits we didn't
adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
have to wait.
JOHNS
For what? There is no water. You
understand that, don't you?
IMAM
All deserts have water, somewhere. God
shall lead us there.
START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
is...
Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.
Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.
Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.
FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
back and dumped into...
Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
Paris straggles in with antique curios.
JOHNS
What the hell are these?
PARIS
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
India. Very rare.
ZEKE
An' this?
PARIS
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
extinct.
ZEKE
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
things, be my guess.
PARIS
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
JOHNS
First, because he can only live out there
for so long -- he's gonna come back and
take what we got. Second, for the sheer
thrill of the kill.
A beat. They all grab for weapons.
Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
About to leave, Johns notices...
Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
still...
Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...
Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.
Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
Alone.
Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.
JOHNS (O.S.)
You know, I woulda played road dog for
these guys. You could've stayed back.
Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
if we don't find water....
"We may not make it back."
FRY (O.S.)
No, no, I wanted to get away.
JOHNS (O.S.)
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
quite so ready to leave her ship.
Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...
Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
all he wanted.
FRY (O.S.)
So now you know.
JOHNS (O.S.)
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
I thought.
Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
left behind. It's still got one good swallow.
Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...
Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.
Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
baseball. Posing with children.
Fry enters a dark room.
FRY
Lights.
No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
throws them open to reveal...
A man standing right outside.
JOHNS
(through window)
Hey. Don't go too far, huh?
Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.
It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.
FRY
No darkness. No lights because no
darkness....
Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
searching for usable goods.
PARIS
Tell me that was you.
AUDREY
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
PARIS
Assailing my fragile sense of security,
that's what.
SHAZZA
What're you goin' on about? She's been
right here for the last....
They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
passing outside. Someone.
SHAZZA
(a quiet probe)
Zeke?
No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
to a crack there.
HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
starts toward the ship.
Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"
Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
All eyes watch as...
The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...
And Shazza swings hard.
AUDREY
No!
Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.
TOTAL STRANGER
I thought...my God, I thought I was the
only one who....
He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
and understands what he's done.
PARIS
Oh, Lord....
AUDREY
It was just somebody else. From the
crash. He was just....
ZEKE
Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....
He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
covet...
Zeke's breather.
As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.
Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.
FRY
So where is he?
Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.
FRY
Tell me about the sounds. You told them
you heard something right before....
(no response)
If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
another crack at it -- at your skull.
RIDDICK
'Mean the whispers?
FRY
What whispers?
RIDDICK
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
spot -- just to the left of the spine,
fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
so I used it to catch a little run-off.
Metallic taste to it, human blood.
Coppery. But if you cut it with
peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
Course, that's more for winter.
Summertime, I take mine straight.
Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.
FRY
Why don't we try the truth now?
A head-shaking beat, then:
RIDDICK
All you people are so scared of me --
an' most days, I'd take that as a
compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
worry about now.
FRY
Show me your eyes.
Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.
FRY
Show me, Riddick.
Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
those of a starved jaguar.
FRY
You did this? To yourself?
RIDDICK
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
FRY
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
RIDDICK
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
suns.
(replacing goggles)
Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
one. No ma'am, not this time.
FRY
Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
We looked.
RIDDICK
Look deeper.
He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.
Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.
Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
forward to reach...
Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...
An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.
FRY
They're hollow....
CLICK-CLICK.
Fry slow-turns toward the sound.
CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.
There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
Something unfolding.
An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
chain, but...
Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.
Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.
CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....
The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
skulking the perimeter, circling.
Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
was faster than a lightning-strike.
A paralyzed beat before...
Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
springing straight up into...
The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.
FRY
Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!
FRY
I'm over here in the --
Something tugs on her chain.
FRY
Oh, God....
CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
out footholds.
A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...
The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.
She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
undo the belt. Suddenly...
Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
pick-ax. Hands reach inside...
As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.
FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...
The spired hills.
Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
THUMPING it down on the deck.
IMAM
One is all?
FRY
For now.
At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.
A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.
RIDDICK
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
JOHNS
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
at Riddick's head.
RIDDICK
Woof, woof.
The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
blew off his wrist chains.
JOHNS
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
The way it coulda gone and didn't.
RIDDICK
(deaf)
Say that again.
JOHNS
Here's the deal. You work without the
chains, without the bit -- without the
shivs. You help us get off this rock....
RIDDICK
For what? The honor of goin' back to some
asshole of a cell?
JOHNS
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
much as you wanna be free of me.
A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.
RIDDICK
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
JOHNS
Only if we both get outta this alive.
And there may be a way.
He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.
RIDDICK
(staring at hand)
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
Would if I were you.
JOHNS
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.
RIDDICK
Want you to remember this moment.
He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
emptied gun and walks away.
START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...
Lights wink on throughout the ship.
FRY
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
But we'll need more cells.
JOHNS
How many?
FRY
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
Five total to launch.
JOHNS
25 kilos each, huh?
SHAZZA
Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
it up and chuggin'.
JOHNS
Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
tap our problem child out....
(looking out)
Where's Riddick?
CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...
PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
Riddick and Johns.
Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.
IMAM
...and for this, our gift of drink, we
give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
father, Allah the Compassionate and the
Merciful.
PARIS
(to himself)
The strangest religion....
Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.
PARIS
Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
were these people, anyway? Miners?
SHAZZA
Looks like geologists. Advance team,
moves around from rock to rock.
JOHNS
Musta crapped out here, huh?
AUDREY
But why did they leave their ship?
Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.
Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
there something in the rafters?
JOHNS
(answering Audrey)
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
PARIS
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
SHAZZA
Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
them off-planet. Long gone.
PARIS
A toast to their ghosts, then....
Goblets rise.
RIDDICK
Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
Zeke got them. They're all dead.
It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
What, you don't really think they left
with their clothes on the lines? Photos
on the walls?
SHAZZA
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
know.
RIDDICK
I know you don't uncrate your emergency
ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
JOHNS
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
theories on --
FRY
(to Riddick)
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.
IMAM
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
RIDDICK
(to Fry and Imam)
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
over Pilgrim #3 and...
The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.
Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:
Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.
As Imam hears the SCREAM.
IMAM
Ali....
CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...
A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
still alive.
As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.
HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
past Johns to enter and find...
The empty coring room.
IMAM
Ali?
A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
come out? Imam opens the door...
And hatchlings pour out.
Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...
Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.
Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
down...
The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.
SHAZZA
Why was the door chained up? Why the
bloody hell would they lock themselves in
like that?
JOHNS
Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
better not be diggin' another grave out
there.
RIDDICK (O.S.)
Other buildings weren't secure...
They turn. Riddick enters.
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
(looks down shaft)
Someone forget to lock the back door.
Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:
SHAZZA
So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
saw it. You was right there.
Riddick nods.
SHAZZA (CONT'D)
You were tryin' to kill him too.
RIDDICK
(shrugging, "not
necessarily")
Just wanted his O-2.
(a beat)
Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
When he shot up that stranger instead.
Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.
SHAZZA
Take it.
RIDDICK
(suspicious)
What, it's broken?
SHAZZA
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.
JOHNS
(to Fry)
Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
stick to daylight, should be all --
FRY
60 years ago.
JOHNS
Wha'?
Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
scrutinizing them.
FRY
Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
years ago. This month.
SHAZZA
Yeah? What's special about that?
FRY
Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....
But now Fry remembers...
The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...
Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
accelerating the orbits.
CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."
They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.
JOHNS
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
RIDDICK
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.
FRY
(jarred)
He can pilot?
JOHNS
Hijacked a prison transport, made a
helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
FRY
(with faint hope)
Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
can use him to help with --
JOHNS
He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
Fry.
A mental shiver.
FRY
You said we were going to trust him now.
You said there was a deal.
JOHNS
That's what I said.
He challenges her to read his mind.
FRY
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
playing, Johns.
JOHNS
May've noticed chains don't work on this
guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
believin' --
FRY
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
royally fuck him over.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
over at the last possible minute -- when
the wings are ready, when we know we're
ready to launch.
Fry looks at him with new eyes.
FRY
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
Let him go if that's what it --
JOHNS
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
do his bid.
Shaking her head, she looks off.
FRY
Dancin' on razor blades here...
JOHNS
I won't give him a chance to grab another
ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
The hatch closes, seals.
CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
scans rising pressure gauges.
RIDDICK (O.S.)
Looks like we're a few shy....
Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
bay. And he has Imam's blade.
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
Power cells.
FRY
They're coming.
RIDDICK
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
drive yet.
(half-beat)
Strange unless he told you the particulars
of my escape.
FRY
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
RIDDICK
An' now you're worried about a repeat of
history?
FRY
Entered our minds.
RIDDICK
I asked what you thought.
FRY
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
Can I get back to work now?
She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
pressure builds.
RIDDICK
Think Johns is an do-right man? You
think I can trust him to cut me loose?
A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?
FRY
Why, what'd you hear?
RIDDICK
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
twice as much alive.
(reading her face)
Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
greed.
It knocks her off stride, but...
FRY
Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
each other -- no matter how hard you try.
Riddick moves right up behind her.
RIDDICK
I don't truly know what's gonna happen
when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
do know that once the dyin' starts, this
little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
itself apart. So you better find out the
truth. Come nightfall, you better know
exactly who's standing behind you.
A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.
RIDDICK
Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
why your crew-pal had to scream like that
'fore he died.
CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
eager arm vein.
FRY (O.S.)
Who are you? Really?
Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.
FRY (CONT'D)
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
mercenary who goes around talkin' about
the law like --
JOHNS
I never said I was.
FRY
Never said you were a hype, either.
She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.
JOHNS
You have a little caffeine in the morning,
I have a little morphine. So what?
FRY
And here you got two mornings every day.
Wow, were you born lucky?
JOHNS
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
FRY
(lashing)
You made it a problem when you let Owens
die like that. When you had enough drugs
to knock out a fucking mule-team.
JOHNS
Owens was already dead. His brain just
hadn't caught on to that fact.
FRY
Anything else we should know about you,
Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
games with our lives when --
He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.
JOHNS
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
cord.
(giving her hands back)
So maybe the care and feeding of my
nerve-endings is my business.
FRY
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
"Captain, Captain...."
JOHNS
Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
Right, "captain"?
It cuts deep.
Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
door...
Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
his cell and stumbles after.
Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.
Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.
The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.
AUDREY
What if...what if she's still out there...
still alive....
JOHNS
Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
here...but 'member that boneyard? These
just might be the fuckers that killed
every other living thing on this planet,
okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
door anytime soon are just about zero
squared.
FRY
(agreeing)
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
a natural die-off.
IMAM
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.
AUDREY
(whispering)
Why do they do that? Make that sound?
IMAM
Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
reflecting back.
FRY
(realizing)
Echo-location. That's what it is....
Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...
Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
the tunnel-like hold.
A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"
FRY
Breach in the hull. I dunno.
More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.
JOHNS
I'd rather piss glass.
RIDDICK
Well, you got the big gauge.
JOHNS
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
AUDREY
Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
are you still --
IMAM
No, no, no, I do not believe --
JOHNS
C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
just lose the goddamn....
More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.
RIDDICK
Big beads.
Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...
The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
his head and a light around the door to spot...
Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.
JOHNS
(to others)
Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
that musta --
Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...
A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.
In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.
JOHNS
Very big beads.
PARIS
Not staying in here another....
He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
Fry lunges for him.
FRY
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
PARIS
I know what's in here!
IMAM
Everybody come, this way and we should be
safe. Hurry, please....
Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
SCRATCHING.
Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
the gasses to illuminate...
The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
BLOWS drive everyone back.
RIDDICK
(to Johns)
Can you do sumpin' else with that?
'Sides holding it in my fucking face?
Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
blades of the predators.
An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...
Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
sweeping, hunting.
SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
always entering darkness.
Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
cargo with their bodies.
Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...
PARIS
Hello, hello?
...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
open container, the one where Johns found predators.
Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.
Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.
PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.
(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
subject in 3-D space.)
Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
"Where's Riddick?"
He's in a stare-down with a predator.
Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
caught in a vice-like grip.
RIDDICK
Don't. Move.
RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
one reaches down with its scythe blade...
And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
of.
CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.
More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
One test-slices Riddick's shirt.
In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
escape hatch:
FRY
Imam? Where are they?
CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.
IMAM (O.S.)
Hasan?
FRY (O.S.)
Riddick?
TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.
RIDDICK
No....
The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.
RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.
Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
escape hatch as...
Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...
The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
beast HOWLS and flails back.
HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.
FRY
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
JOHNS
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."
Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.
FRY
There....
PARIS
Like the light is scalding it.
FRY
It hurts them. Light actually hurts
them....
VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
scraps of the pilgrim.
IMAM
Is that...Hasan?
Riddick nods.
JOHNS
We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.
Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.
FRY
...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
two more in the cabin...I think two
more....
PARIS
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
well.
FRY
How many bottles?
PARIS
Not sure. Ten?
FRY
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
Would they burn?
(reading his face)
If you got a receipt?
PARIS
Possibly.
FRY
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
JOHNS
Enough for what?
Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
I pray you go insane.
FRY
(to others)
We can stick to the plan. If we get four
cells back to the skiff, we're off this
rock.
PARIS
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
night.
FRY
We'll have to carry the cells...drag
them...whatever it takes.
Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
the floor growing dimmer?
AUDREY
You mean...tonight? With all those things
still out there?
PARIS
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
JOHNS
Back it up. How long can this last? Few
minutes? Couple hours?
No one knows for sure.
IMAM
I had the impression...from the model...
that the two planets were moving as one.
That there would be...a lasting darkness.
JOHNS
Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
if these animals really are phobic about
light, we just sit tight till then.
FRY
I'm sure that's what someone else said.
Locked inside that coring room.
A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.
JOHNS
Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
the kid especially. How scared is she
gonna be out there?
FRY
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
screen.
JOHNS
Smoke screen for what?
FRY
For your own fear.
JOHNS
(eyes narrowing)
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
seconds and let someone else come up with
a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Two seconds pass.
FRY
How much you weigh, Johns?
JOHNS
What the hell's it matter?
FRY
How much?
JOHNS
79 kilos.
FRY
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
meat, and that's why you can't come up
with a better plan.
He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
the underside of Riddick's chin.
RIDDICK
Think about that reward, Johns.
JOHNS
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
RIDDICK
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
poised for evisceration.
JOHNS
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
IMAM
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.
FRY
(to Audrey)
They're afraid of our light. That means
we don't have to be so afraid of them.
IMAM
And you're certain you can find the way
back? Even in the dark?
FRY
No, I'm not. But he can.
She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.
PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.
Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
lover's look. Behind him...
FRY
Ready, Johns.
He palms the shell.
JOHNS
He'll lead you over the first cliff.
You know that, don't you?
FRY
We're just burnin' light here.
JOHNS
You give him the cells and the ship --
and he will leave you. He will leave you
all out there to die.
FRY
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
valuable in your life that you're worried
about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
all? Besides your next hype?
(no response)
Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
of us.
As hands yank the last power cell.
Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
shotgun in the dark.
The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.
FRY
Riddick? RIDDICK?
Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.
AUDREY
What? What is it?
RIDDICK
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
GO OVER IT!
Steeling themselves, they start climbing.
But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...
One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...
And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.
PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
different predators.
FRY
Audrey!
Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...
A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
the metal...
And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.
Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
to rip free of the shield.
Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.
The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...
Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
CLICKS MADLY at him.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.
The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
its skull-blade.
Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...
...yanks his shiv...
...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
predator falls, disemboweled.
REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.
RIDDICK
Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.
They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
person short.
IMAM
Suleiman!
RIDDICK
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
IMAM
SULEIMAN!
RIDDICK
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
of existence.
Riddick boards the dark craft.
Connects the power cells to the battery bay.
Watches the ship come to life.
As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.
Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
actually startled by the sight of...
Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
over.
Eye-lock.
Riddick opens the hatch.
CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.
In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
hypnotically at the stars ahead.
RIDDICK
Probably okay to talk to me now.
AUDREY
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
away when this whole thing started.
(a beat)
Where you goin'?
RIDDICK
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
this whole thing....
Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.
RIDDICK
Might interest you....
Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.
IMAM
New Mecca....
RIDDICK
Think a soul could get lost there? With
all those pilgrim-types?
IMAM
It's more a place where souls are found,
Mr. Riddick.
As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...
