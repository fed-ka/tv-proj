                     Lois....                                        (X)

      Clark grabs Lex's arm.                                         (X)

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                           (barely able to control
                            himself; to Lex)
                     I don't know yet what you've done               (X)
                     to her, but I will find you. And I
                     will bring Lois back.  And if I
                     have to go right through you to do
                     it, I will. I promise you.

      Wanda glares at Clark.  Lex wrenches free.                     (X)

                                      LEX
                     Why, that sounds like a threat,
                     Clark.  My woman doesn't take
                     kindly to threats.

      He smiles, jumps in the car, hits the gas, takes off up the
      street.  We are shooting over Clark's back as the Clone        (X)
      enters FRAME, sidles up to him.

                     Well.  I guess it's just you and
                     me.

      He stares over at her as CAMERA CRANES UP, leaving Clark and 
      the Clone watching each other.
