LONG LENS into the crowd . . . Pauline is not participating in the hymn. Her eyes look about uninterestedly.
ZOOM IN . . . on Miss Stewart glaring straight at CAMERA.
Pauline mouths the last couple of words.
The hymn finishes.
MISS STEWART
Sit!
Everybody sits.
SCHOOL FRENCH CLASS - MORNINGClass 3A are in the midst of a French lesson. All the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "French name." MISS WALLER gestures at a screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard.
MISS WALLER The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate, somebody . . . quickly!
A SCHOOLGIRL - LAURA - blurts out from the front of the class.
LAURA
"He wanted her to give him some money."
MISS WALLER
(Angry) Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!
The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the room.
The presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up.
MISS STEWART
Good morning, gels.
CLASS (In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart.
The class sit.
MISS STEWART
Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.
Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily.
JULIET
I am actually from England, Miss Stewart.
MISS STEWART
Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.
Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class.
MISS STEWART
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.
Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet.
MISS WALLER
You can sit over here, Juliet.
Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.
MISS WALLER
We use French names in this class. You can choose your own.
Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing.
MISS WALLER
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .
JULIET
Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.
Miss Waller turns to Juliet-who now has the name "Antoinette" hanging around her neck.
JULIET
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.
MISS WALLER
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."
Juliet stands.
JULIET
You should have written "vint."
Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word.
MISS WALLER
(Embarrassed mumble) Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.
Juliet stands again.
JULIET
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.
Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger. The class looks terrified.
MISS WALLER
(Icily) Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book to page 17.
Pauline is smirking.
CUT TO:
The teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them around the tables.
MRS. COLLINS
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.
The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her. They pair off and Juliet is left alone.
MRS. COLLINS
Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.
JULIET
That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one.
Mrs. Collins scans the class.
MRS. COLLINS
Pauline . . . are you with anybody?
Pauline shakes her head.
MRS. COLLINS
Good! You can come here and pair up with Juliet.
Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet's table.
SERIES of SHOTS showing VARIOUS GIRLS sketching their partners. Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces. Mrs. Collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls.
MRS. COLLINS
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.
PULL BACK. . . to reveal Pauline's "pose" . . . slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face. She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing furiously . . . but doesn't refer to Pauline at all.
MRS. COLLINS
Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???
Mrs. Collins picks up Juliet's drawing. It features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.
JULIET
St. George and the Dragon.
Mrs. Collins studies the detail in the drawing.
MRS. COLLINS
Where's Pauline?
JULIET
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.
Juliet glances at Pauline.
JULIET
Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!
MRS. COLLINS
Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!
Mrs. Collins moves on. Juliet looks up at Pauline rather grumpily. Pauline leans forward, an intense look on face . . .
PAULINE
(Whispers) I think your drawing's fantastic!
CUT TO:
HONORA RIEPER is standing at her sink bench. She is 43 years old. Dark hair, going gray. A middle-aged woman with a kind face.
Her husband, HERBERT, has just arrived home and is taking off his coat, looking at the mail, etc. He is nearly 60 . . . 15 years older than Honora.
The Riepers' house is clean and tidy. They are a low middle-class family on a modest income.
HONORA
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.
Herbert comes up behind Honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.
HERBERT
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
HONORA
playfully shoves his hand away.
HONORA
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
HERBERT
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.
STEVE
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?
HERBERT
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?
STEVE
Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.
HONORA
glances at his album.
HONORA
You have been splashing out!
STEVE
Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .
STEVE
starts fishing in his pockets.
At this moment . . . Pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. She strides past Honora, HERBERT and STEVE
.
PAULINE
(Brightly) Hello!
HONORA
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Pauline disappears into the lounge.
PAULINE
(O.S.) (Calling) Got an A, Mum!
HONORA
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
HONORA
Don't worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.
HERBERT
Doris Day!
STEVE
I think she's very talented!
FAST PULL-BACK . . . from the speaker as the opening notes of "Be My Love" by Mario Lanza burst out. Records from the cabinet lie scattered on the floor. Pauline is clutching a Mario Lanza album.
STEVE backs toward the hallway door, holding his Doris Day album forlornly.
HERBERT chuckles at him through the kitchen doorway.
HERBERT
(Laughing) Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!
Pauline stares misty-eyed at the album cover. HERBERT
calls out.
HERBERT
(O.S.) (Tongue in cheek) Hey! Isn't it that Irish singer . . . Murray O' Lanza?
PAULINE
(annoyed) He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!
Mario Lanza starts singing . . . HERBERT comes into the lounge, miming the song with a limp fish. He gesticulates a grand operatic fashion.
PAULINE
Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!
She pushes HERBERT out of the room, into the kitchen.
CUT TO:
JULIET
(V.0.) Mummy and Daddy sent me to the Bahamas to recuperate. I didn't see them for five years-but we're together now and Mummy's promised they'll never leave me again.
INSERT:

PAULINE
(V.0.) I spent ages in hospital, too . . . with my leg. I had to have all these operations.
The Donkey Serenade continues over a MUSICAL SEQUENCE:
Pauline watches Hilda out of the corner of her eye. She cocks her little finger in the same fashion as Hilda, and she spoons her soup up.
PULL BACK to reveal sculpted horses, knights and dragons on the table top.
CLOSE-UP . . . a Christmas present is torn open . . . followed by several more, in QUICK CUTS. Typical 1952 presents.
A Christmas tree adorns the Riepers' lounge. Some simple streamers and ornaments decorate the room.
SUPER: "Christmas, 1952"
Honora, Herbert, WENDY and Pauline are sitting on the floor, amid presents and discarded wrapping paper, GRANDMA PARKER is sitting in a chair.
Pauline unwraps her present . . . a diary. Her eyes light up. HERBERT
leans over.
HERBERT
Hope it's all right. It's from Whitcomb and Tombs . . .
Pauline opens the diary . . .
CUT TO IN1: RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM - DAYCLOSE-UP of the Jan. 1st page. Pauline's pen starts to write . . .

Bayliss wanders in.
STEVE
Pikelets! Yum!
PAULINE
(Appalled) Aren't you going out?
STEVE
Not till two-thirty . . .
He reaches for a pikelet-Pauline pushes him away from the table.
PAULINE
This is a private function! Go away!
STEVE
retreats, hurt and confused. HONORA
brings in a plate of scones.
The doorbell rings.
HONORA
Come on! Sausage rolls.
HERBERT
(O.S.) Come on through.
HONORA
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
HERBERT
Look who I've found!
HONORA
whips off her pinny as HERBERT
leads Juliet into the dining room.
HONORA
Hello, Juliet.
JULIET
Hello, Mrs. Rieper . . . it's so nice to meet you.
Juliet shakes hands with Honora.
CUT TO:
LATER IN THE LUNCH:
Herbert, Honora, Pauline and Juliet are sitting at the table, in the middle of lunch.
JULIET
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
HONORA
and HERBERT
exchange a glance. HONORA
smiles at Juliet.
HONORA
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
JULIET
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
HERBERT
They sound like a queer mob!
PAULINE
Dad!
HONORA
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
JULIET
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
INSERT SCENE
JULIET
(V.O.) She has deep discussions with unhappy couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she's only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!
WALTER PERRY is now sitting across the table from Hilda. He is ruggedly handsome, in his mid-40s
WALTER My wife's blaming me . . . says it's all my fault.
HILDA And how do you feel about that, Mr. Perry?
WALTER Please . . . call me Bill. I don't know what went wrong. My wife feels . . .
HILDA No . . . no . . . let's talk about your feelings . . . Bill.
The air is crackling with subtext.
JULIET
(V.O.) Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
HERBERT
What's that?
JULIET
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
HONORA
and HERBERT
exchange a glance.
DING DONG! . . . doorbell rings. HONORA
gets up.
HONORA
Eat up, Yvonne.
She leaves the room. Juliet raises her eyebrows at Pauline, who looks embarrassed.
PAULINE
(Quietly) It's my middle name.
HERBERT
smiles at Juliet.
HERBERT
Yvonne tells us you're good at making models.
JULIET
I adore anything to do with the arts.
HERBERT
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Pauline looks down, cheeks burning.
HERBERT
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
JULIET
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT
shakes his head.
HERBERT
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Muffled voices from the hallway.
PAULINE
He's the manager!
HONORA
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
HONORA
(O.S.) This is the dining room . . .
She smiles at Juliet.
HONORA
Do excuse us.
She leads John into the hallway.
HONORA
(O.S.) Breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.
Pauline scowls.
HERBERT
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
JULIET
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
HERBERT
(Laughs) Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
HERBERT
chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each with knowing smiles.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Diary V0.) We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .
PAULINE
Push! . . . Breathe! . . . It's coming! . . . Oh, God!
PULL OUT . . . to reveal Juliet lying on her bed, in childbirth pose. Her pregnant stomach is pushing at the seams of her school dress.
Juliet wails . . . Pauline pulls out a pillow from between Juliet's legs, her face a mixture of surprise and elation.
PAULINE
It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!
Pauline hands Juliet the pillow. She cradles it in her arms.
JULIET
I shall call him Diello.
PAULINE
You're such an incredible woman.
JULIET
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.

Juliet is standing at the front of the class, reading from an essay.
JULIET

Pauline sits at the back, smirking.
MRS. STEVE
NS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet!
JULIET
. . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .
MRS. STEVE
NS That's enough, Juliet!
Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. STEVE
ns rips the essay out of her hand and waves it under her nose.
MRS. STEVE
NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke?
JULIET
No, Mrs. STEVE
ns.
MRS. STEVE
NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!
Pauline leaps to her feet.
PAULINE
It's not rubbish!
MRS. STEVE
NS Sit down, Pauline!
JULIET
I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE
n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.
Pauline points at the blackboard.
PAULINE
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!
MRS. STEVE
NS (Yelling) Sit down!
Pauline sits down, looking victorious.
MRS. STEVE
NS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!
Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. STEVE
ns's face darkens.
MRS. STEVE
NS Stop it, Juliet!
Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts, trying not to laugh.
Juliet slumps over her desk, coughing . . . globules of blood splatter her exercise book.
Pauline's smile vanishes.
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mrs. Hulme told me they had found out today that Juliet has tuberculosis on one lung. Poor Julietta. I nearly fainted when I heard. I had a terrible job not to cry.
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
HONORA
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
HONORA
Come on, sit up.
PAULINE
I'm not hungry.
HONORA
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
PAULINE
I just want to be on my own for a while.
HONORA
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
HONORA
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
HONORA
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
PAULINE
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
HONORA
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
PAULINE
But she'll have no one to look after her!
HONORA
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
MATCH CUT TO:
HILDA It's not too late to cancel our travel arrangements . . . if that's what you want?
Juliet tearfully shakes her head. Henry is standing at the foot of the bed, hands behind his back.
HENRY I'm sure you'll like it here . . . it's very tranquil.
HILDA I've spoken to the Matron, and she promises to take special care of you.
HENRY And you can carry on with your studies while you convalesce.
Hilda touches Juliet's hand, and leans forward . . . a concerned look on her face.
HILDA It's for the good of your health, darling.
Juliet looks at her mother, eyes filling with tears. Henry pats her feet.
HENRY Cheer up, old thing . . . four months will fly by in no time.
CUT TO:
HONORA
(V.O.) Juliet won't be allowed visitors for at least a couple of months.
HONORA
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
HONORA
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT
glances at Pauline.
HERBERT
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
Pauline remains silent.
HONORA
You used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.
MOVE IN . . . on Pauline, who has not been listening.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!
As we listen to Juliet's V.O., we see SCENES of TB hospital life . . . the meals brought around . . . the dayroom . . . the DOCTORS.
JULIET
(Letter V.O.) My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .
As her V.O. continues . . . TRACK INTO a CLOSE-UP of Diello's fierce little face . . .
JULIET
(Letter V.O.) Although only 10, Diello has thus far killed 57 people and shows no desire to stop . . . it worries me, Charles.
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) My dearest darling Deborah. Affairs of state continue to occupy my time.
Pauline washes a pile of dishes in the kitchen.
PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.
Pauline is sitting in the lounge, looking very boring during a game of Lexicon with Herbert, John and a ROSS. Pauline is waiting for her turn, unaware that John is studying her from across the table. Her
word PUTRID spelled out.
PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) Only yesterday I was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Letter V.O.) . . . Diello insisted on coming along . . . in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself. Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well . . .
IMAGES of Pauline's painting: people being run through with swords, heads coming off, etc.
CUT TO:
JULIET
(Letter V.O.) Oh, Charles . . . I am despair enough to put Diello in the hands of the Cardinal, in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path.
REVEREND NORRIS Hello again . . .
Juliet peers up at a DOG-COLLARED VICAR. She eyes him coldly.
REVEREND NORRIS How are you getting along? It must be awfully hard being away from your school chums . . . I've got something here you might just like to have a look at.
He hands Juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure in a great deal of pain. "JESUS LOVES YOU" is printed across the top.
Juliet's face hardens.
REVEREND NORRIS Unfortunately, modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like TB. And that's why I'm here . . . because with the power of God, miracles can happen. The Lord has said that those who have faith will be saved! Reach out, Juliet! Reach out for Jesus!
During Reverend Norris's speech . . . CAMERA closes in to BIG CLOSE-UP of Juliet's face. Reverend Norris's voice fades away. . .
SUDDENLY!!!
A silhouetted figure rises up behind Reverend Norris . . . a lumpy hand closes around his throat!
REVEREND NORRIS Aaaaarghhh!!!
Diello - the Plasticine figurine, now life-size - drags Reverend Norris off his feet and across the room.
Reverend Norris kicks and struggles as Diello hauls him through the doorway onto . . .
follows behind her. Within sight of the dayroom, Pauline breaks into a run, nearly bowling a NURSE over.
HONORA
Yvonne!
JULIET
I'm so happy to see you!
HONORA
hurries over.
HONORA
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
JULIET
Thank you so much!
Juliet sits back in her chair. She holds Pauline's hand. HONORA
admires Juliet's knitting-a red cardigan.
HONORA
That's coming along well!
JULIET
(Pleased) I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
PAULINE
I love the colour!
Juliet smiles at Pauline.
JULIET
It's for you.
Pauline squeezes Juliet's hand.
is looking at some mail on a small table. Pauline is sitting at Juliet's bedside.
HONORA
Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.
JULIET
(Sarcastically) I'm saving them for a rainy day.
HONORA
gives her a sympathetic look.
HONORA
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
JULIET
(Bitterly) They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
HONORA
looks startled at the outburst.
JULIET
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
HONORA
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
HONORA
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
JULIET
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Pauline looks at Honora.
HONORA
We've got a tram to catch, Yvonne.
Pauline hugs Juliet and reluctantly takes her leave.
CUTTO:
JOHN This is quite something . . . you're damn clever.
Pauline beams.
JOHN So . . . Deborah is married to Charles, and this chap Nicholas . . . is her tennis instructor?
PAULINE
Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.
She gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or the shelf.
JOHN Looks like you, Yvonne.
Pauline beams.
PAULINE
Juliet made it!
John smiles.
JOHN This is really quite incredible. l bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.
PAULINE
Oh, yes! It's all worked out!
John returns Nicholas to the shelf, placing him amidst whole family of beautifully sculpted Plasticine figures. Pauline self-consciously returns to her sculpting, aware that John is watching her keenly.
JOHN (Loud whisper) Yvonne!
Pauline sits up, groggily flicking on a bedside light.
PAULINE
Whaddya want?
John puts his fingers to his lips to shush her.
JOHN (Whispers) l can't sleep . . . can l borrow a book?
PAULINE
(Whispers) Shut the door.
John tiptoes across to the bookshelf He pulls a book out . . . "Girls' Own Annual 1951."
JOHN This looks interesting.
Pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed.
John stands shivering, flicking through the annual.
JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated. Have you tried the tea cosy?
Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing.
He glances at Pauline nervously.
JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? My feet are like iceblocks.
PAULINE
You should have worn your slippers.
JOHN Come on, Yvonne, I'll catch me death!
Pauline rolls to one side.
PAULINE
Just for a minute.
John climbs into bed beside Pauline and pulls the blankets up around his chin.
CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Theatrical voice) "Now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee," and she goes . . . "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! Silly old trout!
PULL OUT during Pauline's V.O.... to reveal John lying in bed beside her. He cuddles up to her.
JOHN I love you, Yvonne.
Pauline continues, oblivious to his attentions.
PAULINE
And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (Squawky voice) "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (Normal voice) God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!
JOHN Do you love me as much as I love you?
PAULINE
0f course, my darling Nicholas.
John can't contain himself . . . he starts pressing himself against her body.
JOHN (Panting) My . . . my name's John.
Pauline lies on her back, not responding to his caresses.
PAULINE
I like Nicholas much better!
John climbs on top of Pauline.
JOHN You can call me anything you like . . .
John fumbles around beneath the sheets.
PAULINE
What are you doing?
JOHN Nothing . . .
SUDDENLY!
The outside light flicks on. Sound of footsteps stomping down the path.
THE DOOR OPENS!
PAULINE
Bloody hell!
John desperately tries to conceal himself beneath the bedcovers as . . .
The light flicks on . . . HERBERT
stands in the doorway. He surveys the situation with a grim expression.
John rolls out of bed and staggers toward the door fumbling with his pyjama cord.
HERBERT
Go to the house.
John scuttles out of the sleepout. Pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father.
HERBERT
(Upset) You have broken my heart, Yvonne.
HERBERT
turns and leaves the room. Pauline stares at the ceiling.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I lay there mesmerised. It was just too frightful to believe . . .
CUT TO:
looks thunderous and stomps off.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) When I got up I found Father had told Mother . . .
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal STEVE
, Ross, a new boarder, LAURIE, and HERBERT
seated around the table. The boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes.
LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr. Rieper?
HERBERT
shakes his head, sullenly.
Wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.
WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me.
HONORA
stands in the doorway.
HONORA
John's no longer staying here.
Wendy looks surprised.
LAURIE Shot through, this morning . . . said his old Mum had taken sick.
tidies up, glowering at her daughter.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
HONORA
(Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Pauline bangs a dish into the rack.
HONORA
(Angry) If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
HONORA
sighs.
PAULINE
Can I go now?
HONORA
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
HONORA
You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!
Pauline flinches.
HONORA
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
PAULINE
Well, I guess I take after you then!
HONORA
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
PAULINE
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
HONORA
steps back.
HONORA
(Softly) You're going to be late.
Pauline triumphantly walks past her mother. HONORA
barely reacts as Pauline hurries out.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE-U P . . . John's sweaty face, still grunting furiously.
CRASH CUT TO:
JOHN Yvonne!
Pauline is lying on the bed beneath him. She looks at him with glazed eyes.
She pushes John away and sits up in bed.
JOHN (Worried) I didn't hurt you, did I?
Pauline jumps out of bed and starts to dress.
PAULINE
I've got to go home.
John jumps out of bed and wraps his arms around her.
JOHN I love you so much.
MOVE IN . . . on Pauline's emotionless face.
CUT TO:
Pauline runs into the room. Juliet stands and they embrace hugging each other tightly.
Henry enters the room and frowns at the sight of the girls hugging. Juliet reaches out for Henry and pulls him into the embrace. He looks decidedly ill at ease as Pauline's black hair nuzzles against his neck.
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Of a man who possesses two beautiful daughters,
Henry adjusts the rearview mirror and catches sight of their clasped hands.
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,
Henry's steely gaze in the rearview mirror.
The poem continues over a visual montage:
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,
CLOSE-UP . . . Juliet's face, staring intently ahead.
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,
PULL OUT . . . to show Pauline and Juliet lying in opposite ends of a hot, steaming bath, staring at each other.
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) The wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.
Pauline and Juliet . . . sleeping in each other's arms in bed.
PAULINE
(Poem V.O.) And these wonderful people are you and I.
FAST TRACK IN . . . to the bedroom door.
Henry is silently observing the two sleeping girls, his face stoney.
Sound of a distant thunderclap . . .
CUT TO:
HENRY Mrs. Rieper . . . may I come in?
HONORA
is standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.
HONORA
(Surprised) Yes, of course.
are sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. HERBERT
is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle.
HENRY Your daughter's . . . an imaginative and a spirited girl- HONORA
If she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say. All those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind . . .
HENRY It's rather more complicated than that. Since Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home, Juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner . . . surliness, short temper . . . general irritability-most uncharacteristic.
HERBERT
is pouring a drink.
HERBERT
Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?
HENRY No, thank you. The thing is . . .
HONORA
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
HERBERT
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
HENRY My wife and I feel the friendship is . . . unhealthy.
HERBERT
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
HONORA
frowns at Henry.
HONORA
(Concerned) I'm not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.
Henry pauses for a moment.
HENRY Your daughter appears to have formed a rather . . . unwholesome attachment to Juliet.
HONORA
(Worried) What's she done???
HENRY She hasn't done anything . . . it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert trouble before it starts.
Henry hands a business card to Honora.
HENRY Dr. Bennett is a very good friend. He's a general physician, but has some expertise in child psychology. If Pauline is indeed developing in a rather . . . er . . . wayward fashion, Dr. Bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.
CUT TO:
DR. BENNETT (O.S.) What about your studies . . . are you enjoying school?
DR. BENNETT is seated behind his desk. Pauline is silent. She looks at the ceiling. HONORA
is sitting next to Pauline.
DR. BENNETT Are you happy at home? Pauline is silent.
HONORA
Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.
Pauline remains silent.
HONORA
(Annoyed) Yvonne!
DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . . perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting outside.
HONORA
leaves the room.
DR. BENNETT Do you like your mother?
Pauline hesitates for a moment.
PAULINE
No.
DR. BENNETT And why is that?
PAULINE
She nags me.
DR. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes?
Pauline looks wary. She doesn't answer.
DR. BENNETT Or is it because you want to be with Juliet?
No answer.
DR. BENNETT Do you . . . like girls?
PAULINE
No.
DR. BENNETT Why not?
PAULINE
They're silly.
DR. BENNETT But Juliet's not silly?
PAULINE
(Emphatic) No!
DR. BENNETT Yvonne . . . there's nothing wrong with having a close friend, but sometimes things can get . . . too friendly. Such associations can lead to trouble. It isn't good to have just one friend . . . my wife and I have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, and it's all perfectly healthy. Perhaps you could think about spending time with . . . boys- Dr. Bennett stops in mid-sentence, a look of surprise face. He looks down at his chest . . .
A red bloodstain is slowly spreading across his shirt. Dr. Bennett twitches slightly as the blade of a sword work its way out of his chest!
Pauline's face lights up as . . .
Diello rises up behind Dr. Bennett.
DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Bloody fool!
CRASH CUT TO:
HONORA
looks up from her chair.
Dr. Bennett appears in the doorway behind Pauline. He casts a wary glance in her direction.
DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper . . .
HONORA
bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.
DR. BENNETT Homosexuality . . .
HONORA
looks horrified.
DR. BENNETT I agree, Mrs. Rieper, it's not a pleasant word. But let us not panic unduly. This condition is often a passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.
HONORA
But she's always been such a normal, happy child.
DR. BENNETT It can strike at any time, and adolescent are particularly vulnerable.
HONORA
But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .
Dr. Bennett shrugs.
DR. BENNETT Physically, I can find nothing wrong. I've checked for TB and she's clear. I can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder.
HONORA
(Shocked) Oh . . .
DR. BENNETT Look, Mrs. Rieper . . . try not to worry too much. Yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving family behind her. Chances are she'll grow out of it. If not . . . well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds. There could be a breakthrough at any time!
in the kitchen. HERBERT
wanders by and goes through the adjoining door into the lounge. He sits down and opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The family are chatting to each other, but we do not hear their conversation because . . .
. . . we are listening to Pauline's V.O.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .
CAMERA CRANES UP . . . through the ceiling and into . . .
CAMERA CRANES UP past the foot of the bed to reveal Pauline lying on her back, looking very morose.
TRACK IN TO her intense face as her V.O. continues . . .
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.
CUT TO:
Honora, Herbert, Wendy and Pauline are sitting on the floor, amidst presents and discarded wrapping paper. Grandma Parker is sitting in a chair.
HERBERT
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA
looks at her with concern.
HONORA
(Concerned) Is it hurting, dear?
Pauline looks blank.
HONORA
Your leg . . . have you got pain?
Pauline shakes her head. She rips open a present . . . a new diary.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."
Pauline looks up from her diary as the CAMERA RUSHES IN toward her face.
I NT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING

HONORA

HONORA
This arrived today, Yvonne . . .
Pauline looks at her mother with distaste.
PAULINE
My name is Gina!
HONORA
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
PAULINE
What does old Stew want?
HONORA
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
PAULINE
Who cares!
HONORA
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
PAULINE
I'm educating myself!
HONORA
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE
I'm doing my own writing!
HONORA
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
HONORA
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
PAULINE
(Scornful) What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
HONORA
is very angry.
HONORA
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
PAULINE
(Shouting) I don't wanna be in bloody school!
HONORA
(Shouting) All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
HONORA
storms out of the room and slams the door.
Digby's Commercial College
Pauline sits amongst rows of young ladies, typing. MISS DIGBY patrols the aisles. Pauline looks bored and morose as she stabs dejectedly at the keys.
PAULINE
I think I'm going crazy.
JULIET
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
PAULINE
Let's go overseas . . .
JULIET
You mean travel by ourselves?
Pauline nods.
JULIET
Where shall we go? Not the Bahamas; it's bloody awful!
A few moments of silence as the girls contemplate.
JULIET
(Excited) Of course! It's so obvious!
CUT TO:
He pauses as he overhears giggles and splashes coming from the bathroom. He puts his ear to the door . . .
JULIET
(O.S.) I know . . . I'll lean back and put my hair on my shoulders-then I'll look just like Veronica Lake!
Sound of a camera clicking.
PAULINE
(O.S.) Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
JULIET
(O.S.) Hurry up! I'm freezing!
PAULINE
(O.S.) Just a couple more . . .
JULIET
(O.S.) I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Henry frowns. Sounds of a camera clicking.
Henry opens the door and enters.
HENRY Those girls are up to something in the bathroom! I think they're taking photographs of each other!
HILDA Just leave them alone, Henry.
HENRY I'm prepared to tolerate that Rieper girl's presence but I will not stand for any . . . hanky-panky.
HILDA I'm sure it's all perfectly innocent.
Pauline and Juliet hurry around the darkened lounge, lifting various bits of silver and china. They are dressed their nighties.
PAULINE
(Whispers) I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
JULIET
(Whispers) They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
JULIET
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
PAULINE
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
JULIET
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
RIEPERS' HOUSE - DAWNSunrise over 31 Gloucester St.
Pauline doing housework: sweeping floors, ironing, hanging washing, folding, dusting, cleaning bath . . .
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose at 5:30 this morning and did housework before 8 o'clock, including taking Wendy her breakfast in bed. I feel very pleased with myself on the whole and also the future.
Pauline spins around and stares straight into the CAMERA.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We are so brilliantly clever.
ILAM GROUNDS - DAYWHACK! A tennis ball is hit by a racquet.
Hilda and Walter Perry are playing mixed doubles on the court laid out in the Ilam grounds, behind the house.
SUPER: "Two Weeks Later"
It's a sunny, festive afternoon. Picnic blankets are laid out around the tennis court. Tables of food and colourful awnings have been erected around the lawn.
Henry is chatting to some friends beside the tennis courts.
Thirty cars are filling the drive in front of the house. People are wandering around, admiring the gardens.
Dr. Bennett and his wife, PEARL, are strolling along the edge of the river. SUDDENLY . . .
SPLASH!!! . . . Dr. Bennett and Pearl are drenched in a shower of water as a large rock lands in the river beside them.
CUT TO:
Pauline and Juliet in the bushes across the river from the Bennetts. Juliet is peering through the foliage. Pauline has just clearly hurled the rock.
JULIET
Direct hit! Gave his trousers a good soaking! Everyone will think he's peed himself!
They dissolve into giggles.
CUT BACK:
To the Bennetts . . . and some other GUESTS as they hear the sound of giggling and rustling leaves.
CUT TO:
Pauline and Juliet strolling through the thick undergrowth, eating bunches of grapes and drinking straight from a sherry decanter.
JULIET
(Mouth full) Bloody Bill's sniffing around Mummy something chronic.
They pause by a tree, with a clear view across the river to Hilda and Walter playing tennis.
PAULINE
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
JULIET
(Sarcastic) That was what we were led to believe . . .
INSERT SCENE:
HILDA Henry . . . I'm terribly worried about Bill Perry. He's just had a spell in hospital and has nowhere to convalesce.
HENRY No?
HILDA I've offered him the flat . . . he really shouldn't be left by himself . . . not in his condition.
Juliet is eating, quietly watching her parents.
JULIET
(V.O.) I was looking forward to the ambulance arriving . . .
CUT TO:
HILDA It used to be the servants' quarters, but it's very comfortable.
WALTER Oh, corker!
Hilda and Walter wander into another room . . . Henry struggles through the front door carrying Walter's cases.
Pauline is lying in the bath, writing in her exercise book
She turns the page and calls out.
PAULINE
Just washing my hair now, Laurie. Won't be a moment.
Laurie is seated outside the bathroom door. He is dressed in a bathrobe, and has a new change of clothes on his lap.
HONORA

HONORA
Is she still in there?
HONORA
(O.S.) Pauline . . . Come on, you've had enough time.
Pauline sighs.

PAULINE
(O.S.) (Facetious) Yes, yes, yes!
HONORA
(Angry) You open up this door right now!
Sound of Pauline getting out of the bathwater.
PAULINE
(O.S.) (Angry) I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
HONORA
(Angry) Open this door!
The door opens and Pauline strolls out, a towel around her. HONORA
starts berating her. However, we only hear Pauline's V.O. as HONORA
follows her down the corridor.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Mother gave me a fearful along the usual strain.
Pauline pauses by her bedroom door as HONORA
continues talking to her.
CLOSE UP . . . HONORA
talking to Pauline, soundlessly.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rang Deborah immediately as I had to tell someone sympathetic how I loathed Mother.
CREEPING POV . . . down the CORRIDOR.

SUPER: "23rd April 1954"
Juliet's hand reaches for the door handle.
ZIP PAN AROUND TO . . . Hilda and Walter sitting bolt upright in bed! A tray of tea sits on a bedside table.
JULIET
The balloon has gone up!
HILDA What on Earth are you talking about? Mr. Perry is ill . . . I've brought him a cup of tea.
WALTER Would you like one, Juliet?
JULIET
Don't try and fob me off! It's going to cost you a hundred pounds, or I'm blabbing to Daddy!
Hilda looks at Walter, appalled. She looks Juliet square in the eye.
HILDA Mr. Perry and I are in love, Juliet.
Juliet s eyes widen at this unexpected confession.
WALTER Hilda!
HILDA Your father knows about us. Until other arrangements can be made, we've decided to live as a threesome.
Juliet looks confused. Tears spring to her eyes.
JULIET
(Angry) I don't care what you do! Pauline and I are going to Hollywood. They're desperately keen to sign us up. We're going to be film stars!
HILDA What are you talking about?
JULIET
(Yelling) It's all arranged . . . we don't need your bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!
Juliet turns and leaves, slamming the door.
Hilda puts her head in her hands.
CUT TO:
Rain is pelting down outside.
PAULINE
(Calling out) Hello?
No reply . . . Pauline goes up the stairs.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Deborah was still in bed when I arrived.
Pauline rushes over to the bed. Juliet grabs her and hugs tightly.
WHIZ PAN AROUND and FAST TRACK IN TO . . . Henry standing in the doorway.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Dr. Hulme asked us to come into the lounge to have a talk with him.
Hilda walks past and Juliet glares hatefully at her.
HENRY Your mother and I are getting divorced.
Juliet is in shock. She clutches Pauline's hand.
MOVE IN . . . to CLOSE-UP of Pauline.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding . . .
Pauline's V.O. continues over . . .
A conversation between Henry and the two girls. The large lounge at Ilam is dark and cold. The mood is bleak.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) He said we must tell him everything about our going to America. He was both hope-giving and depressing. We talked for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was over.
Henry ushers Pauline and Juliet out of the lounge. He walks Pauline toward the front door.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) What is to be the future now? We may all be going to Italy and dozens of other places, or not all. We none of us know where we are and a good deal depends on chance.
Pauline is lying in bed, writing in her diary.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) One thing Deborah and I are sticking to: through everything, we sink or swim together.
HENRY Your mother and I have talked things over and we've made some decisions . . . I am resigning from the university and will be taking up a position back in England.
Juliet looks horrified.
JULIET
(Vehemently) But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!
Hilda looks hurt.
HILDA We thought it best that you accompany your father. . .
JULIET
(Worried) Is Gina coming, too?
HENRY (Annoyed) Of course not!
JULIET
(Angry) I'm not going to England without Gina!
Hilda and Henry exchange an awkward glance.
HILDA You're not going to England, darling.
Juliet looks confused.
HENRY I'm leaving you in South Africa with Auntie Ina.
Juliet starts to tremble.
HILDA That chest of yours isn't getting any better. The warmer climate is just what you need . . .
HENRY For the good of your health.
Juliet opens her mouth and screams.
CRASH CUT TO:
PAULINE
(Intense) The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
HONORA
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
PAULINE
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
HONORA
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
PAULINE
(Intense) You have to let me go!
HONORA
stands and walks toward the door.
HONORA
We'll talk about this when you've calmed down.
HONORA
pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.
CLOSE-UP . . . Pauline's face as we hear her diary V.O.:
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
HONORA
Love, you can still write to each other.
HONORA
softly touches Pauline's cheek. Pauline winces, averting her face.
MOVE IN . . . to EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Pauline's eyes.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .

Henry is on stage for the unveiling. He shakes hands with PROFESSOR 2. Hilda is sitting amongst various dignitaries on the stage.
PROFESSOR 1 is at the podium.
PROFESSOR 1 I can not begin to attempt to measure the inestimable value of Dr. Hulme's contributions to Canterbury College, both social and official. We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme all the best for the future.
On sound of large audience clapping:

PULL OUT . . . to reveal newspaper story entitled "Canterbury College Bids Farewell to Rector Today."
PULL OUT FURTHER . . . as the CAMERA rises vertically above Pauline. She is slumped on the hall floor, holding the phone to her ear. The newspaper lies open beside her.
JULIET
(O.S.) (Through phone) Everything's going to be okay, Gina. Mr. Perry's promised to give me 50 pounds for my horse . . .
JULIET
(Hushed) That's a hundred and twenty! It's another 30 pounds and we've got the fare!
INTERCUT WITH:
PAULINE
(Upset) It's no bloody good . . . I went to the passport office today. They won't give me one till I'm 20.
CUT between Pauline and Juliet . . .
JULIET
But that's not true! I've got one.
PAULINE
(Choked up) I need my sodding parents' consent.
Tears well in Juliet's eyes.
JULIET
(Sobbing) Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!
Hilda quietly looms up behind Juliet. She gently takes the phone out of Juliet's hand and puts it back on the receiver. Juliet struggles in Hilda's arms, pushing her mother away, screaming.
Pauline stands holding the dead phone.
HONORA
Yvonne.
Pauline turns and faces her mother.
HONORA
Please don't be like this, love.
Pauline gives HONORA
a cursory glance and walks past her, up the stairs. HONORA
looks after her, a hurt expression on her face.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.
CUT TO:

HILDA She's uncontrollable. I've told her that Pauline is not going to South Africa, but she refuses to accept it.
HERBERT

exchange a glance.
HILDA I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.
HONORA
shakes her head.
HONORA
(Upset) Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.
HILDA Yes . . . well, it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.
HERBERT
She's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.
HILDA What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together. We'd like Pauline to come and stay with Juliet, until she leaves.
HERBERT
Is that a good idea?
HERBERT
looks at HONORA
. . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.
HERBERT
Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme?
HILDA Yes, of course.
HERBERT

Pauline gasps as Diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room. Characters from Borovnia fill the room. Juliet dances with Charles.
A man in a dark suit turns around . . . MARIO! He launches into the second verse!
Pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around.
PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!
They are no longer in the lounge - at some point the waltz has dissolved into . . .
BANG! . . . CLOSE ON . . . Juliet flinching.

Pauline and Juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.

MOVE IN . . . to clock . . . 11:05.
Juliet puts her bags on the table. Her satchel drops with a clunk. Pauline's eyes flick to the satchel, then up to Juliet.
HONORA
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA
silently.
HONORA
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
JULIET
Fruit.
HONORA
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
HONORA
picks up the satchel. Pauline and Juliet tense up . . . as HONORA
puts the satchel on a chair.
PAULINE
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
JULIET
(Vacantly) All right, then.
Juliet follows Pauline out of the room. Pauline has to nip back and grab the satchel.
Pauline is sitting on her bed looking at the brick.
Juliet stands beside her. She tugs at her collar.
JULIET
Do you feel sweaty? I feel sweaty.
Pauline opens a draw and pulls out a stocking.
PAULINE
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
JULIET
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
PAULINE
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
JULIET
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot in the foot.
PAULINE
. . . but in the end I decided against it. I thought it would spoil all their fun.
Pauline puts the brick in her shoulder bag.
JULIET
(Bitterly) Affairs are much more exciting than marriages . . . as Mummy can testify!
They both laugh.
CUT TO:
Pauline and Juliet are laughing loudly.
PULL OUT . . . across the table to reveal Honora, Herbert, Wendy, Pauline and Juliet in the middle of lunch.
PAULINE
It's true! He was spotted in the lingerie department, eh, Wendy?
WENDY There's nothing wrong with Sir Edmund Hillary buying underwear for his wife. He was a very nice man!
JULIET
I bet it was thermal underwear!
Pauline roars with laughter.
PAULINE
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
HONORA
That's enough, Yvonne!
Juliet roars with laughter. The others don't laugh.
HERBERT
That man's a credit to the nation.
Pauline and Juliet dissolve into giggles.
HONORA
Right . . . who's going to help me clear away?
WENDY I will, Mum . . . anything to get away from Laurel and Hardy!
HERBERT
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
HERBERT
pulls his coat on. HONORA
gives him a peck cheek.
HONORA
Bye.
HERBERT
Have a nice outing, you lot.
PAULINE
Bye, Dad.
JULIET
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
HERBERT
wanders out. HONORA
turns to Pauline and Juliet.
HONORA
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
CLOSE-UP . . . kitchen clock . . . 1:13.
HONORA
is sitting at the back with Pauline and Juliet bus winds its way toward the Cashmere Hills.
Pauline and Juliet are scoffing scones as HONORA
drains her cup of tea. Pauline notices HONORA
glancing at the last remaining scone.
PAULINE
(Gently) You have it.
HONORA
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
JULIET
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
HONORA
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
CLOSE-UP . . . clock on wall . . . 3:02.
LOUD TICKING . . .
Pauline pushes the plate to Honora.
PAULINE
Go on, Mum, treat yourself.
Honora's will weakens. She picks up the scone and takes a big bite.
