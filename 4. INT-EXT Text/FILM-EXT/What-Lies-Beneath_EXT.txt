SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.
CLAIRE
...and I still think we should get you
some mittens.
Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
The bond between them is palpable.
CLAIRE
Do you have a scarf?
CAITLIN
Hey.
Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.
CLAIRE
Yes?
CAITLIN
It's only two hours away.
CLAIRE
I know that.
CAITLIN
I'll come back all the time.
CLAIRE
Of course you will.
CAITLIN
I'm just saying, you're going to be
fine.
Claire smiles.
CLAIRE
Sweetheart, I've known this day was
coming for a long time.
I've got your
father and the garden and the new house.
You really don't have to worry.
Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
concern.
Claire takes her hand.
CLAIRE
Really.
She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.
Her
eyes close.
CAITLIN (V.O.)
Mother...
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY
Claire's frozen in the hug.
CAITLIN
(beat)
Mom.
Her eyes open.
Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on
the college campus.
The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
background.
CAITLIN
I have'ta go.
After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.
Caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
this overt display of maternal affection.
CAITLIN
I'll call you.
Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her
daughter's hand.
It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.
CLAIRE
Come home anytime.
Caitlin looks at Norman.
NORMAN
Really gonna leave me, huh?
She nods.
They share a tender look.
NORMAN
Be good.
She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.
A bit
overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
Caitlin's head.
After a moment, she steps back...
CAITLIN
Bye.
...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
Columbia dorm.
A banner is draped across its portals which
reads:
"WELCOME CLASS OF '04."
Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.
Her
eyes are shining.
Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.
CLAIRE
(smiling)
I almost made it.
They turn and head for the car.
Claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder.
ANGLE
Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.
FRONT YARD - DAY
Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.
The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.
She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.
Suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.
She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.
It
is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.
Claire makes
her way over to the fence.
The women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.
She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.
All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.
Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out...
CLAIRE
Hello...
There's no reaction.
CLAIRE
Mrs. Feur?
The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.
The blue
shape vanishes from view.
CLAIRE
Wait a minute.
I just want--
Something bumps against the fence.
Claire draws back.
She
hears heavy breathing.
MRS. FEUR
(sniffling)
Who are you?
CLAIRE
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.
From
next door.
Is everything--
MRS. FEUR
You're the flower lady.
CLAIRE
Um...yes.
MRS. FEUR
I've seen you.
From the window.
CLAIRE
Is everything alright?
Claire leans closer to the tiny crack.
She sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye.
There's no response,
just the breathing.
CLAIRE
Hello?
MRS. FEUR
I'm not...
She seems on the verge of losing it again.
MRS. FEUR
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I
can't breath...
CLAIRE
Who?
Your husband?
MRS. FEUR
And I'm afraid.
Oh god, I'm so afraid
of...
She trails off.
CLAIRE
What?
What are you afraid of?
MRS. FEUR
I can't, no, no, I can't...
Claire edges closer to the crack.
CLAIRE
Tell me.
Please.
MRS. FEUR
That I'll just...that one day I'll
just...disappear.
Beat.
Claire's taken aback by this admission.
CLAIRE
Tell me.
I can help you.
MRS. FEUR
How?
How can you help me?
With your
flowers and your perfect life...
CLAIRE
That's not...It's not like that.
MRS. FEUR
I've never even met you.
CLAIRE
I know.
And I'm sorry.
I've been consumed
with...my daughter left...for school.
MRS. FEUR
This fence...it's so...
CLAIRE
I'm sorry.
It's for the flowers.
Why
don't you...
Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the Feur's driveway.
MRS. FEUR
Oh God.
He's back.
I'm sorry.
Please
forget that I...I don't know what I'm
saying.
Please...
CLAIRE
Wait!
Don't go...
Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a
LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.
A CAR DOOR swings open and a
MAN'S SHOES follow down the path.
Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time.
She sits there for a
moment listening, but all is quiet.
CLAIRE (V.O.)
She sounded terrified.
BACKYARD - MORNING
Claire sets up a camera and tripod.
She steps back and aims
her camera.
She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
FEUR'S HOUSE.
One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open, but no one's there.
Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.
The
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.
She glances back at the Feur's window.
The CURTAIN IS NOW
CLOSED.
She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence.
She can barely see over, but glimpses:
A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.
Just then, a car
pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her
perch.
DRIVEWAY - DAY
Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in
her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.
CLAIRE
Hey there.
Jody hugs her.
JODY
How you holding up?
CLAIRE
Good.
I'm good.
JODY
You are?
CLAIRE
Why does everyone find that so
surprising?
JODY
(are you kidding?)
Cause...your...only daughter just went
away to school...who you were incredibly
close with aaand I'd be tripping...
CLAIRE
Okay, I'm a little tender.
JODY
Well good.
So you're human.
CLAIRE
And so far my day has consisted of taking
pictures of my roses for the garden club.
JODY
Wow.
Got here just in time.
(reaching into her bag)
I brought you this.
She proffers several homemade tea bags.
CLAIRE
What is it?
JODY
Kambucha mushroom tea...
CLAIRE
Jody--
JODY
It soothes heart-ache and promotes
psychic wellness.
Sela suggested I bring--
CLAIRE
You're discussing me with your psychic?
JODY
She's not a psychic.
Just a very
enlightened spirit.
CLAIRE
Thanks, but I'm fine.
JODY
(pressing it into her hand)
So you'll have some later.
(beat)
Notice anything...different?
Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
Karman-Ghia behind her.
CLAIRE
Oh my god.
You bought it.
JODY
Yep.
CLAIRE
It's niiice.
JODY
Beautiful thing, alimony.
Lose a husband,
get a car.
Think it'll help me pick up
dudes?
CLAIRE
Absolutely.
JODY
Listen, I've gotta run.
I just thought
I'd stop by and see if you want to take
the boat out, say Thursday morning?
CLAIRE
You got it.
Jody grins.
JODY
See you then.
Jody drives off.
Claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.
She
starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.
Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
doorknob.
She stops.
A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
within.
Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:
LAKE - DAY
Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
the water's edge.
Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who
bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.
Claire gazes at the
LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.
Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.
Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark
water.
CLAIRE
Cooper...what do you see?
She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
the reflection of her face.
Cooper rumbles a low growl.
The
shape seems to be gaining definition.
RRRING!
Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.
CLAIRE
(into phone)
Hi.
NORMAN (V.O.)
(on the other end)
I'm stuck here for another couple of
hours.
Claire's smile fades.
CLAIRE
Oh.
NORMAN (V.O.)
Unless you need me to come home...
CLAIRE
No, no.
It's fine.
Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...
NORMAN (V.O.)
You sure?
...but the shape is gone.
NORMAN (V.O.)
Claire?
CLAIRE
Huh?
Absolutely.
Take your time.
She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.
GARDEN - DAY
A stiff autumn breeze.
Claire stands at the fence.
CLAIRE
Mrs. Feur?
She looks through the tiny crack.
Nothing.
CLAIRE
Hello?
(beat)
Are you there?
Silence.
THE FEUR'S - DAY
Claire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW.
She looks
up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads
around back.
FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY
She takes in the lake view from the large porch.
The wind is
really blowing.
Her eye catches on something.
Propped
against the back door...
THE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL
Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
then knocks at the back door.
There's no answer.
She knocks
again.
Nothing.
She's turning to go, then the door swings
open.
The smile fades from Claire's face.
CLAIRE'S POV
The immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.
MR. FEUR
Yes?
CLAIRE
Um...
MR. FEUR
I'm running late here.
I just came back
for my briefcase.
CLAIRE
Right.
Well, I wanted to stop by to
welcome you to the uh, to the
neighborhood.
I'm Claire Spencer.
From
next door.
MR. FEUR
This really isn't a good time.
He starts to close the door.
CLAIRE
Well maybe your wife...
MR. FEUR
(growing cold)
She isn't here.
CLAIRE
When...when will she be back?
MR. FEUR
I don't know.
CLAIRE
Oh-kay...
MR. FEUR
I have to go.
Slam.
And Claire is staring at a closed door.
JODY (V.O.)
What do you mean she's gone?
LAKE - DAY
Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the
Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD
LIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.
CLAIRE
She's not there.
I haven't seen her since
that morning.
Well, I mean, I've never
actually seen her, but I'm telling you,
she's disappeared.
Jody finishes securing a line.
The breeze is mild, so they
just cruise with the wind.
JODY
What are you saying?
Claire just looks at her.
JODY
You think he killed her?
CLAIRE
I don't know.
When you say it, it sounds
crazy.
But what else could it all be?
Jody shakes her head.
CLAIRE
I mean, he's so kind of grim and
daunting, and she sounded terrified of
something.
Claire glances over at Jody.
CLAIRE
(laughing to herself)
Listen to me.
I sound like some middle-
aged Nancy Drew.
Jody regards her.
After a beat:
JODY
Know what I think?
CLAIRE
What?
JODY
Seance.
CLAIRE
Jody, no...
JODY
Telling you...
CLAIRE
(overlapping)
...no...no...no...
JODY
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
CLAIRE
Please.
That's all I need.
Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."
Beat.
JODY
Hey, look.
CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake.
JODY
So pretty.
CLAIRE'S POV
A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study.
CLAIRE
Someone's there.
JODY
What?
CLAIRE
In the window.
Norman's at work.
JODY
I don't...
Claire looks over at Jody.
CLAIRE
(pointing)
There.
In the study.
Don't you see--
She looks again-- nothing.
CLAIRE
Wow.
I'm losing it.
JODY
No, you're not.
(beat)
But a presence in your house is not
something to be taken lightly.
Claire stares back at the house.
HALLWAY - NIGHT
Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the
work room.
She holds onto her arm.
JODY
I have to go.
CLAIRE
Jody, wait.
Cooper's growling in the work room.
They look in.
JODY
Claire, this is...this is...
Claire, transfixed, walks in.
LAB BUILDING - NIGHT
Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened
university building.
He sees Claire standing at the foot of
the steps.
NORMAN
What are you doing out here?
CLAIRE
He killed her.
I'm not crazy.
He killed
her and--
NORMAN
This is the Feur thing?
CLAIRE
Yes.
And he's going to get away with it.
Norman's momentarily speechless.
NORMAN
How do you know this?
CLAIRE
We had a seance.
NORMAN
Who did?
CLAIRE
Jody and I.
And she was there, Norman,
she was.
It scared Jody so bad she had to
leave.
NORMAN
How did you--
CLAIRE
Jody brought a Ouija board and we
summoned her.
He regards her for a moment.
NORMAN
Are you angry at me?
This stops Claire in her tracks.
CLAIRE
What?
NORMAN
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
CLAIRE
What are you...?
No.
NORMAN
You know what I've got at stake with this
paper.
You know that.
I can't help but
think that you're doing this now to hurt
me, or to sabotage me somehow.
CLAIRE
Sabotage?
NORMAN
Ever since the accident I've been
worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
CLAIRE
The accident...?
NORMAN
But then you've been so much better...
CLAIRE
Norman, this isn't about you.
This is
something that's happening to me.
It's
not to get even...and it's not some
warped bid for attention.
Some strange
things are happening in our house,
whether you believe in them or not...
NORMAN
Sweetheart--
CLAIRE
No!
Not sweetheart, no.
I believe in
what's happening.
I don't want to, but I
do.
I guess I was foolish enough to think
that would be enough for you.
She turns on a heel and walks toward her car.
CAMPUS - NIGHT
Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of
the concert hall next door.
NORMAN
You're overreacting.
She turns on him.
CLAIRE
Don't tell me how to react!
Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.
NORMAN
Keep your voice down.
CLAIRE
I will NOT.
Some of the bystanders stop to watch.
CLAIRE
(still loud)
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm losing my
mind...
NORMAN
(looking around)
Claire, please...
Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
intensity.
CLAIRE
...But what if I'm not?
What if she died
in terror and betrayal and some part of
her can't move on while that's
unresolved.
Can't you just...
Something behind him catches her eye.
She trails off.
CLAIRE
Wow...
Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.
NORMAN
Claire, please...
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
People step out of
the way.
PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
after.
MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his
old Buick.
CLAIRE
(walking up)
You!
He looks up at her.
CLAIRE
You think you're smart, don't you?
You
think you got away clean.
Well, I know
you killed her.
You drowned her in the
bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
I'm gonna find her, you murdering
sonofabitch.
Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.
Norman arrives
at her side.
MR. FEUR
Who?
CLAIRE
(scoffing)
Give me that shit.
Your wife.
MR. FEUR
I didn't kill my wife.
NORMAN
(to Mr. Feur)
I'm sorry...
CLAIRE
(over Norman)
Then where is she?
He stares at both Spencers for a moment.
Then calls past
them.
MR. FEUR
Honey...
Claire and Norman turn.
A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the
passenger seat.
She turns.
IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS
SEEN.
Claire looks sucker punched.
PORCH - DAY
Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house.
She hears a
knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.
Feur.
The real one.
MRS. FEUR
I wanted to apologize.
CLAIRE
You do?
MRS. FEUR
For scaring you like I did.
When I
thought about what that must have seemed
like that day...
CLAIRE
And then you weren't there.
MRS. FEUR
Right.
I'm sorry.
There's an awkward pause.
CLAIRE
Would you like some iced tea?
MRS. FEUR
Very much.
Claire leads her toward the house.
PORCH - DAY
Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.
MRS. FEUR
Your house is so beautiful.
CLAIRE
Thank you.
MRS. FEUR
And these roses.
They're much prettier
up close.
She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.
She seems skittish and
shy.
CLAIRE
I...there's something I have to ask
you.
Mrs. Feur waits.
CLAIRE
That day...at the fence.
You seemed
terrified.
I don't think I was imagining
that.
There's a pause.
Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap.
MRS. FEUR
No.
CLAIRE
Of what?
What were you so afraid of?
MRS. FEUR
You're going to think I'm crazy or
something.
A tiny smile.
CLAIRE
Not this week.
She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire.
MRS. FEUR
Love.
CLAIRE
What?
MRS. FEUR
Have you ever felt so completely consumed
by a feeling for someone that you
couldn't breathe?
That the time together
is so passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they would leave?
CLAIRE
Um...sure.
MRS. FEUR
I couldn't catch my breath.
That's not a
metaphor, that's...And I panicked.
I
never dreamed anyone would hear me back
there...
(beat)
I tried to leave him.
Went to my mother's
in Boston.
He brought my things up and
pleaded with me to come home.
Claire is mesmerized.
MRS. FEUR
You must think I'm pathetic.
CLAIRE
No.
No, I don't.
MRS. FEUR
I'm sorry that I frightened you like
that.
But I was so touched by your
concern.
I've been lonely here.
(beat)
Perhaps we could be friends.
Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.
CLAIRE
I would like that.
Mrs. Feur smiles at her.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
lives in motion.
CBGB'S - NIGHT
The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.
A
couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the Bowery late at night.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mom?
She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.
There's an awkward pause.
CLAIRE
That was very good.
CAITLIN
Mom, I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.
But it never felt right.
CLAIRE
Why?
Caitlin stares at the ground.
CAITLIN
I didn't want to bring up memories.
I
didn't want to do anything that might
make you regret your choices.
Claire winces silently.
CAITLIN
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
CLAIRE
No, he wouldn't.
CAITLIN
I think playing in a band called "Bitch"
might put a dent in the whole "perfect
family" thing.
CLAIRE
That's not true.
CAITLIN
Yes it is.
Can we please not do that?
Please?
Cause it is.
Claire doesn't disagree.
CLAIRE
He loves you very much.
He just--
CAITLIN
I know he does.
Beat.
Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.
CAITLIN
Are you mad at me?
CLAIRE
Listen to me.
The one thing in life that
I definitely don't regret...is the choice.
I made to be your mother.
They hug.
For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back.
Her eyes well up.
CLAIRE
I miss you.
CAITLIN
So much.
CLAIRE
(laughing)
It got so bad your father almost had to
put me away.
CAITLIN
What do you mean?
CLAIRE
I started seeing things.
CAITLIN
A ghost?
Beat.
Claire stares at her daughter.
CLAIRE
Did you?
CAITLIN
No.
But once I heard...
CLAIRE
What?
CAITLIN
Someone crying.
A girl.
(beat)
I thought I was crazy.
CLAIRE
(quietly)
Then we both are.
Caitlin nods.
PATIO - NIGHT
Claire stands at a small bar.
CLAIRE
(to bartender)
White wine please.
She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate
conversation with each other.
She's speaking about something
astonishing.
He's rapt.
Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED
ALUMNUS holds forth.
He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry."
He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.
She smiles
and nods.
VOICE (O.S.)
Guess I'm not much of a medium.
She turns to see Jody.
CLAIRE
Jody...
They hug.
JODY
Are you okay?
CLAIRE
I think so
JODY
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus,
Claire...
CLAIRE
It's alright.
JODY
I mess around with this stuff, but I
never thought anything would happen.
Claire looks uncomfortable.
JODY
Does Norman know?
CLAIRE
Jody, she's alive.
JODY
What?
CLAIRE
Mrs. Feur.
She's alive.
I met her.
She's really sweet.
JODY
Then what was it?
CLAIRE
Nothing.
It wasn't anything.
I've been
on edge lately.
Maybe since the accident.
And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
JODY
Something was there.
You saw it.
CLAIRE
Did I?
JODY
Yes.
Now I talked to Sela and there's a
guy, this Pakistani guy down in
Hartford...
CLAIRE
Hartford?
JODY
And he's the real thing.
Specializes in
cases like this, like yours.
CLAIRE
No.
Jody, listen to me.
You have to
listen to me.
This is not something that
I can do right now.
Whatever it was,
it's gone.
I need it to be gone now.
JODY
But Claire--
CLAIRE
Please.
Jody recognizes her fragility.
JODY
Okay.
Okay.
CLAIRE
I've got to find a bathroom.
I'll call
you.
Jody nods as Claire walks off.
TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Claire and Norman walk toward the car.
NORMAN
You don't remember?
CLAIRE
When she said it, there was something
familiar...but no.
He looks at her for a moment.
NORMAN
You dropped a glass.
CLAIRE
I...
NORMAN
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.
You
started crying.
I tried to comfort you...
CLAIRE
(something's triggered)
In the living room...
NORMAN
You shoved me away and ran out to the
patio.
I took you home.
CLAIRE
But why?
I can't understand how I could
just completely--
NORMAN
It was maybe a week after the accident.
We were moving.
It was a hard time.
CLAIRE
But I don't remember.
NORMAN
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
CLAIRE
What's wrong with me?
He stops, takes her shoulders gently.
NORMAN
(reassuring)
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
It's been a
hard year.
But you're better now.
And
things are really looking up for us.
So
let's try to enjoy that.
(gently)
Please?
She thinks for a beat.
CLAIRE
Yes.
Yes.
That's what I want.
She takes his hand and kisses it.
CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY
Claire walks up to the door.
When she touches the knob she
hears...the WHISPERING.
She opens the door and moves into:
MADISON FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a
neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own.
She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch.
PORCH - DAY
Claire rings the bell.
A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early
fifties answers the door.
CLAIRE
Mrs. Frank?
MRS. FRANK
Yeah.
CLAIRE
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
MRS. FRANK
You know where she is?
CLAIRE
No, I don't.
MRS. FRANK
Please leave me alone.
She starts to close the door.
Claire leans forward.
CLAIRE
She's my friend.
The woman stops.
CLAIRE
Was.
We were...acquainted.
I've been
away for awhile.
When I came back...
She studies Claire.
MRS. FRANK
What's your name?
CLAIRE
Claire.
MRS. FRANK
She never mentioned you.
Claire doesn't know what to say to this.
MRS. FRANK
Then again, she didn't say much about her
college friends.
She gives Claire the once over.
MRS. FRANK
I'm watchin' my shows.
She motions Claire in.
PORCH - DAY
Mrs. Frank walks Claire out.
MRS. FRANK
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
CLAIRE
Of course.
Claire walks to her car.
She turns and calls out:
CLAIRE
What was her major?
MRS. FRANK
Biology.
She wanted to be a doctor.
Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs. Frank disappears into the
little house.
JODY'S STUDIO - DAY
An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
oil paintings.
Jody brings Claire some tea.
CLAIRE
...and everything I have, everything I
thought my life was...Christ when I think
of all the lies...
Jody looks down.
CLAIRE
What?
(beat)
Jody what?
Jody looks up, tears in her eyes.
CLAIRE
Oh God...you knew.
JODY
I was down in Adamant...
CLAIRE
Adamant?
JODY
Artsy little village down seven.
There's
a guy there who sells my work.
I had just
dropped off some paintings and as I got
in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this
little cafe.
Claire waits for her to continue.
JODY
I started to walk over...but he wasn't
alone.
A blond.
I only caught a glimpse.
She was young.
(beat)
I should have said something right away.
But I didn't.
CLAIRE
Why?
JODY
Partly because I didn't want to hurt
you...but partly...partly because I was
relieved.
CLAIRE
Relieved?
JODY
I had just been left by Richard.
I was
bitter and miserable and for some fucked
up reason, it made me feel better that
your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Claire nods.
JODY
By the time I finally got up the nerve to
tell you, Stan called from the hospital
and it was too late.
CLAIRE
Too late?
Jody, it was an accident.
JODY
Alone?
On a two lane road?
With a ton of
Valium in your system?
Claire walks over to a window.
JODY
I got there first.
Stan covered up the
pills and I had it out with Norman.
He
seemed desperate not to lose you.
He
promised to handle it.
And we all let it
drop away.
CLAIRE
All of us.
Beat.
JODY
I'm a terrible friend.
CLAIRE
No.
Claire turns.
CLAIRE
How could I expect you to tell me
something that I wouldn't even tell
myself?
JODY
What are you going to do?
CLAIRE
I don't know.
JODY
If she was dangerous before--
CLAIRE
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
JODY
You don't know that.
(beat)
If it's your belief that gives her form,
then you've got to shut her out.
Somehow
you have to break the connection.
CLAIRE
No.
She wanted me to know the truth.
Now
that I do...I think she's at peace.
Jody isn't as sure.
DOCK - DAY
Claire's staring down at the PRINTOUT.
She's kneeling at the
edge of the dock.
From her pocket she produces THE BLOND
BRAID and a piece of TWINE.
She wraps the braid up in the
printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.
CLAIRE
Sorry.
Better or worse, he's mine.
She tosses the little parcel into the dark water.
Bubbles
stream up.
In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE,
which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from
beneath the dark water.
Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.
Madison
reaches up toward the surface.
As the bubble diminish, she
seems to be FADING AWAY.
When she's gone, Claire reaches out
toward the water.
When her finger touches the surface...
WHOOSH!
She's sucked down into the water.
UNDERWATER - DAY
Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her
deeper into the murky depths.
DOCK - DAY
Norman sprints toward the dock.
UNDERWATER - DAY
As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as
her hand plunges into the muddy bottom.
Suddenly, she's released.
She yanks her hand free, the silt
swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud.
NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards.
DOCK - DAY
Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.
They hold each
other.
NORMAN
Are you okay?
She nods, catching her breath.
NORMAN
We have to get out of here.
CLAIRE
It's alright.
NORMAN
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
CLAIRE
She's gone.
NORMAN
What?
CLAIRE
She can't be here without me.
NORMAN
How can you be sure?
CLAIRE
I don't know, but I am.
She was there and
then she was gone.
I felt it.
NORMAN
Claire...
She stares into the still water.
CLAIRE
It's over.
GARDEN - DAY
Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her
rosebushes for the winter.
She picks up a basket of clipped
flowers and heads inside.
PORCH - DAY
She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.
All
is quiet.
SAILBOAT - DUSK
Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.
The leaves
on the surrounding hills are stunning.
Norman appears beside
her.
NORMAN
Last sail of the year.
She gazes out.
CLAIRE
The leaves...
NORMAN
Incredible.
We should take a drive before
they're gone.
Spend the night at some
cozy little bed and breakfast.
CLAIRE
Look for antiques...
NORMAN
Yep.
There's some great places nearby.
CLAIRE
(a reflex)
Adamant.
NORMAN
What?
CLAIRE
Little village down seven.
Supposed to be
charming.
NORMAN
Huh.
CLAIRE
Do you know it?
NORMAN
Don't think so.
CLAIRE
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
He wraps an arm around her.
NORMAN
Whatever you'd like.
She leans against him, staring out.
DRIVEWAY - DAY
Jody and Claire return from a walk.
Norman has the boat on
the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.
They stop under
a tree.
CLAIRE
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
JODY
Did he say that?
CLAIRE
Jody he was lying.
JODY
What if he was?
Do you think he wanted to
bring that up again just when you're
trying to make a new start?
CLAIRE
I guess not.
JODY
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.
You should too.
Norman smiles and waves.
They wave back as they arrive at
the Karman-Ghia.
JODY
You've got a beautiful life.
And even
with this, it's always been clear that he
loves you.
(beat)
I've come to think that's all that really
matters.
CLAIRE
I don't know...
JODY
Trust me, Claire.
You hear something...
change the subject.
You find something...
get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
(beat)
You know what happened.
The rest is only
details.
And no one's ever glad they got
a hold of those.
If you want to put this
back together...just let it go.
Jody drives off.
Claire walks over to Norman.
She hugs him
tightly.
NORMAN
What's that for?
CLAIRE
Nothing.
NORMAN
I'm cooking you dinner.
CLAIRE
You don't have to do that.
NORMAN
I know.
CLAIRE
Fine.
I'll do the shopping.
They kiss.
She heads to the Volvo.
ADAMANT - DAY
Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village.
She
looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.
A
friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.
She watches
Claire gazing around.
HIPPIE WOMAN
What are you looking for?
CLAIRE
I don't really know.
HIPPIE WOMAN
Know what you mean.
She ambles off across the street.
Claire watches her go.
Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.
THREE
INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.
She walks toward it.
SHOP - DAY
Claire stands in front of the store window.
A sign in the
window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought
jewelry and gifts."
Claire tries to open the door, but sees
a closed sign.
She steps back out to the window and looks in.
On display
are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate ROSEBUD.
Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.
Protruding
from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.
Claire looks like
she's been punched.
DOCK - NIGHT
Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
dock.
An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.
She holds out a fist.
Her fingers unfold and in her palm
lies THE KEY.
She holds the key out over the water and
stands there, frozen.
The lighthouse beam sweeps past her
once...then again.
Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
then carefully places it on the dock.
She very deliberately
takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
off the dock.
CUT TO:
DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S
PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in
the bed...nobody there.
DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.
BRIDGE - NIGHT
The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.
BRIDGE - NIGHT
The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the
pickup.
Claire chokes, then blacks out.
BRIDGE - NIGHT
The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling
over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.
The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
through the rear window and into the passenger side
dashboard.
LAKE - DAWN
Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER - DAWN
The sound of a furious cello solo.
COLD STARING EYES
Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating.
Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered
to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle.
Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed
back.
As she twists into view...
MORPHS INTO:
MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace.
Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the
distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach.
CUT TO:
FINGERS
...filled with moist earth.
A hand tosses the clump of dirt
onto...
CEMETERY - DAY
A CASKET
Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
the grave.
A tiny arm snakes around her waist.
She glances
down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
tightly.
Claire takes a last look into the grave.
CLAIRE
Rest in peace.
THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK
Mother and daughter turn and step back.
Next to them, also
in black, is MRS. FRANK.
CUT TO:
FINGERS
Racing across the neck of a cello.
The solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
before.
WIDEN TO REVEAL
