      --young BILL HASKELL, 10. Middle class house. Standing before 
      a mirror in his bedroom, clad in Sunday s finest. He s 
      looking uncomfortably at himself as he holds a tie before his 
      throat. You get the impression the child s never even seen a 
      tie before. 

      Chyron:  Windham County, Vermont, 1887. 

      Camera drifts over, reveals through the window, coming up the 
      driveway, a HORSE & CARRIAGE. Something unsettling about that 
      to young Bill...


      His father, BENJAMIN HASKELL, on the first floor, has an 
      entirely different response. He straightens his own tie, eyes 
      the coming buggy, calls anxiously to his WIFE:

                                  BENJAMIN HASKELL
                    Look prim, Elizabeth. Is our boy 
                    ready? First impressions are 
                      everything. Everything dominoes 
                    from that first impression. I want 
                    him in a tie if he's not already--
                          (calling upstairs)
                    William!

      ANGLE. WILLIAM. In his room. This all too much, too 
        officious...

      ANGLE. FATHER. Surveying the glimmering appointments of the 
      buggy through the window:

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Good God, look at that buggy. What 
                    do you think something like that 
                    costs?                                                                                   2.


      ANGLE. BILL S MOTHER--ELIZABETH--ascending the stairs, 
      calling out to Bill--

                                  ELIZABETH HASKELL
                    William, Mr. Chandler's here--

      Following her as she steps into Bill s room. It s empty.

                                  ELIZABETH HASKELL (CONT D)
                    William?

      Her eyes falls across the window. It s open...


      Quick hits: tracking from other students reading math texts, 
      business texts....to a COLLEGIATE BILL flipping through 
       travel lit , 1890 s-style--Bret Harte s accounts of the 
      California Gold Rush, W.L. Stevenson s south seas stories--

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    They prepared me, all right. For 10 
                    years, I read every book under the 
                    sky. 


      A banner fills frame: CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 1897! Camera 
      booms from this down to a coat-and-tie affair. A bit stiff, 
      if we may call a spade a spade. It s  May 1, 1897.  

      We find Bill here, newly graduated, being introduced to 
      various movers-and-shakers by an enthusiastic COLLEAGUE. 

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Captains of industry everywhere you 
                    look. Guy over there s in the 
                    horseless carriage game. Guy over 
                    there: telephones. Supposedly he s 
                    figured out how to lower rates so 
                    the common man can afford it. And 
                    if the common man can afford 
                      it...sky s the limit. Those are the 
                    games we wanna be in.                                                                                   6.


      While all of this is going on, we are with Bill: amicable, if 
      uncomfortable. These people: the 1%. Not, at the end of the 
      day, his people. Colleague, noticing:

                                  COLLEAGUE (CONT'D)
                    I m not detecting ambivalence am I?

        Misinterpreting Bill s silence:

                                  COLLEAGUE (CONT D)
                    God, of all people, you shouldn t 
                    be nervous. Your dad s been pulling 
                    strings with all of these people. 
                    Candidly, I m a bit jealous...

      Bill s demeanor changes when he does spot one of his people. 
      Arguing with the Concierge at the door. 

      A scruffy guy with a poor suit. Epstein.

                                  BILL
                    Excuse me. 

      Before Colleague can respond, Bill excuses himself, pardons 
      his way through the crowd to Epstein & the Concierge.

                                  BILL (TO CONCIERGE, REASSURING) 
                                  (CONT D)
                    It s okay. He s with me. 

      Concierge relents. Bill and Epstein step inside the party. 
      Epstein s got a shit-eating grin. Bill, pleased as hell to 
      see him:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    See you wore your finest.
                          (re Epstein s natty wool 
                            suit)
                    Are there actually moths in there?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    This coming from a guy who looks 
                    like a constipated penguin.

      They embrace with a sincere pat on the back.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                      Congratulations, brother.

      They separate. Colleague has appeared.

                                  BILL
                    Richard. Meet Byron Epstein.

      Colleague nods affably, but you can tell the man s a bit 
      confused about Epstein s low-brow presence here. 

                                  COLLEAGUE (TO BILL)
                    Come over. I want you to meet the 
                    telephone guys.                                                                                   7.


      Bill meets eyes with Epstein. A knowing look there.

                                  BILL
                    Actually, we ve got a train to 
                    catch. 

      A waiter passes. Epstein procures two glasses of champagne. 
      As he hands one to Bill:

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Where re you headed?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    West.

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    West? Why west?

                                  BILL (WRY)
                    Because that s where every young 
                    man goes...

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Yeah, but what s out there?

                                  BILL (SUBTLE GLEE) 
                    I don t know. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And that, my friend...
                          (swallows champagne)
                    ...is exactly the point. 

      As Bill and Epstein clink glasses--CUT TO--


      Various shots of Bill & Epstein, young men emancipated upon 
      the land:                                                                                  9.


      " Hanging heads out the window, shouting exultantly out at 
      the passing America landscape. 

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    Epstein wanted to prove he was the 
                    dog with the runny nose, the poor 
                    man that society couldn't keep 
                    down. And to him, even though I was 
                    his best friend...I was society.

      Camera drifts back to Bill in the window behind him--

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    Thing he didn t get was that was 
                    the last thing I wanted to be. All 
                    I wanted was to get away and find 
                    my own thing. Something that was 
                    real, bare-boned...

      CUT TO--BILL & EPSTEIN--in the back of the dining car, 
      tossing dice and drinks with negro porters and cooks. 

                                  BILL
                    A place to set up shop...and carve 
                    out my future with my own two 
                    hands.


      CASH--being tossed into a hat. Widen. Bill & Epstein--forming 
      a  kitty  for their coming endeavor.

                                  BILL
                    That s all of it. 350. Every cent I 
                    got for graduation.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONSIDERING CASH)
                          (mild disappointment)
                    Huh. 

                                  BILL
                    Huh what?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thought it d be more, that s all. 

                                  BILL
                    Don t look a gift horse in the 
                    mouth, brother. I m putting all 
                    that into the kitty.

      It s then that Epstein unfurls his own wad of cash and tosses 
      it into the kitty.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Just...I got, what, 400 here. 
                    Thought it d be me that d be the 
                    one light on the contribution.

                                  BILL (INCREDULOUS) 
                    What, you rob someone?                                                                                10.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    Funny. That there is legally 
                    acquired tender, brother. Which I 
                    prefer to call capital investment, 
                    if we re going to be business men 
                    about things. 

                                  BILL (COUNTING) 
                    So we re looking at...750.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Ain't much of a nest-egg, but it's 
                      something.

                                  BILL (NODS)
                    Who we kidding. It's nothing. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Makes the story all the more 
                    beautiful though, doesn't it? When 
                    we're millionaires...we can say we 
                    started with nothing. 

      Bill nods. Liking that.

                                  BILL
                    Here's to nothing, brother.

      Epstein smiles. Nods. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    To nothing. 

      Off their smiles, CUT TO--


       Colorado Springs, Colorado. May 7, 1897.  Bill & Epstein 
      idle over beers, the latter reading classified ads in a 
      paper.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thought the west was supposed to be 
                    about opportunity. Ain t seeing 
                    Jack for opportunity. It s all 
                    menial stuff.                                                                                 11.


                                  BILL
                    Don t mind menial. If that s where 
                    we gotta start and work our way 
                    up... 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Always amuses me how the rich man 
                      romanticizes the menial life. 
                    Thinks it s closer to the earth. 
                    Like it ll deliver him. 

                                  BILL
                    I am nowhere near rich. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    All I m saying is, I ve lived the 
                    menial life, brother. Ain t nothin  
                    romantic about it. 

                                  BILL (RE NEWSPAPER) 
                    How  bout you stop sermonizing and 
                    start telling me what you re seeing 
                    in there.

                                    EPSTEIN (READING) 
                    Let s see...they re looking for 
                    cowherds.

                                  BILL
                    Don't know about the first thing 
                    about animals.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Railroad men.

                                  BILL
                    Coulda done it back home.

      Epstein orders 2 more beers, returns to the classified. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    We could be soldiers, go to the 
                      Philippines...

                                  BILL
                    Got no interest in dying anytime 
                    soon.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Not for a dollar a day.

      The new beers come. Bill moves to pay for them. 

                                  BILL
                    What do I owe you?

      Bartender nods up the bar. 

                                  BARTENDER
                    Our man down there s fronting 
                    drinks til closing time.                                                                                 12.


      And it's here we meet a crucial figure in our story. A man 
      the end of the bar: The One Who Kept Going. An impossibly 
      weathered veteran of the gold fields. Call him BECKETT. 

      Bill & Epstein cross to him. 

                                  BILL
                    Wanted to thank you for your 
                      generosity.

                                    BECKETT
                    It's only generous if it hurts. And 
                    buying drinks...ain't no pain in 
                    that for me ever again. Sorta 
                    beyond that phase, if you get me.

                                  BILL
                    Thanks all the same.

                                    BECKETT
                    Telling you, thanking a rich man 
                    for a nickel's like thanking the 
                    sky for air. Drink up. Take a 
                    coupla bottles with you.

      Bill and Epstein meet eyes. The man s clothes bespeak a hard 
      life. The only thing currently with him is a rusting coffee 
      tin on the bar before him. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Mind us asking what sorta business 
                    you're in--?

      In answer, Beckett produces a gold nugget, drops it on the 
      counter before them. 

      This is a big moment. The first time we see gold in the 
      series. And goddamn if it isn t beautiful.

      The size of a man s thumb. Radiant with a deep luster native 
      only in the purest of gold.

      Bill s putting two and two together in his head. Ah...

                                  BILL
                    Colorado. That s right. They been 
                    saying in the papers for a while 
                    now miners ve been pulling all 
                    sorts of gold out of the ground... 

                                    BECKETT (KNOWING SMILE) 
                    If it s in the newspaper, it s 
                    over. 
                          (beat)
                      Colorado s panned out. Has been for 
                    a long time. Just like Black Hills 
                    and California before that.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Then where were you?                                                                                13.


                                    BECKETT
                    Just like anything else, if you 
                    really wanna be the trailblazer, 
                    you go as far as everyone else 
                      does...then you keep going. 

                                  BILL
                    And that gets you where exactly?

      Beckett mulls, finally nods.

                                    BECKETT
                    The Yukon.
                          (beat)
                    Placer fields have been locked 
                    beneath permafrost for thousands of 
                    years. Only now are people starting 
                    to realize what s down there.  

      He finishes his beer. Nods knowingly.  

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    But...you gotta get there before 
                    the newspaper does. 

      He hefts his coffee tin, moves to leave. 

      Epstein & Bill quickly realize the man s left that beautiful 
      nugget on the counter.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Forgot something, boss.

      Beckett looks back. Shakes his head with a subtle smile. 

                                    BECKETT
                    No. I didn t.

      He lifts the lid off the coffee tin. Revealing within, 
      crammed all the way to the top, more gold nuggets. Bigger and 
      more beautiful than the first one. A knowing smile from him. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Keep it.

      Then he s gone.


      Reveal BELINDA MULRONEY, 30. Stolid. Prepossessing. Watching 
      their arrival with silent consideration. With eyes that 
      overlook nothing--or anyone--that comes to Dawson...


      Epstein & Bill enter. Approach the CLERK.                                                                                39.


                                    EPSTEIN (GOOD MOOD) 
                    Room and a bath.

      An uncomfortable beat as the CLERK surveys Epstein.

                                  CLERK
                    No Jewboys.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What?

                                  CLERK
                    You want a room, go tent up with 
                    the niggers outside of town. 

      Epstein & Bill look at him incredulously. He s a big nasty 
      bastard. A hardened Yukon vet. He turns away from them to 
      other business, as if they don t exist. 

                                  CLERK (CONT D)
                    Go on now. Get out of here. 

      Epstein, incensed, produces a fisftul of cash. Insistent: 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    My friend wants a bath. 
                          (beat)
                    He s a god-fearing 
                      Catholic...pretty sure he won t 
                    sully your water.

      Bill gives him a look--don t be a spendthrift--

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Not a word, squeaky pockets. 

      The clerk begrudgingly takes the cash. Epstein grits his 
      teeth, looks to Bill. 

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    I ll be in the saloon. 

      He exits. Bill looks back to the Clerk. No love lost there. 
      His eyes say: Jew-lover. But his hand begrudgingly slips Bill 
      a set of keys.


      ON BILL--standing unmoving in his room. Simultaneously miffed 
      by the Clerk and in a state of disbelief over the amenities 
      he stands amidst. 

      A TLINGIT WOMAN, slave-like, finishes filling the bath with 
      buckets of heated water. Departs. 

      Bill slowly unpeels the wet clothes he s worn for 6 straight 
      days. Slips into the water. To say it s exquisite is an 
        understatement. It s tremulous, skin-prickling as his flesh 
      hits the water...                                                                                40.



      Epstein enters. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What s it take for a loan?

      The PROPRIETOR eyes him. Coolly, simply:

                                  PROPRIETOR
                      Collateral.

      Off Epstein--CUT TO--


      A veritable zoo in here. Gambling. Drinking. Whores. 
      Burlesque show. Epstein pulls Bill through the crowd. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    I have never been to Paris, but 
                    this has gotta out-Paris Paris...

                                  BILL
                    Hey, about that guy back there--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What? You think I m gonna let some 
                      anti-Semite piss on this parade--?

      He stops, finding the guy he was looking for--an excitable, 
      impressionable 19-year-old--JACK LONDON--

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Hey Bill, I want you to meet my new 
                    buddy--
                            (forgetting)
                    W...what was your name again?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Jack London.                                                                                41.


      Bill & Epstein share a look. Kid s apparently dead serious 
      about  branding  himself.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    By the looks of you, I wouldn t peg 
                    you as the formal type. How  bout 
                    tossing in your middle name while 
                    you re at it?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Jack, you won t remember. London, 
                    on the other hand, that s 
                      indelible. 
                          (drinks)
                    Fair number of men ll come out of 
                    here rich, but only a handful will 
                    be remembered.

      A good-natured chuckle from Epstein.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Right on, you nut.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Give it a chuckle if you want, but 
                    you are looking at a walking, 
                    talking novel here. 
                          (re environs)
                    A shelf full of novels. Penwright 
                    there: dumber n a crate of turnips. 
                    Goes on a drunken bender upriver at 
                    40 Mile, sobers up a week later and 
                    he s stakeholder to the hottest 
                    claim on El Dorado Creek. No clue 
                    how he got it. But he s sitting on 
                    a half million in nuggets and it 
                    hasn t even been a month yet. 

                                  BILL
                    El Dorado Creek. That s the place 
                    then.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Sure. Only if you don t wanna get 
                    rich. El Dorado s already panned 
                    out. 

                                  BILL
                    Already panned out--

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Staked anyhow. So unless you re 
                    gonna jump someone, I wouldn t put 
                    any mud on your boots heading up 
                    that way.

      London: fully immersed in all that he says. He s a junkie for 
      the hardscrabble Yukon life. A prodigious drinker, too, 
      though at 19, it s yet to show a downside. Instead only fuels 
      his excitement. Epstein, meanwhile, can only be interested so 
      long, and gets distracted by a courtesan across the way.                                                                                 42.


                                    EPSTEIN (RE COURTESAN)
                    She s giving me the love-eye. I m 
                    telling you. That right there is 
                    the love-eye.

      London nods in another direction--to an elegant-looking 40-
      year-old GERMAN man with a retinue around him.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Take the Count over there: German 
                    nobility. Got all the equipment, 
                    the men...and they ve been pulling 
                    nothing but mud for almost 6 
                    months. Not a spot of color. Just 
                    goes to show...Yukon s the only 
                    place in the world where a dumbshit 
                    can be a king and a king can be a 
                    dumbshit.  

      He decides he likes that last line. Scribble it on the back 
      of a scrip of paper. 

                                  BILL
                    So if it s not El Dorado Creek, 
                    where is it?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Bonanza.

                                  BILL
                    Where s that?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Oh, Bonanza s easy: just go looking 
                    for the cloud of smoke...

      He pauses as a FRIEND comes over, whispers something to him. 

                                  JACK LONDON (CONT D)
                    No...

      Friend gives him an enthusiastic, silent nod. Yes...

      London stands. To Bill & Epstein--

                                  JACK LONDON (CONT D)
                    C mon.
                          (off their looks)
                      Swiftwater Bill is here.

                                    EPSTEIN
                      Swiftwater who?

                                  JACK LONDON
                      Swiftwater Bill. Richest prospector 
                    in all of north America. Maybe the 
                    world. Spends it faster than he 
                    makes it. And they re telling me 
                    he s got a girl upstairs.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    There s girls down here.                                                                                43.


      London swallows the rest of his drink. Grin.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Not in a tub of champagne there s 
                    not.


      FOLLOWING LONDON, BILL, EPSTEIN as they crest the steps--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And what do you mean a  girl , by 
                    the way?

                                  JACK LONDON
                      A courtesan. A whore. A hooker. One 
                    that hooks--

      Ahead: men clamor, trying to get into a room, get a view of 
      the spectacle.

      London pushes past with Bill & Epstein in tow.

      Buoyant music cranks from a phonograph. People are dancing, 
      drinking, laughing. Very much the penthouse crowd, Dawson-
      style. SWIFTWATER BILL, 50s, holds court. He s a rugged, low 
      IQ, high-enthusiasm, high-net worth Zorba of the North. He s 
      passing around champagne:

                                  SWIFTWATER BILL
                    Drink up. Drink up before the 
                    bubbles escape!

      He pours for everyone--even Bill, who accepts it with ready 
        enthusiasm--

      Bill pauses, seeing Swiftwater s next stop. The girl in the 
      bathtub who becomes visible as the crowd shifts.    

      Swiftwater Bill pours her a drink. Bill beholds, for a moment 
      caught up in the strange burlesque elegance of it. 

      Seen from behind, she s a dorsalist s dream, the way the 
      champagne and water hang on her bare back. A courtesan 
      evidently, she seems perfectly comfortable nude amidst the 
      drunken masculinity around her. Her carriage: confident...

      Then she turns. And meets eyes with Bill.  

      Bill dies a bit.

      It s Sabine. 


      Bill, crestfallen, descends the stairs with Epstein in tow. 
      Epstein, though, doesn t have intentions of hanging around. 
      His eyes fall across his earlier COURTESAN. She of the love-
      eye. He claps Bill on the shoulder.                                                                                44.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    Think I m gonna go do some 
                      prospecting.

      He peels off. Bill returns to the bar. Orders a drink from 
      the bartender (later, JOE MEEKOR). Beside him:

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (O.S.) 
                    Dawson City. Where naivete comes to 
                    die. 

      Bill looks up to see Belinda there. Imposing despite her 
      stature. It s the confidence. The gun strapped to her leg. 
      She swallows a mouthful of booze, eyes the place. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Everybody comes a saint, and leaves 
                    as something less than that. 
                          (off Bill s silence)
                    Give him another, Joe. Man s 
                    tongue s still too tight.

      Meekor serves up Bill a drink. Bill nods politely.

                                  BILL
                    Thank you, ma am--

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Don t  ma am  me. I m still south 
                    of 30. Despite what these northern 
                    climes have done to my otherwise 
                    youthful, pearly skin.

                                  BILL
                    Thanks all the same.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Belinda Mulroney.

                                  BILL
                    Bill Haskell.

      They shake hands. She eyes him. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    You labor or management, Haskell?

                                  BILL
                    How s that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Only two types come up here: the 
                    guy with the shovel and the guy 
                    with the business plan. Shovel 
                    guys, they re welcome. One thing 
                    Yukon s not short on is dirt to dig 
                    in. Boys wanna be boys and play in 
                    the big old sandbox, that s up to 
                    you. Guy with the business plan, on 
                    the other hand...Dawson s full-up. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                45.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT'D)
                    We got more middle-men and business-
                    men and hucksters than we know what 
                    to do with. Blight on the 
                      landscape, if I can be perfectly 
                    honest. 

                                  BILL
                    Nope. Shovel guy. Looking to get 
                    into the sandbox. And pull out a 
                    future. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    You keep believing that, and you 
                    and me are gonna be just fine.

                                  BILL
                    How s that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                     Tween the two of us--and not to 
                    rain on your parade in advance--
                    there s no money in gold.

      She nods to the revelry around her.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Soak it up, Haskell. How much of 
                    that gold being pulled up out of 
                    those hills is ending up in their 
                    pockets? 

      She motions vaguely to the elegant BURLESQUE DANCER on stage. 
      Exquisitely lit. Spellbinding.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Gold s a whore, Haskell. Just like 
                    her up there. More beautiful than 
                    the rest. Can t take your eyes off 
                    her. But she gets passed around. 
                    And that s the thing about whores: 
                    you may lust after them--you may 
                    even think you love them--but you 
                    don t need them.

      Said as she draws a toothpick from her mouth. Considers it.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    This, on the other hand...you need. 

      Bill looks to her curiously. The way she holds that tiny, 2  
      span of wood.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    And when you need something up 
                    here, there s nothing you won t do 
                    to get it. No price you won t pay.

      She turns it in her fingers slightly so the wood s fibers 
      buckle slightly. In XCU we see wood like we have not before. 
      Like the gold and courtesan before, sumptuous, elemental...                                                                                46.


                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    To build a fire so you can survive 
                    the winter. To build these precious 
                      buildings. To melt the permafrost 
                    so you can get to your gold in the 
                    first place.

      She looks to Bill.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Without wood, there s no Dawson 
                    City. And if there s no Dawson 
                    City, there s none of you boys 
                    foraging out there in the dirt for 
                    your future.

                                  BILL
                    And you re telling me this why?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    I own the mill, Haskell. Everything 
                    in Dawson comes through me. 

      Bill smiles inwardly. Of course.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    You stay out of the wood business, 
                    I ll stay out of your sandbox, 
                    how s that strike you?

      She smiles at him when she says this. But the implicit threat 
      is clear. Bill isn t cowed. He returns the smile.

                                  BILL
                    Strikes me fine.

      Belinda nods to herself like she s gotten what she wanted. 
      She nods to Meekor for 2 more drinks.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Then you and me, Haskell...we might 
                    be copacetic yet.

      As they drink--CUT TO--


        Bill--finishing his drink--Belinda, wrapping up too--

                                  BILL
                    Say I wanna stake up on Bonanza. 
                    How do I go about doing that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Like anything else up here. You 
                    just go up and do it. Then come 
                    back, drop a few bucks at the 
                      Recorder's office, and you're 
                    official. 
                          (beat)
                    Word of warning, though. There s no 
                    law up there, Haskell. And you 
                    leave a bunch of men alone to their 
                    own devices, and there s money 
                    involved, suddenly they aren t men 
                    anymore. 

                                  BILL
                    You get a gun, you only end up 
                    using it.

      Belinda moves as if to respond--but they re interrupted by--

      --a gunshot--somewhere in back.

      Everyone looks up. 

      A moment later,  Epstein runs out, pulling his pants up. As 
      he nears Bill, excitedly: 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Think I jumped someone s claim!                                                                                48.


      Belinda eyes him, darkening. To Bill: 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Best get him out of here. 


      LAUGHTER and LOUD TALK dims as ...

      ... a Bill enters, walks up to THE BARTENDER.

                                  BILL
                          (quiet)
                    Where can I find the law?

      THE BARTENDER--skinny, sweaty, drunk--heads toward him from 
      behind the bar. 

                                  BARTENDER
                    Ain t no law around here. 

      Voice of a patron,  You re IN the Town Hall.  

      The bartender notes Bill s bulky cart through the window. 
      Doffs his dirty woolen hat in deference. 

                                  BARTENDER (CONT D)
                    Mortuary ain t open yet. Animals 
                    gonna get him, you leave him 
                    outside.

                                  BILL
                          (intently)
                    He doesn t need a mortuary. I 
                    intend to take him home. 

                                  PATRON
                    Don t look like he s got a lotta 
                    walking in him.

      Bill turns... Stares with searing eyes at the patron who made 
      a joke about his dead friend. 

                                  BILL
                    You make jokes about funny things.

                                  PATRON
                    You re supposed to make jokes about 
                    funny things.                                                                                      3.


      Man s amped up on booze. A kid nearly, but grown big and 
      strong. Rises from his stool. Legs shifting, everything about 
      him shifting.

      Just Itching for a fight.

      A hand grabs Bill s shoulder. It s Soapy.

                                  SOAPY
                    Hey, hey... Don t let him in, don t 
                    let him in. Your brains ll be 
                    mixing in with the sawdust.

      Bill allows himself to be pulled toward a stool a bit further 
      down the bar.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                          (to bartender)
                    Give my friend a drink.

      The bartender pours. Soapy pushes away the glass.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Not that cedar bark shite. The good 
                    stuff. Only the good stuff for my 
                    friend.

      Turns ingratiatingly to Bill.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    You pay me back later, huh?

      A drink is put before Bill, He gulps it down. It lightens him 
      a bit. 

      He turns to the window. Outside, a few stragglers pass on the 
      packed clay street. Across the street, stand a row of 
      stores... all shut down.

                                  BILL
                    Why s all the stores closed up?

      Soapy stares at Bill. Does he really not know?

                                  SOAPY
                    Because it s midnight.

      Bill s fatigued eyes wince in the sunlight coming through the 
      window. A world where even the sun s upside down.

                                  BILL
                          (some urgency now)
                    When s the next boat out of here?                                                                                      4.


                                  SOAPY
                    I ll answer you straight. I see 
                    you re an honest man and your query 
                    deserves an honest answer. Boat 
                    comes in two days...

      Soapy makes his face go sad in an almost Kabuki way.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                     ... but your friend won t be on 
                    it. 

      Referring to the cargo just outside the bar. A tremble of 
      anger goes down Bill s spine.

                                  BILL
                    Why s that, grifter?

                                  SOAPY
                          (to bartender)
                    Give my friend another drink.

      Bill pushes away his glass. Doesn t want another drink.

                                  BILL
                         (anger beginning to boil)
                    Why won t he be on the boat?

      Soapy can t contain his giddiness any longer.

                                  SOAPY
                    Because he s DAY--ED!

      Soapy CACKLES with laughter. A few other patrons join in. 
      Bill whips around him. 

      Bill only now takes in his surroundings. Patrons all staring 
      at him. A dream-like hostility palpable in the dusky light 
      from kerosene lanterns.

      Bill is definitely the outsider here.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Death brings death. I for one try 
                    to stay away from it lest I catch 
                    what it s got. Boat captains think 
                    like I do. All of us here and I m 
                    including you in my arithmetric, we 
                    don t leave when we re healthy?

      He pauses for dramatic emphasis... then speaks ominously.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    We gonna be buried here. That s a 
                    fact. You look hearty now, but no 
                    one can speak to the future.                                                                                      5.


      A threat there. Soapy stares at Bill with what he thinks is a 
      wise expression.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    The future s wanton.

                                  BILL
                    You take the scenic route, get

                    hear your pitch, grifter.

                    I got the gift of gab. A curse and 
                      a blessing. Here s how it is.

      A different look in Soapy s eyes now. Business excites him. 
      He lives for it.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Just because your partner s gonna 
                    be buried in this hard, cold clay, 
                    don t mean a man such as you, with 
                    other options, got to. 

                                  BILL
                    What other options?

      Soapy s eyes are afire with the sexiness of this 
      opportunity... for him.

                                  SOAPY
                    Your claim.

      Bill glances around him. Everyone seems to be listening to 
      the conversation. Awaiting his response

                                  BILL
                    It ain t even been dug on. Might 
                    yield nothing.

                                  SOAPY
                    You used a great word there. Might. 
                    Might be something. Might be 
                    nothing. That s the beauty of a 
                    claim such as yours, staked up in 
                    the hill, the only one so far. It 
                    could be anything.

      Soapy s eyes are searing. He may not be the brightest guy in 
      the world, but he has an uncanny understanding of what we 
      call the bottom line.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    What you got to understand is, the 
                    folks around here are hungry for 
                    gold. They ve travelled a thousand 
                    miles for it. Nearly died for it.

SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Images of gold pass before their 
                    eyes before they sleep.

      Soapy lowers his voice so he will not be heard by the patrons 
      around him, all straining to hear their tete e tete. 

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    A great deal of money will be 
                    invested in ignorance when the need 
                    for delusion is deep. And what you 
                    got in your claim is a beautiful 
                    delusion. Right now, it s un-
                    examined. As you say, un-dug... 

      Bill is staring hard at Soapy. This has been a revelatory 
      conversation.

                                  BILL
                    And you want to be the middle man 
                    for my delusion? Sell it when it s 
                    hot.

                                  SOAPY
                    My proposition is this, and the 
                    deal is over the moment your spade 
                    touches soil. I will pay you one 
                    hundred dollars for your claim AND 
                    I will pay your boat fare out of 
                    Dawson. In legal tender, or gold. 
                    Your choice. Maybe you want gold. 
                    Tell the folks back home, you dug 
                    it out yourself. Be a bit of a 
                    hero.

      There may have been a whiff of temptation to the offer... but 
      Soapy s last statement is beyond offensive to him.

                                  BILL
                    Listen to me and tell this to 
                    anyone wants to know my intentions. 

      Soapy had been talking in a whisper, but Bill makes his voice 
      loud enough for all to hear.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                          (eyes searing)
                    I m not leaving Dawson until my 
                    friend gets justice.

                                  PATRON
                    Jew already got his justice.

      This from the patron who tried to pick a fight with Bill 
      earlier. He s been waiting for this moment.

      Bill has reached what he thinks is the end of his rope 
      (actually it s a long, long rope).                                                                                      7.


      The pugnacious patron grins a grinny grin grin. Which 
      evaporates as Bill tackles him.

      THE TWO MEN

      CRASH over a table, splintering it. Bill s opponent lashes 
      out at Bill with a broken beer mug... It hits the side of his 
      forehead.

      The patron has the upper hand. Punches Bill hard in the face, 
      grinning. He loves this shit. But Bill scissors his legs 
      around the patron s legs, flipping him. 

      BILL S OPPONENT

      is under Bill now. But in the tumult, he s pulled a knife. 
      The knife is at Bill s throat. Bill holds the blade back with 
      his left hand. 

      BLOOD

      seeps out onto the blade as it cuts through the flesh of 
      Bill s palm. Excruciating to watch. In seconds the knife will 
      cut through his hand.

      Bill elbows the patron in his face with his free arm... and 
      the knife drops. Bill punches his opponent in the face so 
      hard, the man nearly passes out.

      Bill rises, kicks the knife across the sawdust-spattered 
      floor. 

      Bill s hand is bloody. So is his forehead. He glares at the 
      patrons, all gathered around watching. Bill looks half 
      crazed. 

                                  BILL
                          (growls it out)
                    You re not getting rid of me that 
                    easily. You re not getting rid of 
                    me.

      But the patrons are no longer staring at Bill. They are 
      staring past him... at a commotion out the window. Bill whips 
      around.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW

      we see A SMALL CROWD surrounding Epstein s body. Vultures 
      over carrion.


      Bill frantically whips through the tent, checking every 
      possible hiding place. Shakes out the sleep wear. Empties the 
      packs. Rushes outside.


      Bill enters and pauses. The room is grandly feminine, with 
      hand-carved curlicues in the wainscotting and mother-of-pearl 
        chandeliers. A FANTASY of heaven in the third circle of hell.                                                                                     18.


      Bill stands in the center of this femininity--a rain-soaked 
      man in muddy boots.

      Belinda emerges from another chamber.

                                    BELINDA
                    Sorry to keep you waiting. I was 
                    making myself fragrant. 

      She is spectacular. Her dress looks like it was made out of 
      gold hammered so thin it could shimmer in a breeze. 

      She looks like the Goddess of Gold.

      Bill came here pissed as hell. He has to fight to hold onto 
      his drive.

                                  BILL
                    I like to know when I m getting a 
                    new friend. I m too old to have 
                    someone dropped off at my house to 
                    play with.

                                    BELINDA
                    So you met Meekor. 

      She drapes herself on the couch near him.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    Don t be petulant. I own half of 
                    your claim. I need to protect my 
                      investment.
                          (beat)
                    Meekor was an inevitability. Why 
                    warn someone about an 
                      inevitability? 

                                  BILL
                    Is that what you are? An 
                      inevitability? Who lives, who dies. 
                    You decide with a fetching wave of 
                    your hand.

                                    BELINDA
                    Are you accusing me of something?

      A slight break in her voice. He stares at her. Her green-blue 
      eyes show just a hint of hurt. 

      Still staring at her, he shakes his head. 

                                  BILL
                    No.

      Belinda folds her feelings back into herself.                                                                                    19.


                                    BELINDA
                    Gold is a fool s errand, honey. I 
                    wouldn t kill for it. 

      Her manner is casual, but not her eyes.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    I m building Xanadu.
                          (off his look)
                    I thought you were an educated man.
                          (quotes)
                     In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan, a 
                    stately pleasure dome decree.  Gold 
                    has brought people to this 
                      uncivilized wilderness but it s 
                      civilization gonna make  em stay. 
                          (off Bill s look)
                    And, no, I m not building an ice 
                    palace in Dawson. I m building a 
                    hotel. The largest, grandest hotel 
                    in America. Baccarat crystal, 
                    velvet couches. It s all been 
                    ordered. While you dream of gold, I 
                    use gold to make dreams.

      She heads to her marble-topped desk. Opens the lid of a blue 
      cloisonne jewel box. Inside are stacks of (gold backed) 
      hundred dollar bills. Holds up a wad of bills.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    Know why these are better than 
                    gold?

      No Bill doesn t know.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    Easier to count.

      She leans against her desk, staring at Bill.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    You should take Sope s offer. Sell 
                    your mud hole and head back to 
                    Maine.

                                  BILL
                    Vermont. 

                                    BELINDA
                    It doesn t matter. Both are away 
                    from here.

      She stares emotionally at him.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    You don t belong here.                                                                                    20.


                                  BILL
                    I don t think so. 

      Belinda simmers... fetchingly. 

                                    BELINDA
                    What s your game? Justice? 
                      Vengeance? 
                          (quietly strong)
                    Men always have a mission. Make up 
                    for the fact they can t give birth. 
                    Women are born with a mission. Men 
                    gotta make them up. Do you write to 
                    your mother?

      She puts herself between him and the doorway, knowing he 
      won t just push her away. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    World is divided between men who 
                    write their mothers and men who 
                    don t. 

                                  BILL
                    Do you write to yours? 

                                    BELINDA
                    I killed my ma.
                          (beat)
                    She died as I exited her womb. Left 
                    me to the vagaries of the world. 

      Bill gently lifts her up and places her out of his way. He 
      heads toward the door. Stops... amused by something.

                                  BILL
                    Your mother birthed you... and 
                    you re birthing a hotel. I think 
                    your mother has the edge.

                                    BELINDA
                    It s not a competition.
                          (hits her)
                    Was that a compliment?

                                  BILL
                    You ll know when I m making a 
                      compliment.

                                    BELINDA
                          (beat)
                    You really don t know, do you?

      Bill pauses in the doorway.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    If you re staying or going.                                                                                    21.


      Bill holds her gaze for a moment. His gaze is unwavering... 
      but it does not give answers. He walks off.

      She stares after him. Her blue-green eyes shine with tears. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    I wish it had been a compliment.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON BILL

      charging forward, head bent, as the rain lashes down with 
      renewed brutality on the now-mud-sloshed streets of Dawson. 
      OUR VIEW whips away from him to...

      A COCK-EYED SIGN

      nailed against a dilapidated structure. Faded words read 
      (without irony)  DRY GOODS . ROUGH HANDS pull off the sign. 
      The hands belong to Father Judge.

      The Dry Goods store is officially no longer a dry goods 
      Store.


      Father judge tosses the sign onto a large heap of rotten wall-
      boards. He s been single-handedly turning the store into a 
      church.

      It s a bit of a disaster now. All that s left of the store is  
      the counter. The shelves have all been splintered and tossed 
      into a heap.

      There are maybe a hundred leaks in the ceiling. It s all but 
      raining in here. 

      A KNOCKING on the door. Father Judge turns, surprised. Who 
      would be calling in this storm? 

      THE DOOR

      is opened to reveal A TALL MAN with a patchy black beard, 
      wearing a black, seal-skin rain coat and strange looking rain-
      hat.

      He is  THE COUNT .  

                                  COUNT
                          (slight German accent)
                    I am Charles Eugene Schultz. But my 
                      friends... and enemies... call me 
                    The Count.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    What can I do for you?                                                                                    22.


        Histrionically, the count removes his hat. A gesture of-jokey 
      deference.

                                  COUNT
                          (humble voice)
                    Forgive me but I have sinned.
                          (beat)
                    I would like to make a confession.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Father Judge sits across from The Count as rain pours down 
      around them from the leaky roof.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    What do you have to confess?

      The Count s face is all penitence and sorrow.

                                  COUNT
                    Arson and murder.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                          (reacts)
                    When did you commit these acts?

                                  COUNT
                    I haven t committed them yet.

      He smiles a humorless smile. Stares at father judge until he 
      understands the implicit threat.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Do you care to be more forthright, 
                    sir?

      Father Judge s eyes burn. We haven t seen him angry yet. But 
      he does get angry.

      The Count stares around him.

                                  COUNT
                    This watering can will be your new 
                    church, huh?  

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    If God s willing.

                                  COUNT
                    God is not willing, Father. This is 
                    prime real estate. Right in the 
                    middle of Dawson. Many others have 
                    had their eye on it. I am a 
                    Lutheran, friend.                                                                                    23.


                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    We are not friends.

                                  COUNT
                          (stares him down)
                    During my lifetime, I will not have 
                    a papal atrocity built in my back 
                    yard. My future sins will attest to 
                    that. 

      Father Judge stares him down.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    You intend to burn down my church 
                    and murder me in it.

                                  COUNT
                    So you see, my mortal soul is at 
                    stake.
                          (beat)
                    You have a day to vacate.

      The Count heads toward the doorway... then pauses. 

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                          (slow smile)
                    Aren t you going to offer 
                      penance... for my future sins.

      Father Judge s eyes are red. Old Testament eyes.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Your penance is being who you are.

      The Count stares back. Eyes take in the water pouring down 
      through the sieve of a roof.

                                  COUNT
                    Your roof is leaking, Father. 

      Stares intently at father Judge. Making his last words sound 
      personal.

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                    Too many leaks to be fixed. 

      And he heads off into the rain, sleek as a seal.

      ON FATHER JUDGE

      returning to his  church,  lost in thought, eyes harrowed.

      Alone (very much alone) Father Judge goes back to work , 
      smashing in the broken-down counter of the former Dry Goods 
      Store with an axe.                                                                                     24.


      Hard labor making him sweat. He removes his vestments 
        revealing...

      A VERTICAL SCAR

      It goes down his chest from neck to navel. Like he was 
      gutted... and it didn t take. 

      ON FATHER JUDGE

      Rage in his eyes now... SLAMMING the axe harder and harder 
      against the old splintering wood of the former store counter. 

      Grey hair wild. Scar reddening.

      A different kind of priest.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON HEAVY BOOTS

      sloshing through mud. Soaked through and through. The owner 
      of the boots may as well be barefoot. 

      ON BILL 

      heading toward his claim through visible sheets of rain... 
      eyes alert now. Every part of him alert. 

      OUR VIEW passes along the mining encampments along the 
      swollen Klondike. Everywhere, miners are bustling about, 
      putting up sandbags, reenforcing their structures.

      Almost everyone looks up as Bill passes. Pause in their work 
      to stare. It s unnerving.  

      ONE MAN (standing just outside his structure)

      regards Bill with an extra challenge in his gaze. OUR VIEW 
      drifts down to his feet.

      He is wearing Epstein s boots. (We recognize the embossed 
      cowboy with the lasso).

      A charge comes into Bill s eyes. He starts to move toward 
      this man as... 

      ... THE MAN S BROTHERS emerge from the tent, cold eyes on 
      him. One is whittling a piece of wood with a large knife. 

      Two boys have also emerged from the tent and are clinging to 
      the men s pants. Big, curious... unfriendly eyes.

                                  BILL
                      (to booted miner; growls it out)
                    We ll talk alone sometime.                                                                                    25.


      Continues on, glaring back at the man with Epstein s boots. 

      ON BILL

      arriving at his claim. 

      Meekor is in the midst of tying forked sticks on the base of 
      his structure with triple wrapped bark. He smokes his corn 
      cob pipe as he works. Glances at Bill. 

                                  MEKOR
                    Oughta move your structure to 
                    higher ground.

      Bill is in no mood for Meekor. He s just seen a man wearing 
      his dead friend s boots. 

      Bill storms toward him (Meekor remains standing and smoking; 
      has a kind of Zen quality). Bill has to shout above the rain.

                                  BILL
                    This is the way it s gonna work. You 
                    stay in your area, I stay in mine! 
                    You don t say anything to me, you 
                    don t make small talk, you don t give 
                    me advice! Far as I m concerned, 
                    you re part of the mountain.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Which part?

      Bill stares at him in disbelief. Did he really ask that? 

                                  BILL
                    The part that s quiet and don t 
                    move!

      Bill storms toward his tent.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Not all parts like that.

      Bill turns... is about to let Meekor have it, but pauses at 
      the image of the mining camp spread out before him. Bill and 
      Meekor s quarrel had been louder than Bill thought. 

      A HUNDRED HOSTILE EYES

      are fixed on him, one of them probably a murderer.

      Bill pulls out a pistol, puts it into his pants for ready 
      use. He stares right back at the miners, ready for anything. 
      He goes back into his tent.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    26.



      Bill is in his tent. A single candle is burning. It sounds 
      like a thousand thumb tacks are hitting the canvas of his 
      tent. The rain. With each gust of wind the canvas of the tent 
      billows and shifts, threatens to blow over.

      Pen in hand, Bill is writing a letter to, yes... his mother. 

      OUR VIEW moves through the detritus of the mining settlement 
      past gaunt, tired faces, and rugged nature (spruce trees, 
      lashed by wind and rain, growing out of cracks in rocks), as 
      we hear Bill s voice.  

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    Dear Mother, I find myself a 
                    stranger in a strange but beautiful 
                    land. This is a place they say 
                    where the gold fairly sticks out of 
                    the dirt. I saw a man recently 
                    carrying a nugget the size of an 
                    apple. Like one of those on our 
                    trees out back....But sadness has 
                    followed us. Epstein is dead. 
                    Murdered by a savage, and cowardly 
                    man. I know not who. I know not 
                    how. The Klondike seems hardly real 
                    without him.  To Go for the Moon 
                    whether we get there or not --
                    that s what we promised each other. 
                    An optimists s giddy plan or a 
                    fool s journey? I fear the latter 
                    now. All is rendered hollow as I 
                    write this. I expect to see you 
                    soon. As soon as I can lay my 
                    friend to God s care, and bring the 
                      perpetrator to justice, if there is 
                    justice to be had up here where no 
                    law has yet reached. Your face 
                    brings me comfort. In my mind. And 
                    soon in my sight.

      He hesitates, then writes the last words.

                                  BILL (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... I will be home soon.

      A BOOMING CRASH OF THUNDER

      breaks  the silence.

      THROUGH A GAP IN THE TENT FLAPS

      we see the top of the denuded mountain BLEACHED in a flash of 
      lightning. A single spruce tree stands on the summit like a 
      flag.                                                                                    27.


      ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING

      makes instant daylight out of the mountain peak. The spruce 
      tree is no longer at the summit. It is several yards down the 
      slope now. 

      It s like the mountain is moving.

      Suddenly, there s A TERRIBLE RUMBLING. This can t be good. 
      Beneath the sound, we hear the TINY SHOUTS of other miners.

      Bill exits his tent just in time to see...

      THE MOUNTAIN

      slide away from itself... rushing inexorably downward. Bill 
      grabs at his tent as A TSUNAMI OF MUD hits...

      ...carrying him, the tent, everything in its path down the 
      slope with the force of a hundred freight trains.

      ON BILL

      struggling  in the fast-moving mud as it pulls him down the 
      slope. He goes down, sunk in it. 

      The mud settles a bit... and miraculously, Bill rises--mud 
      covered, pounds and pounds of mud cloaking him. He stares at 
      the slope above him and sees the horrific sight of...

      MINERS 

      scattering as another SEA OF MUD slams down off the mountain. 
      We glimpse the horror of a mother clutching her seven year 
      old s hand hardly having the time to react as the mud 
      engulfs, making them part of the earth. 

      Other miners are carried off like sticks in a waterfall. 

      Bill struggles frantically up the hill.

      THE ENCAMPMENT

      We re in the first moments after the disaster. CHAOS 
      everywhere. The injured SCREAMING. Miners pulling other 
      miners out of the mud. OUR VIEW whips to...

      A MAN COVERED HEAD TO TOE WITH MUD standing stock still (a 
      mud snowman) a jagged piece of wood piercing his shoulder. He 
      doesn t appear to know where he is.

      A mud-covered Bill (barely recognizable) claws through the 
      mud at the structure where he saw mother and child engulfed.                                                                                    28.


      Grabs a hand. Pulls A WOMAN out from under a heavy blanket of 
      mud. Barely alive. She gestures frantically. Her eyes the 
      only thing human in her mud visage.

                                  WOMAN
                    My boy! My boy!

      She stares frantically at Bill.

                                  WOMAN (CONT D)
                    I was holding his hand! I couldn t 
                    hold on! He slipped away!

      Bill pushes aside feet of mud... sees a broken structure 
      beneath. Slides down.

      ON BILL

      looking through a disaster of broken pilings and thick walls 
      of mud. He hears A CHILD S SHOUTS. The kid s alive. 

      Bill plunges deeper. Reaches through a hole in the cedar 
      smaller than a head. 

      FINGERS touch his fingers. It s the kid, stuck in a blocked-
      in crawl space. The kid is CRYING.

      OUTSIDE THE COLLAPSED STRUCTURE

      OTHER MINERS have gathered, trying to console the hysterical 
      mother. 

                                  MOTHER
                    I can hear him! He s alive!

      Bill rises up. All action now.

                                  BILL
                          (eyes wild)
                    I need oil. Something slippery. 
                    Anything.

      Most of the miners are too stunned to react. Bill goes over 
      to a gunnysack, rummages through it. 

                                  WOMAN MINER S VOICE
                    I have mineral oil.

      Bill grabs it, starts to strip while heading back to the 
      collapsed structure. Doing a dozen things art once.

                                  BILL
                    Caves in Vermont. Folks got stuck, 
                    we got  em out like this.                                                                                     29.


                                  MOTHER
                        (hysterical)
                    I don t hear him no more.

      Looks desperately to Bill who, completely naked now, lowers 
      himself into the shaft. It s true, we no longer hear the 
      child s SCREAMS. He might not have made it.

      ON BILL

      wriggling his way through the underworld of mud toward the 
      crawl space. A CEILING OF WOOD cracks audibly above him. 
      Bulges downward. Mud oozes through the crack.

      In seconds the structure will cave in. Bill wriggles further. 

      He s made it to the crawl space. He fumbles for a match. 
      Breathing heavily. Lights the match.

      THROUGH THE SMALL HOLE IN THE CRAWL SPACE

      we see A LITTLE BOY OF SEVEN sitting hunched against a 
      cracked cedar wall. In his underwear. Terrified. Big eyes 
      staring at Bill. 

                                  BILL
                    Listen to me. I need you to listen 
                    to me, okay?

      The boy nods at Bill. He s in shock.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I need you to come toward me.

      The boy inches toward him. Bill hands him the mineral oil 
      through the hole. Something behind Bill collapses. Fuck. Bill 
      turns frantically back to the boy.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Pour this over you like it s water. 
                    That s right, that s right.

      The boy has obeyed, drenched in oil now. 

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Now you re going to have to push 
                    yourself through that hole. 

      The boy stares terrified at the hole. It s so small. 

                                  BOY
                          (pale)
                    I can t fit.

                                  BILL
                    Yes you can. It just looks like you 
                    can t.. You ever see a sea otter?
(MORE)                                                                                    30.

BILL (CONT'D)
                          (off the boy s confusion)
                    A sea otter s bigger than you, but 
                    it can get through gaps in rocks 
                    you don t think a guppy can get 
                    through. You re a sea otter. 

      The boy stares at Bill. Bill holds the boy s gaze. Can see 
      the boy trusts him. 

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Say it,  I m a sea otter. I m a sea 
                    otter. 

      Tentatively the boy moves toward the hole. Scrunches his head 
      into it. Grimaces in pain. 

      THE CEILING OF THE CRAWL SPACE

      CRACKS OPEN behind the boy, dropping down a huge mass of mud. 
      More to follow in seconds.

      Bill grabs the boy s ears, using them like handles... and 
      using every ounce of strength... scrapes him through.

      THE CRAWL SPACE

      caves in with a CRASH behind him. 

      OUTSIDE THE STRUCTURE

      Everyone waiting and staring. There s not a sound from 
        underground. 

      And then... there s a movement in the mud. An arm. The boy s 
      father rushes over and pulls his son to his feet.

      The boy emerges from the sunken mine to tears and applause. 

                                  BOY
                          (smiling)
                    I m a sea otter.

      A DOZEN MINERS

      rush over to help Bill out of the mud. 


      Bill sits with a dozen other half-cleaned-up miners. The 
      place is cramped, stained with smoke. Bill s bright eyes 
      taking everything in.

      GORNA (the owner) moves through the structure handing out the 
      food--a small ageless woman with a thick Kentucky accent. 

      Hands a tin plate of food to Bill.

                                  GORNA
                    Wolf!

      Like it s an order. 

                                  GORNA (CONT D)
                    I like eatin  critters that wanna 
                    eat me. 

      LAUGHS a too loud laugh. Shrewd brown eyes cracks in shoe leather. 

                                  GORNA (CONT D)
                    Open that winder! Warm as spit in 
                    here.

      The miner she just yelled at quickly opens a slat in a 
      makeshift window. Gorna queen of her domain in here.

      A miner hands Bill a mason jar filled with a clear liquid. 
      Bill takes a sip. Winces.

                                  MINER
                    Home made moonshine, brother. From 
                    Spruce bark. Special Yukon recipe.                                                                                    32.


                                  BILL
                    Back home we gotta word for that.

                                  MINER
                    What s that?

                                  BILL
                          (grins)
                      Turpentine.

      The miner LAUGHS and LAUGHS. 

                                  MINER
                      Turpentine.

      Saying it in his native southern accent now. Making it sound 
      even funnier. Spits some of the moonshine into the fire and a 
      gust of flame rises. 

                                  MINER (CONT D)
                    Maybe so. Turpentine.

      Bill turns from him, his bright eyes taking in everything 
      about this brave new world. 

      Notes A GAUNT MAN staring at him with the saddest eyes we ve ever 
      seen. A RAW RED SCAR goes down his face. His name is GOODMAN.

      Goodman sees he s got Bill s attention. He pushes a kit of 
      mining tools toward Bill.

                                    GOODMAN
                    You might get some use of these. 
                    Belonged to my son. He don t need 
                    it no more.

      Goodman s eyes are filled with warmth... and liquor.

                                  BILL
                    Why s that? 

                                    GOODMAN
                          (quiet)
                    He didn t have a guardian angel like 
                    the boy you saved. He just had me.

      The mug of moonshine drops from Goodman s right hand. He 
      scrambles, embarrassed, to pick it up with his left.

      ANGLE ON RIGHT HAND

      Goodman s thumb is gone. From the scars, it looks like it had 
      been exploded off his hand.                                                                                    33.


                                  BILL
                            (quiet;compassionate)
                    What happened to your thumb, 
                    friend?

                                    GOODMAN
                    War.

      Doesn t want to talk about it. Goodman drinks, stares with 
      moist eyes at the tools he just gave Bill.

      During this interlude, people have been talking around him. 
      The conversation has grown heated. Something being talked 
      about with great interest.

      But it s like listening to people talking in a foreign 
      language, they ve been in each other s company so long. 

      We hear disparate phrases.  Justice for hire...  Gorna: 
       Ain t live up to heaven.  

                                  BILL
                    What re they talking about?

      Meekor has just sat heavily down beside Bill with his chow.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Law coming to town tomorrow.

                                  BILL
                          (stunned)
                    What law?

                                  MEEKOR
                    Mounties from Canada. 

                                  YOUNG MINER
                          (grins)
                    Gonna crack down on us sinners.

      Bill stares through a slit in the wall boards. 

      THROUGH THE SLIT

      we make out A FULL MOON hanging over Dawson... where justice 
      is perhaps on its way.

      ON BILL

      There s a new (hopeful) fire in Bill s eyes. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A BIG PLUMP HORSE TURD

      dropping onto the muddy street. We are:                                                                                    34.



      Steele sits at his desk now, a Mountie on either side of him. 
      One of the mounties busily scribbles notes.                                                                                     35.


      Bill sits across the desk. Steele appears to be taking Bill 
      very seriously.

                                  STEELE
                    When did this murder take place?

      Hurls all his contempt into the word  murder.  He seems to be 
      angry on Bill s behalf.

                                  BILL
                      Yesterday. We had just staked our 
                    claim. Uphill from the river.

      Steele reacts as if he s just been hit in the face. Goes back 
      to being poker-faced. 

                                  STEELE
                    You say the shot came from the 
                    North east?

                                  BILL
                    It s where I saw the smoke.

      One of the seated Mounties confers with Steele quietly. 
      Steele nods.

                                  STEELE
                    Rifle shot?

      Bill nods. What the hell is going on?

                                  STEELE (CONT D)
                    Likely the Tlingits.

      Never has a man seemed more sure of himself.

                                  STEELE (CONT D)
                    Two specimens of that tribe were 
                    seen near where your friend was 
                    killed. They will be found. 

                                  BILL
                    Tlingits?

                                  STEELE
                    The Indian tribe that used to 
                    dominate this region. In their 
                    savage ignorance, they think this 
                    land is theirs. They have an 
                    invisible boundary, beyond which 
                    folks who venture have been 
                    harassed and threatened. I m 
                    referring to the hillside where you 
                    and your friend Mr. Epstein staked 
                    your claim.                                                                                    36.


                                  BILL
                          (stunned realization)
                    The second we staked our claim we 
                    were marked men?

      Steele stares at Bill with his hard metallic eyes. Yes, 
      that s what Steele thinks. 

      And thinking and knowing is the same for Steele.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON BILL

      walking fast down the main street of Dawson--an extra charge 
      in his eyes now. Jack London sidles up to him. Keeps pace 
      with difficulty.

                                  JACK 
                    I might be able to help you in your 
                    newest endeavor. Hear you re 
                    heading for the Tlingit camp.

                                  BILL
                    Your information is correct.

                                  JACK
                    I m told they re just East of Wolf 
                    Paw trail.

      Jack s beginning to get out of breath keeping pace with Bill. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    It ll be my pleasure to guide you there.

      Bill whirls on him.

                                  BILL
                    Why? To fill more scribbles in your 
                    notebook. This is my battle.

                                  JACK
                    You ll need someone who can speak Tlingit.

      Bill stares at him. His eyes are harrowed. The moment of 
      truth is coming. He nods, charging forward...

      ... Jack hurrying to keep pace.

      ACT OUT                                                                                    37.


      ACT FOUR


      We re in a world of green. Puffy wet moss everywhere. It 
      covers the rocks, the trunks of the huge CREAKING trees.

      IN THE FOREGROUND

      A FIGURE whisks past. Soundlessly, like an animal. Unseen 
      by...

      BILL AND JACK 

      trekking through the dark, ominous forest. Jack continuing to 
      drink.

                                  JACK
                    Lie on the leaves, close your eyes, 
                    might feel the cold paws of wolves 
                    passing over you. And you re one of 
                     em here. A wild... human... 
                    animal. No difference. 

      Jack offers the flask to Bill. Pushes it on him.

      For the first time, we sense a glimmer of real fear in Bill s 
      eyes. He takes a long draught from the flask. And then 
      another. 

      The moment is interrupted by LOUD GROWLING.

      JACK S DOG

      stands frozen before them, staring into the thick trees. Tail 
      down, back arched. Ready to pounce.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                          (whispers it)
                    We re being tracked.

                                  BILL
                    By what?

                                  JACK
                    Could be wolves.
                          (beat)
                    Could be men.

                                  BILL
                          (almost to himself)
                    No difference.

      Bill pulls out his gun. Jack stops to stare at him.

                                  JACK
                    That ll only help with wolves.                                                                                    41.


      No drunkenness in Jack s eyes now. He s scared himself sober. 
      Bill puts away his gun.

      They move tentatively forward through the dark, sacred woods. 
      They freeze at the sound of a BREAKING TWIG.

      AN ELK

      stands less than ten feet from them. Not moving a muscle. 
      Just staring. More curious, than afraid.

      Bill and Jack continue forward... alert to every sound. 
      Knowing how vulnerable they are.

                                  BILL
                          (a whisper)
                    You ever seen an Indian?

                                  JACK
                    Yes, I have seen Indians and talked 
                    to them--

                                  BILL
                    What is their complexion?

                                  JACK
                    They are like all the colors of a 
                    mountain, run together and dripped 
                    in a jar.

      He suddenly stops walking. 

      AHEAD OF THEM

      A MAN is standing absolutely still. As still as the elk. God 
      knows how long he s been standing there. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                          (quiet)
                    They are the color of nature.

      Bill and Jack turn.

      EVERYWHERE THEY LOOK

      stand TLINGIT WARRIORS. They have come silently and taken up 
      positions, surrounding them. Still as the trees.

      Their eyes are not friendly.

      ACT OUT                                                                                    42.


      ACT FIVE


      A FLASH OF LIGHTNING bleaches the straight-backed figure of 
      Father Judge sitting on a freshly made bench. His first pew. 
      He looks devastated.

      BEFORE HIM 

      is his packed suitcase. He s made the decision... but can t 
      quite get himself to leave yet.

      Finally, he hoists the suitcase. Heads disconsolately toward 
      the door. He pauses at the door to cast one last look at his 
      would be church. His eyes fall on...

      A WHITE-WASHED WOODEN CROSS

      lying on a plank of white-smeared plywood on the floor. Just 
      painted.

      He can t leave a cross on the floor.

      FATHER JUDGE

      lifts the cross. HIS HANDS are smeared white from the fresh 
      paint. This gets to him. The cross leaving a mark on his 
      hands. A deep emotion passes over his features.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FATHER JUDGE

      climbing a ladder to the peaked roof of the store, holding 
      the heavy cross. Eyes determined, hair blowing in the wind. 
      His coat is smeared white with the holy burden.

      FATHER JUDGE 

      balances himself astride the pitch of his roof. A skeletal 
      wooden structure has already been placed there.

      LIGHTNING flashes. Wind and rain whip his harrowed face as he 
      lifts a hammer and nails his cross to the roof.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    43.



      A small crowd has gathered around TWO PEOPLE KISSING. The 
      young, pretty (might be under 18) SABINE and a GRIZZLED 
      MINER. Sabine pulls out of the kiss,.

                                  SABINE
                    That s your dollar s worth.

      Gold dollar in her hand, she moves with a slinky, confident 
      grace through the tavern. We hear other laughing miners,  I 
      got a dollar too.  etc. 

      SABINE

      turns to stare at them with sleepy eyes. Conscious of her 
      effect. 

                                  SABINE (CONT D)
                    I m tired of kissing.

      Continues forward with forced arrogance. A little leather 
      pouch is dropped at her feet.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    This should get me more than 
                    kissing.

      Sabine picks up the leather pouch. Looks inside. Gold dust. 

      She looks at the MAN who tossed it at her feet. He is neither 
      attractive or unattractive. Neither appealing or unappealing. 
      He is nothing.

                                  SABINE
                    Have you ever heard of buying a 
                    lady a drink?

                                  MAN
                    What would the lady like to drink?

      Sabine ignores the mocking tone. Sidles (with a touch of 
      regret) up to the man. 

                                  SABINE
                          (to bartender)
                    Red wine. Merlot.

      She turns to her new customer. Smiles an exaggeratedly 
      elegant smile.

                                  SABINE (CONT D)
                      Enchantee.

      Her eyes are sad.                                                                                    44.



      Belinda stands at her boudoir window combing her hair... all 
      alone. We sense she spends a lot of time alone.

      VIEW OUT WINDOW

      By the stables near the Hotel, two people are all but going 
      at it. Sabine and the man who just approached her. Sabine 
      hardly moves. Her eyes are open. 

      BELINDA

      starts to turn away when she reacts to something new in the 
      landscape of Dawson.

      Something akin to (but not quite) panic crosses her features.

      HER POV - TOWN OF DAWSON

      The cross--a distance away... but shining brightly through 
      the night.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      THE COUNT

      He is playing poker with a few of HIS MEN. He is holding out 
      his forearm, while talking, making his muscle taut. 

      A MOSQUITO 

      is sucking the blood on his forearm, bloated red almost to 
      bursting.

                                  COUNT
                          (boasting)
                    You hold the muscle, he can t fly 
                    off. He tries but he s stuck--

      The Count suddenly goes quiet. Through the window, he sees 
      the cross. His eyes flash and (in his moment of distraction) 
      the blood-bloated mosquito flies off.

      WIDE SHOT - TOWN OF DAWSON - NIGHT

      In the darkness there is only one thing that stands out. It 
      can be seen from anywhere in town.

      THE WHITE CROSS

      on Father Judge s just sanctified... church.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    45.


      A DARK FIGURE

      comes toward us out of the storm moving into the entrance-way 
      of a tall lean-to-like structure. This is CHEYEHO, chief of 
      the Tlingit tribe. 

      He comes into clearer focus. Blue-grey hair, decorative scars 
      on his cheeks. DEEP BLUE EYES a jewel-like surprise in his 
      Indian features. Strong eyes. No promise of mercy or 
      vengeance there. A survivor s eyes.

      IN THE TENT BEFORE HIM

      sit Bill and Jack (not bound), guarded by the Tlingit hunters 
      who brought them here. Cheyeho sits across from them, making 
      himself an equal of sorts.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I did not ask you here but I 
                    welcome you.

                                  BILL
                          (to Jack)
                    He speaks English.

                                  JACK
                    That s good because I don t speak 
                    Tlingit.

      Bill gives Jack a look. Cheyeho stares only at Bill. Bill is 
      the man who interests him.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I know about your friend. I mourn 
                    him with you. 

      A charge comes into Bill s eyes. 

                                  BILL
                    What do you know about him?

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I know everything in these woods. I  
                    am like an owl. You and your friend 
                    have what you call  a claim.  In 
                    the hills. You buy land you don t 
                    own from a man who doesn t own it.  

                                  BILL
                    We have different principles of 
                    commerce. 

                                    CHEYEHO
                    Why don t you buy waves in the 
                    ocean? Pieces of sky. Somewhere, 
                    there is a white man who thinks he 
                    owns the moon.                                                                                    46.


      There are tears of anger in Bill s eyes.

                                  BILL
                    Did you kill him?

                                    CHEYEHO
                    We kill only for a purpose. 

                                  BILL
                    That s not an answer.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    Are you a God fearing man?

                                  BILL
                          (a challenge)
                    I am.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    And God is everywhere. He is in 
                      everything?

                                  BILL
                    Yes.

      Cheyeho smiles. It s a surprisingly easygoing smile. It 
      lightens his face. He turns to his fellow tribesmen. He 
      speaks in Tlingit, but subtitles translate.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    You see? The white man fears 
                      everything.

      He turns back to Bill. No longer smiling, the storm whipping 
      the trees behind him.

                                    CHEYEHO (CONT D)
                    Your fear is misplaced here. 

      Cheyeho s eyes are tinged with rage.

                                    CHEYEHO (CONT D)
                    You are in Tlingit territory and 
                    this is the land of no God. I m 
                    sorry for the loss of your friend, 
                    but we did not kill him.

                                  BILL
                    Who killed him?

      Bill s eyes burn. The question that haunts him. That might 
      haunt him to the grave.

      Cheyeho stares at Bill. Two men. That s all they are. Two 
      men. Something passes between them. Some sort of 
      understanding.                                                                                     47.


                                    CHEYEHO
                    The sky killed him.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A CRACK OF THUNDER

      EXPLODES in the sky. The sky is murderous. 

      OUR VIEW drifts down from THE RAIN-SPATTERED CROSS to the 
      image of Bill and Jack arriving back in Dawson. 

      CLOSER - BILL AND JACK

      The two taking leave of each other.

                                  JACK
                    You think they killed your friend?

                                  BILL
                    They didn t act guilty.

                                  JACK 
                    Maybe they don t feel guilty.

        A conundrum. Bill feels it. The two men take leave of one 
      another. Jack heading to the tavern. 

      Bill alone with his stormy thoughts.

      ON BILL

      walking along the main street of Dawson. His mind churning. 
      He glances at the display window of a supply store. What he 
      sees makes him stop.

      ANGLE ON WINDOW 

      Bill s reflection is a spectral presence. He looks ragged, 
      harrowed, pale. He almost doesn t recognize himself.

      ON BILL

      He sees something else in the window. Something that sends a 
      chill down his spine.

      THE WINDOW 

      We RACK FOCUS from Bill s reflected image to reveal the goods 
      on display. Prominent amongst the other items are...

      ... EPSTEIN S BOOTS. 

      Etched in the leather, we make out the cowboy whirling a 
      lasso.                                                                                     48.


      CLOSE ON BILL

      The emotional vagaries of his own adventures are brought home 
      to him by the strange journey of his friend s boots.

      Bill turns emotionally from the sight... and he sees 
      something else...

      THE WHITE CROSS

      standing like a beacon on the roof of Father Judge s church.

      Bill approaches the store, eyes blazing. His gaze falls on a 
      heavy piece of rotted lumber in the street.

      He picks it up... heaves it against the store window, 
      shattering the glass.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EPSTEIN S BODY

      lies on a the makeshift knave of the church, lit in trembling 
      lightning. He s been arranged carefully on a table. Hands 
      folded. 

      Boots back on his feet. Where they belong. We are:  


      Father Judge and Bill stand over the body, sharing a Kaddish 
      prayer book. Father Judge has not slept in a long time, but 
      is voice is firm. 

      He is doing what he came here for.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    May his great name go exalted and 
                      sanctified. 

                                  BILL 
                          (quiet)
                    Amen. 

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    In the world that He created as He 
                    willed. May He give reign to His 
                    kingship in your lifetime and in 
                    your days and in the lifetimes of 
                    the Family of Israel... swiftly and 
                    soon. 

      Bill s cue.                                                                                     49.


                                  BILL
                          (tears in his eyes)
                    May His great Name be blessed 
                    forever and ever.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    May His great Name be blessed 
                    forever and ever.

      Father s Judge s VOICE breaks. This next passage has great, 
      great meaning to him.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    ... Blessed, praised, glorified, 
                    exalted, extolled, mighty, 
                    upraised, and lauded be the Name of 
                    the Holy One, Blessed is He.

      A FLASH OF LIGHTNING

      bleaches Epstein s face in white light... 

      ... It also lights up the window near the body where...

      A DARK-BEARDED MAN 

      is staring in at them. Sees Bill and father Judge staring at 
      him and backs off, grinning.

      Bill turns with suddenly alert eyes to father Judge.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                          (a growl)
                    This is not your fight. They are 
                    here for me.

                                    COUNT S VOICE
                          (shouting)
                    The Pearly gates beckon you, your 
                    holiness! 

      Father Judge s eyes are wild. Instinctively, he turns toward 
      the AXE sitting on a small table. 

      Bill sees the moment. Father Judge sees Bill see. 

      A defining moment. It s like we re between the ticks of a 
      clock.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW

      we see The Count, with A DOZEN OF HIS MEN. Several hold 
      flaming torches.

                                  COUNT
                    You have three seconds to show 
                    yourself, your holiness!                                                                                    50.


      Bill pulls out his pistol. Father Judge grabs his wrist with 
      surprising force. He stares searingly into Bill s eyes.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Leave this place. If you re a man, 
                    leave this God forsaken place... 
                    before it unmans you.

      Bill pulls his arm away. Moves with his pistol toward the 
      door.
