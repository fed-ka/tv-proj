      CLOSE ON-- A BOY'S FACE, eyes closed.  He looks angelic,
      peaceful.  This is JACOB (8, CAUCASIAN).  We widen a little
      to REVEAL--

      He's lying on the ground somewhere.  Sounds of nature --
      birds, insects.  He's wearing a BASEBALL JERSEY that says:
      Springfield Cardinals.  Whoever they are.

      Then-- his eyes POP open at the same time the upper half of
      his body lurches forward, as he takes a HUGE, primal, almost
      violent gasp of air-- as if he's been underwater and just
      came up.  He continues to breathe for several beats, labored,
      sitting up now.

      Breathing more evenly now, he tries to get his bearings. 
      Looks around at-- the tall grasses around him.  He seems to
      have no idea where he is.  He notices-- his sneakers are
      wet.  Why?  He hears a noise.  Turns to see--

      An animal.  An ox, to be exact.  Though it's likely Jacob's
      never seen an ox in his life.  The ox stares at him a beat,
      mildly curious, then starts drinking from a puddle of WATER.

      CLOSE ON: Jacob.  As if he's remembering something about
      water... fear taking over his expression.  SFX: rushing water
      as if running through his mind...

      WIDE SHOT-- Jacob's in the middle of nowhere.  Nothing but
      1000's of acres of farmland and rice paddies all around.  As
      the sound of RUSHING WATER builds in intensity and volume
      until it's deafening we're-- 

      EXT. RURAL CHINESE VILLAGE - DAY

      CHYRON: Heilongjiang Province, China.

      A bustling marketplace.  An OX CART passes by.  Salesmen
      hawk their wares-- various animal carcases dangle from hooks;
      BAGS of RICE, etc.  The people wear conical Asian hats and
      speak in Chinese.  NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

      A CHINESE COUPLE (50's) walks down the dirt road, carrying
      bags, laughing at a shared joke.  The woman suddenly stops
      when she sees--

      Jacob.  Standing in the road.  Exhausted.  Dirty.  

                                      CHINESE WOMAN
                          (in Chinese; worried)
                    Are you alright?

      Jacob just looks at her with plaintive but tired eyes, trying
      to keep standing.

                                      CHINESE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                          (in Chinese)
                    Are you lost?  Do you need help?                                                                                        2.

      With great effort Jacob opens his mouth, tries to speak.

                                      CHINESE MAN
                          (in Chinese)
                    What?  What is it?

      Jacob finally manages to utter--

                                      JACOB
                    Is she... dead?

      And before he has a chance to get an answer or we can
      conjecture who "she" may be-- his eyes roll back into his
      head and-- as he collapses to the ground, we CUT TO BLACK.

      A CHYRON APPEARS ON THE BLACK SCREEN: "The Returned."

                                                                            END TEASER.                                                                                        3.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT (ICE)
      OFFICES - D.C. - DAY

      SLAP!  A RUBBER BALL ricochets against a wall and rockets
      back to be caught by the hand of-- AGENT MARTIN BELLAMY (late
      30's, handsome, black).  He's lying back in his chair,
      contemplating something.  

      His office is spartan-- the office of a person who doesn't
      intend to stay in this job forever.  There are binders and
      folders everywhere, but very few personal touches.  We catch
      a few details: A FORMAL-LOOKING PHOTO of Bellamy with his
      COLLEAGUES.  They're all wearing their official Jackets--
      it's a photo op for some kind of Customs victory-- the seizure
      of drugs.  Bellamy's drawn handle-bar moustaches on everyone.

      He tosses the ball again.  It lands back in his hand.  Reveal--
      he's staring at -- A FRAMED PHOTO, of himself and a WOMAN
      (30's, white, attractive.  Arms around each other.)  He throws
      the ball again.  This time it bounces off the wall and
        accidentally hits--

      The framed photo, knocking it to the ground, the glass
      breaking.  He laughs at the Freudian accident.

                                      MARTIN BELLAMY
                    Oops.

      As he bends down to pick it up his boss, DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
      (40's) appears, sees the broken picture frame--

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                    Another one bites the dust?

      He tosses the frame in the trash can.

                                      MARTIN BELLAMY
                    She wanted someone with more ambition.

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                          (joking)
                    Is that why you came here on a
                    Saturday?  To prove you have ambition?

                                      MARTIN BELLAMY
                    Hell no.  I came here to drown my
                    sorrows in paperwork.

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                          (smiles, then--)
                    Have you seen Kessler?

                                      MARTIN BELLAMY
                    He left an hour ago.  Anything I can
                    do?

      She hesitates.  He looks up--                                                                                        4.

                                      MARTIN BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    What?

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                    A friend of mine at HHS called, asked
                    for a favor.  It's a repatriation. 
                    He was supposed to gather the subject
                    from the State Department attache at
                    the airport.  But he can't make it.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (so?)
                    I can do it.

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                            (hestitates)
                    It's a kid.

      This obviously has significance to them.  Bellamy shrugs--

                                      BELLAMY
                    All I gotta do is pick him up, take
                    him to Health and Human Services?
                          (off Willis)
                    Whole thing should take two hours,
                    tops.  Right?

                                      CATHERINE WILLIS
                          (slight hesitation)
                    Yeah.  Of course.  Thanks.

      PRE-LAP the SOUND of AN AIRPLANE AND--

      INT. REAGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

      A PLANE FLIES by in the b.g., through a window.  In the
      foreground, Bellamy walks with a STATE DEPARTMENT ATTACHE. 
      Bellamy carries a FILE.

                                      ATTACHE (O.S.)
                    ...I gotta be honest, this one's a
                      head-scratcher.

                                      BELLAMY
                    How's that?

                                      ATTACHE
                    The boy showed up in a village in
                    rural China.  Outta nowhere.  Nothing
                    but farms and rice paddies for
                    hundreds of miles.  Kid had no i.d.,
                    no passport, nothing.

                                      BELLAMY
                    What's the kid say?

                                      ATTACHE
                    That's the thing.  Nothing.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        5.

                                      ATTACHE (CONT'D)
                    Hasn't said a word since we found
                    him.  Traumatized, I guess.

                                      BELLAMY
                    From what?

                                      ATTACHE
                      Kidnapping, human trafficking, white
                    slavery-- who knows?

      Bellamy looks up as they approach a sitting area where--
      Jacob (wearing the same jersey as he did in China, now washed
      clean) sits with another ATTACHE (ATTACHE #2).  They stop
      walking--

                                      BELLAMY
                    What do you know about him?

                                      ATTACHE
                    He appears to be American. 
                      Springfield Cardinals is a minor
                    league team in Missouri.  But no
                    missing persons hits in the state or
                    for the rest of the country for that
                    matter-- we sent notice.  Also, the
                    name Jacob was written in pen on the
                    inside collar of his jersey.  He
                    seems to respond to it.

                                      BELLAMY
                    So he could have parents.  At least
                    someone who cares for him. 

                                      ATTACHE
                    We didn't find anyone.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Not yet.  Once I dump him at HHS the
                    odds go to nil.

                                      ATTACHE
                          (shrugs)
                    Look, we did everything we could. 
                    If this kid's got a home and parents,
                    he wasn't helping us find them.  Who
                    knows what kind of home it is.  

      Bellamy considers that, then Attache catches the eye of--
      ATTACHE #2.  Attache #2 taps his watch.  Attache nods.

                                      ATTACHE (CONT'D)
                          (checks watch)
                    I got a flight back to Beijing. 
                      Everything we know's in the file,
                    not that you need to know it.  Oh--
                    here's a tip.  He likes cell phones.                                                                                        6.

      Attache heads off.  Bellamy wonders what he meant by that,
      feeling left dangling.  He turns to Jacob--

                                      BELLAMY
                          (a little awkward)
                    Hi.  I'm Agent Bellamy.  What's your
                    name?

      Jacob looks down at the ground, shy, scared.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Ready?

      Jacob continues to look down, looking anything but ready. 
      Bellamy doesn't want to get involved-- his job is just to
      take the kid to HHS.  But he can't help it-- he has an
      intuitive empathy he can't ignore--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Hungry?

      Jacob looks up.

      INT. DINER - DAY

      Jacob eats like crazy.  Stuffing fries into his mouth while
      he's already eating a burger.  Bellamy's amused--

                                      BELLAMY
                    Guess you got sick of rice.

      Jacob glances at him, as if confused.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry-- bad joke.

      Bellamy takes out his SMART PHONE, starts returning texts. 
      Jacob stares at the phone, fascinated.  Bellamy notices--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    You like games?

      Jacob's eyes lights up.  Jacob watches as Bellamy changes
      the screen on the phone--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Got a whole folder of 'em.

      Jacob points to something, excited--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Pacman.  You like the classics, huh? 
                    Man after my own heart.  Here ya go.

      Bellamy hands him the phone.  Jacob starts playing.  Bellamy
      watches him for a beat, thinking more about his case.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    How the heck did you end up in China?                                                                                        7.

      Jacob looks up at him.  Something about Bellamy he trusts. 
      He seems just at the point of communicating but doesn't for
      some reason.  Bellamy's starting to feel bad for this kid,
      then reminds himself it's not his problem.  He checks his
      watch, reaches into his pocket for money.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Better get going.  They'll be
                    expecting us.

      Jacob hands him the phone.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    That's okay, keep it.  You can play
                    in the car.

      But Jacob keeps his hand out.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    What, you wanna show me your score?

      Bellamy takes the phone, looks at it.  Jacob's texted the
      word: "Aurora."

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                          (confused)
                    Aurora?
                          (realizing)
                    Is that where you're from?
                          (off Jacob)
                    Aurora, Missouri?

      Jacob nods.

      INT. DINER - MINUTES LATER

      Bellamy stands away from the booth where Jacob sits, pacing,
      excited.  He looks at-- Jacob, who sits at the booth in the
      b.g. making little structures with the coffee stirrers. 
      Bellamy's got to admit to himself it would feel pretty good
      to reunite this kid with his parents.  After a beat--

                                    MALE VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                    This is the Sheriff, Aurora P.D.

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                    Sheriff, hi.  I'm Agent Bellamy from--

                                    MALE VOICE
                    You got the wrong kid.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (beat)
                    Sorry?

                                    MALE VOICE
                    The dispatcher told me you're calling
                    about a boy named Jacob.  'Bout 7 or
                    8 years old.  55 pounds.                                                                                        8.

                                      BELLAMY
                    That's right.

                                    MALE VOICE
                    There's no missing kids named Jacob
                    that belong here.  No missing kids
                    at all.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Okay, that doesn't make sense.  He's
                    sitting right--

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Please don't call back here.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Sheriff, I--

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Have a good day.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (click)
                    Sheriff?  Sheriff?

      He's been hung up on.  That was weird.  Bellamy thinks, heads
      back to--

      THE BOOTH.  He sits across from Jacob.  Looks at him a beat.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Are you really from Aurora, Jacob?

      Jacob looks down, disappointed.  Bellamy thinks he made it
      up.  Nods.  As he pays the bill--

      EXT. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUILDING - DAY

      Bellamy's car pulls up to the building, next to a sign that
      we can see: "Health and Human Services - Adoptive Care."

      INT. BELLAMY'S CAR - DAY

                                      BELLAMY
                    Here we are.

      Jacob takes his seatbelt off, while staring at the floor,
      sad.  It's breaking Bellamy's heart.  Bellamy steels himself,
      opens his car door, then freezes when he feels something--

      Jacob's got his hand on Bellamy's hand, staring up at him
      with big little boy eyes telling him: don't leave me.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    What do you want me to do, Jacob? 
                    The sheriff said you don't live there.

      Jacob looks down, unsure himself.  But Bellamy's been thinking
      about this--                                                                                        9.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    So why don't I believe him?

      Jacob looks back at him, a glimmer of hope.  Bellamy makes a
      decision, shuts his door.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    You have parents, Jacob?  People to
                    take care of you?
                          (Jacob nods)
                    You swear?
                          (nods again)
                    If somebody took you to Aurora, would
                    you be able to take them to your
                    house?

      Jacob looks at him a beat, then nods.  Vigorously.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    You owe me.  Big time.  Now put on
                    your seatbelt before I arrest you.

      Jacob smiles wild.  For the first time.  As he puts his
      seatbelt back on, excited, Bellamy turns the ignition--

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      EXT. RURAL STREET - VARIOUS

      Still and peaceful-- the lush tranquility of a small town,
      tree-lined road.  Birds sing the song of middle-American
      values as a few leaves fall, heralding the coming of autumn. 
      A few BOYS ride by on bikes.  

      But even now we may sense something sad-- the slightest hint
      of loss-- seeping through the cracks of the picture perfect
      exterior of this place.  We favor one of the houses on the
      street--

      EXT. WHITE COLONIAL HOUSE - DAY

      The house oozes with charm.  It was built in the 1860's using
      techniques and materials long abandoned in favor of expediency
      and cost-effectiveness.  It is mostly well-kept, but if you
      look closer you might notice the peeling paint around the
      attic windows, or the broken step leading up the side entrance
      to the kitchen.  We begin to make out the conversation coming
      from inside--

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                      Perspicuous.

                                      HAROLD (O.S.)
                      Repetitive?

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                    Nope.                                                                                        10.

      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      CLOSE ON-- a FRAMED PHOTO of Jacob, sitting on a side table.

                                      HAROLD (O.S.)
                    Tiresome?

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                    Not even close.

      REVEAL-- HAROLD GARLAND (60's, balding, wiry and compact)
      wears a plaid flannel shirt and jeans, reads a newspaper on
      a big chair.  LUCILLE GARLAND (60's, plump but not fat),
      sits at the dining room table.  Lucille takes care of herself
      and her appearance-- even on a Sunday morning in her own
      house she has makeup on and her hair done but not overdone.

      Lucille looks at a stack of VOCABULARY FLASH CARDS FROM A
      BOX for new words she's teaching herself.  Harold half pays
      attention to her quizzing--

                                      HAROLD
                    How about downright annoying?

      She gives him a look.  He smiles.  Knowing he's making fun
      of her now (lightly)--

                                      LUCILLE
                    Preacher Tom says we shouldn't mock
                    our loved ones-- even small jokes
                    can be hurtful.

                                      HAROLD
                    Preacher Tom was still in diapers
                    when I graduated college.

                                      LUCILLE
                          (a memory)
                    Remember when he pooped his little
                    pants on the park see-saw?

      Harold smiles-- yeah, he does remember.  She laughs guiltily. 
      These two may bicker, but there's still a lot of love between
      them.  DING DONG.  It's the doorbell.  They look at each
      other: who could that be?  Then Harold remembers--

                                      HAROLD
                    Fred said he'd stop by to return the
                    chainsaw.

      EXT. HOUSE - FRONT STOOP - DAY

      Harold opens the door.  Is surprised to see-- Bellamy (who
      still wears his ICE JACKET.)  For his part, Bellamy's
      surprised to see a man in his 60's.  Bellamy notices-- a
      MAILBOX with the name: "Garland."

                                      BELLAMY
                    Mr. Garland?                                                                                        11.

      The sun gleams in Harold's eyes.  He holds his hand up to
      shade the light.  Harold gets a look at Bellamy, is
      immediately wary of this official, big-city-looking outsider.

                                      HAROLD
                    I've been called worse.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Are you the only Mr. Garland who
                    lives here?

                                      HAROLD
                    Far as I know.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Father of Jacob?

                                      HAROLD
                          (eyes narrowing)
                    What's this about?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'm Agent Martin Bellamy, Customs
                    and Immigration Enforcement Agency. 
                    Did your son go missing, Mr. Garland?

                                      HAROLD
                          (getting impatient)
                    Why?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Because I have him.  He's okay.

                                      HAROLD
                          (chuckles)
                    Well, now.  That would be fairly
                    unlikely considering my son died
                    thirty years ago.

      Bellamy reacts: WTF?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'm very sorry, Mr. Garland.  There's
                    obviously been a mistake--

      A NOISE.  Jacob appears, his head between the bannister
      railings.

      Harold squints, holding his hand over his eyes again.  He
      sees-- Jacob, peeking from between the railings.  Doesn't
      recognize him.  Harold looks at him quizzically--

                                      HAROLD
                    Hello, there.

                                      JACOB
                          (to Harold)
                    What's green and red and goes a
                    million miles an hour?                                                                                        12.

      Bellamy reacts: this is the first time Jacob's spoken.  He
      looks up at-- Harold, who's suddenly in shock.

      Because that's when it hits Harold.  He just stares at the
      boy.  His brain feverishly trying to reconcile the impossible
      reality of Jacob's presence.  As if he's seeing his dead
      son.

      Bellamy watches, utterly confused--

                                      JACOB (CONT'D)
                    Frog in a blender.

                                      HAROLD
                    Oh, God...

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                    Harold?  Is that Fred?

      Harold's reaction to seeing Jacob is enough to signal to
      Jacob that Harold recognizes him.  Jacob runs up the stairs,
      grabs hold of Harold's leg--

                                      JACOB
                    Daddy!

      Harold's legs almost give out from the shock.  He braces
      himself against the doorframe.

                                      HAROLD
                    No...

      Lucille comes to the door--

                                      LUCILLE
                    Harold, who is it?

      Harold looks at her, his face pale.  His eyes empty caverns. 
      She looks down at Jacob.  Jacob turns, looks up at her. 
      Doesn't recognize her--

                                      JACOB
                    Who are you?

      Terror registers in Lucille's eyes.

      Bellamy reacts.  Lucille takes a step back, getting weak-
      kneed.  Bellamy instinctively steps forward to help her.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Jacob?

      A hint of recognition in Jacob's eyes.  And that's it. 
      Lucille's eyes flutter as-- LUCILLE'S POV-- the room spins
      with terrifying, accelerating speed until we--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        13.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - ENCLOSED PORCH - A LITTLE LATER

      Harold and Bellamy are on the porch.  Harold looks out over
      the yard, a bit shell-shocked--

                                      HAROLD
                    It was 31 years ago as of August
                    28th.

                                      BELLAMY
                    What was?

                                      HAROLD
                    My son.  He drowned.  He was playing
                    down by the river behind the woods. 
                    Fell in.  His aunt Barbara-- my
                    brother's wife-- went in to save
                    him.  Neither made it.

      Bellamy is respectful even though he feels he's being played
      with--

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Garland. 
                    But what does that have to do with
                    that boy in there?

      Harold turns, looks at him.  Bellamy smiles, realizing what
      he's getting at--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    You're not saying...  Mr. Garland,
                    you don't expect me to believe that
                    boy is...

      Harold gives him a slight smile--

                                      HAROLD
                    Well, now, Mr. Martin Bellamy.  What
                    you believe or don't believe is none
                    of my business, is it?

      Bellamy reacts.  Harold notices-- Lucille, getting up from
      her chair in the kitchen.  He heads inside--

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (nervous)
                    Lucille?

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Jacob sits and plays with Bellamy's phone.  He senses someone
      above him, looks up at-- Lucille, standing there.  She's
      nervous, cautious.  Harold's behind her, holding her arm,
      worried about her.

      Bellamy's behind them, watching.                                                                                        14.

      Jacob looks back at his game.  Lucille kneels, slowly reaches
      out to touch his hair, still scared, tears welling up in her
      eyes.  But she stops just short of touching him.  She can't. 
      She's just not ready.

      Jacob turns, locks eyes with her.  They each take the other
      in for the first time.  Jacob now recognizes her--

                                      JACOB
                    You look different.

      She smiles involuntarily.  And in that smile, the ice is
      broken.  As if her body is telling her what her brain can't
      accept, yet: it's him.  She suddenly embraces him, kissing
      his head hard all over, tears streaming down her face--

                                      LUCILLE
                    Jacob.

      She pulls his head into her bosom, rocking him, plunging
      into this impossible dream.  A dream she'd rather stay in
      forever than wake up in a reality without her beloved child. 
      Bellamy watches, stunned--

      Harold watches, too, but he has a look of concern--

      INT. ENCLOSED PORCH - DAY

      Bellamy's on the phone with Dr. Willis, mid-conversation.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS (THROUGH PHONE)
                    Hold on, you're in Missouri?  Jesus,
                    Martin, all you had to do was take
                    him to HHS.

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                    You don't understand.  State
                      Department had no idea what they
                    were dealing with.  They didn't see
                    what I'm seeing.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                    Which is what?  A couple in their
                    60's?

      Bellamy looks into the living room; Harold's standing back
      from Jacob.

                                      BELLAMY
                    At least.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                    So the kid's obviously not theirs. 
                    Right?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Look, either these people are
                    suffering some mutual delusion that
                    they belong to each other or--                                                                                        15.

      Bellamy notices-- a FRAMED PHOTO on an end table.  He picks
      it up.  The photo's obviously old (from the late 70's).  It
      depicts some kind of outdoor event-- a picnic.  

      On the bottom it says: "Courtesy of the St. Louis Tribune." 
      Front and center are what look like-- a young Harold (30's),
      Lucille (early 30's) and Jacob (8), who looks EXACTLY the
      same.  The three are smiling, arms around each other.  A
      happy family.  What the hell?  This is just getting weirder...

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                    Or what?  Marty?

                                      BELLAMY
                          (hanging up)
                    I'll call you back.

                                      SHERIFF FRED (O.S.)
                    What the hell is this?

      Bellamy turns-- SHERIFF FRED GARLAND (mid-50's, tough) is
      standing right outside the porch, looking up at Bellamy, a
      CHAINSAW in one hand and a DOCUMENT in another.

      Fred holds up a FAX of a missing persons report with Jacob's
      picture on it.  

                                      SHERIFF FRED (CONT'D)
                    What kind of monumental goddamn screw-
                    up did you feds do?

      Harold approaches, tries to calm him down, knowing his brother
      can have a vicious temper--

                                      HAROLD
                    Calm down, Fred--

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    I told you you had the wrong damn
                    kid.  Now you come here-- to my town--
                      harrassing my brother with some
                    nonsense about his son--

                                      HAROLD
                    Fred, please, we have to talk--

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Not until this man explains why a
                    federal agency would send out a
                    missing persons report for a boy who
                    died 30 years ago.  Is this some
                    kind of sick joke?

                                      JACOB
                    Hi, Uncle Fred.  

      All eyes turn to-- Jacob, standing in the doorway to the
      porch.  He's holding a DUSTY, ANCIENT LEGO SCULPTURE someone's
      pulled out of the attic.  ON FRED, seeing him.  Stunned.                                                                                          16.

      Clearly he's recognized Jacob but he can only stare.

      Bellamy clocks Fred's reaction.  Suddenly, before anybody
      can fully process the moment-- Jacob starts to SHAKE.

                                      HAROLD
                    Jacob?

      The shaking increases-- Jacob drops the LEGO SCULPTURE on
      the ground and it-- SHATTERS-- Lego pieces skidding and
      bouncing on the floor and-- Jacob, too, drops to the ground--
      CONVULSING VIOLENTLY now.

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Oh, God--

      Strangely, Harold seems to know what to do.  He runs to Jacob--

      Harold kneels beside the boy, taking off his PLAID SHIRT (he
      has a white T-shirt underneath).  Lucille enters--

                                      LUCILLE
                    Harold?  What is it?  Oh, no--

                                      HAROLD
                          (to Fred and Bellamy)
                    Come on, help me!

      As Bellamy and Fred run over to him, and Jacob continues to
      seize violently--

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (to Lucille)
                    Call a doctor-- call Gail!

      Lucille grabs her PHONE, dials.

      EXT. AURORA DINER - DAY

      Establishing, we get a sense of the town center here.  A few
      couples walk through town, antiquing, brunching, etc.  Sunday
      drivers pass by lazily.  We favor A CAR that drives up to
      the diner, parks.

      IN THE CAR, A radio plays.  CLOSE ON-- A CELL PHONE VIBRATING
      inside a purse.  REVEAL--

      GAIL GARLAND (30ish, tough, attractive, smart with an
      inquistive nature), in the driver's seat.  She doesn't hear
      the phone over the music.  She sings along to the music
      unconsciously (Doobie Brothers or the like)...

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                      "Whoa-oh-oh, listen to the music..."

      She catches herself, turns off the radio realizing--

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    I hate this song.                                                                                        17.

      INT. AURORA DINER - CONTINUOUS

      Gail enters.  A WAITER greets her--

                                      WAITER
                    Hiya, Gail.  How's tricks?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Just keepin' em real, Len.

                                      WAITER
                    Boo-ya.

      Gail smiles: making nonsensical small talk is their little
      game.  Gail's friend, ELAINE DAWSON (30ish, pretty,
        immaculately put together, has an opinion about everything),
      waves to her--

                                      ELAINE
                    Gail!

      INT. AURORA DINER - A LITTLE LATER

      Gail and Elaine have coffee.  These two have been friends
      since 2nd grade-- but not without their share of ups and
      downs.  Gail gives her a look: really?

                                      ELAINE (O.S.)
                    ...I don't judge, Gail, you know
                    that--
                          (off Gail: really?)
                    And it's nothing against Connor.  
                    I know he's been through a lot and
                    he's a sweetheart.  A little serious
                    for my taste, but a sweetheart.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (snarky smile)
                    Generous of you.

                                      ELAINE
                    Are you at least talking about moving
                    in together?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Sure, right after he pins me at the
                    sock hop.
                          (then)
                    So how about you?  Anything to write
                    home about?

                                      ELAINE
                    As a matter of fact, I have a date
                    this very afternoon.  A fireman.  

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                            (titillated)
                    Really?                                                                                        18.

                                      ELAINE
                    He looks like he should be in a
                    calendar, but it's a profile picture. 
                    What are the odds he's got all his
                    digits?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    You're impossible.

                                      ELAINE
                    I just want a guy who's funny and
                    smart but wouldn't be caught dead in
                    skinny jeans.

      They laugh.  CONNOR CUPIT (30's, intense, sexy, wearing a
      POLICE UNIFORM) comes up to them--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (pleasant surprise)
                    Hey, sweetie.

      Gail gets up, kisses him--

                                      ELAINE
                          (playfully mocking)
                    Hi Con-nor.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Elaine.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (sees his face)
                    What's wrong?

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Your Dad needs you at the clinic. 
                    He was calling you.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    What is it?

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    He didn't say.  But it sounded urgent. 
                    I can take you.

      As Gail grabs her things--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - WAITING AREA - DAY

      Gail and Connor walk toward the back of the clinic.  Sheriff
      Fred stands in the hallway with Bellamy.  Gail sees his face,
      notices Bellamy, gets concerned--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Dad?

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Gail.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        19.

                                      SHERIFF FRED (CONT'D)
                    This is Agent Bellamy, from the
                      Immigrations and Customs Enforcement
                    Agency.

      Bellamy smiles.  Gail looks at him, wondering what his
      relevance is--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Hi, Gail Garland.

      They all head into--

      INT. AURORA MED CLINIC - OUTSIDE EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      GAIL puts on a WHITE LABCOAT as Fred gives her the update--

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    ...The seizure was pretty violent
                    but he seems to to be okay now.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Where did you find this boy?  Who is
                    he?

      Before he can answer, A NURSE appears, hands her a chart--

                                      NURSE
                    Dr. Garland.  I gave the boy a shot
                    of diazepam.  He seems to have stopped
                    seizing for now.  Vitals are good.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (looking at chart)
                    How long did the seizure last?

                                      HAROLD
                    Just over 16 minutes.

      Gail looks up at Harold, surprised to see him--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Uncle Harold?  What are you doing
                    here?

                                      LUCILLE
                          (entering)
                    Gail, thank God.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (confused)
                    Aunt Lucille?

                                      LUCILLE
                    Jacob's had seizures before, of
                    course.  But not usually this bad or
                    this long.  And with everything that's
                    happened we were just terrified--                                                                                        20.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Hold on-- Jacob?  What are you talking
                    about?
                          (off their looks)
                    What's going on here?

      The looks from everybody freak Gail out--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - MINUTES LATER

      Gail, STETHOSCOPE around her neck, washes up at the sink,
      her mind overactive, making a thousand calculations a second
      to process what she's been told moments ago offscreen.  A
      mix of excitement, fascination and disbelief-- both as a
      scientist and potential relative of this boy.

      She takes a seat on a ROLLING STOOL, rolls up next to Jacob,
      who's sitting on the bed.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Okay.  Can you lift your shirt for
                    me, Jacob?

      He does.  Gail puts the stethoscope EARTIPS into her ears. 
      She slips the SMALL DIAPHRAGM of the CHESTPIECE of her
      STETHOSCOPE to Jacobs heart and-- she hears nothing.  She
      moves the chest piece around.  Still nothing.  Holy shit.

      She pulls the chest piece out from under Jacob's shirt.  She
      taps the small diaphragm-- hears nothing.  She taps the LARGE
      DIAPHRAGM.  Hears the finger THUMPS.  She smiles to herself--
      she'd forgotten to turn the SMALL DIAPHRAGM (the pediatric
      one) to the correct position.  She does so now-- rotates it
      so it clicks properly in place.  Taps it-- now hears sound.  

      She slips the chestpiece back into place against his heart. 
      We hear the normal THUMP-THUMP of a child's heart.  Relief.

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    So I heard you had quite an adventure
                    these last few days.

                                      JACOB
                    I guess.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Heard you were all the way in China. 
                    Do you remember how you got there?

      He doesn't answer.  He just stares at her, recognizing
      something.  We hear his HEARTBEAT ACCELERATE.  A look of
      excitement and a touch of fear on his face.  She looks back
      at him, unnerved by his expression.  The way he seems to be
      looking right through her.

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    Jacob?  Are you alright?                                                                                        21.

                                      JACOB
                    You look like my Aunt Barbara.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (stunned)
                    What?

                                      JACOB
                    My uncle Fred's wife.  Did you know
                    her?

      Gail's floored.  Aunt Barbara was her mother.  The mother
      she never knew, who died when Gail was a baby.  

      EXT. BRIDGE OVER A RIVER - DAY - FLASHBACK

      CLOSE ON-- A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.  REVEAL-- a younger SHERIFF
      FRED (early 30's), standing with a very young GAIL (6). 
      Fred points to a spot in the river, presumably where Barbara
      died.  CLOSE ON-- little Gail.  Looking at the spot.  Trying
      to imagine her mother.  Trying to conceive of death.  She
      tosses the Bouquet into the river.  As it floats downsteam--

      INT. MEDICAL OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - PRESENT DAY

                                      JACOB
                    She died.  Right?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I...  what do you mean?  When?

                                      JACOB
                    I tried to help her.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Help her?

                                      JACOB
                    I tried.  But I slipped.  I fell in.

      Gail looks at him, confused, freaked, realizing--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Into the river?

      Jacob nods.  This isn't the version she's heard all her life--

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    You mean you fell in and she went in
                    after you, right?

                                      JACOB
                          (shakes head)
                    He was there, too.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (confused)
                    He?  Who?                                                                                        22.

                                      JACOB
                    The bald man.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                            (spine-tingled)
                    What bald man?

                                      JACOB
                    He was holding her arm and...

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (he looks down, scared)
                    What is it?  Jacob?  Are you afraid
                    of something?

      He's silent again like in Act 1.  She looks at him, not only
      starting to get freaked out by the idea this could really be
      him, but now wondering if there's more to the story she's
      heard her entire life about how her mother died...  A RISING,
      DRAMATIC MUSIC CUE CRESCENDOES and we're--

      INT. BUS (NOT MOVING) - DAY

      SLAM!  A BAG is tossed onto a LUGGAGE RACK, revealing-- a
      YOUNG TATTOOED MAN (20's).  He sits in the aisle seat next
      to an UNSEEN PERSON-- 

                                      TATTOED MAN
                    Where you headed?

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    Aurora.

                                      TATTOED MAN
                    Yeah?  What's in Aurora?

      REVEAL-- A DISHEVELED MAN (40's), wearing a RUMPLED SUIT (no
      tie) and a BASEBALL CAP, sitting in the window seat.  He
      turns to Tattooed Man, the cap mostly hiding his face, like
      he's trying to remain incognito.  It also completely covers
      any hair he might have.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    I got a kid there.

      The bus pulls away, leaving us to wonder: is this the "bald
      man" Jacob was talking about?  And if so, who is he?  The
      angel of death?  Is he somehow the key to this mystery?

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        23.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - WAITING AREA - DAY

      POV-- looking out the window onto the street-- the main street
      in town.  An intersecting street sign reads: "Garland Street."

      REVEAL-- BELLAMY, on his cell phone, looking out the window
      of the clinic, distracted by the Garland name he sees--

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS (THROUGH PHONE)
                    Marty?

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                            (distracted)
                    Yeah.  He seems to be okay.

      Bellamy notices-- Connor, watching him.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                    Then you need to pull him out of
                    there.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I can't.  Not yet.  Jacob wouldn't
                    like that.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                    I don't care.  What if these people
                    do something crazy?  What if his
                    real parents come looking for him?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I can't explain it, Catherine, but I
                    need more time.  I have to get to
                    the bottom of this.

                                    DR. CATHERINE WILLIS
                          (considers, then--)
                    Fine.  Get a DNA test.  When it comes
                    back negative you need to remove the
                    kid.  Understood?

      Bellamy considers this, looks at-- Harold, Lucille, and
      Connor, who are sitting in the waiting area awaiting news of
      Jacob.  How can he explain all that he's seen?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Yeah.

      He hangs up as-- the front door opens.  Bellamy looks up. 
      It's PREACHER TOM HILD (40, a little chunky but handsome in
      a slightly unkempt way, wearing a sweater and slacks.) 
      Physically, Tom's a cross between Paul Giamatti and Gerard
      Butler.  He has an empathetic soul that is irresistable to
      women.  Lucille comes up to him--                                                                                        24.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Tom!  Thank you for coming.  I know
                    you're busy today.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    That's okay.  Is everything alright? 
                    What is it?

                                      LUCILLE
                      A miracle.

      Off Tom's reaction--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - OUTSIDE EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Gail and Fred in mid conversation--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    How could this boy have known all
                    that?  About Mom?  About the drowning?

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    I don't know.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Could any of it be true?

      Fred looks at her, then, as if making a decision, his tone
      hardens--

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    There was no other man.  Jacob fell
                    in.  She went in after him.  They
                    both died.  That's what happened.

      There's edge to Fred's speech.  We get the sense all these
      years later he's still angry about what happened that day.

                                      BELLAMY (O.S.)
                    Is he okay?

      Gail and Fred turn to look at -- Bellamy.  Gail feels a little
      caught, but quickly shifts gears, goes into official doctor
      mode--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Vitals are good, reflexes, everything
                    checks out.  He seems like a normal,
                    healthy boy.

      Bellamy's almost amused; there's nothing normal about this.

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    I took some blood.  Of course we'll
                    run tests.  DNA...

                                      BELLAMY
                    I have contacts in the bureau.  We
                    can call their lab, rush the testing.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        25.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                          (then--)
                    Either of you have any theories about
                    this?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Without test results, I can only
                    assume it's mistaken identity of
                    some kind.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Of course it is.  It has to be.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (shifting gears--)
                    I think you'll both understand the
                    need to keep this under wraps.  Until
                    we get some answers, no one needs to
                    know about any of this.

      Gail and Fred exchange a look.  Fred nods, grudgingly
        appreciating the wisdom of that.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    Is there anything else I should know? 
                    Anything you haven't told me?

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                            (confrontational)
                    There anything you haven't told us?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Sorry?

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    You brought the boy here.  

                                      BELLAMY
                    I assure you, I'm just as in the
                    dark as you.  All I want is the truth.

      Off Fred, accepting, but not entirely believing this.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    I'd like to see any relevant records. 
                    Police reports, autopsy, anything
                    related to Jacob's death.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Deputy Connor will have the blood
                    sample taken to a courier.  We'll
                    deliver it to the lab.

      Gail notes the power play between the men.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - WAITING AREA - DAY

      Lucille and Harold sit on a bench across from Preacher Tom. 
      She's trying to convince him of what's happened--                                                                                        26.

                                      LUCILLE
                    ...You didn't see him, Tom.  Just
                    wait til you see him--

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    I'm only saying we shouldn't jump to
                      conclusions.  Sometimes things appear
                    in this world that are meant to test
                    our faith.

      She looks at him, frustrated.  Not the answer she wanted. 
      Harold just takes this in, an inscrutable look on his face.

      Lucille looks up, sees-- Fred and Bellamy walk to the front
      entrance; Bellamy leaves.  Fred turns the sign on the front
      door of the clinic from "Open" to "Closed."

                                      LUCILLE
                          (worried)
                    What's happening, Fred?

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                      Everything's fine, Lucille.  But
                    it's important we keep this all in
                    the family for now.  

                                      LUCILLE
                    Why?  Is there something wrong with
                    him?

      Gail appears--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    He's fine, Aunt Lucille.  Everything's
                    normal.  He just needs rest.  He'll
                    have to stay here a while.  Connor
                    can take you home--

                                      LUCILLE
                    We'll stay.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (hesitates)
                    It could be several hours.

                                      HAROLD
                          (starts to get up)
                    Alright--

                                      LUCILLE
                          (defiant)
                    No.  I said we'll stay.

      Harold looks at Lucille, then up at Gail.  Harold sits back
      down.  Tension between Harold and Lucille.                                                                                        27.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - DESK AREA - MOMENTS LATER

      Gail and Connor walk and talk on their way to collect the
      blood sample.  Connor's bursting with theories--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    ...Tell you one thing.  I don't trust
                    that fed guy.  He was acting all
                    secretive on the phone.

      Gail stops at the CENTRIFUGE where the blood samples were
      being prepared-- a private spot.  She turns to him--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Connor, there's more layers to this. 
                    Things my aunt and uncle don't even
                    know.  I just don't know where to
                    start--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    I know.  I've been sitting out there
                    with them.  Lucille's completely
                      convinced.  And Harold... he's like,
                      shell-shocked.  It's crazy.  What
                    kind of sick son of a bitch would do
                    a hoax like this?

      She just looks at him, feeling alienated from him right now. 
      How can she share what she knows with him when he's this
      convinced of what's going on?

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (CONT'D)
                    You okay?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (forces a smile)
                    Yeah.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Gail, you're not thinking this could
                    be real?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (hesitates)
                    Of course not.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Then what is it?

      Gail smiles, hands him the sample--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Nothing.  Here.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    I'll call you.  Let me know if you
                    need anything.                                                                                        28.

      He kisses her and walks away.  Off Gail, confused, disturbed,
      wondering what to do--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - WATER COOLER - DAY

      Tom stands at the Water Cooler, downs a cup of water.  

                                      JACOB (O.S.)
                    Who are you?

      Tom turns to see-- Jacob, standing a few feet from him.  By
      the look on Tom's face and his demeanor, he's fascinated but
      by no means convinced this is Jacob--

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    I'm... Tom.  Tom Hild.

                                      JACOB
                          (thinks he's being
                          put on)
                    That's not your name.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                          (amused)
                    It's not?

                                      JACOB
                    No.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    Why not?

                                      JACOB
                    That's my best friend's name.  We
                    like to play G.I. Joe together.

      Off TOM-- the muscles in his face going limp--

      EXT. WOODS - FLASHBACK - DAY

      EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON-- AN EYE.  It moves left and right with
      an eerie smoothness.  Because-- it's not human.  REVEAL--
      It's the eye a G.I. JOE DOLL, held by Jacob.

                                      JACOB (O.S.)
                    Like this.

      REVEAL-- Tom and Jacob play with Jacob's G.I. Joe doll (they
      were 12-inch action figures back then, with "eagle eye
      vision." This hi-tech innovation meant you could move the
      eyes when a lever in the back of the head was moved.)

                                      JACOB (CONT'D)
                    Just move the lever and he can see--
                    even at night.

                                    TOM
                    Wish I had one.                                                                                        29.

      Jacob can see Tom's sad--

                                      JACOB
                    Wanna take it home with you tonight?

                                    TOM
                          (excited)
                    Really?

      It was a simple act of kindness Tom's remembered for 32 years.

                                      JACOB (O.S.)
                    Are you a Priest?

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - WATER COOLER - PRESENT DAY

      Present-day Jacob has asked him the question.  And NOW Tom
      is convinced.  He's speechless, dumbfounded.  Tom looks down
      at-- the pocket BIBLE jutting from his SHIRT.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    I'm... a preacher.

                                      JACOB
                    Did I die?

                                      PREACHER TOM
                          (in a daze)
                    What?

                                      JACOB
                    Did we all die?

                                      PREACHER TOM
                          (disbelieving)
                    I... Jacob?

                                      JACOB
                    How do you know my name?

      As Tom continues to try to process what he's seeing--

                                      NURSE
                    Jacob!  What are you doing out of
                    bed?  Excuse me, Preacher Tom.

      The nurse takes Jacob away.  Tom watches Jacob go, in a daze.

      INT. AURORA MED CLINIC - OUTSIDE EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      As the nurse puts Jacob in bed--

                                      NURSE
                    You had a big morning and the doctor
                    says you need your rest.  Most boys'd
                    be sleeping for days after somethin'
                    like that.                                                                                        30.

      The nurse exits the room, closing the door behind her, a
      little freaked out.  Gail comes up to her--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I'm gonna step out for a bit.  I'll
                    be on my cell.

      But as soon as she walks away, Gail's smiles fades.

      EXT. ELAINE DAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY

      A car pulls up.  Elaine gets out, heads inside to--

      INT. ELAINE DAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY

      CLOSE ON-- A FRAMED PHOTO of Elaine (16) with her arm around
      a man (40's), presumably her father.  They're both smiling
      wide.  We pull back to REVEAL-- SEVERAL more photos of Elaine
      and her father.  Elaine enters--

                                      ELAINE
                    Ray?  I stopped by the pharmacy.

      As she puts her things down she sees-- an array of EMPTY
      DIET COKE CANS on the coffee table, sighs.  RAY DAWSON (30's,
      childish, a bit off) enters.

                                    RAY DAWSON
                    Thanks.  Sorry-- I meant to clean
                    all that up.  Ninja caught another
                    rat.  A big one!  Don't worry, I
                    took it out.  

                                      ELAINE
                    Eugh.  I'm kinda tired and I didn't
                    get a chance to go to the store.  I
                    was thinking we could order in. 
                    Pizza okay?

                                    RAY DAWSON
                    Actually, I'm making tomato sauce.  

                                      ELAINE
                          (pleasantly shocked)
                    What?  Great.

      He smiles, heads into the kitchen.  A KNOCK on the door. 
      Elaine answers.  She's surprised to see--

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D)
                    Gail?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I need to talk to you.

      Elaine can see this is serious--                                                                                        31.

      INT. ELAINE DAWSON'S HOUSE - LATER

      Gail's just told Elaine about Jacob.

                                      ELAINE
                    I don't know what to say, Gail. 
                    There's gotta be an explanation.  I
                    mean that's just not possible, right?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I know.  That's why I feel like I
                    have to look into this.

                                      ELAINE
                    Okay, so what's the problem?

      Gail unexpectedly tears up.

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D)
                    Gail?  Gail, what is it?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I don't know.

      Elaine is disturbed.  She's never seen Gail like this.

                                      ELAINE
                    Are you okay?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    I know how hard it was for you to
                    lose your Dad.  But I never even had
                    a mother.  Seeing this boy... he's
                    my only connection to her.  And I
                    was there.  When they found her.  I
                    was in my carriage... I always felt
                    guilty...

                                      ELAINE
                    Guilty?  Why?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    It's like I thought it was my fault. 
                    Like if she hadn't taken me for a
                    walk that day... maybe everything
                    would be different.  Maybe Dad
                    wouldn't look at me like...

                                      ELAINE
                    Like what?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Like he blames me, too.

      Elaine hugs her, comforting her friend--

                                                                                FADE OUT.

      EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY

      A SIGN on a BUILDING READS: "County Records Office."  Bellamy
      stands with A CLERK (Female, 40's, Asian, overweight, dour). 
      She's got a huge KEY RING, stands in front of the door. 
      Bellamy's in a bit of a tussle with her--

                                      BELLAMY
                    I don't care about your protocol. 
                    This is a federal investigation--
                    are you gonna let me in or not--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Agent Bellamy.
                          (he turns)
                    I wanna help.

      Off Bellamy--

      EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

      Bellamy and Gail talk, away from the Clerk.

                                      BELLAMY
                    And your father knew nothing about
                    Jacob's version of things?  The bald
                    man?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    No.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Well, it's an interesting story. 
                    Not sure it sheds much light on who--
                    or what-- Jacob is.

      But Gail's been thinking about this.  On the other hand...

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    If we want to know the truth about
                    Jacob, seems to me the best place to
                    start is the day he died.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (considers, then--)
                    Okay.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    One more thing.  I'd appreciate it
                    if we could keep my involvement in
                    this between us.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (guessing)
                    Not everybody's as eager to dig up
                    the past as you?                                                                                        33.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Something like that.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Sure.  Let's go.
                          (re: Clerk)
                    But be careful, that one bites.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Tina?  She's a sweetheart.

      Tina smiles at Gail.  Bellamy gives her a nasty look as they
      head into--

      INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - RECORDS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

      As Gail and Bellamy carry a bunch of FILES and old ARTICLES
      from 1981 to a table--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Aurorans have a natural distrust of
                      outsiders.  Goes back to the civil
                    war.  We were a border town in a
                    border state-- everybody thought
                    they knew what was best for us. 
                    North, South, Democrat, Republican...

                                      BELLAMY
                    As long as I don't get lynched.

      She looks at him queerly--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                          (shrugs)
                    I'm a city boy.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (re: the table covered
                            with files)
                    Well, that should get us started.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I'd say.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    So what exactly are we looking for?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Anything unusual about the accident. 
                    Anything that could suggest someone
                    else was at the scene.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Like the bald man?

      Bellamy nods.  They each reach for a file.  Gail looks at
      hers a beat, hesitating to open it.  CLOSE ON-- the label:
      "Barbara Garland - Autopsy report." Bellamy sees her
        hesitation--                                                                                        34.

                                      BELLAMY
                    You ever look at that before?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    No.

      As she carefully opens the file, and opens the past--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - OUTSIDE EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Walking, the nurse holds a CLIPBOARD, makes a notation on
      it, then stops at-- the EXAM ROOM DOOR.  She hesitates there--
      she should probably check on Jacob.  But he freaks her out. 
      She steals herself to go inside, enters--

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      The room is dark.  It takes her eyes a moment to adjust. 
      She walks to Jacob's bed and-- he's fast asleep, eyes closed. 
      Relieved, she gently checks his pulse.  Seems normal.  She
      adjusts the sheets on him and leaves.  

      CLOSE ON-- Jacob.  As soon as the door shuts closed--

      Jacob's eyes POP OPEN-- he was faking being asleep.  It's
      unsettling, a little scary.  As if on a mission, he gets out
      of bed, moves a CHAIR over to below a window, the blind
      closed.  He climbs on the chair, opens the blind and looks
      out the window.  He stands there a beat, on the chair. 
      Staring out the window.  

      JACOB'S POV-- Grass.  Trees.  Woods.  Nothing else.  Why
      this mundane scene is commanding his attention so assiduously
      is unnerving.

      INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - RECORDS AREA - DAY

      Bellamy and Gail.  Bellamy searches through NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
      about the accident.  Gail finishes with Jacob's autopsy report--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Anything in any of those articles?

                                      BELLAMY
                    No, nothing.

      As they both start digging through more files, after a beat--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    You've been quiet.

                                      BELLAMY
                    What's that?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    You're not bursting with opinions? 
                    Theories?                                                                                        35.

                                      BELLAMY
                    One thing I've learned being an
                      investigator all these years.  The
                    weirder the case, the more you gotta
                    stick to the facts.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    The facts?  You mean like an 8 year
                    old boy popping up in rural China
                    with no record of him entering the
                    country?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Some facts you just gotta set aside
                    or they'll drive you crazy.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Sounds wise.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I made a lot of mistakes to earn
                    that wisdom.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    What about coming here?  Was that a
                    mistake?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Why?  You think I can't handle a
                    standard resurrection?

      She can't decide if she finds his humor funny or juvenile.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    I got a big mouth.

      What she really wants to know is: who is he?  What kind of
      man is he?  Something about the way she looks at him pierces
      his armor.  She's not content to stay at the surface of
      things.  It's her nature and her vocation.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    How'd you end up at ICE?

                                      BELLAMY
                    You ask a lot of questions.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Yes.

      They exchange a smile: these two like each other.  Ice broken.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I was a cop.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Yeah?                                                                                        36.

                                      BELLAMY
                    A unit that specialized in crimes
                    against children.  We backed into a
                    human trafficking case.  Ended up in
                    a task force with ICE.  What they
                    did seemed exciting.  So I joined.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                      Delivering an 8-year-old to Missouri
                    exciting, too?

      He looks at her-- she's sharp.  There's more to his story. 
      But he's not ready to share, yet.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Not so bad here.  Seems like a pretty
                    good place to settle down, raise
                    kids.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    If you're into that.

      He smiles, surprised she said that.  Then he notices something
      in a document.  She sees--

                                    GAIL GARLAND (CONT'D)
                    What?

                                      BELLAMY
                    What would you be looking for to
                    indicate someone else was at the
                    accident, medically speaking?

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    If this man held her for some
                    reason...  Unusual contusions,
                      contusions produced pre-mortem, which
                    would be indicated by swelling... 
                    Why?  What are you looking at?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Death scene photos.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Anything there would've been mentioned
                    in the autopsy report, right?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Unless the M.E. missed something.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Like what?

                                      BELLAMY
                    When the ME did an autopsy, he was
                    probably just trying to figure out
                    what killed your mother-- nothing
                    about who else was there, right?                                                                                        37.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Probably.

                                      BELLAMY
                          (shows her photo)
                    These little half-moons on her wrist. 
                    They look unusual to you?

      She looks at it the photo, amazed--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    These look like fingernail
                      indentations.
                          (looks at him)
                    Somebody grabbed her wrist.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - OUTSIDE EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Nurse picks up her CLIPBOARD to write something down but--
      she can't find her PEN.  She looks at the exam room door--
      must have left it inside.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Nurse enters, quietly walks to a TABLE, snatches her pen. 
      As an afterthought, she looks over to check on Jacob but--
      he's not in bed.

      Panic.  She looks up at-- the WINDOW.  It's closed.  Then
      she notices-- the BATHROOM DOOR is closed.  Relief.  She
      goes to the door.  Knocks.

                                      NURSE
                    Jacob.
                          (no response)
                      Everything okay in there?

      Again no response.  She tries the door.  It's locked.  A
      sinking feeling.

      INT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - EXAM ROOM BATHROOM - LATER

      ANGLE ON-- the DOOR.  Suddenly-- BOOM!  It comes crashing
      inwards, knocked off it's hinges-- REVEALING-- SHERIFF FRED. 
      He enters, nurse behind him.

      REVERSE ANGLE-- as Fred searches for him.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Jacob?

      He goes to the shower.  SWIFF-- opens the curtain.  No Jacob.

                                      NURSE
                          (freaked)
                    Where did he go?

      It's a good question.  Did he just vanish into thin air as
      strangely as he came?                                                                                          38.

      Then Fred notices something, on the toilet seat.  He goes
      closer, sees-- little boy SHOEPRINTS.  He looks up at-- the
      WINDOW.  It's ajar.

      EXT. AURORA MEDICAL CLINIC - MOMENTS LATER

      Fred and the Nurse have been looking all around, are just
      giving up.  Fred's on his phone, pacing--

                                    FRED (INTO PHONE)
                    He's gone... I don't know, 20 minutes? 

      A DISCHORDANT MUSICAL CUE RISES AND WE--

      PULL BACK, farther and farther with a VERY LONG LENS until
      we're in-- the woods.  The sense we're in someone's POV, and
      Sheriff Fred is being watched.  Because we are.

      REVERSE ANGLE, REVEALING-- The Disheveled Man from the
      busstop.  Is he coming for Jacob?  Already gotten him?

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                        39.

                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      CONNOR'S POLICE CAR slowy cruises.  IN THE CAR, Connor drives
      while talking into his RADIO.  Harold sits shotgun, looking
      out the window for Jacob, tense--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (INTO RADIO)
                    ...We're heading south on Dover,
                    just north of the Garland's house. 
                    Clear so far--

                                      HAROLD
                    Stop!  
                          (Connor stops)
                    There he is.

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Connor and Harold hop out of the car.

                                      HAROLD
                    Jacob!

      Jacob, in the deep b.g., stops.  Looks back at them.  A beat. 
      Then he turns towards the woods.  He seems torn.  Then, some
      force compelling him, he makes his choice, runs away from
      Harold and Connor towards the woods--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Where's he going?  What's back there?

                                      HAROLD
                    Nothin'.  Nothin' but woods and... 

      Harold looks at Connor.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    What?

                                      HAROLD
                    The river.

      Shit.  They run after him--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - SIDE YARD - DAY

      A few cuts of Connor and Harold running after Jacob, who's
      well off in the distance--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Jacob!

      Jacob runs with determination, purpose.

      CONNOR flies ahead of Harold, as Jacob takes a turn behind
      the house, disappearing from view--                                                                                        40.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (CONT'D)
                    Jacob!

      WITH HAROLD.  Up ahead, Connor disappears from view behind
      the house.  Harold, exhausted, stops to catch his breath. 
      Has to lean over, supporting himself with hands on knees,
      the action triggering a MEMORY HIT--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - SIDE YARD - FLASHBACK

      We're in a TRACKING SHOT, following Jacob (8), running with
      a football as fast as he can, laughing.  The feeling is
      idyllic, pastoral.

      REVEAL-- Harold (30's, athletic, spry, full of energy) running
      after Jacob.  Effortlessly, he catches up to the boy, scoops
      the laughing Jacob up in his arms.  Back to--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - SIDE YARD - PRESENT DAY

      Harold, still catching his breath--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT (O.S.)
                          (calling in distance)
                    Jacob!

      Harold gathers strength, starts running again--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

      Connor's at the edge of the woods, looking around.  Harold
      appears.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    He's gone.

      They look into the woods.  Could they have lost him that
      fast?  Then Harold sees movement by an ANCIENT TREE.

                                      HAROLD
                    Jacob!

      Jacob's reaching into a HOLE in the trunk of the old tree. 
      As if digging for something.  More spooky behavior.  Harold
        approaches--

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    What're you doing, boy?

      He doesn't respond.  They come closer, tension mounting.  

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    What you lookin' for in there?

      Jacob keeps digging, determined.  Then he pulls something
      out of the tree--                                                                                        41.

                                      JACOB
                          (big smile)
                    He's here!

      He triumphantly holds up a 30-year-old tattered, broken G.I.
      JOE DOLL.  He wasn't going to the river at all.  He just
      wanted his doll.  Harold stares at the doll, another memory--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

      A 1978 PORSCHE 911 pulls into the driveway, driver-side window
      open.  REVEAL-- the driver is Harold (30's).  He looks up at--
      the WHITE COLONIAL HOUSE.

                                      JACOB
                    Daddy!

      Jacob's outside the car window.  Jacob opens the driver's
      side door from the outside.

                                      HAROLD
                    Hey, Monkey!

      Jacob hugs him.  Harold grabs-- a PAPER BAG, sitting on the
      passenger seat.

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, now.  I got somethin' for
                    you.  Back up, go on.

      As Jacob gets out of the car, and Harold follows--

                                      JACOB
                    What is it?

      Harold steps of the car and we now see he's wearing-- AN
      EXPENSIVE SUIT.  He's perfectly groomed, in stark contrast
      to the man in present day.  He hands Jacob the bag--

                                      HAROLD
                    Happy birthday.

      Jacob opens it, pulls out-- the G.I. Joe Doll.

                                      JACOB
                    G.I. Joe!  Awesome!  Mommy!  Look
                    what Daddy got me!

      Jacob runs to the open front door where Jacob joins Lucille
      (30's).  Harold watches Jacob and Lucille, smiling--

      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - BACK TO PRESENT DAY

                                      JACOB
                    It's Joe!

      Harold's face turns stern, as if Jacob's voice had rudely
      awaken him from a dream--                                                                                        42.

                                      HAROLD
                    That's his.  That's my son's.

      Connor looks at Harold, surprised by his harshness.  Jacob
      is, too.  He starts to put the doll back in the tree--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    That's okay, Jacob.  You can have
                    it.
                          (to Harold)
                    Right?

      Connor looks at Harold, who catches himself.

                                      HAROLD
                    Yeah.  Sure.

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM - PRESENT DAY

      Jacob sits at the table playing with his G.I. Joe.  Lucille
      removes a CLEAN PLATE from in front of Jacob.

                                      JACOB
                    Can I have another grilled cheese?

                                      LUCILLE
                    Another?  Lord, have you ever seen
                    such an appetite in a boy?  Must've
                    been all that excitement and runnin'
                    around.

      Lucille is in heaven.  She's a born caretaker, and Jacob's
      presence gives her renewed purpose and vigor; she seems 20
      years younger than in the Teaser.  

                                      LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                    Now careful with that dirty thing,
                    don't wanna be gettin' it all over
                    the table cloth.

      Jacob moves the doll from the table.

      Lucille sees her pile of CUE CARDS.  Gathers them up and
      tosses them into the trash.  She looks up, sees-- Harold,
      standing back.  Harold moves to the door.

      Lucille comes up to him, concerned--

                                      LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                    Where are you goin'?

      As Harold grabs his coat, opens the door, leaving just the
      SCREEN door closed.

                                      HAROLD
                    For a walk.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Harold.                                                                                        43.

      She grabs his arm.  He turns to her.  Her eyes are intense.

                                      LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                    I know you're having trouble acceptin'
                    it, but that boy is ours.

                                      HAROLD
                          (looks at her a beat)
                    Well, he seems to be a boy.  But our
                    son died 31 years ago.

      She's angry at him for not sharing her perspective--

                                      LUCILLE
                    That boy deserves our love.  What's
                    wrong with you?

      They hear a SOUND, look up-- Bellamy stands right outside
      the screen door.  Obviously heard that whole exchange.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I heard about the adventure. 
                      Everything okay?

                                      HAROLD
                    Fine now.

                                      BELLAMY
                    Do you mind if I talk to Jacob?

      Harold looks at Lucille, who hesitates, then nods her
      approval.  She heads back to get Jacob.  Bellamy pulls Harold
      aside--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm still responsible for the boy,
                    Mr. Garland.
                          (a threat)
                    I'll take him away right now if you
                    don't want him.

                                      HAROLD
                    I don't.
                          (then)
                    But for her sake... what choice do I
                    have?

      Harold heads off, Bellamy watching him, stunned.  A beat
      while Bellamy considers that.  

      Lucille returns with Jacob, who runs up to Bellamy--

                                      JACOB
                          (happy to see him)
                    Agent Bellamy!
                          (sees Harold walking
                            away)
                    Where's Daddy going?                                                                                        44.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Just for a walk.

                                      JACOB
                    Can I go with him?

      Lucille exchanges a look with Bellamy.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Better stay inside for now, Jacob. 
                    You need your rest.

                                      JACOB
                    But I wanna play outside.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Just for a little longer.  Then you
                    can play outside all you want.  Okay? 

      Jacob nods, sadly.  Lucille feels guilty about making him
      stay inside; Bellamy clocks this.

      REVEAL-- Gail.  Pulling up in her car, watching the family
      drama.  Harold walking away.  Jacob wanting to go after him. 
      Will this family survive Jacob's return?  She makes eye
      contact with Bellamy, who nods.  Gail gets out of the car.

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Bellamy and Gail sit across from Jacob.

                                      BELLAMY
                    I heard you had a visit with Dr.
                    Garland.
                          (Jacob nods timidly)
                    She told me about the day you fell
                    in the river.  Can you tell us
                      everything that happened that day? 
                    Can you tell us what you remember?

                                      JACOB
                    When?

                                      BELLAMY
                    Start at the beginning.

      Jacob glances up at him, Bellamy having finally won his trust
      enough to tell his story.  Off Jacob--

      EXT. WOODS - DAY - FLASHBACK

      Jacob walks by the river.  He picks up a rock, throws it. 
      Then hears-- what sounds like a BABY CRYING.  In the woods
      by the river.  It's disturbing.  

      He parts some bushes, sees-- a BABY CARRIAGE.  Inside, a
      baby.  Little Gail.  By herself.  He stands there a beat,
      staring at her.  Then hears-- SCREAMING.  "Help!  Help!"  He
      runs down to the river.                                                                                        45.

      EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY - FLASHBACK

      Jacob gets to the riverbank, sees-- BARBARA (20's), in the
      water, holding onto a branch jutting from the bank, struggling
      to keep her head above the rushing water.  

                                      BARBARA
                    Jacob!

      Jacob scurries down the bank, carefully climbs out onto the
      branch toward her.

      She's losing her grip.  Jacob gets the farthest point of the
      branch, reaches out, Barbara's just inches too far.  He
      stretches as far as he can, building tension.

      Then-- Barbara slips, and just as she plunges into the water,
      facing certain death-- a HAND comes out and grabs her wrist. 
      The owner of the hand is: a Bald Man.  He's struggling to
      keep hold of Barbara's wrist.

                                    BALD MAN
                          (to Jacob)
                    Run!  Get help!

      Jacob, scared, full of adrenaline, scurries back over the
      log but while he does, slips.  Falls into the water.  Jacob's
      POV-- shooting down the rapids, chaos, rushing water.  Terror.

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - BACK TO PRESENT DAY

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Jacob?  Are you okay?

      Jacob comes out of the memory, nods slowly, terror in his
      eyes.  Bellamy and Gail exchange a look.  They seem changed
      by all they've heard, feeling Jacob's story has the ring of
      truth to it, impossibly.  Gail has a hint of tears in her
      eyes, having been told the story of her mother's death.

      Bellamy's almost afraid to ask-- feeling he may be about to
      get the answer to one of the big questions-- but can't help
      himself--

                                      BELLAMY
                    What do you remember after that,
                    Jacob?

      Jacob looks away, as if searching his mind.  Then--

                                      JACOB
                    Nothing.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Nothing at all?

                                      JACOB
                          (shakes head)
                    I woke up.                                                                                        46.

      Bellamy and Gail react; is Jacob telling the truth?  Or is
      there something about the beyond he won't reveal?

                                      BELLAMY
                    One more question, Jacob.  This man--
                    the bald man.  Did you know him? 
                    Had you ever seen him before?

                                      JACOB
                    I think so.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    Where?

                                      JACOB
                    He's in the picture.  On the patio.

                    Will you show us?
                          (off Jacob)
                    What is it?

                                      JACOB
                    Are you gonna take me away?

      Bellamy's stung, feeling guilty when-- his phone RINGS.  He
      looks at the caller i.d.  Answers--

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                    Bellamy.

                    Marty.  Got those test results for
                    ya.

      Bellamy glances at Gail.

      EXT. HILD HOUSE - DAY

      Establishing.  Tom gets out of his car.  Heads to--

      INT. HILD HOUSE - DAY

      Tom enters the front door, in a daze.  A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
      jumps on him, pawing his thighs.  Tom barely pays attention. 
      The dog whimpers.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    Sorry, boy.  You wanna go out?

      He opens the door and the dog bolts out.  Tom watches him
      run around the yard, chasing a SQUIRREL.

                                      JANINE
                    Tom?  Where were you?

      It's Tom's wife, JANINE (30's, thin, pretty in a plain way).                                                                                        47.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    Look at that animal.  No care to
                    what happens tomorrow.  Or what
                    happened yesterday.  Completely...
                    free.

                                      JANINE
                    Tom, are you alright?  You're scaring
                    me.

      INT. HILD HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

      Tom and Janine sit at the kitchen table.  He's told her all
      about Jacob.  She's trying to take it in--

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    In my heart I know it's him.  And
                    yet... I just can't believe it.

                                      JANINE
                    But everyone has doubts, right? 
                    Nobody knows what this is.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    It's different for me.

                                      JANINE
                    Why?

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    I've been preaching about God's
                    miracles for a decade.  But if I
                    can't believe one that's right before
                    my eyes... how can I believe the
                    rest?  How can I preach in front of
                    all those people tonight?  I feel
                    like... I'm a fraud.

      Janine can see he's in pain, has some advice for him--

                                      JANINE
                    You're missing the bigger picture,
                    Tom.

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    What's that?

                                      JANINE
                    You don't need to have all the
                    answers.  That's not your job.  You
                    just need to comfort those who have
                      questions.

      Off Tom, considering this--

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Lucille's at the counter, cutting the CRUSTS off another
      GRILLED CHEESE--                                                                                        48.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Now this is your absolute last
                    sandwich today.  You're gonna turn
                    into a stick o' butter--

      She goes to dump the crusts in the garbage, sees-- on top of
      the garbage are the discarded crusts of at LEAST 7 or 8
      grilled cheese sandwiches.  She'd lost track of exactly how
      much he was eating and now that she sees it, she's freaked
      out.  But she doesn't want to think about that-- she quickly
      shuts the garbage door: out of sight, out of mind.  

      INT. GARLAND HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

      Jacob finishes the sandwich while Lucille talks and KNITS--

                                      LUCILLE
                    ...You can have whatever you like. 
                    Just none of those awful baggy pants
                    with the underwear showing like the
                    teenagers do these days...

                                      JACOB
                    Mommy?

      She looks up.  Sees he's bothered about something.

                                      LUCILLE
                    What is it?

                                      JACOB
                    Why is everything different?

                                      LUCILLE
                    What do you mean?  Like what?

                                      JACOB
                    Like Daddy.

                                      LUCILLE
                    What about him?

                                      JACOB
                    Why won't he play with me?  Am I
                    sick?

      She's afraid he feels like a freak.  She answers with the
      viscious protectiveness of a mother lion--

                                      LUCILLE
                      Absolutely not.  There's not a thing
                    wrong with you.

                                      JACOB
                    Then why can't I play outside?  Why
                    can't I see people?

      Lucille's heart is breaking for this boy.  As she
      unconsciously fingers the CROSS around her neck--                                                                                        49.

                                      LUCILLE
                    You're right.  There's nothing' wrong
                    with you, so there's no reason you
                    should be couped up in here like a
                    hen.  Grab your coat.  We're goin'
                    out.

      INT. AURORA COMMUNITY BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

      Tom stands at the podium, preaching to a crowded nave--

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    ...So even John had doubt.  And how
                    did Jesus respond?  By personally
                      reassuring him?  No.  He told John's
                    disciples to go to John and to remind
                    him of the miracles they had seen--

      Tom looks up and something stops him dead in his tracks--
      Lucille and Jacob have just entered the back of the nave. 
      Everybody turns to see what Tom's looking at.

                                      LUCILLE
                    Hello, Tom.  Hello, everybody.  I'd
                    like you all to meet Jacob.  He'll
                    be a new congregant here.
                          (then)
                    You may proceed, Tom.

      Lucille and Jacob look for a seat.  Murmurings, confusion
      are heard around the room: "Jacob?,"  "Who's Jacob?," Etc.

      And as Jacob makes eye contact with Tom, Tom suddenly
      speechless, his words ringing hollow to him now...

                                      PREACHER TOM
                    Uh...

      Tom is sweating, looking through the notes of his prepared
      sermon, clearing his throat, searching for some words, any
      words, that can feel real to him now...

                                      PREACHER TOM (CONT'D)
                    ...These miracles that John... why
                    did John, uh...?

      And now the murmurings are starting to increase again. 
      "What's going on?" "Is he okay," etc.?  Tom looks at Jacob,
      now seated.  He's too distracted by this miracle right in
      front of him to talk about what's in an old book.

      He glances at Janine, who's staring back at him, as if willing
      all her strength into him right now.  And then something
      shifts in Tom; he lets go of something, some burden--

                                      PREACHER TOM (CONT'D)
                    I don't know.                                                                                          50.

      More confused murmurs from the congregants.  Tom's almost
      surprised he said it.  But it felt good.  Because it was the
      truth.  He decides to go with it--

                                      PREACHER TOM (CONT'D)
                    That's the truth, isn't it?  We don't
                    know the answers to the big questions. 
                    Not even John knew how he got here
                    on this Earth.  Why he was chosen. 
                    How long he'd get to stay.
                          (then, confidence
                            building)
                    He was human, like us.  And like us,
                    he was given the tools to ask the
                      questions, but not to know the
                    answers.  It may seem cruel sometimes,
                    but isn't that the price of human
                      understanding?  Isn't that what it
                    means to have faith?

      Tom catches the eye of-- Janine.  She's beaming, so proud of
      him right now.  He smiles back, grateful-- it was her advice
      he took.

      EXT. AURORA PARK - LATER AFTERNOON

      CLOSE ON-- AN ANGEL.  A STONE ANGEL, that is.  Widen to REVEAL--

      There are actually 2 ANGELS.  And they're holding up-- A
      BOY.  It's a statue of Jacob, all part of--

      A GIANT MAUSOLEUM, maybe 12 feet high, and 12 feet by 12
      feet wide.  There's also a WOMAN statue featured at the doors
      of the mausoleum, depicting BARBARA GARLAND.  REVEAL--

      Harold, standing at the foot of the thing.  Bellamy appears
      holding a PHOTO--

                                      BELLAMY
                    We have to talk, Mr. Garland.

      Harold turns to him.  Bellamy points to a Bald Man in the
      background of the PHOTO from Act 2--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    I had a conversation with Jacob.  He
                    told me things about the day at the
                    river.  Told me about a man.  This
                    man.
                          (shows him the photo)
                    Do you know him?

                                      HAROLD
                    Maybe.  I think he was a carpenter
                    at Garland Furniture for a time. 
                    Why?                                                                                        51.

                                      BELLAMY
                    His name is Edward Napier-- I looked
                    up the photo credit.  His current
                      whereabouts are unknown, but back
                    then he had a hunting shack near the
                    river.  Jacob said he tried to save
                    Barbara.  I don't know why he never
                    came forward, but the thing is, the
                    story Jacob told about this man being
                    there checks out.

      As Harold tries to comprehend what he's saying--

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    That's not all.  The DNA test came
                    back.
                          (then)
                    Some how, some way... biologically
                    speaking this is your son, Mr.
                    Garland.

      Harold takes that in, his eyes half closing in anguish.

                                      BELLAMY (CONT'D)
                    But you knew that all along, didn't
                    you?  From the moment you first saw
                    him.  You just didn't want to believe
                    it.

                                      HAROLD
                    Believe what?  The impossible?

                                      BELLAMY
                    I can only imagine how this feels--

                                      HAROLD
                    No, you can't.  How could you?  No
                    one could.

                                      BELLAMY
                    So tell me, Mr. Garland.  Help me
                      understand why you don't want your
                    son back.

      CLOSE ON-- Harold, facing the pain of that question.  SFX--
      the SOUND OF RUSHING WATER rising, building in volume and
      intensity, as if in his head, echoing Jacob in the Teaser--

      EXT. RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON

      The infamous AURORA RIVER.  The rapids are fast but it doesn't
      look all that dangerous.  More peaceful.  Harold and Bellamy
      stand on a BRIDGE above the water-- the same bridge in Gail's
      flashback.  Harold's brought him here.

                                      HAROLD
                    Doesn't look all that dangerous, I
                    know.  But it's deep.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        52.

                                      HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Way deeper'n it looks.  That's why
                    the current's so strong.
                          (then)
                    It took me the better part of three
                    decades to get through Jacob's
                    passing.  To get to the point where
                    I stopped thinking of him everyday. 
                    Of his laugh.  His hair.  A joke I'd
                    like to tell him.  Three decades to
                    heal all those wounds.  And now... 
                    Every gesture, every word reminds me
                    of the life I could have had.  The
                    life I should have...
                          (getting emotional)
                    It's cruel...

      Bellamy considers that, then--

                                      BELLAMY
                    When you lose someone... it can be
                    hard to find your place in the world
                    again.  To give yourself to a world
                    that's taken so much away... it's
                    easy to retreat to a life that's
                    safe.  Easy.

      Bellamy's talking about himself, too.

                                      HAROLD
                    Guess I've lived that way for a long
                    time.
                          (then)
                    So what now?

                                      BELLAMY
                    That depends.

                                      HAROLD
                    On what?

                                      BELLAMY
                    My bosses don't know what I know. 
                    They haven't seen the way he looks
                    at you.  At Lucille.  How much he
                    needs you.

      Harold nods, knowing that's true, feeling guilty--

                                      HAROLD
                    I know.

                                      BELLAMY
                    But if I'm gonna put my ass on the
                    line for him you need to step up,
                    too.  You need to be strong.  If not
                    for your sake then for Lucille's. 
                    For Jacob's.                                                                                        53.

                                      HAROLD
                          (a man at his breaking
                            point)
                    I don't know if I can.

      Off Bellamy, considering that--

      EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY EVENING

      Fred exits, walks up to his car.  Looks up-- Harold is there. 
      Leaning against the car.

                                      HAROLD
                    There's somethin' I need to tell
                    you.  Something' I shoulda told you
                    a long time ago.  It's about Barbara.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Okay.

                                      HAROLD
                    There was a man.  A carpenter who
                    worked at Garland Furniture.  His
                    name was Ed Napier.  Jacob says this
                    man was there at the accident.  Said
                    he tried to save her.  I believe
                    that's true.

                                      SHERIFF FRED
                    Why?  If this man was there why didn't
                    he ever say something?

                                      HAROLD
                          (hesitates)
                    Because he was sleeping with her.
                          (then)
                    I'm sorry.

      Off Fred, the memory of his wife collapsing all around him--

      EXT. AURORA - LATE AFTERNOON - DAY

      A beautiful old WINDMILL spins by the river, its purpose no
      longer practical; a reminder of changing times--

      EXT. GARLAND HOUSE - FRONT YARD - EVENING

      Gail's car drives up to the house.  She gets out.  Walks up
      to-- Bellamy.  He gives her a slight, reassuring smile. 
      They watch as-- 

      Lucille pushes Jacob in a rope swing, hanging from a tree.
      Jacob is glad to no longer be trapped inside.  Lucille is
      elated as ever to be with him.

      Harold joins them, giving Lucille a cautious smile.  We have
      the sense it's not going to be easy, but they're gonna try
      to make this work.                                                                                        54.

      REVEAL-- Fred watches the strange reunited family from a
      distance, inside his car.  An inscrutable look on his face. 
      He drives away.  Off Gail, concerned, watching him go, a
      MUSIC CUE begins--

      INT./EXT. VARIOUS - NIGHT - MONTAGE

      Where we watch the effect of Jacob's return on our main
      players...

      TOM, at home, stares at-- his Bible.  He's glad to have won
      the battle in church, but wonders how he'll get through this
      crisis of faith.  Janine watches him from the b.g., concerned
      about him and their future...

      GAIL knocks on a door of a HOUSE, a worried look on her face. 
      Receiving no answer, she walks away.  

      We move INSIDE THE HOUSE Gail just walked away from, where--
        a half-empty bottle of whiskey sits on a table.  REVEAL -
      FRED, sitting behind it.  Despondent.  He's looking at--
      PHOTOS of him and his young wife.  Along with newspaper
      clippings.  A headline reads: "Sheriff's Wife Dies Trying to
      Save Garland Child."  There's a terrible sadness in him. 
      But also a rage beneath that sadness.  It's clear he's still
      angry.  At God?  At Jacob for bringing all of this up again,
      besmirching the memory of his beloved wife?

      He suddenly stands, grabbing the bottle, and throws it--
      smashing it against the wall.  Is this man dangerous?

      LUCILLE shows Jacob to his "room."  She hands him a new toy -
      an updated version of his old G.I. Joe (perhaps Buzz
      Lightyear).  He loves it.  Harold watches from the door, a
      slight smile.

      END MONTAGE.  The sound of LAUGHTER takes us into--

      INT. BAR - NIGHT

      Connor, Gail and Elaine are drunk, coming off the laugh,
      trying to forget the weirdness of the day.  Connor shakes
      his head, stares into his beer--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    What a crazy day.

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                          (reminded)
                    Wait, weren't you supposed to have a
                    date today?  The fireman?

                                      ELAINE
                    Bastard cancelled-- said he had some
                      emergency.  The liar.  I told him
                    not to call me again.  Men.

      She takes a swig.  Connor realizes--                                                                                        55.

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    Elaine, that's real.

                                      ELAINE
                    What?

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    There was like a huge fire near Indian
                    Village.  I heard it on the police
                    radio.

                                      ELAINE
                    Really?

      They laugh.  Elaine gets a call.  Check the i.d.  Sighs--

                                      ELAINE (CONT'D)
                    It's my brother.  What now?
                          (answers)
                    Hey, Ray...?
                          (it's bad)
                    What?  Calm down, I'll be right there.

      EXT. BAR - NIGHT

      Bellamy stands outside the bar, on the phone with Dr. Willis--

                                      BELLAMY (INTO PHONE)
                      ...Everything's under control,
                      Catherine...
                          (lying)
                    He's still at the clinic.  I'm gonna
                    check into a B&B, hang around a few
                    days to monitor the situation... No. 
                    No test results, yet.  I'll keep you
                    updated.

      He hangs up as-- Gail, Connor and Elaine pour out of the bar--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                          (urgent)
                    My car's there--

                                      BELLAMY
                    Dr. Garland--

                                    GAIL GARLAND
                    It's her brother.  He's off his meds. 
                    He's got a gun.

      EXT. DAWSON HOUSE - NIGHT

      Gail, Connor, Elaine and Bellamy run up to-- Ray Dawson,
      eyes WILD, standing outside a tool shed, holding a SHOTGUN--

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (to shed)
                    Don't you do anything stupid now, ya
                    hear?                                                                                        56.

                                      ELAINE
                    Ray!  What are you doing?  Who's in
                    there?

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (excited)
                    The demon!  Got him trapped!  Right
                    inside the shed!

                                      ELAINE
                    Calm down, Ray--

                                      CONNOR CUPIT
                    It's gonna be alright.  Just put
                    down the gun down.

                                    RAY DAWSON
                          (realizing)
                    You don't believe me.  None a you.

      He opens the door, bangs the shed with the butt of his gun--

                                    RAY DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Show y'self, Demon!  Come on out,
                    now!

      After a beat, a man steps out.  It's the Disheveled Man.  He
      slowly lifts his head, takes off his hat-- he's NOT BALD.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    Hi, Elaine.

      Elaine looks at him, gasps, scared, backing away.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN (CONT'D)
                    It's okay.

                                      ELAINE
                    No.

                                      DISHEVELED MAN
                    Elaine.  It's okay.  It's me.

                                      ELAINE
                          (softening; emotional)
                    Dad?

      This isn't the Bald Man Jacob saw.  Her father.  Who died 13
      years ago.  This thing hasn't ended.  It's only just begun. 
      Off everyone's reactions--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

      After a beat, A WHITE TITLE CARD appears, with a bass-heavy
      THUMP:  "The Returned".  Another beat and-- the card
      disappears, plunging us back into darkness.  Some might wonder
      if it ever appeared at all or if they just imagined it.

                                      END PILOT
