      The campus of a large but humble community college a few 
      miles from your home.  Cambridge bells chime.

      Actually, the bells are playing on an old boom box, which is 
      now stopped by Dean PELTON [40s, rotund], who is holding a 
      microphone hooked up to it.  He is on a small stage at the 
      front of the courtyard.

      He starts to speak into the microphone, realizes it s not 
      working and fiddles with the boombox switches.  He begins to 
      speak, but a Busta Rhymes cd starts playing instead:

                                  BUSTA RHYMES
                          (on cd)
                    Yo.  I m high as hell right now, 
                    and I m about to bust your ass 
                    open, but first -

      Pelton, an apparently humorless man, frantically figures out 
      how to stop the cd, then addresses the students.

                                  PELTON
                    Good morning.  Many of you are 
                    halfway through your first week 
                    here at Greendale and, as dean, I 
                    thought I would share a word of 
                      inspiration.

      Pelton reads from a small stack of index cards:

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    What is Community College?  Well, 
                    you ve heard all kinds of things.  
                    You ve heard it s  loser college  
                    for young people who couldn t make 
                    the cut at a university.  

      ANNIE [18, tightly wound, sweater vest] is walking through 
      the courtyard when she hears this, causing her to stop.

      TROY [18, letter jacket, All American], is seated on a bench 
      with a breakfast burrito.  He looks up, a little put-off.

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    It s  halfway school  for 
                      twentysomething dropouts, crawling 
                    back to society with unskilled 
                    tails between their legs.                                                                                       2.

      BRITTA [late 20s, sweatshirt, pony tail, unadorned and 
        accidentally hot], is interrupted in her confident stride by 
      what she s hearing.  She stops and looks as if called by 
      name.

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                      A tax-funded self esteem workshop 
                    for newly divorced housewives 
                    piecing together shattered 
                      identities, 

      SHIRLEY [early 40s, shy, modest 90s attire], was briskly 
      crossing the courtyard, eyes cast downward.  She stops and 
      looks toward the stage.

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    and old people hoping to keep their 
                    minds active as they circle the 
                    drain of eternity.

      PIERCE [50s, prescription sunglasses, turtleneck, sport 
      jacket], was talking to a group of young people, but stops.

      In fact, Pelton now has the undivided attention of most of 
      the pedestrians in the courtyard.  

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    That s what you ve heard.  However:

      He flips to the next index card.

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    I wish you luck.  Wait -

      Confused, Pelton flips through his cards as the slightly 
      deflated students resume their activity.  Pelton calls out to 
      them.

                                  PELTON (CONT D)
                    There was... a middle part of that 
                    speech, if you see a card...

      Walking amongst the rest of the students and not thrilled to 
      be doing so: JEFF Crocker, [30s, well dressed, dashing but 
      rough around the edges].  He is paced and orbited by ABED 
      [20s, Arabic,  geek chic  Weezer fan clothes], who seems 
      generally intrigued by everything all the time.

                                  ABED
                    I m only half Arabic, actually, my 
                    Dad is Palestinian, I mean, he s a 
                    U.S. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      3.

                                  ABED (CONT'D)
                    Citizen and he s not a threat to 
                    national security or anything, a 
                    lot of people want to know that 
                    after they meet him, because he has 
                    an angry energy, but not like angry 
                    at America, just angry at my Mom 
                    for leaving him, although she did 
                    leave because he was angry, and he 
                    was angry because she was American.  
                    My name s Abed, by the way.

                                  JEFF
                    Abed, nice to know you, and then 
                    meet you, in that order.  Now about 
                    that question I had.

                                  ABED
                    Oh.  
                          (looks at watch)
                    Five after eleven.  When you asked.

                                  JEFF
                    Thanks.  I ll talk to you in a few 
                    months, if that s cool. 

                                  ABED
                    Oh.  Few months.  Okay.

      Abed starts to walk away but Jeff puts a hand on his 
      shoulder.

                                  JEFF
                    Hey, let me ask you.

      Jeff pulls Abed closer and indicates someone in the distance: 
      It s Britta, heading into the cafeteria.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    The hot girl from Spanish class, 
                    what s her deal, I can t find a 
                    road in there.

                                  ABED
                    Well, I ve only talked to her once 
                    while she was borrowing a pencil, 
                    but her name s Britta, she s 28, 
                    birthday in October, she has two 
                    older brothers and one of them 
                    works with children who have a 
                    disorder I might want to look up.  
                    Oh, and she thinks she s going to 
                    flunk tomorrow s quiz so she really 
                    needs to focus and she s sorry if 
                    that makes her seem cold.                                                                                      4.

                                  JEFF
                    Abed, I see your value, now.

                                  ABED
                    That s the nicest thing anyone s 
                    ever said to me.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A motley crew of would-be athletes are trying out for the 
      apparently all-ages track team.  Currently, a ninety year old 
      man is prepping himself on the starting line.

      Jeff and Duncan are standing out in the middle of the field.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    I could get fired for having this 
                      conversation, so act like you re 
                    watching the athletic proceedings.

                                  JEFF
                    You couldn t stop me from watching.  
                    There is a man trying out for your 
                    track team that is older than the 
                    game of poker.
                          (noticing)
                    And he s kinda truckin .

                                  DUNCAN
                    Suppose I did feel indebted to you, 
                    Jeff.  And suppose I said it was 
                    possible to get you these answers.  

                                  JEFF
                    I d say go for it.  And, for future 
                      reference, you can ask me stuff 
                    like that way closer to wherever 
                    we re originally standing. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    I m asking if you understand the 
                      difference between right and wrong.                                                                                      13.

                                  JEFF
                      I understand  right  and  wrong  
                    are slippery slopes that end with 
                      presidents who don t believe 
                    dinosaurs existed.  And I ve 
                      understood since I was a kid that 
                    if I talked long enough, I could 
                    make anything true.  So either I m 
                    God or truth is relative, and in 
                    either case: booyah. 

                                  DUNCAN
                      Interesting.  The average person 
                    has a harder time saying  booyah  
                    to moral relativism.  

                                  JEFF
                    Ian, you don t have to play shrink 
                    to protect your pride, I accept 
                    that you re a chicken. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you trying to use reverse 
                      psychology on a psychologist?  

                                  JEFF
                    I m just using normal psychology on 
                    a pussy.

                                  DUNCAN
                    You can t talk to me that way!

                                  JEFF
                    A six year old girl could talk to 
                    you that way!

                                  DUNCAN 
                    Because it would be adorable!

                                  JEFF
                    No, because you re a five year old 
                    girl, and there s a pecking order!

                                  DUNCAN
                    FINE, I LL DO IT!

                                  COACH BARTEL (O.S.)
                      - Gentlemen.

      COACH BARTEL [stocky, 40s] is approaching their exchange.                                                                                    14.

                                  COACH BARTEL (CONT D)
                    This is an athletic field, not a 
                    rehearsal of Glengarry Glen Ross, 
                    and I should know, because I run 
                    both the Sports and Theatre 
                      departments.  Take it elsewhere.

      Jeff and Duncan start walking off the field together.  Coach 
      Bartel calls after them:

                                  COACH BARTEL (CONT D)
                    Either of you guys play football?  
                    It s looking that bad this year.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff enters the parking lot, looking around.

                                  DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Hello, Jeff.

      Duncan emerges from between two cars, holding a large, thick 
      envelope.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Every answer to every test in your 
                      curriculum this semester.

                                  JEFF
                    You are the best.                                                                                      22.

      Jeff reaches for the package.  Duncan withholds it.

                                  DUNCAN
                    But what do I get?

                                  JEFF
                    I thought we had a deal.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Deals are bound by ethics, Jeff.  
                    Deals are for five year old girls.

                                  JEFF
                    What do you want.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Your Lexus.

                                  JEFF
                    HA!  My luxury sedan for a 
                      semester s worth of answers?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Come on, you re never going to stop 
                    taking the easy way out.  I ll be 
                    helping you for four years.  You 
                    want to get a degree while taking 
                    naps?  I want leather seats with 
                    built-in ball warmers.  Offer 
                    expires in ten seconds.

                                  JEFF
                    I m supposed to do what, walk home?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Take my Prius.

      Duncan holds up some keys.

                                  JEFF
                    PRIUS?

                                  DUNCAN
                    It s good for the Earth.

                                  JEFF
                    So is wiping your butt with a leaf  
                    but it s not how a man gets around!

                                  DUNCAN
                    Time s up.

      Duncan starts to walk away.  Jeff panics.                                                                                    23.

                                  JEFF
                    Alright!

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff exits the front doors, miffed, sour grapey, opening 
      Duncan s packet.

      He gets the envelope open and pulls out a stack of papers 
      from inside.  He looks at them, stunned.

      We watch as Jeff flips through a stack of pages from old 
      Psychology Today magazines.   

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff stomps across the empty night time campus of Greendale 
      community college.  So fucked.

      He sees the Old Black Woman sitting on one of the benches 
      that is just outside the library entrance.  He starts walking 
      to her.  She s clearly bummed out about this.  He stands by 
      her for a moment, mustering the confession:

                        JEFFOLD BLACK WOMAN
      I don t know how to do it.I don t care.

      She gets up.

                                  JEFF
                    Where are you going?

                                  OLD BLACK WOMAN
                          (sarcastic)
                    Don t you know, honey child?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    I gots to go polish that moon and 
                    hang them clouds out to dry.  But 
                    don t you worry.  Outer space Jesus 
                    negro lady is watching over you.

      Jeff slumps down on the bench as she walks away.

                                  JEFF
                    Great.  Even God thinks I m a dick.

      He sits there for a moment.  Puts his head back.

      Pierce emerges from the library s front doors, sees Jeff, and 
      pauses to take in the night air.

                                  PIERCE
                    Boy.  There is Autumn, and then 
                    there is just Fall.

                                  JEFF
                    You may have purchased a knockoff 
                    calendar.

                                  PIERCE
                    You said some nice things about me 
                    up there, Jeffrey. 

      Pierce sits on another bench across from him.

                                  PIERCE (CONT D)
                    And I do admit, I ve got things to 
                    learn about the ladies.  You know 
                    I ve been married seven times?  I m 
                    starting to think I m doing 
                    something wrong.

                                  JEFF
                    Do I look like I m in a position to 
                    give romantic advice right now?

      Troy comes out of the library, sees them both and nods.

                                  TROY
                    Hey.

                                  JEFF
                    I thought you guys were studying.

                                  TROY
                    We re done.  

                                  JEFF
                    Oh.  That was fast.

      Troy sits next to him, curious.                                                                                    31.

                                  TROY
                    Let me ask you something.  People 
                    have been clowning me about this 
                    jacket since I got here.  But if I 
                    take it off to make them happy, I m 
                    weak, right?

                                  JEFF
                          (shrug)
                    Troy, what s it matter.  You lose 
                    the jacket to please them, you keep 
                    it to piss them off...either way, 
                    it s for them, that s what s weak. 

                                  TROY
                          (epiphany)
                    Whoa.
                          (bigger epiphany)
                    Whoa.
                          (confusion)
                    Wait, but -
                          (realization)
                    Whoa!

                                  PIERCE
                    He s good, isn t he?

                                  TROY
                    My brain s all wrinkly.

      Jeff doesn t necessarily mind the praise, but he s still got 
      wallowing to do.  

      Shirley and Annie come through the doors together.  Annie 
      stops when she sees the boys sitting together.

                                  ANNIE
                    Is this another  we hate Annie  
                    meeting?

                                    SHIRLEY
                    Oh, sweetie.  Nobody hates you.  
                          (catching it)
                    Sorry I called you sweetie, it s a 
                    mother s habit -

                                  ANNIE
                    - It s not that bad, really.  
                          (almost crying)
                    My parents, um -
                          (clears throat)
                    This is interesting architecture.

      Abed and Britta come through the library doors.                                                                                    32.

                                  ABED
                    Oh, hey, everybody.

      Britta is not excited to see Jeff.

                                  BRITTA
                    Shouldn t you be at home rolling 
                    around on a bed covered with quiz 
                    answers?

      Jeff tosses the envelope to her.  She looks at the contents.

                                  BRITTA (CONT D)
                    Ha!  Live by the sword, huh Amigo?
                            (explaining)
                    Amigo means  friend.   You might 
                    need to know that for tomorrow.

      Jeff nods, resigned to his fate.

                                  JEFF
                    I want to say something.

      Jeff starts to say something.  Then stops.  He gets a weird 
      look on his face.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    But nothing I say is true, so...I 
                    can t...

      He struggles.  Then, finally:

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I need help.

      He buries his face in his hands.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    I m gonna flunk.  I need help.

      The group looks around at each other.  Mostly, they re all 
      looking at Britta.

      Shirley looks at Britta with a face that says  do something. 

      Britta looks at Shirley with a  What?  Me?  face.  She 
      indicates Jeff and makes a gagging gesture.

      Shirley makes a gesture that means  give me a break and maybe 
      also get over yourself because there are worse things in the 
      world than men making asses of themselves over you. 

      Troy gestures insistently.  So does Pierce.  Abed is 
      confused.                                                                                    33.

                                  ABED
                    What s going on?  Can you guys hear 
                    me?  Am I deaf?

      Jeff looks up, curious to see what Abed is talking about. 
      Britta makes a decision.  She addresses the group.

                                  BRITTA
                    Hey, um.  We should, um.
                          (clears throat)
                    We should get back upstairs, and 
                    finish, right?

      Jeff is confused.

                                  JEFF
                    I thought you were done.

                                  BRITTA
                    Who said that?  Are we done?

                                  PIERCE
                    I m not done.

      Everyone agrees they re not done.  Abed is more confused.

                                  BRITTA
                    Well, let s go.  Jeff, you coming?

      Jeff is taken aback by the offer.

                                  JEFF
                    Are you serious?  I can study with 
                    you guys?

                                  BRITTA
                    Eh.  You know.  If you want.  I 
                    don t care.

      Jeff stands up, recovering from his depression.

                                  JEFF
                    That s the nicest thing anyone s 
                    ever said to me.

      The group heads back for the library entrance as we pull back 
      in a crane shot that, like this campus, packs a lot of 
      emotional punch for a reasonable price.


                                                                          FADE OUT.
