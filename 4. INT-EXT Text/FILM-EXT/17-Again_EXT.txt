A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed
by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net.
Opulent HOMES.
OCEAN views.
Luxury CARS.
Manicured LAWNS.
The sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as WE settle
in on a large, MEDITERRANEAN STYLE HOUSE.
Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level
building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'.
Mike pulls into the empty parking lot, climbs out of his car
and into the building.
Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and
Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain.
MIKE
Is your mom home?
ALEX
She's probably out back.
MIKE
Hey, next week we'll have a
barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound
good?
MAGGIE
I'm counting down the minutes.
Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside.
MIKE
What's with her?
ALEX
We see you once a week for a couple
hours. What do you expect?
Alex follows Maggie into the house.
Mike makes his way
around back.
As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom
Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags.
13.
DOM
Hey, Mike. Good to see you.
Tough
break, you and Scarlet.
MIKE
Bite me, Dom.
Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on.
Mike scowls.
Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it
beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.
MIKE (CONT'D)
A little late for a delivery isn't
it?
SCARLET
Dom was in the neighborhood. He
offered to make a dump run for me.
MIKE
Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
SCARLET
What's your point?
MIKE
Come on. He's been after you since
10th grade and he's after you now.
SCARLET
At least someone's after me.
Mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade-
MIKE
`In touch with the ground, I'm on
the hunt I'm after you.'
Scarlet shakes her head-
SCARLET
Please, Mike. This isn't high
school. That's not gonna work.
MIKE
`Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a
crowd, and I'm hungry like the
wolf.'
Mike flirtatiously stalks her.
Scarlet fights smiling.
14.
SCARLET
You can stop now. It's not
working.
MIKE
`Mouth is alive, with juices like
wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'
Mike gets close to Scarlet's face. She smiles, stops herself
and pushes him away.
SCARLET
You no longer have the right to
invoke the "wolf."
A chastised Mike eyes the yard...it's a WRECK...holes and
mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes
and flowers strewn about.
MIKE
Why are you destroying the yard?
Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.
SCARLET
I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for
clients. Thanks for asking.
MIKE
Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
SCARLET
I am a landscape designer. Then
again you barely took an interest
in my work so I guess that's a fair
question.
An awkward silence.
Then-
MIKE
I didn't get it.
SCARLET
I'm sorry. But maybe this is what
you needed. Maybe it's time you
looked for something else?
MIKE
That's a great idea, Scar. Because
there are so many options out there
for a 36 year old with only a high
school diploma.
15.
Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.
SCARLET
And it's all my fault, isn't it?
MIKE
I didn't say that.
SCARLET
No, but it's what you think, right?
Mike's silence says it all.
Scarlet fights back tears.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
I never asked you to marry me.
MIKE
But I did.
Scarlet shakes her head in frustration.
SCARLET
I'm sorry you're not happy with the
way your life turned out Mike,
really, I am, but you're not the
victim here.
Scarlet goes back to shoveling.
Mike turns, steps, falls
into a hole.
MIKE
Hey!?
Get away from there!?
16.
Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing. The
Janitor's GONE.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Oh no!!
Hello!?
Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down...
The phosphorescent water swirls angrily...rising quickly.
It's mesmerizing. Magical. Mike can't take his eyes off-
LIGHTENING FLASHES Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares
back up at him.
MIKE (CONT'D)
What the-
CRACK. The railing BREAKS.
Mike FALLS...SPLASH...headlong
into the river.
CUT TO:
Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway. The door swings open.
A muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but
in no better shape.
WE follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement,
to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching-
MIKE
Damn it.
(pushes doorbell)
Ed! Ed! I lost my key!
ED
My theory is that you were
transformed by a freak congruence
of some of the planets most
volatile elements. I've recreated
the exact contents of the LA River.
The toxic pollutants, the
contaminants.
REVEAL Mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub.
MIKE
Well, it obviously isn't working.
19.
ED
That's because the cocktail's not
complete.
Ed picks up a TOASTER attached to an extension cord.
ED (CONT'D)
Last night we had the worst
electrical storm of the last
hundred years.
MIKE
Is that true?
ED
It was pretty bad.
Ed raises the toaster-
MIKE
Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you
really think this'll work?
ED
It could.
Ed tosses it in. Mike screams.
Nothing happens.
ED (CONT'D)
Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a
moment.
Ed reaches down to plug it in.
ED (CONT'D)
What were you doing by the river
anyway?
CLOSE ON MIKE, Light bulb goes off.
He leaps out, runs for
the house.
MIKE
The janitor!
CUT TO:
The Audi screeches to a stop in front of the school.
Mike
bounds out, wearing a robe, races inside.
20.
The Boys gather a stack of TEEN MAGAZINES and TABLOID RAGS.
Ed slips a MELONS Magazine into the pile.
The usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder
Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang.
Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing.
HONK.
A horn blares.
Stan and Maggie jump out of the way.
An ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted
window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike.
Mike winks then rolls on past.
SAMANTHA
Oh my god.
Was that-
JAMIE
Did you see-
LAUREN
I told you he was cute.
The Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the
door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell.
SCARLET (o.s.)
Coming!
The door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
I've been dying to meet you. I've
known your father since...(gasps)
Scarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance...
MIKE
Is something wrong?
SCARLET
(FLUSTERED)
No. It's just...you look
like...No. I'm fine. Come in.
Please.
44.
Mike and Scarlet step outside.
MIKE
I almost don't even recognize
it...er...if I had seen it before I
probably wouldn't recognize it.
SCARLET
You wouldn't have. It was a
disaster back here a few days ago.
Obviously I have a lot to do still.
I'm laying the sod next and the
limestone pathway will go here.
Scarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
Then I'll plant all those, over a
hundred different types of flowers
and plants. I have an amazing
fountain being delivered that'll go
here and a bench over there.
(MORE)
46.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
And I'll string rows of tiny, white
lights above it all so every night
will be a starry one. It'll be a
real sanctuary back here.
MIKE
It seems like a lot'a work for one
person, Scar.
A chill runs up Scarlet's spine.
SCARLET
My husband's the only one that ever
calls me that.
Alex appears at the doors interrupting-
ALEX
Yo, Mark.
Let's do this.
MIKE
Good luck with the project.
SCARLET
Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be
home by 10:30.
Mike heads back inside.
Scarlet stares after him.
A BONFIRE illuminates the night sky. MUSIC plays. KIDS lay
on blankets, play football. Others splash in the ocean.
WE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire.
SAMANTHA
We were on his myspace page.
There's a picture of him jamming
with the Chili Peppers at
Coachella.
JAMIE
I heard Timbaland wants to produce
an album with him.
LAUREN
Yeah, but he turned him down to
help orphans with Brangelina in
Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.
SAMANTHA
Oh my God!
I bet he knows Justin.
ANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand.
ALEX
This looks boring. Let's go back
to my house and play video games.
Alex turns.
Mike grabs his arm, turns him back.
48.
MIKE
What are you so nervous about?
ALEX
The beach is for the older, cool
kids. I don't belong here.
MIKE
What are you talking about? You're
a basketball player. You're cool.
ALEX
I don't play basketball. I mean, I
can play, I just don't play on the
team.
Mike is stunned.
MIKE
But I thought you were getting
ready for the season?
ALEX
I never told you that.
As a confused Mike and Alex approach the scene, BOYS call out
to Mike, tap his fist. GIRLS fawn over him. Mike's become a
celebrity...and he's eating it up.
ANGLE: Lauren spots Mike with Alex.
LAUREN
Here he comes!
The Bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy.
MAGGIE
Can he be any lamer? Using my
little brother to get to me?
SAMANTHA
If that boy was an apple he'd be
delicious.
Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike.
Lauren and Jamie
chase after her. Maggie shakes her head.
As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up.
ALEX
Oh, man.
It's her.
She's here.
49.
MIKE
Who?
Alex nods towards the fire.
Seated with FRIENDS is Nicole.
Alex BELCHES loudly.
ALEX
She's so pretty it makes me gassy.
MIKE
Calm down. Here's what you're
gonna do. You're gonna go over
there and introduce yourself-
ALEX
She won't like me, Mark.
I'm a
loser.
Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders.
MIKE
Why? Because Stan says so? You
think Stan's a winner? He's going
nowhere. You're a great kid. Any
girl would be lucky to get your
attention.
ALEX
Really?
MIKE
Really. And right now, there's a
girl over there who's dying to meet
you.
A determined look comes over Alex.
ALEX
Okay.
What do I say?
MIKE
Just introduce yourself. Then
compliment her on something she
never gets complimented on. Like if
she has big, meaty, man hands tell
her she should be a hand model.
(Alex burps nervously)
And don't burp on her.
ALEX
I can do that.
50.
Alex takes a deep breath, marches off just as Samantha runs
up and throws her arms around Mike.
SAMANTHA
You came! Why don't we take a walk
somewhere private and play?
Jamie and Lauren rush over.
JAMIE
I don't think so, Sam. Mark
promised me a walk on the beach.
LAUREN
Walk with me. I've got less miles
on me.
A full blown ARGUMENT breaks out between the Bras.
Mike sees
Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out.
ANGLE: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses
confidence. As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up-
NICOLE
Hi.
Alex stops, turns back around and blurts out-
ALEX
Hi, Alex.
I'm Nicole.
Nicole and her Friends giggle.
NICOLE
You don't look like a Nicole.
ALEX
You have big, meaty man hands.
You
should be a hand model.
The Girls' jaws drop.
Nicole hides her hands.
NICOLE
Oh my God!
Seriously!?
Alex rips a huge BURP.
The Girls duck for cover.
GIRL 1
I think he got some on me!
51.
ALEX
Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real
nervous and I've wanted to talk to
you for so long. And Mark told me
to compliment you on something you
never get complimented on but I
couldn't find anything because
everything's so...perfect.
Nicole and her Friends MELT.
NICOLE
Do you want to sit down, Nicole?
Nicole scoots over making room next to her.
Alex smiles.
ANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie.
MAGGIE
What do you want?
MIKE
Stan.
Why are you dating him?
MAGGIE
Get to the point why don't you?
MIKE
I'm serious. He's not a nice guy.
Matter of fact he's a jackass.
MAGGIE
Don't talk about him like that.
You don't even know him.
MIKE
I know he bullies your brother.
MAGGIE
Stan barely knows Alex exists.
We're moving in together after
graduation.
MIKE
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you
were going to Georgetown?
MAGGIE
I'm going to Westwood Community
College. Stan and I both are.
Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting-
52.
MIKE
The hell you are, Young Lady! If
you think I'm gonna let you throw
your life away on some Sleestack
you're crazy! I forbid you to see
him anymore and that's final!
Maggie jumps up.
Kids all stare.
MAGGIE
Who do you think you are!?
My
father?!
Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras.
MIKE
Don't you walk away from me,
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!
Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare.
Maggie
heads for the parking lot.
SAMANTHA
Who's Margaret?
LAUREN
He doesn't even know her name.
JAMIE
He's so not into her.
The Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie.
Mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the
faces of a group of KIDS.
A HOT GIRL wearing a `Lifeguard' bathing suit sits atop a
high chair.
Ed floats on a raft. A frozen drink next to him.
Scarlet
looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation-
SCARLET
I haven't heard from him in three
weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.
ED
He cares.
53.
SCARLET
Then where is he?
Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet-
MIKE
What's going on?
SCARLET
Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping
something off.
Scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
Our court date is the 27th. If he
has anything to say, he can say it
then.
Scarlet exits.
MIKE
What was that all about?
ED
That envelope contains divorce
papers.
Mike eyes the envelope, in stunned silence.
ED (CONT'D)
But what do you care? You're going
to college, right? Life's one big
panty raid for you.
Mike feigns innocence.
MIKE
I don't know what you're talking
about?
ED
I saw the applications in your
room.
MIKE
You went through my room!?
ED
If you'd cleaned like I asked I
wouldn't have had to. You can't be
serious about this can you?
54.
Mike starts to argue then gives in-
MIKE
I have to face the possibility that
I might never turn back and if
that's the case, I'm going to do it
right this time around.
ED
Karmically speaking, in the next
life you're coming back as a
hemorrhoid.
Mike scoffs, storms off.
Ed calls after him-
ED (CONT'D)
I'm not paying for college!
A dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down.
MIKE (o.s.)
Got an extra pair of gloves?
Scarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in.
Scarlet
stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans.
SCARLET
Gloves are for sissies.
MIKE
Yeah, but I just had a manicure.
SCARLET
(LAUGHS)
You're serious? You want to help?
MIKE
Are you kidding? I love
landscaping!
(MORE)
63.
MIKE (CONT'D)
It's right up there with watching
"Sex and the City" and snuggling.
Scarlet laughs, eyes him skeptically-
SCARLET
Mark, I'm 36 years old-
MIKE
I'm just doing this to make a few
bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.
SCARLET
(BLUSHES)
Embarrassing. Sorry.
I'll give
you 10 dollars a day.
MIKE
Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that
rate I should be able to buy
tickets in...2011.
SCARLET
Fine.
20.
Grab a roll.
Mike and Scarlet, step over to the sod, lift a roll together,
carry it over to the spot.
MIKE
What are the benefits like here?
SCARLET
I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.
MIKE
Deal.
Mike and Scarlet share a laugh.
Alex dribbles, using both hands, while running through a maze
of cones. Whenever he messes up, Mike makes him start again.
Mike and Scarlet settle the limestone rocks into the freshly
laid sod creating a walkway.
Lights shine down. Alex stands behind the 3 point line.
Mike feeds him balls. Alex shoots and moves. Shoots and
moves. More misses than hits.
Mike teaches Alex the cross over dribble. Scarlet brings the
boys water. Mike checks her out as she goes back in the
house. Alex bounces the ball off his head.
Scarlet fills holes with plants then waters them with a hose.
She turns, finds Mike SLEEPING in the grass. Scarlet picks
up the hose, TURNS IT ON HIM. Mike leaps up, chases her.
Mike, Alex, Nicole, Maggie, the Bras and a slew of KIDS hang
by Mike's Aston. Stan, Jazz and Kevin are all that's left by
Stan's Mustang.
67.
Alex scampers through the maze of cones, dribbling from hand
to hand...and does it perfectly. Mike and Alex high 5.
Mike and Scarlet lug an ornate, wooden bench to it's spot.
They sit. Mike casually places a hand on Scarlet's leg.
Scarlet casually removes it.
The 3 step outside.
Mike, truly blown away, takes picture
with his iPhone.
MIKE
It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm
sorry I never saw how talented you
are...I mean when people see this
and how talented you are you'll be
designing sanctuaries all over the
city.
SCARLET
(BEAMS)
Thank you.
ALEX
Mom, why are you all dressed up?
SCARLET
Oh my God. I almost forgot.
I
have a date.
Off Mike's stunned reaction.
CUT TO:
CARS line the street. A steady flow of KIDS stream towards
the front door. MUSIC pounds from within. It's a RAGER.
Stan corners Maggie against the back wall.
STAN
I was upset. I'm sorry. But I
need you to show me you love me.
Then we'll move in together.
MAGGIE
Whatever.
I'm with someone else
now.
STAN
Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid
enough?
MAGGIE
Him.
Stan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches.
MIKE
Party's over, Stan.
You're out of
here.
STAN
Who's gonna make me leave?
You?
MIKE
I would but it smells like you've
been drinking so I'll let the cops
do it.
Mike pulls out his phone.
Stan looks to Maggie then back to
Mike, laughs-
STAN
You can have the nun.
She doesn't
put out anyway.
79.
MIKE
On second thought-
Mike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW.
Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK.
Alex and Nicole sit closely by a fire pit, laughing.
ALEX
How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time
she rolls her r's she spits all
over me.
Alex imitates Mrs. Cruz. Nicole laughs, places her hand on
Alex's leg. Alex looks down at her hand, then up at her,
both staring at one another...THE MOMENT.
Nicole closes her eyes, moves in. Alex moves in then
FREAKS. He bounds out of his chair, sprints inside leaving
Nicole hanging.
A determined Alex marches over to the seated Nicole.
ALEX
Nicole.
Nicole stands-
NICOLE
I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-
Before she can finish Alex's hands are on her face and his
lips on hers. It's as if time stands still.
CLOSE ON a Heavy Kid leans over the pool PUKING.
Wider...Mike beside him while Kids cheer the Heavy Kid on.
MIKE
I'm so dead.
Mike turns, finds SCARLET making her way through the crowd.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Oh no!
Mike rushes over to her.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Scarlet, what are you doing here?
SCARLET
I'm looking for Alex. It's past
his curfew and he wasn't picking up
his phone. Is he here?
MIKE
Yeah, he's fine.
He's with his
girlfriend.
SCARLET
Alex has a girlfriend?
86.
MIKE
He does and she's really cute.
Come on.
Mike leads Scarlet away from the pool.
Ed storms up the driveway.
Julie hurries after him.
A KID
spies Julie, calls out-
KID
It's Ms. Goodwin!
Run!
All the Kids on the lawn SCATTER in different directions.
Mike and Scarlet hide behind the pool house, peek around the
corner, spy on Alex and Nicole by the fire pit. Alex is
animated, confident...
SCARLET
He's like a totally different
person.
Scarlet and Mike step back by the pool, sit on a lounge.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
It's been so good for him to have
you around. You have no idea.
88.
MIKE
Believe me, I do. He's a great
kid. And you're an amazing mother.
SCARLET
I'm not so sure. I mean look at
me. I showed up at a party to drag
my son home. Could I be any more
embarrassing? And how many amazing
mothers run their kids' father off?
MIKE
Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't
blame yourself for his stupidity.
SCARLET
I knew he was unhappy. I knew he
hated his job. I should've been
more supportive, more sympathetic
to what he was going through. He
gave up a lot for me.
MIKE
That's bull shit! You, Maggie and
Alex are the best thing that ever
happened to me...him. He was just
too selfish to recognize it. At
least, that's how I see it.
Scarlet smiles thankfully at Mike.
ANGLE...Maggie and the Bras roam the backyard searching for
Mike.
JAMIE
He's over there.
By the pool.
SAMANTHA
Who's the ho?
MAGGIE
Mom?
ANGLE...Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards
the house when Alex freezes-
ALEX
Whoa.
What's my mom doing here?
ANGLE...Scarlet places a hand over Mike's.
89.
SCARLET
You're sweet. I have no idea why
I'm telling you all this. There's
just something so familiar...
Scarlet looks into Mike's eyes. Mike stares back. She's
vulnerable. He loves her. It's perfect. Mike leans in and
KISSES HER...PASSIONATELY.
SSSSSLAP.
Mike falls off the chair.
Scarlet leaps up.
SCARLET (CONT'D)
What do you think you're doing!?
Mike scrambles to his feet.
MIKE
Scar, just calm down. I have
something to tell you but I need
you to keep an open mind. Can you
do that for me?
SCARLET
This conversation is over, Mark.
MIKE
I'm not Mark.
SCARLET
I'm not in the mood for games.
MIKE
It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike.
It's me...your husband.
Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow-
SCARLET
What?
Why would you say that?
MIKE
It's the truth. I'm the father of
your children. You have to believe
me.
SCARLET
Don't ever come near me or my
family again. If you do, I'll have
you arrested or better yet,
institutionalized.
Scarlet marches towards the house.
Mike on her heels
pleading.
90.
MIKE
Let me explain, Scar.
As she passes Ed and Julie.
SCARLET
Your son needs a shrink!
Scarlet storms off.
Before Mike can protest-
MAGGIE
Pervert!
Mike turns. SLAP. Maggie lights him up, runs for the house.
SLAP, SLAP, SLAP. The Bras add theirs on the way out.
Alex and Nicole march past.
Mike reaches for Alex's arm.
Alex pulls it away.
MIKE
Alex, wait. Let me explain-
ALEX
How could you do this to me?
Alex whisks Nicole into the house.
Mike lowers his head.
Ed
stomps over, grabs Mike.
ED
This place is a disaster! A kid
pissed all over my English garden!
What were you thinking!?
MIKE
She hates me, Ed.
I've ruined
everything.
Mike runs for the house.
Julie looks quizzically to Ed.
JULIE
Who hates him? What's going on?
Ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath.
ED
Oh boy. I don't quite know how to
put this.
JULIE
Try being honest.
91.
ED
He's not really my son.
I don't
have a son.
SLAP.
Ed looks like he's about to cry.
JULIE
Mark's obviously having a crisis
and you...you insensitive bastard,
you disown him? He'd be better off
with his mother in Thailand.
Julie strides for the house.
Ed yells after her-
ED
Should I call you?!
All is normal.
No signs of a party.
The BMW roars out of the garage, Ed driving, tears down the
driveway, fishtailing onto the street, LOSES CONTROL, rips
across a neighbor's lawn then back onto the road and off.
Ed's BMW skids to a stop in front of the building.
Mike and
Ed bound out, race up the court steps-
ED
What exactly are we doing?
MIKE
I don't know. We just need to stop
her from going through with it!
ED
A well thought out plan.
Good job.
Mike steps outside, throws his duffel into the Aston.
Ed
exits the house.
97.
ED
Where you going?
MIKE
I'm moving on. See you at the
game.
Mike climbs into the car, pulls out of the driveway.
