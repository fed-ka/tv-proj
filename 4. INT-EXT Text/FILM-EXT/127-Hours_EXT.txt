A massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell
show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it
is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave
erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's
impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass
cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc
marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at
london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's
thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona
500. . . . Gradually the screen splits into 2, and then 3,
though at times there appears to be no division at all.
An overhead shot of a crammed freeway gives way to a single
vehicle, a 98 Toyota Tacoma, red and white with a topper.
CUT TO:
Eventually Aron's truck is now alone on an interstate road.
2.
From high above, three quarters of the screen is black and we
see his truck's lights running parallel with the blackness.
CUT TO:
Jackrabbits dart onto the road, racing him, darting left and
right as he chases them down. They finish the game darting
back into the darkness.
CUT TO:
3.
Slowly, images from the Great Gallery materialise on
different parts of the Triptych - petroglyphs and
pictographs; dozens of 8-10 ft high Superhumans hovering over
groups of indistinct animals, dominating beasts and onlookers
alike with their long, dark bodies, broad shoulders, and
haunting eyes.
CUT TO:
Billboards, TV, cinema, www: commercial America sells
everything to us through every means. As many brand names as
we can get.
CUT TO:
Rushing across the desert grooves, pulling, snatching, hard
left and right, the rear of the truck fishtails madly.
Curves, swoops and sandy washes kick up dust clouds as
everything in the truck flies all over the place. Except his
bike, locked down and braced solid.
Music blazes on.
Another Rabbit. Another fence line. Another curve.
CUT TO:
The truck turns sharp left.
CUT TO:
Ghostly, but there are three other vehicles and two
encampments at the Trailhead, despite signs prohibiting
camping.
CUT TO:
It's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle.
Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the
land like an ad for extreme sports. Past bikers, he vanishes
temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across
his face as the bikers pass by... a final telephone box, past
remnants of those who tried to settle or work this
unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers...
all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into.......
CUT TO:
5.
Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend
socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a
back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of
water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration
pouch which he sucks on without stopping.
CUT TO:
His bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of
the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone
against what nature can offer. He's clearly a fit and daring
young man and these are his kicks.
CUT TO:
Even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone. Gasping for
oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes
until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can
suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define
themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a
way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should
be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls.
Until...
CUT TO:
Suddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the
handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and
momentum brings the bike with him. The bike has him trapped
on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits,
landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around
quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his
bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess.
CUT TO:
At what seems like the only tree for miles he U-locks his
bike in the shade, pockets the keys, scoffs a muffin and
heads off into the desert.
CUT TO:
6.
He approaches the crest of a sand gulley and sees below him,
just 30 yards down the canyon, 2 fellow hikers. He looks
around. All of them in the middle of nowhere it seems.
CUT TO:
He can see now it's 2 girls passing a map back and forth
between them. He rushes towards them, initially above them as
he walks along side. They're aware of him before he arrives:
ARON
Hey. Are you doing the east pike?
Can I come along with you for a
while?
The girls don't reply, just look at each other.
ARON (CONT'D)
I'm on my own. I'm Aron.
CUT TO:
He slides/surfs down so he's on the same level as them,
arriving in a haze of dust, holding out his hand for the
shake. Big smile.
KRISTI
(looking at Megan)
Sure, I'm Kristi.
MEGAN
Megan.
ARON
Nice to meet you. What a day.
KRISTI
It's beautiful.
ARON
Did you bike or come straight from
the trail head?
KRISTI
We left the car there. Pretty
quiet.
ARON
I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon
and biked here.
7.
MEGAN
You biked from Horseshoe? That's
20 miles or more.
ARON
17 and windy.
The girls exchange glances.
ARON (CONT'D)
I do this a lot.
They laugh. He's crazy, but harmless.
ARON (CONT'D)
Wasn't expecting to see anyone in
the canyon today.
MEGAN
Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up
like that.
ARON
Sorry.
MEGAN
It's kind of nervy seeing a lone
guy walking up to you in the middle
of the desert.
ARON
Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one
around for 50 miles.
KRISTI
... and suddenly there's a guy
right behind you and `wait a
minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY
MASK!'
They all laugh.
ARON
Let me guess... You're here for
the paintings or the Cathedral?
KRISTI
The Cathedral? We've got a bit
disorientated and the map isn't
great. Where is it?
ARON
The climb's a little tricky but
it's worth it.
KRISTI / MEGAN
We climb.
8.
They all laugh.
CUT TO:
Eating and drying in the powerful afternoon sun. A little
self consciousness has returned but it's sweet-natured and
fun still.....
MEGAN
I really can't eat all this
chocolate by myself... Never mind,
yes I can!
KRISTI
So have you got a girlfriend, Aron?
ARON
Well, there's not really anyone
special.
MEGAN
Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends.
KRISTI
There's always a girl, you just
don't know it yet.
10.
MEGAN
Yeah, we meet lots of guys and
there's always a girl.
ARON
Long story.
KRISTI
With lots of characters in it.
CUT TO:
Aron on top of a snowy peak. Self shot. Classic pose.
Breathtaking backdrop.
ARON (V.O.)
I've done 46 of the 59 winter solo
ascents.
MEGAN
Wow, highest person in Colorado.
ARON
Well I figure no one else is mad
enough to climb in the winter.
KRISTI
... you can be the highest person
on the continent!
CUT TO:
Megan shows the image to Aron.
MEGAN
Didn't you see it?
ARON
What? No.
MEGAN
Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's
house - the roof's caved in and
someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on
the side. Smelled weird though.
ARON
Just like a MOTEL 6 then?
CUT TO:
11.
KRISTI
Why are you on your own?
ARON
Solitude. Great tunes. Empty
mind.
He indicates the wilderness.
ARON (CONT'D)
And I can sing Phish songs as loud
as I like.
MEGAN
Phish?
KRISTI
Not those guys from...
ARON
Yeah, I know, I know.
(LAUGHS)
See, that's why I'm on my own.
Nobody likes me or my band.
They laugh as he goofs for them. He gathers all their
packaging and stuffs it in his backpack.
ARON (CONT'D)
I'll get this. Leave no trace.
CUT TO:
They're walking again.
ARON (CONT'D)
Hey, but I like a beer like the
next man. You know, end of the day.
CUT TO:
They're negotiating a steep gulley. Aron is 1/2 way down,
Megan at the top, Kristi on her way down to him.
ARON
I'm not certified yet but that's
what I want to do.
MEGAN
An illegal instructor.
12.
ARON
It's hard to get the hours to
qualify. Catch 22.
KRISTI
Well, we'll sign your time-card
today.
ARON
Great. Now put your ass on my head.
KRISTI
Okay but don't look and no grabbing
now, if I do...
MEGAN
Oh whatever, you love it.
KRISTI
Shhh!
Aron then quickly slips to the bottom. Megan is way high,
Kristi half way.
ARON
(at his most instructor-
ish, talking all the time
as he makes his way down)
You'll have to chimney down a
little ways - like here, watch -
one foot on each wall then squat
onto your right heel, now your
butt's on the wall, so you can move
your right foot across, now put
your left foot under your butt
lower down and scootch your butt
down - watch that black part, it's
slick, slime, try not to get it on
your shoes - if you can get to
these bomber handholds here it's
like an elevator shaft and just
think friction to control the
slide. This is a keeper so always
have someone at the bottom to boost
you out.
He looks up to them.
MEGAN
I didn't understand any of that.
LATER IN THE DAY. 2PM-ISH
They come to a clear fork in the paths. He watches them turn
their map round and round.
13.
MEGAN (CONT'D)
Kristi, I think this is our way
back.
ARON
Why don't you come with me to the
Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a
lift back to your car.
KRISTI
How far is it?
He shows them on the map.
ARON
About another 8 miles or so, I
think.
MEGAN
You'll never get out before dark.
ARON
No, I really got to do this. Anyway
I've my miner's lamp.
MEGAN
You don't climb at night, do you?
ARON
No, it's great for seeing snakes in
hand holds. Can I get a picture
then?
They pose with raven feathers in their hair.
ARON (CONT'D)
Listen, my friends are having a
party tomorrow night. You should
come.
KRISTI
Yeah, we'd like that. What time?
MEGAN
Where?
ARON
Drive on the east road and about 40
miles out there's a huge inflatable
Scooby Doo. You can't miss it.
Turn off and it's about 2 miles
down that track. Starts late and
it'll go right thru.
Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them...
14.
KRISTI
Come on Aron, hike out with us -
we'll go get your truck, hang out
and have a beer.
ARON
No, I really got to do this.
KRISTI
Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah?
ARON
That's the one. I'll have 3 cold
beers waiting for us.
MEGAN
12 cold beers!
CUT TO:
And they separate down 2 different canyons shouting to each
other...'hot dogs!...'vegetarian hot dogs!'.... 'so that's 12
cold beers and 9 vegetarian hotdogs!'...'.. I really can't
eat all these vegetarian hotdogs by myself... never mind, yes
I can!'... the last of the dialogue fading away as they lose
earshot of each other and we pull up out high over the
meandering slits of sandstone...
CUT TO:
Aron alone ... they are gone ... he picks up the pace as he
checks his watch... he loved them but now he's behind
schedule and he's ruthless about his schedule...
CUT TO:
His sense of momentum is established again and it's clear
he's moving downhill, into the fissure of the rock.
CUT TO:
Without warning his feet suddenly slide forward from under
him and he skates/snap-kicks trying to keep his balance on a
floor of scattering pebbles left there by a flood. There's a
flash of the sky and dazzling sunlight.
15.
Only his arms and the proximity now of the walls prevent him
landing hard on his ass.
CUT TO:
A small snake slithers away from his giant feet.
CUT TO:
ARON
Easy Aron, easy now.
He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more
circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip
round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times
selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the
headphones over his head.
CUT TO:
Suddenly, louder than loud, the sound of fanatical 5,000
strong applause at the Phish live concert in Las Vegas, fills
his head and ours.
He's heard it many times as he alternatively
anticipates/answers all the dialogue preamble mixed over the
applause...
CD RECORDING
Good evening Las Vegas... are you
having a good time? Are you ready
for PHISH!
Whether we are or not, the first song begins on a wave of
adoration from his fellow Phish fans. He sings along.
CUT TO:
16.
Aron keeps descending, the canyon walls growing taller and
closer, into the narrowing slot canyon.
CUT TO:
A dry waterfall, many months since it's seen rain. A drop of
maybe 12/15 ft with no obvious climb down. Way beyond his
reach and jammed into the walls of the canyon is an enormous
S-shaped log, sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a
massive reptile making its way down the canyon. Beyond it,
Aron can see his route down disappearing into narrowing
darkness.
CUT TO:
To reduce the drop he scrambles down clinging to the edge,
pushes away and drops the final 6 feet or so landing in a
fine cloud of sand. Nothing to it, second nature.
CUT TO:
PHOTOTIME
He snaps the log now arching above him well out of reach.
TITLE.
" 2:41pm. Sat April 26th. 2003 "
ARON
Won't be coming back this way.
CUT TO:
We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron
moving within it. We track in and elide into a graphic view
of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only 3 ft wide
at most. It's a chance to see his skill and thirst for
climbing. And to see how deep he's going.
18.
He uses his legs, back and natural body weight to body walk
along and down the towering walls.
CUT TO:
... to see the slot canyon, back and back and back, nothing
more than a dry crack in the surface of this massive land.
Gradually his cries for help become inaudible.
CUT TO:
Daylight, a lunar landscape almost, though with patches of
green and giant boulders, Aron whom we sense only by being
around his shoulder is out walking with his friend, Mark Von
Eeckhout through this field of boulders. They come upon one
the size of a house buried nose deep in the field.
MARK
Wow, look at the size of this one.
There's no cliffs or mountains anywhere near. We look at
Mark's pleasant, unremarkable face for far too long as he
looks around -
MARK (CONT'D)
How the fuck did this get there?
It's like we're on the moon looking over Buzz Aldrin's
shoulder at Neil Armstrong; it certainly sounds like that...
HARD CUT TO:
26.
A black raven flies symmetrically the length of the canyon
slit above him. Blue, blue sky.
CUT TO:
On top of some 4 x 4 vehicles are 8-10 ft huge Easter Island-
like masks, multi-coloured. Multiple bikes are strapped to
the backs of the vehicles too. More of Aron's friends,
including Mark V.E. mill around their 4 x 4s. There are
multiple lights in the distance but it's unclear what it
might be. The vehicles' own headlights illuminate Rana, a
stunningly beautiful red-haired woman in her mid-20s,
effortlessly organising the 15 or so group. As before, we
remain behind Aron. By the camera's virtually complete
concentration on Rana it's clear he's a fan.
28.
RANA
OK - lights off and line up
alongside me.
They turn off their vehicles' headlights as she draws a long
line in the sand and they join her standing on one side of
it.
RANA (CONT'D)
On the other side of this line,
everything will be different.
As they all hold hands and together step cross the line
(Aron's keen and ever so slightly ahead of everyone across
the line) the sparkling lights of the crescent-shaped `town'
of vehicles and camps that is Burning Man are replaced by an
astonishing sunrise in the Nevada desert. They hoot and
holler as Rana smiles beautifully at Aron.
RANA (CONT'D)
And remember, stick together, the
desert wants to kill you.
CUT TO:
Flashes of the accident-almost in silhouette - like an
animatic side view. It freezes just before the moment of
entombment.
CUT TO:
Different angle on the freeze-frame.
CUT TO:
Aron's Truck. We sense him in the cab but we're not inside
with him yet. Music loud and pulsing as we travel towards
the inflatable Scooby Doo. It's 12ft tall, powered by a mini-
generator.
CUT TO:
We stay with the dancing figure as his truck drives away into
the landscape. The generator fan rattles on as the booming
bass of the truck fades.
CUT TO:
We're now high above the desert, and in the time-lapse we see
the soft, grey, endless line of darkness cross right to left
BRINGING -
CUT TO:
TITLE:
" NIGHT TWO ":
CUT TO:
He looks like a multi-coloured version of the Michelin Man,
only much thinner.
CUT TO:
He watches them devour him and then he clears them away from
his hand. Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before
sunrise. In the grey-white, soft morning he is involved in
recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and
pulley.
Obsessive, inventive, analytical, he constantly adjusts and
adds and subtracts, and cannibalizes. Undoing and tieing
knots with his teeth and hand. Each time nothing happens to
the rock. But each time he doesn't stop. He tries again and
again and again; looping and re-looping throwing and catching
ropes; creating footholds and bouncing in them with his foot,
his knees, his ass.
Finally he stops. He looks down. For a moment it's as though
he will cry. He looks up to where he came from and
CUT TO:
... suddenly we're moving, retracing his journey at
increasing and eventually staggering speed.
Through the slot canyon, up and into the blazing light across
the desert paths, past his chained-up bicycle and back to his
truck waiting at the side of the road. But we don't stop...
SLAM CUT TO:
We see the raven and we see him check his watch. Sure
enough, 8.14 Slides to 8.15.
CUT TO:
VIDEO:
ARON
I have about one hundred and fifty
millilitres of water left. That's
four ounces. I can't believe it
but I peed twice today, within a
few minutes of each other. How is
this possible? It's two days since
I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to
go so quickly I forgot to save the
first. I saved the second in the
CamelBak. Will I drink it? It
smells foul, and hot but it'll
settle. And I can chill it in the
sand in the night. It's like Polar
winter here for nine hours.
CUT TO:
42.
REALTIME:
We see his precious bottle of water. It looks back at him.
Next to it is the Camelbak of his stored urine.
CUT TO:
VIDEO:
ARON
No number twos. Which will
disappoint my insect friends.
They're gonna have to wait. The
sunlight appears down here for a
few hours. I get 15 minutes of it
at 9.35... and apart from chipping
away uselessly at this rock that's
pretty much my morning routine.
CUT TO:
REALTIME - TIME-LAPSE:
Aron is deathly still as we travel towards him with the
dagger of light. His leg is stretched out and the only
movement is the change of leg halfway through. He stays in
shot throughout getting bigger and then smaller as the light
approaches and recedes; the sliver of light leaves the
canyon.
CUT TO:
VIDEO:
ARON
I keep chipping at the rock but
just to generate warmth and give me
something to do. I think it's
making it worse. I know it's
settling more on my arm as I remove
material from it. The area where I
chipped flakes off yesterday has
already rotated down onto my arm.
PAUSE. I can't feel anything.
PAUSE. So I made a great
tourniquet and I tried to cut it
off.
CUT TO:
43.
REALTIME:
We see him pull the elastic neoprene tubing insulation from
the CamelBak. It's stretchy, supple and strong and emerges
like a thin snake. It's perfect. He wraps the black
neoprene around his right forearm 2 inches below his elbow.
Simple overhand knot tightened with his teeth. 2nd knot, 3rd
knot, clips the neoprene with a carabiner and twists 6 times
tight.
ARON
OWWWWW
Now real pain in his right arm. Weird smile at the success.
The skin colour separates; fish belly white below the
tourniquet and bright red bunched up crushes of flesh between
the elbow and the tourniquet.
ARON (CONT'D)
Oh yeah. That aches.
He takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade.
looks at it. Then he presses the blade and draws it quickly
across his forearm. Nothing. Repeats it harder. Nothing.
No cut, no blood, nothing. He switches to the short knife
and saws viciously at the same point.
ARON (CONT'D)
Shit!
He releases the tourniquet and as the blood flow returns a
series of angry red lines establish themselves where he was
sawing. He looks at them.
ARON (CONT'D)
Pathetic, Aron, pathetic.
CUT TO:
VIDEO:
ARON
The blades are too blunt even to
break the skin. I guess that's the
chipping. It's not even a proper
Leatherman. It's a knock-off one
we got free in a gift pack with a
torch... Mom gave it to me.
LONG PAUSE.
Sis. Sonja, I'm very proud of you.
(MORE)
44.
ARON (CONT'D)
I didn't get to hear firsthand how
your championships went, but I
heard from Mom that you placed very
well at the national competitions,
that you were tenth overall in
speech and debate in the nation.
Hot damn, girl. I'm very proud of
you. Not just for that but for who
you are.
He looks directly in the lens for the first time.
ARON (CONT'D)
I can imagine you in your living
room looking back at me.
CUT TO:
There's an angry looking black motherfucker of a cloud.
CUT TO:
HUGE C/U OF:
A massive crack of noise like the land has split. His eyes
staring up, unblinking, the corridor of light above him
reflected in is contact lenses like mirrors. Suddenly a drop
of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from
the sky.
CUT TO:
46.
We're many miles away, the dust spits as though hit by silent
bullet tracer fire. Raindrops gathering and multiplying,
soaking and bouncing off the desert floor, they skim and slip
into a groove and then another, the slit instantly fills and
water drops crash on the new surface. The spillage spreads
and fills everything near it. We tilt up, the sky is furious
black, and murderous. Lightning arcs across hundreds of
miles.
CUT TO:
A channel fills now as the grooves spill and multiply. The
water poured from above appears everywhere, visibility is
virtually gone, whether it's through mist or darkness it's
impossible to tell.
CUT TO:
Another channel explodes like a volcanic surging mass in
every direction. The camera literally slips and slides as
the water now seems to take a direction towards deeper
gulleys, looking for something to fill, for somewhere to
escape to.
The floor of the desert becomes a river careering towards the
slot canyons.
CUT TO:
Now carrying debris with it the water cascades into the
natural pipe-work of the desert.
CUT TO:
47.
We see the S log from below as someone seems to pour
unimaginable tons of water over the lips of the canyon above
it. The walls glisten with force as the canyon becomes a 6FT
wall of churning mud, hurtling towards the chockstones. The
smaller ones are picked up and tossed downstream, smashing
and breaking on the bigger ones.
CUT TO:
Jump cut, pulling up at the party.
JUMP CUT TO:
One shot outside - POVs naked arms out the windows shaking
and saluting the storm. Their crazy, happy faces through the
windscreen as the weather invades the vehicle.
CUT TO:
Hundreds of miles of canyon - sunrise. The inner canyons
change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of
pastel yellow, white, green and a hundred shades of red, a
hallucinogenic movement towards light.
V.O.
`Good morning America!' etc.
There's a chorus of 'Good Mornings' from American TV & radio
shows. Literally dozens of them from Texas to Oregon,
Massachusetts to the Carolinas.

Like the beginning there are thousands of fans filling the
screen, people everywhere, maybe holding lighters. And again
like the beginning the screen splits into 2...
57.
TITLE:
" NIGHT FOUR. WEDNESDAY. NIGHT FIVE "
CUT TO:
The rest of Tuesday and night, and Wednesday and night play
out through the triptych. Repetition is used to create a
trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there's 3 Arons
doing the same thing. It could be consecutive days or he's
forgotten.
At key moments it resolves to one image and then back again.
Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch
the loops happening again and again. This is particularly
true inside the head bag at night. When his light is switched
on it's bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close-
up - his disintegration is terrifying.
When it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue,
that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images,
sometimes of himself also, play out on the interior surface
of the bag. The effect is like wraparound Imax, multi-screen
Technicolor.
Listening to the live concert
again.
The laser in the CD The crowd smears,
skips. dragged and distorted.
It's been damaged by the time in The numbers skip on the

As they stop...
CUT TO:
...the raven beats its wings across the canyon.
CUT TO:
Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock
shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The
scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the
dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his
dry eyes.
He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep
green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and
he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and
he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of
vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow
turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now
he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and
zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself
lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to
the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign
land.
Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing
70.
light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open
between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't
have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and
licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and
listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is
uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up
speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He
lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was
his future disappearing over the ledge.
CUT TO:
We're far below - 6 storeys - and see him inch over the edge.
Something's not right. It's a difficult overhang and he's
awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm
catches horribly on the lip of the ledge. Suddenly he starts
coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast,
accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with
deadly force.
CUT TO:
His feet gently touch the sandy floor, 10ft to the side of
the pool...
CUT TO:
... he's a great climber and even in his present condition
has perfectly executed the descent. And the pool is a puddle,
swimming with dead leaves and insects, 2 inches deep at most.
He falls on it with his bottles, filling them and dipping his
mouth into the water, He washes his head, drinks and fills,
drinks and gargles, and drinks again-insects, leaves,
tadpoles, everything. Blood splashes in beside him so out
comes his map again as he plots his way out. He sees a great
goose- necked avenue before him bending to the right.
71.
Checking the map... there's a long way to go and he's small,
nothing in this landscape.
CUT TO:
He walks shedding any weight that might reduce how long he
can keep going; his equipment, carabiners, headphones; his
harness left like a spent snake skin behind him. He keeps to
the shadows of the huge Monument Valley-like cliffs when he
can.
CUT TO:
Finally, he comes to the great gallery that we saw in the
opening titles. A 300ft huge wall with dozens of broad
shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of
tan and maroon. They seem to stare back at him. He salutes
them in his own way and continues.
He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff
face and makes to the flattest ground - there's no shade to
hide in here.
CUT TO:
70 yards ahead, 3 aliens are walking away from him. 2 tall,
one shorter. All with elongated bodies and tiny heads,
shimmering in the heat.
He goes to shout but his voice catches. Then a feeble effort
is lost in the vast scale of the canyon. The figures walk on
bending and disappearing in the light. He digs deep.
ARON
HELP!
And the figures turn.
There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and
then he pushes out another heartbreaking -
ARON (CONT'D)
HELP ME! I NEED HELP!
The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in
close up as they come. If tears come, then now they come at
the sight of humans. He mutters to himself.
72.
ARON (CONT'D)
Hang in there Aron.
At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from
somewhere.
ARON (CONT'D)
My name is Aron Ralston. I was
trapped by a boulder on Saturday
and I've been without food and
water for 5 days. I cut my arm off
this morning to get free and I've
lost a lot of blood. I need medical
attention.
There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low
budget horror movie. He hungrily eyes the water bottles
attached to their waist bands. This gives them a way in to
his world. The moment is broken by their offering him their
water. It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow
mechanism.
CUT TO:
Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises
the Mejers in a series of jump cuts pushing us through the
final stages-he's brutally practical.
ERIK
We are the Mejers from Holland.
You should stop and rest.
ARON
No, we need to keep hiking.
We need a helicopter - who can run
fastest?- You, go now fast. Take
him.
Monique runs ahead with Andy, her son.
ERIK
They told us you were here.
ARON
Who? Who told you?
ERIK
The police at the parking lot
ARON
Do you have a phone?
ERIK
There's no signal for miles.
Nobody for 6 days and then like London buses another couple
appears. They too are confronted by:
ARON
Do you have a cell phone?
WAYNE
No. I'm Wayne. I have some medical
training.
ARON
Is it ok for me to drink so much
water?
74.
WAYNE
Sure so long as it doesn't make you
vomit.
Aron drinks more and more, he overhears...
WAYNE (CONT'D)
(TO ERIK)
Make sure he doesn't pass out.
ARON
I gotta stop and empty my shoes.
You'll have to tie my shoe lace.
As he sits his head slumps forward. He's absolutely
motionless. Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can
barely hear them. A pop song spins round and round distantly.
He strains to pull his head up, and, staring, drops forward
to his knees. There it is. Filling his vision like a god.
Whirling screaming in front of him, dust blasting him as he
kneels. A HELICOPTER.
CUT TO:
A strange slightly formal man pops out of the helicopter. He
almost looks like he's part of the Matrix.
PILOT
Are you Aron?
ARON
Yes I am. Can I get a lift?
CUT TO:
Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seat before he gets
in the back of the helicopter. Surreal. It's a startling
contrast to his Frankenstein, and even now it's not lost on
him.
ARON
I'm gonna make a terrible mess of
your seat.
PILOT
Just get in buddy. We're all
looking for you.
The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Wayne,
Monique, Andy and Erik far below.
75.

1000 HOURS LATER
CUT TO:
As the helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the
medic room he's surrounded by vertical giants as he lies
horizontal for the first time in 6 days.
ARON
Thank you for bringing me back.
The most senior of the burly men says,
BURLY MAN
That's all your miracle days used
up kid. You need to rest. You can
stand everyone a beer later.
Aron is greeted by medics. Needles. Care. Machines. Tubes.
ARON
Will you look after this for me
please?
He opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife.
CUT TO:
We can see him beneath, swimming along the floor of the pool,
like a diver building lung capacity.
CUT TO:
The vast crowd again, floodlit, ready to begin their evening.
CUT TO:
The concert explode into life.
THE POP SONG PLAYS OVER:
` A man will rise, A man will fall...
There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same
sofa as in the canyon. On it and around it, his friends and
family, including Rana. There's so many of them they fill the
screen. Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away.
They smile, simple, silent support for him. He looks right
back at them.
