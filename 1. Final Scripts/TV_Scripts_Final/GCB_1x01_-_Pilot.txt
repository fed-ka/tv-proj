      EXT. AWESOME SANTA BARBARA HOUSE/ESTATE - DAY

      FEDERAL MARSHALS stand guard outside an Incredible Home as 
      they monitor MOVING MEN load a few boxes into a small Moving 
      Van.  The Marshals escort AMANDA (30 s), her two children 
      WILL (14),SARA (15), and their PeekapooGIDGET to their SUV.  
    The SUV and VAN pull away from their Federally-seized home.

                    The important thing is that we have 
                    each other.

      Will and Sara look at each other, not convinced.

      EXT. WASTELANDS OF NEW MEXICO - MOTEL 4 - LATE DAY

      Sara whines at the dumpy  MOTEL 4  as they pull up.

                    4?  We can t even afford Motel 6?

                                  AMANDA
                    Things will be better when we get to

                    It s me she has a problem with.

                    What s her house like?                                                                                        2.

                    Of course she s single, Sharon.  Most 
                    widows are.

      INT. AMANDA S SUV - DAY

      Amanda, Will and Sara stare at Amanda s Mom s house as they 
      just sit in the car, too nervous to get out.  It s a moment.

                                  WILL
                    Wow.  Big.  So this is home now?

                                  AMANDA
                    Only until we find our own house.  
                    This is just a quiet, safe place where 
                    we can start rebuilding our lives.

      Suddenly two DOBERMANS attack the car like a pair of CUJO s.

    The kids scream.  Amanda s frantic.  Gidget the Peekapoogoes 
      berserk, ricocheting around the SUV.                                                                                           3.

      It s MAYHEM.  Sara s on the roof of the car clutching the

                    How does Amanda look?  

      INT. DARLENE S LIVING ROOM - AT THAT MOMENT

      Darlene shifts to get a better view of Gigi s house and the 
      arrival of Amanda.  The Moving Van has obstructed her view.

                                  DARLENE (ON PHONE)
                    Can t really tell.  The moving van s 
                    in the way.  It s such a small van.

                    Well, Amanda can t have much.  
                    Supposedly the Fedsseized everything.  
                    How could Bill have done this to his 
                    family?  Such a tragedy.

                    homework could have become so corrupt.

                    Being married to Amanda for 16 years 
                    probably had a lot to do with it.

      EXT. GIGI S DRIVEWAY - DAY

      Dogs calmed.  Amanda s greeting her estranged mother.  Gigi s 
      meeting her grandchildren for the first time since they were 
      babies.  Years of emotion flow.

                                  AMANDA
                    Mom.  This is Sara.  And Will.  All 
                    grown up.

                                  SARA/WILL
                    Hi/Hey Grandma.

      Gigi, overcome by this, breaks down into tears.    

                                  GIGI
                    No one s ever called me Grandma...

      This sets off the emotional waterworks in Amanda.  They all 
      hug. Then Gigi finishes her thought.  

                                  GIGI (CONT D)
                    ... but let s make it  Gigi .

                    Amanda and Gigi are being civil to 
                    each other.  I prayed for that.

      Darlene watches Will and Sara unload the SUV.

                    Ladies!  It is not appropriate to 
                    speak of such things on the phone.

      Everyone stops talking.  They obey Darlene, who then says...

                                  DARLENE (ON VERTU) (CONT D)
                    See you in church.

      Darlene hangs up, fingering the cross in her cleavage. She 
      steps on the chair to get a better angle on the activity 
      across the street at Gigi s.

      INT. GIGI S ELEGANT HILLSIDE PARK HOUSE - LATER DAY

      Amanda is carefully stacking empty boxes.  Gigi enters.

                                  GIGI
                    Oh, don t bother with those.  I ll 
                    have Lupethrow them away for you.

                                  AMANDA
                    Don t throw them away.  I ll just need 
                    them again.  We re only here til we 
                    find a house.

                                  GIGI
                    Well, I m happy to know you dohave 
                    some money.

                                  AMANDA
                          (touches a nerve)
                    Mother, the Fedsseized everything.  
                    It was like running out of a burning 
                    house.  I grabbed what I could.  

                                  GIGI
                          (with a wink)
                    But you always hear criminals like 
                    Bill stash cash all over the world 
                    where nobody can find it.                                                                                        6.


                                  AMANDA
                    Don t you dare wink at me. And don t 
                      worry-we re only staying here 
                    temporarily.  Just until I find a job 
                    and a place of our own.

                                  GIGI
                    I didn t like Bill when you dated him 
                    in high school, didn t like him 
                    marrying you, really hated him when he 
                    dragged you away to California...

                                  AMANDA
                          (the hand)
                    I know.  The fact you didn t come to 
                    his funeral wasn t my first clue.

                                  GIGI
                    I mean, why would anyone in their 
                    right mind leave Dallas for Southern 
                      California?  Dallas has the same 
                    weather without the liberals.

                                  AMANDA
                    Mama.  Bill s dead.  We can retire the 
                    topic now.

                                  GIGI
                    Why did you come back here if you 
                    don t want help?

                                  AMANDA
                    I need a fresh start.  In Santa 
                    Barbara I couldn t bear another moment 
                    of the stares and gossip and judgment.

                                  GIGI
                    So... you came to Dallas?

      Upset Amanda leaves the room.

      INT. KITCHEN - GIGI S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Amanda walks through the kitchen.  Will is on his laptop.  As 
    she passes, she notices the screen and what she sees 
      distresses her even more.

                                  AMANDA
                    Honey.  Stop Googlingyour father.

                                  WILL
                    I just can t believe Dad did all this 
                    terrible stuff -- old people lost all 
                    their savings, charities lost 
                      everything.  What does committing  
                    Hari-kiri mean?

      Amanda hugs Will, kissing the top of his head.

                                  AMANDA
                    Whatever awful things your father did, 
                    he was a good dad.                                                                                        7.

                    Then I haveto know.   Sounds like a 
                    cool cautionary tale.

      Amanda explains, but is embarrassed and ashamed.

                    Back in high school, there were two 
                    groups of girls.  The Foxes were cute 
                    and fun...

                                  CRICKET

                    little sore, that s all.

      Darlene clandestinely understands the traumas of a boob job.

                                  DARLENE
                    Wish Alexandra Happy Birthday for me

                    How thin is Amanda?

    ON HEATHER who fires off another link.

                                  HEATHER (ON HEADSET)
                    See for yourself.

    ON SHARON opening the link, AMANDA S PHOTO pops up.

                                  SHARON (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
                    What do you think?  A size 2?

    At that moment, Sharon s son BOZEMAN (14) passes by, grabs a 
      handful of M&M sand scopes out AMANDA S PHOTO.

                                  BOZEMAN
                    Whoa.  Who s the MILF?

      Sharon instantly clicks off as we HEAR CHURCH BELLS.

      CLOSE ON AMANDA - SOUND ASLEEP DROOLING, BEDHEAD.

      INT. AMANDA S OLD ROOM - GIGI S HOUSE - SUNDAY MORNING

      Gigi, dressed in her Sunday Best, wakes Amanda.

                                  GIGI
                    Get up.  We re gonnabe late for 
                    church.

                                  AMANDA
                    Huh?  Church?  Oh, no.

                                  GIGI
                    Oh yes.  If you re going to live in my 
                    house, you re going to church.  Rules 
                    are rules.  

      EXT. HILLSIDE PARK CHURCH - MORNING

      Gigi leads a reluctant Amanda, Will and Sara to the church 
      entrance.  Amanda continues her protests.

                                  AMANDA
                    We didn t raise the kids with any 
                    particular religion, I encourage them 
                    to find their own spirituality.                                                                                        14.


                                  GIGI
                    Cut the Commie crap.My grandchildren 
                    are going to church so they can go to 
                    heaven.  End of story.  Amen.

      Gigi opens the church door.  They enter.

      INT. SANCTUARY - CHURCH SERVICE IN PROGRESS - DAY

      Amanda, Gigi and kids slip in unnoticed.  REV. WESLEY TUDOR, 
    the handsome young Minister asks for Prayer and Concerns...

                                  REV. WESLEY
                    ... and now, does anyone have Prayers 
                    for the People?
                          (Darlene raises hand)
                    Darlene?

      Darlene rises to give her prayer.  Amanda is shocked at 
      Darlene s va-voomness, whispering to her Mother...

                                  AMANDA
                      That sDarlene?

      Gigi shushes her and they bow their heads. We track Sharon, 
      Cricket and Heather s reaction as Darlene prays...

                                  DARLENE
                    This week, let us remember the parable 
                    of the prodigal son, or in our case, 
                    daughter.  We are overjoyed at the 
                    return this week of one of our own 
                    back into our fold. 
                          (Amanda s eyes pop open)
                    Let us open our hearts in support of 
                    her as she struggles to pick up the 
                    pieces of her shattered tragic life.  
                    And keep us ever mindful that the 
                      humiliation of sin, degradation, and 
                    lack of moral decency are not ours to 
                    judge... 

      Mortified Amanda whispers to Gigi. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Oh my God. She s praying for me.

      Gigi pats Amanda s knee reassuringly.

                                  GIGI
                    See?  People  round here care.

    But Amanda s creepedout.  All eyes turn to her.

      INT. ACTIVITY HALL - HILLSIDE PARK CHURCH - COFFEE HOUR

      Amanda, now really shell-shocked, maneuvers through the 
      stares and greetings of CHURCHGOERS at the coffee hour after 
    the service.  Amanda is rushed by Darlene.                                                                                        15.


                                  DARLENE
                    Amanda, Amanda, Amanda.  Welcome home.

      Darlene hugs Amanda as Heather, Cricket and Sharon approach 
    and greet her.   

                                  SHARON
                    Let me look at you, skinny-Minnie.

                                  AMANDA
                    I can t believe you even remember me.

      Cricket offers up air kisses with a smile of ice.

                                  CRICKET
                    How could we forget you?

      Heather is the warmest and most genuine of the bunch.

                                  HEATHER
                    So sorry to hear what you ve been 
                    through.  If there s anything...

      Amanda hears  Wow  and turns to see ZACK PEAVY, husband of 
      Sharon.  Former pro-ball player and in much better shape than 
    his food-loving wife, he s genuinely happy to see Amanda.

                                  AMANDA
                    Zack?  My God.  It s great to see you.

      Sharon bullets over to take possession of handsome hubby 
      Zack s arm.  She s not about to leave him alone with Amanda.

                                  ZACK
                    Sharon, doesn t Amanda look amazing?
                          (to Amanda)
                    I think you look even better than you 
                    did in high school.

                                  SHARON
                    Just gorgeous.

                                  AMANDA
                    Thank you.  And Sharon you re... 
                          (at a loss)
                    still married.  That s so wonderful. 

      Sharon and Zack s son Bozeman comes up to check out MILF
      Amanda.

                                  ZACK
                    Meet our son, Bozeman.  Bozeman, this 
                    is Mrs. Vaughn.

                                  BOZEMAN
                            (practically drooling)
                    Yeah.  My mom was checking you out 
                    online.  Did you date my dad in high 
                    school?

      Sharon wants the earth to swallow her up.                                                                                          16.


                                  AMANDA
                    Oh, no.  We were just friends.

                                  ZACK
                    Yep.  Back then, Amanda wouldn t give 
                    me the time of day.  She only dated 
                      quarterbacks.

                                  SHARON
                    Like Bill.  God rest his soul.
                            (hugsAmanda)
                    We re all so sorry sweetie.
                          (overher shoulder to 
                            Bozeman)
                    Time to go.  Let s find your sister.

      Sharon  releases Amanda, and moves off with her family. 
      Suddenly from behind, another pair of hands lift Amanda off 
    the floor and twirl her into a genuine hug. Amanda is 
      surprised to find herself in the arms of BLAKE CARUTH, 
      Cricket s dashingly handsome husband.  A few feet away, 
      Cricket watches with detached interest.

                                  AMANDA
                    Blake!  Oh, Blakey.Oh my God!   

                                  BLAKE
                    Mandy.  How does it feel to be back?

                                  AMANDA
                    Better.  Now that I ve seen you.

      Clearly a lottafeeling between these two.  Blake s tone 
      turns gentle.

                                  BLAKE
                    Well?  So?  How are ya?

                                  AMANDA
                    Well, ya know.  Life. I m sure you ve 
                    heard.

                                  BLAKE
                    Yeah.  You just never know.

      Cricket steps in.

                                  CRICKET
                    So true.  
                            (veiledsweetness)
                    If you hadn t stolen Bill away from me 
                    in high school, I might have been in 
                    your shoes today.  
                          (takesBlake s hand)
                    I d have lost the family business and 
                    I d never have married this one.
                          (hugsunsettled Amanda)
                    So.  Thank you. 

      ANGLE ON SARA who is approached by teen queen Alexandra and 
      MCKINNEY, Sharon s  pep squad  cute daughter.                                                                                        17.


                                  ALEXANDRA
                    You re Sara, right?  I m Alexandra, 
                    this is McKinney.

                                  SARA
                    Hi.  You go to Hillside?  

                                  MCKINNEY
                    It s awesome.  You ll love it. 

                                  SARA
                    It seems very different than my old 
                    school.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Well, wherever you went, Hillside s 
                    better.  

                                  MCKINNEY
                    Mom says you ve never been to Dallas 
                    even to visit.  How come?  Your 
                      grandmother s so cool.

                                  SARA
                    Did you ever see that old movie, Terms 
                    of Endearment?  Well, Gigi is like 
                    Shirley MacLaineand Mom s like Debra 
                      Winger.Only Mom didn t die.

      ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE COFFEE HOUR

      Darlene is with oilman husband RIPP and teenaged son LANDRY.  
      Darlene instructs Landry.

                                  DARLENE
                    Landry, be a darlin and go get Mama a 
                    coffee and a kolache.

      Landry leaves.  Darlene scopes Amanda talking to Blake.  Zack 
    has circled back to join Amanda.  Darlene comments to Ripp.

                                  DARLENE (CONT D)
                    That Amanda.  The men all run to her. 

                                  RIPP
                    She looks familiar.

                                  DARLENE
                    You wouldn t know her.  Amanda moved 
                    away after high school.  She was a 
                    monster, God love her, and sordid 
                      circumstances have moved her back here 
                    so we can forgive her.  

                                  RIPP
                          (more focused)
                    That sAmanda Vaughn?  

                                  DARLENE
                    Yes, darlin .                                                                                         18.


                                  RIPP
                    Married to Bill Vaughn?

                                  DARLENE
                    Was. Do you know her?

      Ripp s face clouds.

                                  RIPP
                    I knew him.

      ANGLE ON AMANDA AND HEATHER

      Amanda recognizes TOM HARRINGTON from a distance.  He s cute, 
    but clearly formerly a major nerd.  She comments to Heather.

                                  AMANDA
                    That s Tom Harrington?  What s he 
                    doing here?  He s Catholic.

                                  HEATHER
                    He converted when he married LouAnn. 
                    You know what happened to him, right?

                                  AMANDA
                    Who doesn t?  Super nerd who couldn t 
                    get up the courage to speak to us.  
                    Then he goes and invents cyberspace 
                    and now he s worth billions.  

                                  HEATHER
                    Squillions.He s re-invented rich. 

    Tom approaches Amanda and Heather.  Tentatively.

                                  TOM
                    Hi... Amanda.  I, uh, heard you were 
                    back in town and uh... wanted to say 
                    I m sorry about... uh... Bill.  Just 
                    awful.  Hey Heather.  

    He shyly backs away.  The buzz of all this homecoming is 
      overloading Amanda. She unloads on Heather.

                                  AMANDA
                    O.K.It s official.  I m freaking.

                                  HEATHER
                    Relax.  It s still just like high 
                    school.  Only now, people have real 
                    money and power.

      EXT. HILLSDALEPARK CHURCH - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

      Amanda, Gigi, Will and Sara leave.  

    As Amanda walks to the car, she can t help but notice the 
      Bulletin Board on the church lawn that announces today s 
      sermon topic -- YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.  Will questions the 
      phrase.                                                                                        19.


                                  WILL
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  AMANDA
                    That s Texan for Karma.

      Digesting the simple but potent theme, Amanda has a 
      revelation.  The light bulb goes on.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    You know what, mother? I think I just 
                    figured out why I m here.

    ACT TWO

      INT. AMANDA S OLD ROOM - GIGI S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Frustrated Amanda searches the internet for jobs.  As Gigi 
      enters, sipping coffee, Amanda vents.

                                  AMANDA
                    I thought Dallas supposedly weathered 
                    the recession.  Where are the jobs?

                                  GIGI
                    Darlin , you don t have to rush.  
                    You ve been through a lot.  Let me 
                    pick up the tab for awhile. There s 
                    nothing at stake.

                                  AMANDA
                    I m at stake.  Me, as a person, my 
                    identity. I ve got all sorts of wrongs 
                    I have to right.  Did you see how 
                    Cricket looked at me today?  She s 
                    hated me for almost two decades.  I ve 
                    got to fix that.  I ve got kids to 
                    raise and I can t afford to fail.   

                                  GIGI
                    I saw you talking to Tom Harrington.  
                    Work that.  He always liked you. 

                                  AMANDA
                     Work  that?  Stir up the marriage of 
                    the richest man in town?  I don t 
                    think that s the smartest way to re-
                    enter Dallas society.

                                  GIGI
                    You have to put yourself out there, 
                    honey.  The Lord will provide.

    As Amanda turns off her computer.

                                  AMANDA
                    Maybe.  But right now?  The Lord ain t 
                    hiring.

      INT. KITCHEN - GIGI S HOUSE - MORNING

    The hustle and bustle of morning.  Amanda and Gigi are 
      slinging breakfast.  The kids are obviously apprehensive 
      about school.  Amanda takes charge.

                                  AMANDA
                    Sit.  Eat. 
                          (theydo)
                    O.K., team Vaughn.  Today kicks off a 
                    whole new ball game.  And we re gonna
                    knock it out of the park.  Sure 
                    there llbe rough spots.  I m sure 
                    you ll hear nasty rumors about your 
                    Dad, about me.  But shake it off...                                                                                        21.


                                  SARA
                    What s with the sports metaphors? 

                                  WILL
                    It s because we re in Dallas now.

                                  AMANDA
                    I m just saying, be excited about your 
                    new life.  Carve out your niche.  Be 
                      yourselves.  Don t judge.  Don t be 
                    afraid.       

                                  GIGI
                          (the clock)
                    Don t be late for school?

      Amanda can t help herself.  She holds them tightly.

                                  AMANDA
                    O.K.I love you so much.  Go.  Get 
                    out there.  Be wonderful.

    The kids wrest themselves from her grasp and dash out the 
      front door.  Amanda expresses her true anxiety to Gigi.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    And just don t follow in my footsteps. 

      Gigi embraces her daughter in this emotional moment when we 
      HEAR Sara s BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.

      Panicked Amanda flies out the front door.

      EXT. GIGI S HILLSIDE PARK HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

      Sara s scream was inspired by a big MERCEDESparked in the 
      driveway with an enormous bow on its hood.

      Gigi sees the car and gets even more excited than Sara.

      Amanda is dumbfounded.  She opens the card addressed to 
       Amanda .   From a Secret Admirer .  

      INT. SHARON/ZACK S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

      Sharon s on her way out.  Zack is looking through his old 
      Hillside High Yearbook.  

                                  SHARON
                    Zack, what reyou looking at that for?

                                  ZACK
                    Just stubbing my toe on Memory Lane.

      Sharon looks over his shoulder.  He s looking at a candid 
      photo of CHEERLEADER AMANDA on FOOTBALL PLAYER ZACK S 
      shoulders.  Sharon gulps.

                                  ZACK (CONT D)
                    Remember?  I used to lift Amanda with 
                    one hand.                                                                                        22.


    He flips pages and runs across the SWIMSUIT PHOTO of SHARON.

                                  ZACK (CONT D)
                    And there youare.
                          (beat)
                    Were.

      Being super sensitive, Sharon snaps the yearbook shut.  Zack 
      checks himself out in the mirror, picks up his gym bag...

                                  ZACK (CONT D)
                    I m gonnastart hitting the gym at 
                    lunch.  

    Now Sharon s really starting to sweat.

      INT. HALLWAYS OF HILLSIDE PARK HIGH - DAY

      Sara is walking with Alexandra and McKinney.Sara s still 
      worked up about the gift Mercedes.

                                  MCKINNEY
                    Which model Mercedes?

                                  SARA
                      I dunno.Black.  Big. Huge.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    A secret admirer?

                                  SARA
                    Yes.  And the bow was bigger than me.

      McKinneyis blase about the whole thing.

                                  MCKINNEY
                    There s a shop in Highland Park 
                    Village that sells big bows like that.  
                    They giftwrap helicopters around here.

    TWO CHEERLEADERS pass Alexandra and point to her new boobs 
      approvingly as they pass.  They even identify the surgeon.

                                    CHEERLEADER #1
                    Dr. Mitchell?

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Of course.

                                    CHEERLEADER #2
                    I could tell.  Perfect.

      Sara looks at Alex s chest.  Is this for real?

                                  SARA
                    Seriously?

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Sure.  Starter boobs.                                                                                        23.


                                  SARA
                    What?  Why?

                                  MCKINNEY
                    You definitely just moved here.  

      Sara processes this as she walks away.  Alexandra waits til 
      Sara s out of earshot, then dials her cell.  INTERCUT

      INT. CRICKET S OFFICE/HEADQUARTERS CARUTH CORP - MORNING

      Mogul Cricket is behind her desk in the ranch-style 
      headquarters of her multi-company empire.  She s on the phone 
      with Alexandra while ASSISTANTS barrage her with business.

                                  CRICKET (ON PHONE)
                    Which model Mercedes?

                                  ALEXANDRA (ON CELL)
                    She had no idea.  Can you imagine?

                                  CRICKET (ON PHONE)
                    Ah ah.  Don t be a snob.  That s the 
                    way Amanda treated everyone.  
                          (ordersan ASSISTANT)
                    Rescind the offer.  I don t need any 
                    more hotels in Miami. Certainly not at 
                    that price per square foot. 
                          (backto Alexandra)
                    Be nice to Sara.  Your crowd must 
                    embrace her, otherwise you ll never 
                    find out the scoop.

    As Cricket hangs up, Blake enters her office with wardrobe 
      sketches.  He spreads out his western wear designs.

                                  BLAKE
                    I m about to green light a big order 
                    for the western wear division.  Sign. 

                                  CRICKET
                          (glancing at the designs)
                    Corduroy s back?

                                  BLAKE
                    Corduroy never goes away.  Because 
                    everyone s ass looks good in corduroy.

      Cricket signs the papers as ANOTHER ASSISTANT interrupts with 
      a PHOTOGRAPHER.

                                  ANOTHER ASSISTANT
                    Miss Cricket.  The photo?

                                  BLAKE
                    What s this one for?

                                  CRICKET
                    The Longhorn Ball souvenir poster.                                                                                         24.


    The Assistant presents Cricket with a choice of two Stetsons, 
      a WHITE and a BLUE.  Cricket reaches for the White.  Blake 
      puts the blue hat on her head.

                                  BLAKE
                    White washes you out. Blue brings out 
                    those cornflower eyes I fell for.

    As Cricket softens, she casually mentions to Blake...

                                  CRICKET
                    Someone gave Amanda a car.

                                  BLAKE
                          (with a smile)
                    Who?

    As the Photographer flashes, Cricket poses.

                                  CRICKET
                    Don t know.  It was from Zack s 
                      dealership.

                                  BLAKE
                    Well, you know Zack was always hot for 
                    Amanda in high school.

      Cricket considers.  Blake collects his sketches to leave.

                                  CRICKET
                    I made a reservation at Jeremiah s for 
                    dinner.

                                  BLAKE
                    Sorry.  I ll be at the ranch.

                                  CRICKET
                    Whatever.
                          (toAssistant)

                    traceable.  Oddly enough, it s not

                    But?                                                                                        26.


                                  TOM
                    Uh.  It s really nice.  But it s so 
                    big and now I m gonnabe alone.  I 
                    don t know if I d be comfortable.  
                    Before I spend this... uh... kind of 
                    money, I d really like to know if I 
                    could live in it.   Wish ya could take 
                    houses for test drives. 

                                  HEATHER
                    I get it.
                            (wheelsturning)
                    I have an idea.  It s unorthodox, but 
                    you re a special situation.  Let me 
                    arrange for you to spend the night 
                    here.  It ll give you better feel for 
                    the place.  

                                  TOM
                    That... er... good idea, Heather.

                                  HEATHER
                    Leave it to me.  Come back tonight at 
                    7:00.  I ll take care of everything.  
                    So sorry to hear your marriage is 
                    over.  It isover, isn t it?

                                  TOM
                    Oh yeah.  We re done.

      EXT. QUAD - HILLSIDE HIGH - LUNCHTIME

      ANGLE ON THE CORNER OF THE QUAD where loner Will skateboards 
    to a solitary spot with his lunch.

      A FOOT deliberately trips up Will, sending him sprawling.  
      It s Darlene s son Landry with Sharon s spawn Bozeman.

                                  WILL
                    Not cool.

    As Will picks himself up, dusts himself off...

                                  LANDRY
                    Definitely not as cool as the way your 
                    Daddy bought it.

                                  BOZEMAN
                          (high fives Landry)
                    Ouch!

      Will can t keep a lid on it.

                                  WILL
                    Don t you redneckshave a lunch date 
                    with some sheep or something?

                                  BOZEMAN
                    Tell you what -- I d definitely meet 
                    your mamabehind the barn.                                                                                        27.


      That s it.  They throw down.

      ANGLE WAY ACROSS THE QUAD

      Sara, Alexandra and McKinneynotice the scuffle.

      Alexandra tsksher disapproval.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Bullying.  Such a scourge.  Putting a 
                    stop to it is so important.

                                  SARA
                            (recognizing Will)
                    Wait!  That s my brother.  Will!

      INT. FARMER S MARKET - LATE LUNCH

      Amanda and Heather are having a quick lunch.

                                  AMANDA
                    A home for me and the kids is the top 
                    priority, but I have to get a job 
                    first.  

                                  HEATHER
                    I m happy to help, just let me know 
                    when you want to pull the trigger.
                    So... what kind of job are you looking 
                    for? 

                                  AMANDA
                    Well, I have some marketing experience 
                      --advertising for some boutiques. And 
                    I ve decorated some friends  homes in 
                    Santa Barbara.  

                                  HEATHER
                    Can you put together some photos of 
                    your work?

                                  AMANDA
                    Of course. 

                                  HEATHER
                    My friend Colleen may have something.  
                    I ll text you the deets.                                                                                        28.


      INT. CENTRAL MARKET - A LITTLE LATER

      Amanda and Heather chat as Heather shops for  test run  stuff 
    to impress Tom.  Heather selects some top shelf sushi.

                                  AMANDA
                    You re really puttin it on.

                                  HEATHER
                    Selling this house is a very big deal.

                                  AMANDA
                          (sniffs a candle Heather s 
                            bought)
                    You sure a house isn t all you re 
                    trying to sell?  You did say this 
                    guy s single, right?

                                  HEATHER
                          (smiles at Amanda s 
                            perception)
                    I wouldn t mind if the client gave me 
                    a test run along with the house.  

      They re at the wine racks.  Heather picks up a bottle which 
      Amanda disapproves and immediately puts back on the rack.

                                  AMANDA
                    No.  If you really mean business...
                          (another bottle)
                    Snake River Red 1996.  It s stunning.

      Heather considers the bottle.

                                  HEATHER
                    Yeow.So s the price.

                                  AMANDA
                    You said it was a big deal.

      Heather agrees and puts the bottle in the cart, reaching for 
      roses.  Amanda rejects again.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    No.  Too loud.  Hydrangeas.  Less 
                    obvious.

      Heather gets hydrangeas. Amanda s pleased, she s found a 
      friend.  Amanda s phone RINGS.

                    Hey.  It s Zack.  Listen I ve done 
                    some poking around.  I have a thought 
                    about that car that showed up in your 
                    driveway.                                                                                          29.

                    I m having some body work done and 
                    they ve messed up my colon.  Just a 
                    sec...

      REVEAL THE BODY SHOP where a WORKMAN is engraving a Bible 
      verse on Darlene s car s bumper.  She corrects him.

                                  DARLENE (CONT D)
                    Darlin .It s  John 3:16 .  The colon 
                    goes BETWEEN the 3 and the 16.
                          (backto Ripp)
                      I shouldn t be too much longer.

      INT. PEAVY MOTORS - AROUND 6:00

      Amanda heads to Zack s office.  People are leaving for the 
      day.  The glass-walled showroom s shutting down.

      INT. BODY SHOP - AT THAT MOMENT

      Darlene watches as the Workman polishes off his engraving of 
      John 3:16.

                                  DARLENE
                    Perfect.  Thanks so much.

      Darlene gets in the car.

      INT. ZACK S OFFICE - DAY

      Amanda enters Zack s office with anticipation.

                                  AMANDA
                    Well?  Who do you think gave me the 
                    car?

      Zack closes the door, the blinds for  privacy .  But they 
      don t close all the way.  Then he turns to Amanda.                                                                                        30.


                                  ZACK
                    No idea.

                                  AMANDA
                    But you said you had a thought.

                                  ZACK
                    I do.  My thought is, I wish I d 
                    thought of it.

                                  AMANDA
                      C mon.Why?.

                                  ZACK
                    Amanda, you were the love of my life.   

                                  AMANDA
                    No, Zack.  Easy. Please don t... 

                                  ZACK
                    When I saw you Sunday, all the 
                    feelings came flooding back.  I m 
                    drowning the in very thought of you...

                                  AMANDA
                    You re married.  Tread water.

      Zack can t help himself.  He grabs Amanda and kisses her 
      passionately.

    AT THAT MOMENT

      ANGLE ON DARLENE as she drives by the outside of Zack s 
      office and clocks THE KISS between Zack and Amanda through 
    the partially closed blinds.

    ON DARLENE BEHIND THE WHEEL

      Shocked Darlene slams on the brakes.  She pauses to absorb  
      what this means, then floors it.

                                                                                BACK TO:

                    No.  No.This did not happen.  Get a 
                    grip, Zack.

    She gets away from Zack as fast as she can.

                                                                                FADE OUT.                                                                                        31.


    ACT THREE

      INT. RIPP S OIL BARON OFFICE - EVENING

      Darlene can t get the story of the Amanda/Zack kiss out fast 
      enough.  Ripp listens, his boots propped on his desk.

                                  DARLENE
                    Amanda s only been back in town for a 
                    minute and she s already up to her old 
                    tricks.  I don t know what to say to 
                    Sharon. 

                                  RIPP
                    You don t say nothing.

                                  DARLENE
                    But... if I know something and don t 
                    tell her, is it a lie?  
                          (reachesfor his computer)
                    I ll Googleit.

      Ripp s hand stops her.

                                  RIPP
                    You can t go messing in Sharon and 
                    Zack s relationship.  You getting in 
                    the middle lljust cause you trouble.  
                    Sharon needs to find out on her own.  
                    Praying for her is all you can do.

      Darlene takes a long hard look at her husband.

                                  DARLENE
                    You are so smart.  I am so blessed to 
                    have found a husband like you.  I wish 
                    everyone s marriage could be as happy 
                    and secure and spiritually grounded as 
                    ours.

                                  RIPP
                    Me, too.  
                          (a long look)
                    Wanna do it on the desk?

                                  DARLENE
                    Sure.

      Darlene climbs on the desk in her heels, turning down FRAMED 
      PICTURES of son Landry and Jesus.

                    always helped with guy stuff.  I m on

      Amanda s about to press harder but there s a SCREAM.  

                                  GIGI (O.C.)
                    Amanda.  Get down here.  Right now!

    The Dobermans bark O.C. likecrazy.  Gidget yaps and bolts, 
      too. Terrified Amanda dashes.

      EXT. GIGI S HOUSE - DAY

    As Amanda blasts out the front door, a lottaactivity in 
      front of Gigi s house.

      A NEIMAN MARCUS delivery truck is delivering half the store, 
      stacking the boxes at the front door.  Gigi is ecstatic.  
      Lupehangs onto the Crazy Dogs.  Sara s joined the fray.

                                  GIGI
                    Look at all this!

      JOBETH MARIE presents herself to Amanda.

                                  JOBETH
                    Amanda Vaughn? I m Jobeth Marie, your 
                    personal NeimanMarcus shopper. So 
                    nice to meet you.

                                  AMANDA
                    Likewise, Jobeth but this is a 
                    mistake. I m not shopping...

                                  JOBETH
                    Well, someone is.  This is all for 
                    you. 

                                  SARA
                    Secret admirer strikes again.                                                                                        33.


      A DELIVERY GUY rolls a rack of clothes past Gigi. 

                                  GIGI
                    Ooo.He s got good taste.

                                  AMANDA
                    What?  Take it all back.  

      Gigi snags a little black Chaneloff the rack.

                                  GIGI
                    Not this one.

      Amanda instructs Gigi re: the NM boxes.

                                  AMANDA
                    Mother, this is unacceptable.  

                                  JOBETH
                    But...

      Gigi slips inside with the black Chaneldress.  

                                  AMANDA
                    No buts.  Back.  All of it.

      ESTABLISH EVENING OVER GIGI S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

    The NeimanMarcus delivery truck is pulling away.

      INT. KITCHEN - GIGI S HILLSIDE PARK HOUSE - EVENING

      Photos of Amanda s design work are spread everywhere.  She s 
      putting them in a portfolio. Gigi enters wearing the little 
      black Chanel.She presents Amanda with a piece of plastic.  

                                  GIGI
                    Jobeth Marie left a gift card to 
                    replace the loot you returned.

                                  AMANDA
                    BUT I DON T WANT IT!

      Exasperated Amanda throws the card on the table.

                                  GIGI
                    Neiman sdoesn t take  no  for an 
                    answer!  Besides, you re going to need 
                    a new outfit for the Longhorn Ball.

                                  AMANDA
                    I m not going to the Longhorn Ball.  

                                  GIGI
                    How else are the eligible men going to 
                    know you re in town?  If you don t put 
                    it in the window, how s anybody gonna
                    know it s for sale?                                                                                        34.


                                  AMANDA
                    I m not a heifer, Mom.

                                  GIGI
                    Exactly.  You re not young enough to 
                    be a heifer.

      Amanda explodes.  She lunges for her cell.

                                  AMANDA
                    I have to got to get outtahere!

      Amanda dials  HEATHER , gets voice mail.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Heather?  Amanda.   Help me. I m ready 
                    to pull the trigger on that house. 

      ANGLE ON HEATHER S PHONE which is on  Ignore .

      INT. SHOW HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT - EARLY EVENING

      Candles are lit.  Sushi spread out.  Hydrangeas everywhere.  
    Tom strolls through the house.  He s impressed.  Heather 
      pours him a glass of wine, very  all systems go .

                                  TOM
                    Heather.  You re amazing.

      Heather almost purrs as she hands him the glass, her cleavage 
      very much in evidence.

                                  HEATHER
                    So?  You like what you see?

                                  TOM
                    Very much.

    As Heather reaches for a second glass for herself...

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  Good night.

      Heather realizes it s a closure  thank you .  Smoothly, she 
      puts down her glass, masking her disappointment.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    I ll call you tomorrow and tell you 
                    what I think.

    The ultimate professional, Heather leaves.

      ANGLE ON HEATHER as she leaves the house.  Her disappointment 
      gets the best of her.   DOORBELL.

      INT. GIGI S HILLSIDE PARK HOUSE - EVENING

      Amanda answers the door to dejected Heather.                                                                                        35.


                                  HEATHER
                    I was driving by when I got your 
                    message. Everything OK? You sounded 
                    frantic. 

                                  AMANDA
                    I just don t know how many more days I 
                    can spend under the same roof as my 
                    mother.

                                  HEATHER
                    That s exactly what you used to say 
                    when we were kids.

                                  AMANDA
                          (smiles)
                    Funny.  
                            (suddenlynotices)
                    Wow.  You look fantastic.  

      Heather is vulnerable, needs to talk.

                                  HEATHER
                    Not fantastic enough.

      Amanda realizes things with her  client  must vederailed.

                                  AMANDA
                    Didn t close the deal, huh?

      Heather s embarrassment rises.  She backs away.

                                  HEATHER
                      I shouldn t have dropped by.  Sorry.

                                  AMANDA
                    Please stay.  The kids have homework.  
                    Gigi s out and I can finally hear 
                    myself think. C monin.  

      LATER IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Heather is showing Amanda some properties on her IPAD.She 
      describes a listing, rattling the gossipy facts.

                                  HEATHER
                    ... now this is a really cute 
                    townhouse.  Not for sale, but could be 
                    rented.  The owner, who shall remain 
                    nameless of course, uses it to keep 
                    her boy toys hidden from her husband, 
                    but her full-time  PilatesInstructor  
                    is about to ditch her for a hotter 
                      Sugarmamain Ft. Worth which will send 
                    our devastated owner straight to the 
                    body shop in Rio which means she won t 
                    be picking up another Mr. Jiggyuntil 
                    her scars heal.  So.  I could get you 
                    the townhouse cheap for about six 
                    months?                                                                                         36.


                                  AMANDA
                    Wow.  How do you know all this?

                                  HEATHER
                    I m in real estate.  It s the job.

      More wine for Heather.  Amanda pours herself ginger ale.

                                  HEATHER (CONT D)
                    Don t take this the wrong way.  But 
                    you re so different from the way you 
                    used to be.

                                  AMANDA
                    I hope that s a compliment.

                                  HEATHER
                    I know I was your friend in high 
                    school, but that was basically in self 
                    defense  cause I didn t want to be on 
                    your bad side.  

                                  AMANDA
                    O.K. Might as well start the 
                    apologies with you.  I hadn t realized 
                    how much pain I d caused until I came 
                    back here.  From now on, no agendas.  
                    No manipulation.  Honesty, no  
                    secrets...

      Amanda s CELL RINGS.  She answers.  INTERCUT

      INT. SHOW HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

    Tom is pouring himself another glass of wine from the bottle 
      Heather opened.  He s getting a little tipsy.

                                  TOM (ON PHONE)
                    Hey, Amanda.  Tom Harrington.  Uh... 
                    look... I was wondering if you d like 
                    to get together for a little high 
                    school reunion?  It s not exactly 
                    public knowledge - but I m recently 
                    single - just like you.  Well not 
                    exactly like you...I mean the 
                      circumstances weren t quite as 
                    tragic...

      Amanda has no idea that Tom is Heather s  secret client .

                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                    How sweet.  But I shouldn t...

                                  TOM (ON PHONE)
                    You sure? ..  I m checking out this 
                    cool new... crib.  Got some great 
                    sushi.  A bottle of Snake River Red, a 
                     96.

      Realization SLAMS Amanda that Tom is the  client  that 
      Heather s hot for.                                                                                             37.


                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                    No!  I mean... really, I can t.

                                  TOM (ON PHONE)
                    Well.  Rain check?  

                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                    I ll call you.

                                  TOM (ON PHONE)
                    Amanda?  I m glad you re back.

      Amanda looks at unsuspecting Heather sitting next to her.  
      Heather smiles back.  This would kill Heather.  Rattled 
      Amanda hangs up the phone and tries to focus.  

                                  AMANDA
                    Um... what was I saying?

                                  HEATHER
                    Honesty?  No secrets?

      Amanda gulps. DING DONG.  Amanda s saved by the DOORBELL.

      Amanda opens the door to Cricket, Sharon and Darlene.

                                  THE GCB S
                    Surprise!

      Darlene lugs a  Dallas Survival Kit  basket.

      Sharon gestures to bottles of wine in the basket.

                                  SHARON
                    We didn t know if you were a red or 
                    white girl.

                                  AMANDA
                    Actually neither.  I m sober 6 years.

      Darlene forms her trademark compassion face.  

                                  DARLENE
                    Don t beat yourself up.  Remember, 
                    Jesus drank wine.  Preferred it to 
                    water.  Feast of Cana.  Look it up.

      Cricket chirps.

                                  CRICKET
                    The closest I could ever get to 
                    abstinence is no salt on my margarita.

      Sharon who s suspicious of everything, is thrown by Heather s 
      presence at Amanda s.  She stares accusatorily at Heather.

                                  SHARON
                    Heather!  How cute you re here.

      A LITTLE LATER                                                                                        38.


      Amanda is pouring wine for Heather, Cricket, Darlene, Sharon, 
      then refreshing her own ginger ale.  The Welcome basket has 
      been pillaged.

                                  CRICKET
                    And this is a gift membership to Lone 
                    Star Fitness Centers.  You can go to 
                    any of  em.  I own  em all.

                                  DARLENE
                    And of course if you need a cowgirl 
                    look, call Cricket.  One of her 
                    companies makes great western wear.  
                    Blake designs the cutest chaps.

                                  CRICKET
                    Just give a shout.  I ll get you all 
                    set up for the Longhorn Ball. 

      Amanda changes the subject, referring to a sheet of paper.

                                  AMANDA
                    So these are numbers for the 
                      pediatricians, gynecologists...

      Cricket hands her a thicker stack of physician s numbers...

                    And these are the doctors for when you 
                    feel the need to  freshen up .  

                                  SHARON
                    And there s no stigma attached to it 
                    in Dallas.  

                                  DARLENE
                    I won t lie to you.  I have hair 
                      extensions.

    The Others swallow their tongues at this understatement of 
    the century. 

                                  HEATHER
                    But!  Should you decide to have work 
                    done, always check the car the doctor 
                    drives.  Ferrari?  Hire him.  If he 
                    drives a Jettait means he s lost the 
                    lawsuits.

      Sharon gets to the topic of her real fear.

                                  SHARON
                    We ve heard you have a secret admirer.  
                    Cars, Neiman sboxes.  

                                  AMANDA
                    How did you know that?

                                  SHARON
                    Sara textedCricket s daughter who 
                    told McKinneywho told me.                                                                                          39.


                    Your daughter also said you went by 
                    the dealership to talk to Zack. 

      Darlene s antennae go up, her accusatory gaze lands on 
      Amanda.  Amanda wants to avoid Zack discussions at all costs.

                                  AMANDA
                    Word travels fast.  Just like old 
                    times.  Only with better technology.

                                  CRICKET
                    Not exactly.  In  old times  I 
                    wouldn t been included in that info 
                    daisy chain.  I was a Javelina, 
                    remember?

      Amanda grimaces.  Darlene smacks Cricket s hand lightly.

                                  DARLENE
                    Now, now.  Ancient history, Crick.

                                  HEATHER
                    What dyou get from Neiman s?

                                  AMANDA
                    I don t know.  I sent it all back.  
                    But then they left me a gift card.  
                    It s kindaexasperating, really.  

                                    SHARON/DARLENE
                    For how much?/You have no idea who s 
                    doing this?

    ON DARLENE whose wheels are turning.  She sgetting an idea.

      Amanda just wants to end this while she s ahead.

                                  AMANDA
                    Don t know.  Don t care.  Look at the 
                    time.  School night.

      A LITTLE LATER

    The GCB s are leaving.  As she leaves, Darlene s eye lands on 
    the NEIMAN S GIFT CARD ENVELOPE Amanda had tossed on the 
      table.  Nowher idea is locked and loaded.

      AMANDA says farewell as the gracious hostess.  Air kisses.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Thank you so much.  This means alot to 
                    me.  You have no idea.

                                  CRICKET
                    Let s work out someday.  I have my 
                    very own full time Pilatesinstructor.

      WHAT?!                                                                                          40.


      Amanda shoots a glance to Heather who instantly looks away.  
      Cricket s the one with a boy toy who s about to dump her? 
      That secret s out now.  Heather quickly closes the door.   

      INT. DARLENE S CAR - IN MOTION - NIGHT

      Cricket drives Darlene and Sharon.

                                  SHARON
                    Am I the only one that finds it odd 
                    Heather was there?

                                  CRICKET
                    I m sure she s trying to interest 
                    Amanda in some overpriced real estate.  
                    More power to her.  It s important to 
                    stick it to Amanda any way we can.

                                  DARLENE
                    Cricket!  What about forgive and 
                    forget?

                                  CRICKET
                    I m a Texan.  Amanda is my own 
                    personal Alamoand I plan to remember 
                    it.

                                  DARLENE
                    Well, I think it was a very profitable 
                    evening.

                                  SHARON
                    But we learned absolutely nothing.

                                  DARLENE
                    Not entirely.

    She holds up the Neiman sGift Card.  Sharon is aghast.

                                  SHARON
                    Darlene Cockburn.You broke number 8?

                                  DARLENE
                    No. I did not steal. This is research.  
                    And it s not like I m going to keep 
                    it.  We ll have it back to Amanda 
                    before she even knows it s gone.

                                  SHARON
                    Me?!  Why me?

                                  DARLENE
                    Because knowledge is power, darlin .
                    And I can t do everythingaround here 
                    myself.                                                                                         41.


      INT. DARLENE/RIPP BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Darlene slips into bed with Ripp.

                                  RIPP
                    How dit go?

                                  DARLENE
                    Perfect.  I didn t have to tell Sharon 
                    anything.  She s gonnafind out for 
                    herself.

      Darlene smiles and turns off the light.

      INT. SHOW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

      Heather arrives to see if the house met Tom s approval.  She 
      knocks.  The door is ajar.  She opens it.  The first thing 
    she sees is pair of panties on the floor.  She s confused.

                                  HEATHER
                    Hello?

      ANOTHER ANGLE - the living room is a mess.  Heather s 
      shocked.

      EXT. POOL - THE SHOW HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Heather sees something floating in the pool.  She gets a pool 
      hook and fishes out a bra. Heather is reeling from what 
      must vegone on here.  

      Then she s startled when a BIMBO in a towel rushes up, 
      snatches the bra from Heather with a relieved...

                                  BIMBO
                    There it is!

                                  HEATHER
                    Uh... is... isTom here?

      A beat of recognition flashes across the Bimbo s face.  She 
      scurries and yells up the stairs.

                                  BIMBO
                    Tom!  His name was Tom!

      Another BIMBETTE bounces down the stairs buttoning up, 
      remembering...

                                  BIMBETTE
                    I told you his name was Tom or Tim or 
                    something like that.

    The Bimbette takes the panties from a stunned Heather with a 
      perky,  Thanks .

    The two girls scamper out of the mansion leaving Heather 
      trying not to hyperventilate.                                                                                        42.

      INT. NEIMAN S BUSINESS OFFICES - MORNING

      Sharon presents herself to a MANAGER and hands him Amanda s 
      gift card.  She lies, as scripted by Darlene.

                                  SHARON
                    I was given this gift card.  Can I get 
                    some information about it?

    The Manager swipes the card.  His eyes widen.

                                  MANAGER
                    There s 98,728.32 left.

      Sharon almost passes out.  She had no clue it was so much.

                                  SHARON
                    Uh.  Wow.  Um... actually I wanted to 
                    know who gave it to me.  So I can 
                    write a proper  thank you  note.  

      Another NM ASSOCIATE appears with a ANOTHER SUIT.  Amanda s 
      card has created security interest.

                                  MANAGER
                    Certainly, Ms... 
                          (checks his computer)
                    ...Vaughn.  May we see some ID?

      Sharon stammers.  That wasn t in Darlene s script.

                                  SHARON
                    Uh, uh, uh.

      Sharon backs away.

      ANGLE ON SHARON who can t puff herself out of the store fast 
      enough.

      EXT. PARKING LOT - NORTHPARK MALL - MOMENTS LATER

      Sharon runs and dives into Darlene s car, ducks down.

                                  SHARON
                    Drive it like you stole it.

      INT. HOTEL CONSULTANT OFFICE - LATE MORNING

      Amanda s interview for the consultant position with Heather s 
      friend COLLEEN (30 s) is going well.  Amanda shows her 
      portfolio.                                                                                          43.

                    If your new boutique hotel division is 
                    going for a breezy casual California 
                    makeover, I m your girl.

                                  COLLEEN
                    Your sensibilities seem perfect. 
                          (the portfolio)
                    And your house is flat out amazing.  

                                  AMANDA
                    Was.  I don t live in Santa Barbara 
                    anymore.

                                  COLLEEN
                    You have a great eye.  And I owe 
                    Heather big time.  She got me such a 
                    deal on my house.
                          (downto business)
                    Can you start tomorrow?

      Amanda almost cries she s so relieved to have a job.

                                  AMANDA
                      Absolutely.

      Amanda is being shown the full tape of Sharon trying to get

                                  MANAGER
                    Shall we call the police?

      Amanda thinks long and hard as she looks at the mug shot.

                                  AMANDA
                    No.  She s an old friend.  She was 
                    trying to be helpful.

                                  MANAGER
                    So... no further action required?

                                  AMANDA
                    Not that youneed to do.  Thank you so

                    Yeah.  You know... cheerleader?  Pep

                                  SARA
                    That s considered an ambition?

                    We re not going to the Longhorn Ball.

      Alexandra and McKinneyreact with shock then sympathy.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Then you have to tell everyone you re

                    That s stupid.  We re not going to the

                    Amanda?  A word?

      ANGLE ON AMANDA AND COLLEEN IN THE HALLWAY -- Colleen 
      reluctantly dropping the bomb.

                                  COLLEEN (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  It s not working out.

      Amanda s floored.

                                  AMANDA
                    Not working out?  I just got here.

                                  COLLEEN
                    It s a corporate decision from the 
                    top.  The renovation of the properties 
                    has been postponed.  It s the economy.  
                    It s not you.

      Amanda tries to suck up her disappointment as Colleen leaves.

      ANGLE ON COLLEEN DIALING - unhappy about what she s done.  

                                  COLLEEN (ON CELL) (CONT D)
                    O.K.I did it.  She s fired.

      INT. CRICKET S OFFICE/HEADQUARTERS CARUTH CORP - THAT MOMENT

                                  CRICKET (ON CELL)
                    Thank you.

                                                                                FADE OUT.                                                                                        46.


    ACT FOUR

      INT. JEREMIAH S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Amanda joins Heather at the bar, who s also trying to wash 
      away the disappointments of her day.   

      JEREMIAH (silver fox 40 s), the proprietor, approaches.

                                  JEREMIAH
                    Amanda.   Heard you were back.  Was 
                    wondering when you d make it in here.  
                    Buy you a drink?

                                  AMANDA
                    I d love a vodka rocks.  But give me a 
                    club soda.

      Jeremiah leaves.  Heather is all compassion to Amanda.

                                  HEATHER
                    Bummer about the job.  So odd.  I ll 
                    get to the bottom of it. 

                                  AMANDA
                    It s just part of the whole  reap what 
                    you sow  mess I ve gotta work through.

                                  HEATHER
                    Yeah.  I had the same thing with my 
                          secret-client-and-the-show-house 
                      expectations.  And boy, did I get 
                     reaped .

      Jeremiah returns with drinks and a wink for Amanda.

                                  HEATHER (CONT D)
                    God, Jeremiah s so handsome.

                                  AMANDA
                          (a quiet confession)
                    You know he was my first.  

                                  HEATHER
                    Really?  I didn t know you guys ever 
                    dated.

                                  AMANDA
                    Dated?  Who said dated?  

      ANGLE ON THE FRONT DOOR OF JEREMIAH S where dashing Blake 
      Caruthjust walked in.  No question Blake is very popular, a 
      local favorite.  He heads directly to Amanda and Heather.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Hey, Blakey.Where s Cricket?

                                  BLAKE
                    Working out.  I m having dinner with 
                    an employee.  Wanna join us?                                                                                        47.


                                  HEATHER
                    No thanks.  
                          (raisesher scotch)
                    We re just wallowing.

                                  BLAKE
                    Aww.Pretty girls like you shouldn t 
                    wallow.

                                  AMANDA
                    It was my first day at work.  And my 
                    last.  My plug was pulled.

                                  BLAKE
                    Where was the job?

                                  AMANDA
                    Hill Country Hotel Group.

                                  BLAKE
                    But... that s one of Cricket s 
                    companies.  Her family bought a 
                      controlling stake in it a couple of 
                    months ago.

      Heather and Amanda exchange a look.  Now Amanda totally gets 
      what went down.  Heather apologizes.

                                  HEATHER
                    I had no idea.  Her family goes 
                    through companies like Kleenex.

                                  BLAKE
                    I ll talk to Cricket...

      Amanda laughs at the thought.

                                  AMANDA
                    Don t bother. I think somebody already 
                    did. 

    AT THAT MOMENT Tom Harrington walks up to Amanda, Blake and 
      Heather.  Amanda braces.  Heather steels herself.

                                  TOM
                    Hey.  Uh.  Heather.  I meant to call 
                    you about the house.  Not the right 
                    vibefor me. It was kind of a crazy 
                    night.  I don t usually drink.  I 
                    don t remember all that much.  

                                  HEATHER
                          (as sweetly as possible)
                    The cleaning bill will remind you.

                                  TOM
                    Oh, Jeez.I m sorry.  Well.  Uh...  
                          (to Amanda)
                    Do you ladies have dinner plans?                                                                                        48.


      Amanda decides to give Heather an assist with an instant 
      change of plans.    

                                  AMANDA
                    I m having dinner with Blake. Why 
                    don t you two go on without me?

      Amanda plops Tom on the stool next to Heather and drags Blake 
      into the restaurant.

      ANGLE ON AMANDA AND BLAKE S TABLE - LATER

      Amanda and Blake are having a blast.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Now that I know Cricket owns the 
                    company, I m not so upset.  Working 
                    for her would not be a walk in State 
                    Fair Park.

                                  BLAKE
                      C mon.She s not that bad.

                                  AMANDA
                    She hates me.  Still. And I don t 
                    blame her.  At least you ll give me 
                    the time of day.  

                                  BLAKE
                    The night is young.  That can change.
                          (he sidles closer, 
                            confidentially)
                    Hey.  How do you feel about corduroy?

                                  AMANDA
                    Love.  Always makes my ass look good.

                                  BLAKE
                    Then you understand what s important 
                    about clothes.  It s all about the 
                    ass.
                          (beat)
                    You re hired.

    He clinks Amanda s glass.

                                  AMANDA
                    Really? To do what?

                                  BLAKE
                    Help me with re-branding my apparel 
                    company.  It s been in business since 
                    1946 and the name is a contemporary 
                    marketing challenge.  

      Blake hands her his business card.  She laughs.

                                  AMANDA
                     Westward Ho! ?  I see the problem.                                                                                        49.


    AT THAT MOMENT - Blake s dinner companion BOOTH BECKER, a 
      hunkyyoung cowboy comes up.  Blake introduces.

                                  BLAKE
                    Amanda.  Booth Becker, my ranch 
                    foreman.

                                  BOOTH
                    Pleasure. Sorry I m late.  Two horses 
                    foaling. Beauties...

    As Booth and Blake rattle on about the farm, Amanda reaches 
      under the table to pick up her purse.  HER POVis of them 
      holding hands.  She gets Blake s subtext now.

                                  AMANDA
                    I d better go.

                                    BLAKE/BOOTH
                    No/Stay/Why?

                                  BLAKE
                    I ll call you tomorrow about the job.

      Amanda blows him a kiss as she heads out of the dining room.

    AT THE BAR - Heather sits alone.  Amanda swings by.  Amanda 
      watches Heather hide her disappointment.

                                  HEATHER
                    Tom had a previous engagement.

      Amanda doesn t want to let on she knows about Heather s 
      interest in Tom (her  client ), but she wants to be a friend.

                                  AMANDA
                    If you like him, don t take  no  for 
                    an answer.  Life s too short and it 
                    can change so quickly.  Take it from 
                    me.

    She gives Heather a hug.  Then directs Heather s attention to 
      Blake and Booth.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Sooo... Blake and Cricket?

      Heather takes a beat to catch her drift, then:

                                  HEATHER
                    Cricket was a rich Javelina who 
                    married a poor cowboy who loves to 
                    dance, travel, shop and make her feel 
                    beautiful.   Don t ask don t tell  is 
                    not just for the military.

                                  AMANDA
                    Do they have sex?

                                  HEATHER
                    At least once.  They have a daughter.                                                                                        50.


                                  AMANDA
                          (finishes the thought)
                    So Cricket doesn t mind if he 
                    scratches his itches as long as she 
                    gets to -- do Pilateswhenever she s 
                    horny?

                                  HEATHER
                    Those are the dots.  Connect them any 
                    way you wish.

      Amanda wraps her head around yet another revelation.

                                  AMANDA
                    No wonder Blake never looked at my 
                    boobs in high school.
                          (looksaround)
                    I want to tell Jeremiah good night.

      Heather nods to a dark table in the corner.

      ANGLE ON THE DARK TABLE where Jeremiah is making out sloppily 
      with a woman.    

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    God, don t let that be my mother.

      Looks closer, realizes, with horror...

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    It is my mother.  Can this day please 
                    be over?

                                  HEATHER
                          (signals for another 
                          drink)
                    Better just roll with it.  Because 
                    tomorrow s there s gonnabe another 
                    one just like it.

      INT. BEDROOM - CRICKET/BLAKE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Cricket s in bed reading.  Blake enters.

                                  CRICKET
                    You re late.

                                  BLAKE
                    Just passing through.  I m spending 
                    the night on the ranch.

    He grabs a pair of boots.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    By the way.  I know what you did to 
                    Amanda.  That was mean.

                                  CRICKET
                    So is she.                                                                                        51.


                                  BLAKE
                    Let it go. That was 20 years ago.  

                                  CRICKET
                    People don t change.

                                  BLAKE
                    Wrong.  Sometimes people don t change 
                    enough.  Good night.

                                  CRICKET
                          (with bitterness)
                    Ride  em cowboy.

                                  BLAKE
                    I intend to.

      INT. AMANDA S OLD ROOM - GIGI S HOUSE - SUNDAY MORNING

      CHURCH BELLS.  Amanda s asleep.  Gigi enters, all dressed up.

                                  GIGI
                    Get up.  You know the rules.


      INT. HALLWAY HILLSIDE CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

      Sharon, Darlene, Heather and Cricket are in intense recap.

                                  DARLENE
                    Amanda hasn t mentioned the gift card?  

                                  SHARON
                    Nothing.  Not a word.  I m terrified.

                                  CRICKET
                    You should be.  You know how 
                    diabolical she can be. 

                                  HEATHER
                    What about the gift card?

                                  SHARON
                          (the wounded victim)
                    Darlene was trying to help Amanda find 
                    out who was sending her all those 
                    expensive gifts, so she made me...

      ANGLE ON AMANDA, GIGI, ET AL entering the Hallway.

      Amanda sees the GCB s gathered, listening to Sharon s version 
    of the gift card.  Amanda pauses, telling Gigi...

                                  AMANDA
                    Should I lower the boom on Sharon in 
                    front of them, or solo?

                                  GIGI
                    Be careful.  If you re gonnastay 
                    here, you re gonnahave to deal.  They 
                    have kids, you have kids.                                                                                          52.


                    And once upon a time, you were worse 
                    than all of  em put together.

      INT. SANCTUARY - A LITTLE LATER

    Hot Reverend Wesley Tudor is beginning the sermon.

                                  WESLEY
                    I hope some of you were able to 
                    reflect on last week s sermon,  You 
                    reap what you sow .  

      QUICK GLANCES all around.  Man, did they ever.

                                  WESLEY (CONT D)
                    This week, I want to us to realize, 
                     To err is human, to forgive, divine .

      Yikes.Amanda hears that.  Gigi sees Amanda s reaction and 
      whispers...

                                  GIGI
                    I think you ll find this church 
                    thing s right on the money.

      Amanda nods.  She looks at Will and Sara.  She ponders.

      INT. GIGI S IMPRESSIVE CLOSET - DAY

      Gigi finds Amanda rummaging in Gigi s closet.

                                  GIGI
                    What reyou doing?

      Amanda pulls out a couple of Gigi s rockin western shirts 
    and plops a bedazzled Stetsonon her head.

                                  AMANDA
                    Looking for something to wear to the  
                    Longhorn Ball.

                                  GIGI
                    So now you re going?  Why?

                                  AMANDA
                    Because forgiveness is divine and I 
                    plan to look as divine as hell.

                                                                                FADE OUT.                                                                                        53.


    ACT FIVE

      EXT. THE LONGHORN BALL - NIGHT

    ALL OUR DENIZENS OF HILLSIDE PARK are dressed in their finest 
      Western Wear and staggering jewels.

    ON THE KIDS waiting for their turn to ride the MECHANICAL 
      BULL.  Will keeps his distance from Landry and Bozeman.  Sara 
    is in line with Alexandra and McKinney.

    ON AMANDA AND HEATHER as they scope out the CROWD.

                                  AMANDA
                    I d forgotten how amazing this party 
                    is.

                                  HEATHER
                    Best meat market in the world.
                          (sincerely)
                    Amanda Vaughn - can I just tell you 
                    how happy I am that you re back in 
                    Dallas. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Honestly?

                                  HEATHER
                    I hadn t realized how boring things 
                    had become since you left. 

      Amanda hugs her.

                                  AMANDA
                      Sweetheart, that s the nicest thing 
                    I ve heard in a long time. I needed 
                    that. Thank you.

      Heather spies Tom Harrington over Amanda s shoulder. 

                                  HEATHER
                    Excuse me...

      ANGLE ON TOM as Heather approaches.

                                  HEATHER (CONT D)
                    I m sorry the house didn t work for 
                    you the other night.

                                  TOM
                          (blushes)
                    I, gosh, I should probably explain 
                    what happened.  I invited over my COO 
                    and he was with some cheerleaders...

                                  HEATHER
                    No explanation necessary.  Let s keep 
                    looking.  There are other things I 
                    want to show you.                                                                                        54.


    She walks off.  Tom s POVof Heather walking away.  Her 
      outfit is basically backless.  He gets the message.

      ANGLE ON THE MECHANICAL BULL where Alexandra is riding it.  
      Sara and McKinneycheer her on.  Suddenly, on a particularly 
      violent buck, Alexandra s wardrobe malfunctions.  Her NEW 
      BOOBS pop out of her bustier.

      Cricket and Blake rush up as Sara and McKinneyhelp Alexandra 
    off the bull.  Blake throws a horse blanket around his 
      mortified daughter.

                                  CRICKET
                    I told you.  Didn t I tell you?  
                    They re too big.  Aren t you glad you 
                    didn t get the 36 s?

      ANGLE ON THE BIG STAGE where the live auction  Let  Er Buck 
      Chuck  is about to begin.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    And we re gonnakick off our auction 
                    with a sweetie.  Lot #1.  A gift card 
                    to NeimanMarcus in the amount of 
                    98,728.32.

    ON SHARON S LOOK that fires between Darlene and Cricket.

                                  AUCTIONEER (CONT D)
                    This most generous item is donated by 
                    Sharon Peavy.

    ON THE SCREEN the MUG SHOT of Sharon that Amanda got at 
      Neiman spops up.  (It s a still from the NM security footage 
    at the moment Sharon was asked for her ID.)  Her mouth and 
      eyes are wide open.  It s a horrid picture.   

    ON AMANDA S triumphant look to mortified Sharon.  She 
      saunters to her as BIDDING BEGINS on the gift card.

                                  AMANDA
                    To err is human, and I m divine for 
                    forgiving you, Sharon.  Besides.  I 
                    wouldn t want to see you in jail.  
                    Orange jumpsuits aren t slenderizing.

      Sharon yanks Darlene over. 

                                  SHARON
                    She made me do it.  Darlene made me do 
                    it.

                                  DARLENE
                          (to Amanda)
                    Darlin .We were simply trying to 
                    ease your suffering by finding out 
                    who s been stalking you with gifts.  

      Cricket has joined the GCB s.                                                                                        55.


                                  CRICKET
                      Congratulations, Amanda. Blake just 
                    told me he hired you on as a marketing 
                      consultant. He always did have a soft 
                    spot for you. 

                                  AMANDA
                    I think he has a soft spot for all 
                    women, Cricket. But you re the one he 
                    fell in love with. 

    She takes their hands.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Ladies, I just want to tell you how 
                    sorry I am for how I behaved all of 
                    those years ago. I had a mother I 
                    couldn t stand, a daddy who spoiled me 
                    too much and a princess streak a mile 
                    wide. I know I didn t treat you all 
                    with the kindness and respect you 
                    deserved - but I m back home now, and 
                    I hope you ll let me prove to you that 
                    I ve changed. And can be a good 
                    friend. Will you at least let me try?

    The women look at Amanda, then each other. They nod.

                                  SHARON
                    Of course sweetheart.

                                  CRICKET
                    Yes.

                                  DARLENE
                    I ve been praying for this moment for 
                    a long time.

      They fall into a group hug. 

      Sharon sees a waiter go by with a passing tray.

                                  SHARON
                    Oh lord, there go the deep fried 
                    twinkies.I only eat them once a year.

    She runs after them. The BAND begins to play Donna Summers, 
       BAD GIRLS . Blake approaches Cricket.

                                  BLAKE
                          (excited)
                    Cricket, babe - I think they re 
                    playing our song.

      Cricket takes Blake s hand as he pulls her onto the dance 
      floor. We can see the fun and delight she takes in this part 
    of her marriage.

    Now it s just Amanda left with Darlene.                                                                                        56.


                                  AMANDA
                    How lucky for Cricket. A husband that 
                    likes to dance.

      Darlene narrows her eyes at Amanda.

                                  DARLENE
                      Sweetheart, don t think I m buying 
                    this redemption story for one second.

                                  AMANDA
                    Excuse me?

                                  DARLENE
                    I saw you kissing Sharon s husband at 
                    the car dealership. Breaking # 7 and # 
                    10. And God knows what else you ve 
                    been up to since you ve arrived in 
                    town. You may think you re good. You 
                    might pretend to be a Christian. But 
                    honey... I think you re a bitch.

    AT THAT MOMENT, a very SMALL KID (5) dressed in chaps runs to 
      Amanda and hands her a gift box.

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    This is for you.

      EVERYONE, including Darlene is interested and gathers around 
    as Amanda opens the box with dread.

      It s a GIANT CROSS PENDANT encrusted with diamonds and 
      matching earrings.  Gigi sighs.

                                  GIGI
                    Dear God.  Another present?

      Amanda looks around for the Little Cowboy.  He s vanished.  
    She sprints through the THRONGS, finds him.

                                  AMANDA
                    Hi.  Listen.  Who gave you this box?

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    I dunno.

                                  AMANDA
                    Well, then.  Can you remember anything 
                    about how he looked?

    The Little Cowboy thinks, then beams.

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    Yeah.  They was wearing a cowboy hat.

    The Little Cowboy runs off into the crowd, disappears.

    ON AMANDA looking around.  In a WIDE SHOT WE SEE she s in the 
      middle of a SEA OF 2000 COWBOY HATS.

      ESTABLISH GIGI S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                                                                                        57.


      INT. AMANDA S OLD ROOM - GIGI S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Dark.  Amanda s sound asleep.  Her CELL BUZZES.  She fumfers
    and manages to answer it without totally waking up.

                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                    Mm...ello?

      ANGLE ON THE EDGE OF A MAN S FACE as he speaks.

                                  MAN (INTO CELL)
                    How do you like Dallas?

      Amanda struggles for more awakeness.

                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                    Who... who is this?

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    Don t worry about a thing, honey.  
                    I ll take care of you.  Just sit 
                    tight.

                                  AMANDA (ON CELL)
                          (now alert, with 
                            disbelief)
                    Bill?!

    The line goes dead.  Amanda tries to stay calm.  She scrolls 
    the cell to the Call Record.  WE READ the CALLER I.D...

 UNKNOWN

      Amanda drops the phone, reeling.  What the f...?

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                     THE END.
