                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT11

      Storm clouds gather with unnatural speed above the hospital, 
      blotting out the stars in the night sky. In the parking lot, 
      a hasty evacuation takes place with NURSES and STAFF quickly 
      assisting patients into ambulances and vans.

      Lightning tears through the clouds, followed by a powerful 
      CRACK OF THUNDER. The sound startles the evacuees, turning 
      heads. More THUNDERCLAPS hit, each going off like CANNON 
      BLASTS as--

      INT. HOSPITAL/RECEPTION - NIGHT22

      WIND SLAMS the doors open into the crowded reception. Barely 
      pausing to notice, Melissa gives directions to a group of 
      ORDERLIES.

                                    MELISSA
                    All medications should be sealed in 
                    the plastic bags and be carried in 
                    the patients  hands. When you ve 
                      completely evacuated the room, you 
                    mark the door with a red X.

      Pieces of RED CHALK in hand, the Orderlies disperse. A 
      surgeon named DR. VANDENBERG cuts through to Melissa.

                                  DR. VANDENBERG
                    What the hell s going on out there? 
                    The weather said mild thunderstorms 
                    this morning.

                                    MELISSA
                    And now they re saying power s 
                    already out in several towns. Hill 
                    Valley s under a flood watch.

                                  DR. VANDENBERG
                    I live in Hill Valley.

                                    MELISSA
                    Are your patients clear?

      Vandenberg quickly scans a list on a clipboard.        TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/132.

                    All except for Cora Hale.

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR PATIENT HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT33

      Gently using a towel to wipe the perspiration from Cora s 
      forehead, Peter throws a glance to the corridor where 
      orderlies hurry past.

                                  PETER
                    Hey! Anyone want to tell me when 
                    they re getting my niece out of 
                    here? Anyone at all?

      Stepping away from the unconscious Cora, Peter starts for the 
      door when Melissa appears with a chart.

                                    MELISSA
                    Sorry, but she wasn t listed as...

      She trails off when she gets a look at Peter, breath caught. 
      He retreats back, instinctively moving for the shadows.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    You re supposed to be dead.

                                  PETER
                    I get that a lot actually.

      Cora LURCHES UP, startling both of them. Choking violently, 
      she twists about and vomits. BLACK BLOOD mixed with the WHITE 
      BERRIES of MISTLETOE splash across the floor.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT44

      The steel door slides back with a CLANG and Jennifer Blake 
      rushes in. Voice tremulous with panic, she calls out to the 
      darkened loft.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek? Derek, where are you?

                                  DEREK (O.S.)
                    Right here.

      She spins around and sees Derek step out of the shadows as if 
      he d been waiting in the darkness for her. 

                                  JENNIFER
                    Thank God.

      She rushes over, arms wrapping around him.        TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/133.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    Something happened at the recital. 
                    At the school. I need to tell you 
                    before you hear it--before you hear 
                    any of it from them.

                                  DEREK
                    From who?

                                  JENNIFER
                    Scott, Stiles--they re going to 
                    tell you things. Things you can t 
                    believe. You have to trust me, 
                    okay? You trust me.

                                  DEREK
                    What is it?

                                  JENNIFER
                    Promise you ll listen to me.

                                  DEREK
                      I promise.

      She kisses him. Pressing her lips desperately to his. But 
      there s a hesitancy in him. She pulls back to look him in the 
      eyes, noticing a lack of reaction, a visible unease.

                                  JENNIFER
                    They re already here, aren t they?

      Scott and Stiles step out of the elevator alcove. Jennifer 
      backs away, nervous.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    So they told you it was me? That 
                    I m the one taking people?

                                  SCOTT
                    We told him you re the one killing 
                    people.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Oh, that s right. Committing human 
                      sacrifices. Cutting their throats? 
                      I probably do it during my lunch 
                    hour. That way I can get back to 
                    teaching high school English the 
                    rest of the day. That makes perfect 
                    sense.

                    How would I know? Derek, tell me 
                    you don t believe this.

                                  DEREK
                    Do you know what happened to 
                    Stiles s father?

                                  JENNIFER
                    No. I have no idea.

                                  SCOTT
                    Ask her why she almost killed 
                    Lydia.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Lydia Martin? I don t know anything 
                    about that.

                                  DEREK
                    What do you know?

                                  JENNIFER
                    I know these two boys, for whatever 
                    misguided reason, are filling your 
                    head with an absurd story. One they 
                    can t prove, by the way.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if we could?

      Jennifer notices an open VIAL held in his hands. Inside are 
      the ground and crushed remains of green and brown leaves.

                                  JENNIFER
                    What is that?

                                  SCOTT
                      Mistletoe. My boss told me it s a 
                    poison and a cure. Which means you 
                    can use it, but it can also be used 
                    against you.

      With a flick of his arm, the POWDER flies out of the vial, 
      pluming into a cloud of dust. Jennifer raises her hands, but 
      in the cloud, her face changes to THE DARACH, slashed and 
      SHRIEKING in anger.

      Derek flinches back as if he d been hit.

      Dust settling around her, Jennifer looks up with a mixture of 
      rage and fear. She starts to back away, moving for an escape. 
      But Derek comes at her.        TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/135.

                    No, Derek wait--

      His right hand wraps around her throat, left opening with 
      CLAWS unsheathed.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    Wait, just wait--you need me.

                    sister.

      He blinks, a moment of hesitation. Scott and Stiles watch 
      Jennifer struggle to breathe, eyes locked on Derek s.

      Cell phone to his ear, Peter glances to Cora who is now being 
      prepared for evacuation by a Nurse and Orderly.

                    It s not good. She s been in and

                    one other alarming substance.

      Derek slowly lowers the phone. His grip tightens around

      Anguish in his eyes, he finally releases his grip, letting 
      Jennifer fall to the floor. She draws in a breath, hand to 
      her throat and glares up at them in defiance.

      Two cars soar into the darkness. Derek s FJ Cruiser closely 
      followed by Stiles s Jeep.

      Gripping the wheel, Derek keeps his focus on the road ahead, 
      refusing to look at Jennifer.

                    talking for the rest of your life.

      He pushes down on the pedal, ENGINE ROARING.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT99

      Stiles keeps pace with Derek s car just ahead of them. Scott 
      can t help but notice his friend s quiet.

                                  SCOTT
                    We re going to find your Dad.

                                  STILES
                    How do we know he s not already...

      He swallows the last word, unable to finish.

                                  SCOTT
                    He s not. We re going to find him.

                                  STILES
                    Something feels wrong about this. 
                    We proved it to Derek, but she had 
                    this look like it didn t matter. 
                    Like it was all still going 
                    according to plan. You saw it, 
                    didn t you?

      With a reluctant nod, he turns his gaze back to the road and 
      to the almost absolute darkness ahead of them.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1010

      SIREN LIGHTS FLASHING, an ambulance full of evacuees veers 
      away from the hospital s entrance. Derek s Cruiser and 
      Stiles s Jeep soar in past and SCREECH to a halt. 

      Derek gets out and yanks open the passenger door. He makes no 
      attempt to be gentle when pulling Jennifer out.

      Shutting the door of the Jeep, Scott pauses when he sees 
      Stiles pull a BASEBALL BAT out of the back.

                                  STILES
                    You got claws. I got a bat.

      He follows the others to the entrance.        TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/138.


      INT. HOSPITAL/ER RECEPTION - NIGHT1111

      Derek, Jennifer, Scott and Stiles enter through the side 
      door. They pass the reception desk the moment Melissa comes 
      rushing back in through the ER entrance.

                                    MELISSA
                    Scott?

      He turns back, the others pausing ahead of him.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing here? The 
                      hospital s evacuating.

                                  SCOTT
                    We re here for Cora.

                                    MELISSA
                    All of you? And why does Stiles 
                    have a bat?

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, trust me on this. You need to 
                    get out of here. Right now.

      Melissa notices the way Derek holds Jennifer s arm, sees the 
      tension on their faces.

                                    MELISSA
                    The building is supposed to be 
                    clear in thirty minutes. We ve got 
                    two more ambulances coming back. 
                    One s ten minutes out. The other s 
                    twenty. Cora needs to be on one of 
                    those. They ll be picking up in the 
                    basement garage.

                                  SCOTT
                    Got it.

      Frightened, Melissa watches her son follow the others to the 
      elevator.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ELEVATOR - NIGHT1212

      Still gripping Jennifer by the arm, Derek presses the button 
      for the second floor.

                                  JENNIFER
                    You don t need to keep me on a

      She glances back to Scott who does not seem convinced. Next 
      to him, Stiles raises the bat, fully ready to bash her across 
      the skull with it.

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT1414

      THE BELL RINGS and the elevator doors open. Derek pulls 
      Jennifer out with Scott and Stiles close behind. The LIGHTS 
      FLICKER. All of them notice.

      Releasing Jennifer, Derek moves past the group to the double 
      doors of the Patient Holding Area. All he sees inside is an 
      empty bed and BLACK BLOOD mixed with mistletoe all over the 
      floor.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek...

      Scott nods to the drops of BLACK BLOOD on the floor. They 
      lead into the corridor and toward TWO DOUBLE DOORS which 
      BURST OPEN. 

      A BODY soars through, tumbling across the floor and sliding 
      to their feet. With a GROAN of pain, Peter looks up.

                    We got a problem.

      Down the hall, a MONSTROUS WEREWOLF steps into the light. At 
      its feet lies Cora s unconscious body.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT1515

      A BRILLIANT RED fills Derek s eyes, his face transformed into 
      a werewolf. He rushes to meet the Twin Alpha in the middle of 
      the corridor, their bodies colliding brutally. 

      Eyes glowing and transformed as well, Scott races in to help. 
      Stiles, however, has his eyes on Cora lying at the far end of 
      the hall. Still holding the baseball bat, he grabs Peter, 
      pulling him to his feet.

                                  STILES
                    Help me.

      Dodging blows and bodies smashing against walls, they slip 
      past the fighting werewolves to reach Cora.

      Derek SLAMS to the floor just as Scott s feet lift off it. 
      The Twin Alpha grips him by the neck, raising him up.

                                  SCOTT
                    Ethan, Aiden--stop. You don t know 
                    what you re doing.

      The Twin Alpha speaks with a voice combining both Ethan and 
      Aiden s.

                                  TWIN ALPHA
                    All we want is her.

      Pushing himself up from the floor, Derek sees Jennifer 
      slipping inside the elevator again. They connect eyes and a 
      hint of regret crosses her face as--THE DOORS CLANG SHUT.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ER RECEPTION - NIGHT1616

      Helping escort the last patients out, Melissa fails to notice 
      the pair of CLAWED FEET stepping in. Kali guides Deucalion 
      through the rapidly deserting reception corridor.

      The BELL RINGS for the elevator and the doors open. Hurrying 
      out, Jennifer stops short when she sees Deucalion and Kali 
      rounding the corner. Breath held, she takes a step back.

      Deucalion responds immediately. He whips the cane up and 
      sends it SOARING through the air.       TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1311.

      Jennifer twists about, just managing to avoid the tip s BLADE 
      as it lands in the wall. Seeing Kali racing toward her, she 
      rushes back into the elevator. 

      The doors don t close fast enough. Kali reaches in to block 
      them. But Jennifer s EYES SURGE with a sinister WHITE GLOW 
      and she SLAMS her open palms against the closing doors. A 
      CONCUSSIVE FORCE knocks Kali off her feet, sending her flying 
      back.

      The doors close and Jennifer sinks against the wall of the 
      rising elevator, weakened from the effort.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE - NIGHT1818

      Racing through double doors and into the morgue, Stiles looks 
      past Peter carrying an unconscious Cora over his shoulder to 
      find Scott and Derek catching up.

                                  DEREK
                    Don t stop!

      The Twin Alpha barrels through the doors after them. 
      Brandishing the baseball bat, Stiles turns back, ignoring 
      Derek s warning.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Stiles--

      He swings, SMASHING the Twin Alpha across the cheek. The bat 
      CRACKS into two pieces. Hands trembling, Stiles drops the 
      handle.

      The Twin Alpha, hardly even fazed, slowly turns back to him 
      with fangs bared. 

      As Stiles begins to retreat, Scott looks to Derek and nods to 
      a light fixture above them.

                                  SCOTT
                    Give me a lift?

      Derek grabs him by the jacket and TOSSES him right into the 
      air. Latching onto a LIGHTING FIXTURE, Scott YANKS it free.

      THE FIXTURE SMASHES DOWN on the head of the Twin Alpha. 
      SPARKS FLY as the monster crumbles underneath the steel 
      fixture amid BURSTS OF ELECTRICITY. 

      Scott and Derek share a quick glance of satisfaction at their 
      teamwork, and turn to run again. Derek grabs Stiles, dragging 
      him back.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1312.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1919

      Under the sound of rain hammering the roof of the school, 
      Allison hurries through a crowd of DEPUTIES and WITNESSES in 
      the aftermath of the Teacher s death and Stilinski s 
      kidnapping. She finds Isaac ending a call on his cell.

                                  ISAAC

                    She s got some bruising on her 
                    neck. They re taking her to the 
                    hospital downtown since Beacon 
                    Memorial is being evacuated.

                    It will be. And I heard one of the 
                    EMT s talking about the backup  
                      generators being too old to last if

      Stepping through the crowd, Argent motions for them.

      With a bewildered look, Melissa slowly approaches the CANE 
      still stuck in the wall. The moment she yanks it free, a HAND 
      reaches over to pull it from her grasp.

                    Thank you, Ms. McCall.

      Kali by his side, he caps the blade on the cane and taps it 
      back to the tile.

                    You have no idea.

      The hospital LIGHTS BLINK and then, just like the high 
      school, the power shuts off. In the darkness, all Melissa can 
      see are GLOWING RED EYES.

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT2121

      The hulking SHADOW of the Twin Alpha moves across the 
      corridor wall. Without pausing, it splits into two smaller 
      versions, Ethan and Aiden.

      A strange sound interrupts them. A LOW ELECTRIC HUM.

      The HUM rises to a CRACKLE and the backup generators kick in. 
      Dim emergency LIGHTS click on in the operating room. 

      The door swings open and Stiles comes through with Peter 
      carrying Cora. He sets her down on the operating table. Derek 
      and Scott rush inside right behind them, both returned to 
      normal.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT2323

      A look of rage in his eyes, Derek rushes toward Jennifer with 
      frightening speed. But Scott quickly steps in between them.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek, wait--

                                  DEREK
                    She was trying to get out.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I was trying to keep from getting 
                    killed. You can t blame me for 
                    that.

                                  STILES
                    You want to show us you re one of 
                    the good guys?
                          (pointing to Cora)
                    Heal her.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Not until I m safe.

                                  PETER
                    I d like to volunteer a different 
                    method of persuasion. How about we 
                    torture her?

                                  DEREK
                    Works for me.

      He grabs Scott to yank him aside when THE PA SYSTEM CRACKLES 
      to life. Everyone looks up to a SPEAKER at the ceiling.

                                    MELISSA (V.O.)
                    Um... can I have your attention...

      Scott slowly steps past the others, frightened by the sound 
      of his mother s voice echoing through the speaker static.

                                    MELISSA (V.O.)
                    Mr. Deucalion--excuse me, just 
                      Deucalion--requests you bring the 
                    woman calling herself Jennifer 
                    Blake to the ER reception. Do this 
                    and everyone else can leave. You 
                    have ten minutes.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1317.

      The PA clicks off, leaving Scott breathless and terrified.

                                  JENNIFER
                    He s not going to hurt her.

                                  DEREK
                    Shut up.

                                  JENNIFER
                    He won t. Scott, you know why. Tell 
                    them it s true.

        Reluctantly, Scott confirms it with a nod.

                                  DEREK
                    What does she mean?

                                  JENNIFER
                    You re not the only one he wants in 
                    his pack.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/INT. HOSPITAL/RECEPTION - NIGHT2424

      Rain hammers down over the entrance where Argent s SUV pulls 
      up. The doors click open as Argent, Allison and Isaac step 
      into the downpour. They quickly take cover under the awning 
      and peer in through the glass doors.

                                  ARGENT
                    Looks like the evacuation s over.

      Head tilted up, Isaac breathes in the air.

                                    ALLISON
                    Catching a scent?

                                  ISAAC
                    Not with the rain this heavy.

      He starts for the door, but Argent holds him back.

                                  ARGENT
                    I ll go first.

      Pulling a gun from his coat, he clicks open the door.

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT2525

      Speaking quickly, Jennifer explains her theory.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Deucalion doesn t just want an 
                    Alpha pack. He wants perfection.

                          (nodding to Jennifer)
                    We still have to get her out of 
                    here.

                    My Mom said there was one more 
                    ambulance coming in twenty minutes. 
                    I don t think we ve been here that 
                    long. If we could get down to the 
                    garage, we could get that last 
                    ambulance and get out of here.

                                  PETER
                    The twins aren t going to just let

                                  PETER
                    I ll do it. But I d prefer going 
                    out there with an advantage.

                                  STILES
                    What s that mean? Like a weapon?

                                  PETER
                    Something better than a baseball 
                    bat, yes.

      Seconds later, they yank drawers open across the room and 
      spill their contents onto counters. Scott picks up SCALPELS 
      of various sizes. Peter shakes his head.

      Stiles raises a set of DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES.

                                  DEREK
                    Do you even know how to use those?

                                  STILES
                    No.

                                  DEREK
                    Then put them down.

      Scott holds up a HUGE SYRINGE filled with a clear liquid.

                                  SCOTT
                      Epinephrine?

                    All that would do is make him 
                    stronger.

      Peter turns, looking on the syringe with interest.

                                  PETER
                    How strong?

      INT. HOSPITAL/SURGERY CORRIDOR - NIGHT2626

      The doors of the operating room SLAM OPEN into the corridor. 
      SYRINGE jammed into his chest, Peter steps through with a 
      look of wild-eyed, adrenaline-induced ferocity.  

      At the end of the hall, the Twins watch him yank the needle 
      out of his chest and toss it to the floor. Peter flares his 
      eyes an ice-cold BLUE.

                                  PETER
                    All right, boys. Let s rumble.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1320.

      CONTINUED:2626

      Ethan and Aiden charge forward. In one fluid motion, their 
      bodies surge together to form the Twin Alpha.

      With a lunatic WAR CRY, Peter bullets right at them. Soaring 
      in behind him, Scott leaps up to help with claws unsheathed.

      While he and Peter grapple with the Twin Alpha, Derek carries 
      Cora through the OR s doors, Jennifer and Stiles behind him. 
      The group races down the opposite corridor.

      INT. HOSPITAL/BASEMENT GARAGE - NIGHT2727

      A door BANGS open into the garage and Stiles leads the others 
      through.

                                  STILES
                    It s still here.

      AN AMBULANCE sits before them, LIGHTS blazing across the 
      darkened garage. Rushing to it, Stiles yanks the back doors 
      open to allow Derek to place Cora on a gurney.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek... over here.

      At the front of the ambulance, Jennifer stands with her eyes 
      locked on something lying a few feet away in the shadows.

      A BODY.

      She and Derek slowly approach, discovering the AMBULANCE 
      DRIVER, dead eyes staring up at them. A BLOODY FOOTPRINT 
      marks his chest.

                                  KALI (O.S.)
                    Julia.

      Jennifer whirls toward the sound of Kali s voice.

                                  KALI (CONT D)
                    It is you.

      She steps into the light, twirling the AMBULANCE KEYS with 
      her finger.

      At the rear of the vehicle, Stiles jumps inside with Cora and 
      yanks the doors shut. Only a few feet away, Jennifer slips 
      behind Derek, both of them retreating back from Kali who 
      continues a steady approach.

                                  JENNIFER

                    That s why we re going to run.

      Derek grabs her hand and pulls her with him. Fangs bared, 
      Kali bolts after them.

      INT. HOSPITAL/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT2828

      SLAMMING through a door and into a darkened hallway, Derek 
      leads Jennifer out, heading for another turn when she pulls 
      him back.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Wait--the elevator.

      Ahead of them, an elevator s doors lie open. Peering back 
      down the hall, Derek quickly grabs a GURNEY and sends it 
      flying back toward the opposite door.

      Kali pushes through, SLAMMING against it. The gurney s wheels 
      slide across the floor, SCREECHING back. Ramming it clear, 
      she barrels through just as--

      The elevator doors close on Derek and Jennifer.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ELEVATOR - NIGHT2929

      Breathless, Derek watches the numbers light on the panel. But 
      under an ominous HYDRAULIC HUM, the dim emergency lights 
      FLICKER and click off.

      The elevator shudders to a stop and plunges into darkness.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP - NIGHT3030

      Deucalion carefully releases a LEVER on the outside terminal 
      of one of the hospital s rooftop GENERATORS. He turns to 
      Melissa with a gracious smile.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Thank you. That was more than

      Confused, she watches him walk away, cane sweeping across the 
      roof as he disappears under the rain.

      INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT3131

      Stiles checks that the locks on the doors are engaged. Then *

      Fear taking hold of him, Stiles looks helplessly over Cora s

      INT. HOSPITAL/ELEVATOR - NIGHT3232

      Fitting his fingers between the steel doors, Derek starts to *
      pry them open, but manages little more than a few inches. A 
      dim light shines in from the floor above. But there is 
      clearly not enough space to climb through.

      Derek peers up at the ceiling.*

      Cora lying deathly still in front of him, Stiles tries to 
      remember mouth-to-mouth.

                    Okay, okay--tilt the head. Fingers 
                    on the chin. Clear the throat.

      He gently but nervously pushes Cora s chin up, tilting her 
      head back. Then looks in her mouth, searching her throat.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Nothing. I see nothing. Okay, all 
                      right--um--pinch nose and blow.

      He takes her nose between his fingers and leans down to blow 
      into her mouth. Then pulls back and does it again, each time 
      with more and more urgency.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Come on, breathe. Cora, breathe.

      Stiles leans down for another try. But Cora finally pulls in 
      a GASP, her body seizing as she coughs. 

      With a sigh of relief, Stiles slumps back on the ambulance 
      bench watching her relax, still unconscious but breathing.

      Staggering, Peter tumbles to the corridor floor. Scott grabs 
      him by the jacket and yanks him back to his feet.

                    That shot... didn t last long.

      Both of them bloodied and beaten, they lurch down the hall 
      toward the only door left, one marked LAUNDRY.

      Locking the door, Scott turns to look about the room, 
      desperate. Peter slumps down, breathing hard.

      He notices Scott no longer listening, eyeing a LAUNDRY CHUTE.

      Dropping down from above, Peter lands with a soft thud into a

      down on top of him.

      A SOUND OF MOVEMENT comes from outside. Stiles turns to the 
      window, breath held. He cautiously peers out as--

      THE TWIN ALPHA passes right by.

      Stiles pulls away from the window. He glances about the 
      ambulance for something with which he can defend himself, but 
      finds nothing. All he can do is listen. Waiting in terrified 
      silence.

      Moving cautiously, Argent leads Isaac and Allison through the 
      side door into the ER reception. Pausing, Argent throws a

      Stiles cautiously pulls his ear from the wall of the 
      ambulance to look out the window again. He hears a SHUFFLING 
      SOUND. Feet moving quickly across the cement floor, COMING 
      RIGHT FOR THEM.

      Fist clenching by his side, he prepares to fight as someone 
      YANKS on the doors of the ambulance.

      With a breath of relief, he unlocks the doors and opens them 
      to reveal Scott struggling to keep Peter on his feet.

      Moving quickly and quietly, Scott heads for the end of the 
      corridor. But just at the turn, something stops him. Barely 
      breathing, he listens in almost perfect silence when-- 

      He DUCKS and the FIST of the TWIN ALPHA SMASHES INTO THE 
      WALL. 

      Dust flying about them, Scott retreats back. The Twin Alpha 
      swings another fist, trying to strike again.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1328.

      Dropping Scott to the floor, the Twin Alpha whirls around to 
      see Melissa holding a pair of DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES. She 
      presses them to the Twin Alpha s body and hits the monster 
      with TWO THOUSAND VOLTS.

      Ethan and Aiden tumble to the floor, BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY

                    Are you asking if maybe there was a

                    walked away, thinking she was dead, 
                    that maybe I turned back? And maybe 
                    I saw her there, lying perfectly 
                    still, but I focused my hearing 
                    anyway. Listened to the sound of 
                    her heart still beating. Still 
                    fighting for life. And I thought I 
                    could either go back to finish it, 
                    or let someone I loved die 
                      peacefully. And maybe I just kept 
                    walking.

      Face and body decimated, an unrecognizable Jennifer crawls 
      across the arid ground, through dust and dirt, desperately 
      trying to reach something just a few yards ahead...

      THE STUMP OF A ONCE MASSIVE TREE. Its thick roots stretch 
      out, plunging into the dirt below.

                    For years the Nemeton s power was 
                    virtually gone. Like a dying ember

                    But a few months earlier, something 
                    happened to cause that ember to 
                    glow a little brighter. Something 
                    gave it a spark of power again. The

                    was a sacrifice to the Nemeton. You 
                    gave it power again. You gave me 
                    power. Enough to hold on to life

                    You know mistletoe is important to 
                    Druids. But do you know the myth of 
                    why people kiss under mistletoe?

                    No.

                                  JENNIFER
                    It s a Norse myth. Baldur, the son 
                    of Odin, was the most beloved by 
                    the other Gods. So much that they 
                    wanted to protect him from all of 
                    the dangers in the world. His 
                    mother, Frigg, took an oath from 
                    fire and water, metal, stone and 
                    every living thing, that they would 
                    never hurt Baldur. At a gathering, 
                    they tested him.

                    Stones, arrows and flame were all 
                    hurled at him. Nothing worked. But 
                    there was one God who wasn t so 
                    enamored of Baldur. The God of 
                    mischief, Loki. He discovered that 
                    Frigg had forgotten to ask 
                      mistletoe--a tiny, seemingly 
                    harmless plant. And completely 
                      overlooked. Loki fashioned a dart 
                    out of mistletoe and it was used to 
                    kill Baldur. Frigg was heartbroken. 
                    She decreed that mistletoe would 
                    never again be used as a weapon and 
                    that she would place a kiss on 
                    anyone who passed under it. And now 
                    we hang mistletoe underneath our 
                    door during the holidays. So that 
                    we never overlook it again.

      She inches closer and Derek finally looks her in the eye.

                    We were the overlooked. The

                    Deucalion and the Alphas should 
                    never have made. Because I took an 
                    oath of my own. From Virgins and 
                    Warriors. From Healers, 
                      Philosophers and Guardians, to loan 
                    me their power so that I could 
                    teach these monsters that their 
                    monstrous actions would never be

      But Stiles pauses to notice something hanging on the door of 
      the ambulance. A clipboard with forms on it.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1340.

                    Stiles, we have to go!

      Down at the bottom of the sheet, Stiles sees the line for a 
      SIGNATURE. Underneath the line it reads: Parent or Guardian.

      He turns, realization hitting him.

      INT. HOSPITAL/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT6868

      Hurrying to the elevator to meet Derek and Jennifer, Scott 
      slows as the doors open, a look of shock spreading across his 
      face.

      Inside, Derek lies unconscious on the floor. Above him, the 
      SERVICE HATCH is broken open, revealing the almost pitch 
      black elevator shaft above him.

                                  SCOTT
                          (a frightened whisper)
                    Mom...

      Running into the corridor, Stiles sees Scott going for the 
      stairs.

                                  STILES
                    Scott! Scott, wait!

      INT. ARGENT S RAV4 - NIGHT6969

      Engine running, Isaac grips the wheel with Peter and Cora in 
      the back. Shifted into reverse, the REAR PARKING CAMERA is *
      on. He glances to it, seeing just the empty lot and darkness *
      behind them.*

                                  PETER
                    We have to go. Drive, you idiot!

                    I can t. Not without Scott.

      But as they hear GUNFIRE continue from outside--

                                  PETER
                    You want the Argents dead too? Make 
                    a choice!

      Isaac looks to the REAR PARKING CAMERA - the Twins emerge *
      from the shadows, eyes locked on them.*

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    For the love of God, Isaac. Go now!    TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1340A.

      Finally, he floors it, sending the car surging back and 
      forcing the Twins to dart out of the way.      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1341.


      INT. HOSPITAL/STAIRWELL - NIGHT7070

      Taking steps as fast as he can, Scott races up the stairs 
      toward the roof. Running fast. Running blind.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP - NIGHT7171

      Slamming through the door onto the rooftop, Scott whirls 
      about. But sees no one. No Jennifer. No Melissa.

                    They re gone.

      Deucalion emerges from the shadows.

                      Guardians, Scott. If you were with 
                    me, I could ve told you what it 
                    meant. I could ve warned you.

                    Scott.

      He turns to see Stiles stepping out onto the rooftop.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Don t do it. Don t go with him.

                                  SCOTT
                          (barely a whisper)
                    I don t know what else to do.

                                  STILES
                    There has to be something. We 
                    always have a Plan B.

                    I m going to find your Dad. I 
                    promise.

      Slowly, he turns away. As Stiles watches, Scott walks into 
      the darkness with Deucalion.

      INT. ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT7272

      Blinking out from the haze of unconsciousness, Melissa slowly 
      lifts her head up. Trying to move, she discovers she s bound 
      by a straw-like rope.

                                  STILINSKI (O.S.)
                    Are you all right?

      Eyes focusing, Melissa sees Sheriff Stilinski seated close to 
      her, also tied up.

                                    MELISSA
                    Where are we?

                                  STILINSKI
                    To me it looks like a root cellar. 
                    But she had a different word for 
                    it...

      Melissa peers about the vast array of roots upon which they 
      both have been bound.
