                    We re a mile from the loft- in the 
                    worst neighborhood. If I killed 
                    somebody in another part of town, 
                    I d be to afraid to dump the body

      She starts to reach under her seat.

                    Cece, the only thing that gets me 
                    more aroused than you is my finely-

      Schmidt beckons Jess to join him. She smiles and steps into 
      the circle. Schmidt and Jess drum and dance together wildly. 


      Jess approaches Schmidt, who sits alone with his drum, waiting 
      for the drum circle to gather, eating a bacon-wrapped hot dog.

                    Schmidt, I think you re abusing our

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No, Jess. This is the best thing 
                    that ever happened to me. You woke 
                    me up- We re gathering, Jess.  

      Slowly, drummers begin to gather around Schmidt.

                      Sandcastle? Is that a person?  
                    Schmidt, I made a huge mistake. I 
                    should ve kept my mouth shut. Come

                    Why, Jess?  So I can cook and clean 
                    for you? So I can tell you where 
                    the vacuum is? 

      As Jess speaks, the gathering drummers slowly start forming a 
      circle around Jess, drumming and dancing.
