End of the day.
An armored truck moves through the city of
Los Angeles.
The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.
5.
A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.
Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.
And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.
A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.
Tommy gets in.
A SWAT COP signals him.
SWAT COP
Move it out.
A stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac
next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The
man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.
She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.
SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --
LING
Enjoying California?
CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.
CHARLES
Hope we're not here long.
I hate
sunshine.
Ling kisses Sona on the lips.
Then --
SONA
We may have a problem.
Ling's mood quickly darkens.
LING
The stones?
SONA
The exchange was just robbed.
LING
... Let's hope that was part of the
plan.
Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot
goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is
spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing
seemingly at random. When...
The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
VOICE (O.S.)
Bang.
A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
pops his head up out of the tank.
ARCHIE
Like it?
FAIT
It's cool.
As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --
ARCHIE
Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
included... Reactive armor, twin M240
machine guns, 120mm smoothbore
cannon. Guaranteed to get you
through the rougher areas of the city
and keep the neighbors in line.
FAIT
Pass.
26.
ARCHIE
How about a Marine Corps assault
hovercraft?
FAIT
I got other business.
Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.
MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS
We're outta room over here, Arch.
ARCHIE
Stack 'em in the office, if you have
to.
Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
ARCHIE
... You weren't downtown tonight by
any chance, were you, Tony?
FAIT
Don't know what you're talking about.
ARCHIE
Me either.
FAIT
Ever see black diamonds before?
ARCHIE
White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil
Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.
Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
ARCHIE
You got me.
FAIT
Find out how much they're worth.
ARCHIE
There a timetable on this, or --
FAIT
Yesterday.
ARCHIE
That's what I figured.
27.
Fait's heading out.
FAIT
I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a
guy who fucked me over.
Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.
Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
FAIT
Oh, man...
He's about
to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls
in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.
Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits
it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.
30.
Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.
Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.
Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
LING THUG #1
Give us the stones.
FAIT
Man, how many times I gotta tell
people: I'm a business man. Make me
a motherfucking offer.
LING THUG #2
Here's your offer.
He cocks his pistol.
Beat.
FAIT
That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
ain't got the stones.
LING THUG #1
Then you're gonna tell us where they
are.
Whereupon a...
BOTTLE
Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one
Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
fence.
REVEAL
the person who threw the bar.
Su. The fight's on.
Two on
31.
two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.
Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
SU
Over here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
Fait digs out the phone, to Su --
FAIT
Man, what the hell's up with these
fucking stones?
(into phone)
Go.
32.
INTERCUT WITH:
The limo stops inside the hangar.
To Charles, re:
Vanessa
--
LING
Find a place to put her.
Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out --
VANESSA
My daddy's gonna come and kick your
butts.
Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises
Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's
daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles
takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call.
LING
Su says he has the stones... But why
cut me off? Why not negotiate for
the girl? It doesn't make sense.
SONA
38.
The buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should
we stop them?
LING
We'll never regain their confidence.
(beat)
We need information. Find the right
people. Pay whatever it costs.
Something's not right. Something's
happening with the stones.
SONA
What about the girl?
LING
We'll need her... She stays alive.
For now.
Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
CHARLES
Shut up!
VANESSA
You shut up!
CHARLES
Go to sleep!
Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.
Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.
Locks it.
And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.
CLOSEUP - FAIT
As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
--
FAIT
Angels east, angels west, north and
south, do your best. Guard her,
watch her, while she rests.
41.
OFF which, as Su regards him...
After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
CHAMBERS
Metz.
The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
CHAMBERS
D.V.D.'s broke.
METZ
Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
Chambers.
Metz goes.
Beat.
Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
CHAMBERS
Thanks for your patience.
Man needs
his nightly rest.
(then)
Who's the gook?
42.
FAIT
... Chinese guy.
CHAMBERS
... No shoes in my crib.
Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
CHAMBERS
In.
The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
FAIT
How you doing, Jump?
CHAMBERS
Don't waste my precious time.
FAIT
... I got a problem.
CHAMBERS
How's Daria?
FAIT
... Good.
CHAMBERS
Always was good. From the moment I
found her till the moment you took
her away from me. Problem, you say?
FAIT
... The black stones.
CHAMBERS
Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
money. But that all stopped. You
stopped that. You decided it was
okay to put an end to that. Black
stones. Go on.
FAIT
I need 'em back.
CHAMBERS
Only smart thing was not pimping her
yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
sore-angry, and you'da both been real
cold-dead...
CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
But you don't pimp, do you? Just a
43.
thief in the night. Stealing what
don't belong to you.
Chambers turns to Su.
In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
CHAMBERS
You like tall white women?
Su doesn't say anything.
Back to English --
CHAMBERS
He can't talk?
SU
I don't speak Korean.
Chambers carves up a sausage.
CHAMBERS
Bought myself this Korean club
downtown. Packing in the Seoul
brothers 24-7-365... Black man
gouging Koreans, ain't that a
switch... Motherfuckers got faces
like walls, but they love to drink
liquor and look at naked girls...
Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
an office looks like a kabuki love
palace. My own little sanctuary --
A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
CHAMBERS
-- just waiting for when I parole
out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the
poon.
FAIT
... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
this. I gotta have the stones, or
she's dead.
No response.
Chambers just keeps eating.
FAIT
If you need something more than that,
here it is...
(this is hard)
I'm begging you, Jump.
Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.
Wipes his
face. Finally --
CHAMBERS
Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
news. I'm watching it wondering why.
44.
What's worth that kind of trouble,
that kind of heat? Gotta be
something good. Gotta be something
expensive.
Beat.
He meets Fait's eyes.
Holds them.
FAIT
She's my little girl.
CHAMBERS
Make another one... Lotta offspring
running around. Big scores're rare
in a lifetime.
Another beat.
That's it.
No deal.
Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.
Su stops him.
CHAMBERS
Slope's no dope.
He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
CHICKENS
Let me cut one of these
motherfuckers.
CHAMBERS
Your choice.
Chickens is happy.
Thrusts the knife at Fait.
When...
Su reaches out and catches the
blade.
Catches it with just
the thumb and forefinger of one
hand.
And holds it like
that. Holds it hard. Chickens
can't push and can't pull.
Doesn't know what to do next.
Finally yanks really hard.
And...
Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
beat. Then, to Fait --
CHAMBERS
Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
your shoes.
Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.
FAIT
I used to look up to that guy.
All I
wanted was to be like him.
45.
SU
In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.
FAIT
This ain't Taiwan.
(then)
Only thing we can do now is find out
where the stones are and go take 'em.
SU
You make it sound easy.
FAIT
It won't be.
They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.
Looks back at
the prison. Suddenly realizing something.
FAIT
... They're at his club.
SU
How do you know?
FAIT
I know. I can feel it.
That ever
happen to you?
SU
No.
FAIT
I thought Chinese people were all
mystical and shit.
SU
We like to gamble.
Not guess.
FAIT
It's no guess... But I could be
wrong... We'll hit the club. You
gotta see Archie.
SU
Archie?
FAIT
He's gotta remember something about
the guys who took down his place.
SU
What if he can't?
FAIT
Pretend it's Taiwan.
Make him
remember.
46.
THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is
surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key
and remote are gone.
CHARLES
Shit.
(yells to Sona)
She got the key!
A cavernous industrial building.
Cars parked on the
perimeter.
As they park --
52.
SU
How will you recognize him?
ARCHIE
I didn't see his face.
But I'll know
his pinkie ring when I
see it. Ten
carats. Round cut with
square mount.
Good color and clarity.
I remember
thinking what it would
do to my face
if he hit me.
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
help disguise himself...
Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.
Via
earwig mike --
FAIT
Tommy.
Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.
TOMMY
Here come da bug man.
The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control
truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest
spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.
TOMMY
Hey.
Howzit?
DOORMAN
What the hell you doing?
TOMMY
Pest control. Don't tell me you
didn't get your notice.
DOORMAN
What notice?
TOMMY
See, that burns my ass right to the
bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my
job... Anyway, putting that aside, if
you had gotten your notice, you'd
know there's a new city ordinance
saying all businesses catering to
foreigners gotta be sprayed.
DOORMAN
Yeah?
How come?
TOMMY
'Cause foreign people're bringing all
55.
their scary-assed foreign bugs over
here. Y'know, in their luggage and
shit. And then the bugs're getting
loose and fucking everything up --
eating all the trees and everything,
y'know, making people sick... Anyway,
city says we gotta spray to prevent
any infestation and possible spread.
DOORMAN
We're doing business inside. Can't
let you just start hosing the place
with bug spray.
TOMMY
Yeah, well, maybe you should at least
ask the manager about it.
DOORMAN
Manager's busy.
TOMMY
... Okay. Your call. Just know the
city quarantine people'll be here
first thing tomorrow.
DOORMAN
Quarantine people?
TOMMY
They'll be shutting you down for non-
compliance... Peace out.
Tommy starts to go.
DOORMAN
Wait, wait, wait.
Tommy stops.
DOORMAN
City's really gonna come and close us
up?
TOMMY
Quicker'n a Zip-loc.
DOORMAN
... You sure you're not fucking with
me?
TOMMY
I'm a licensed exterminator.
Why
would I be fucking with you?
The Doorman considers it another moment.
Then --
56.
TOMMY
Look. Let's do this. You let me
start with a couple small rooms,
y'know, offices or something,
someplace you don't have customers.
Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
bombs, and then we'll do the rest
later. How's that?
The Doorman considers a moment.
Then --
DOORMAN
... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and
come on.
Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto
ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story
window. A window into...
Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,
Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.
Via earwigs --
DARIA
We're still here to help you, T.
MILES
Anything you want us to do?
Fait reaches the rear doorway.
When...
He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.
Shoves another aside.
And
takes off running.
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
by car.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.
To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
FAIT
Get the car.
Stay close.
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.
67.
MOTO-RIDER #1
Hey!
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.
Right
through the nylon mesh tailgate.
Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
MOTO-RIDER #1
Don't let that fucker get away!
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
pursuit.
68.
WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
fast, strong and maneuverable.
One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.
The guy's right on
Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
This'll be a news highlight for days to come.
Fait's everywhere.
And so is the moto-bike.
Still on his
tail.
Fait veers inside a building.
The bike follows.
The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.
Onto the
roof of a next-door building.
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.
Jump after jump.
Longer and longer. Until...
The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.
The moto-
rider walks away, but his chase is over.
Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
cops. Into his mike --
FAIT
Yo.
Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.
Up the spiral ramp.
70.
Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.
The gang's all here.
All eyes on the club.
FAIT
I knew the stones were in there.
TOMMY
Question is, how do we get 'em out?
Place is slamming nonstop.
A long beat.
Fait doesn't answer.
SU
Something isn't right.
72.
FAIT
Yeah.
That's what I'm getting.
SU
The doorman.
FAIT
... Where the hell is he?
(then)
Everyone stay put.
OFF which, as he and Su go --
Driving.
Daria and Miles following in their car.
FAIT (V.O.)
So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan
fit into all this?
SU (V.O.)
One of our scientists made the
stones. Tried to go into business
for himself. We stopped him.
Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed
us. He took them.
FAIT (V.O.)
Ling?
He was one of you?
SU (V.O.)
We were partners. Six of us. He
killed the others. He thought he
killed me, too.
FAIT (V.O.)
(beat)
So what're you really after -- the
stones or the payback?
SU
82.
Both.
FAIT (V.O.)
... Yeah... Let's get it all.
Near their cars.
(NOTE: From now until the battle's over, it's night. At
the airport, Fait, Su and Fait's team will all communicate
via earwigs.)
FAIT
Miles, what do you see?
Atop the building next to Ling's hangar. The five choppers
rest on the wide tarmac below, between the two buildings.
Miles scans Ling's hangar through the scope of a silenced
sniper rifle.
SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NO NIGHT VISION
FINDING the Ling killers outside the hangar.
MILES (V.O.)
Two sentries my side.
Then, scanning inside Ling's hangar THROUGH windows --
MILES (V.O.)
Sale's at this end... There's a
camper with painted windows. Middle
of the hangar.
FAIT
Vanessa said she was in a van.
That's gotta be it.
(to Daria)
When we get her, you move her outta
85.
there fast.
DARIA
I'll keep her safe.
Su's reached the top of outside stairs.
Opens a door and
enters.
FAIT
Miles.
Sentries.
MILES
is already sighted in.
PULLS the TRIGGER.
PHUT!
86.
SENTRIES
One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down.
Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a
BULLET in the shoulder.
MILES
MILES
Done.
FAIT AND DARIA
FAIT
Tommy and Archie. Watch out for the
camper. Punch it.
91.
As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...
MILES
flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.
And...
SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!
CHARLES
The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.
Charles is slowed
but keeps going.
SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.
MILES
sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.
He comms
Fait.
MILES
Lost 'em behind the gas truck.
CHARLES
stops behind the gas truck.
Looks around for Vanessa.
No
sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.
Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
CHARLES
Time to end this my way.
And then...
FAIT (O.S.)
Drop the girl.
92.
Charles looks over.
Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
FAIT
Put her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.
He releases her.
VANESSA
Daddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...
Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.
SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Fait, Charles and Vanessa.
No clear shot.
MILES
comms Fait.
MILES
No shot.
FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
The fight continues.
Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.
They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.
93.
FAIT
Don't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
FAIT
Wrong kid.
Wrong dad.
Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...
Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.
Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.
The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.
94.
As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.
The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
INTO FLAMES.
The spilled fuel ignites.
A circle of intense fire.
With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.
LING
96.
You were lucky last time.
You
Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
LING
I'll kill you fast.
You won't
Feel a thing.
SU
... I won't.
You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.
Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
SU
This is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...
INSIDE LING'S THROAT
The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...
ANGLE BACK ON LING
97.
As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
b.g.
The two men regard each other a moment.
FAIT
We got it all.
(then)
What happens to the stones?
SU
They'll be destroyed.
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
in b.g.
FAIT
Looks like I'll be doing some jail
time.
TOMMY
Jail? Man, you just helped save the
planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
A look between Fait and Su.
Su nods.
SU
I'll do what I can.
ARCHIE
That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
helluva team, y'know?
(to Su)
Well, not you, 'cause you're law
enforcement. But the rest of us
-- look, a white guy comes in handy
now and then. Y'know, if you're
pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
ripping off a country club or
whatever... What kind of percentage
are we talking?
98.
FAIT
We're not.
Fait looks at Vanessa again.
Finding a new purpose in her
eyes. Beat.
FAIT
Time I got real.
He regards the others.
FAIT
Time we all did.
ARCHIE
Get real?
What's that mean?
TOMMY
... Means we're through with that
life.
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.
Beat.
Tommy nods.
Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
DARIA
I'm with you, T.
He looks to Miles.
MILES
Whatever you say, man.
Fait looks back to Su.
They hold the look.
SU
... Good luck.
FAIT
... Faith.
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
ARCHIE
What, you're all gonna go straight,
just like that?
TOMMY
Maybe oughta try it yourself.
ARCHIE
Me? Are you kidding? I've had
straight jobs. You ever had a
99.
straight job?
TOMMY
I had plenty of straight jobs.
ARCHIE
Name one.
TOMMY
I sold Avon door-to-door.
ARCHIE
... You were an Avon lady?
TOMMY
I was an Avon man. You got a problem
with that?
ARCHIE
No, it's just, well, uh...
TOMMY
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
(then)
But my momma did it, and don't you
dare start disrespecting my momma...
And so on... OFF which, we...
