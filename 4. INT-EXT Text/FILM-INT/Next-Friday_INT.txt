The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's
father), storms out of the bedroom.
He struggles to put on
his dog catcher's uniform.
He stops at the bathroom door and
knocks hard.
MR. JONES
Craig!
Craig!
Off yo' ass and on yo'
feet; this ain't the time to beat your
meat!
Mr. Jones laughs at himself.
CRAIG (O.S.)
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
MR. JONES
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!
And we gotta
hit the high-way!
Mr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat.
Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.
A pack
of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.
Papers are ripped from the
package.
CLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES
the doctor of this delicate operation.
CRAIG (V.O.)
Soon as my pops found out what Debo said
to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my
uncle and little cousin in Rancho
Cucamonga.
Til' things calm down, or
Debo went back to prison.
Whichever
comes first.
He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting
the finishing touches on his masterpiece.
He licks, rolls
and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.
CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
I feel like the biggest punk around here.
I wiped Debo's ass.
He should be the one
moving.
He exits.
He's daydreaming about Smokey.
CRAIG (V.O.)
I didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at
all.
Especially my homeboy Smokey.
But
he went to rehab last week.
I know I'mma
miss him...
Out of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck.
Mr. Jones
slams on the BRAKES.
DEBO
Craig!
Get out the car, boy!
This the
rematch!
Debo reaches for his shank.
Craig turns to Mr. Jones!
CRAIG
Daddy, punch it!
Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.
He falls over the hood,
off the car and in the street.
The yellow truck speeds off.
Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.
DEBO
You know I'mma find you!
You can run ya'
can't hide!
BACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS
Craig screams out the window.
CRAIG
You fake ass Suge Knight!
Mr. Jones is a bit shaken up.
MR. JONES
That nigga worst than them damn pit
bulldogs or something!
That's why moving
wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is
the best thing for you right now.
CRAIG
(with attitude)
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
MR. JONES
It ain't about being a punk, son.
It's
about this...
Craig smells something in the air.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
My great, great grand daddy on my Momma
side; had a saying... 'See a fool --
leave a fool.'
Somebody else a get him.
Plus, I don't want that fool shooting at
my house trying to hit yo' ass.
CRAIG
What's that smell?
Mr. Jones sniffs.
MR. JONES
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't
smell nothing.
CRAIG
(holding his nose)
I do.
MR. JONES
What it smell like?
CRAIG
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Mr. Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat.
He
starts to spray too much.
Craig's window won't roll down.
CRAIG (cont'd)
What's wrong with the window?
MR. JONES
I gotta get'em fixed.
They don't roll
down.
CRAIG
All damn.
MR. JONES
Just hold your breath.
Day-Day and Craig enter the house.
They still have the
furniture from the projects.
Craig looks around.
He spots
at a few hanging pictures.
CRAIG
Man, this a cool house.
DAY-DAY
(picking up a picture)
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a
chance to see it.
Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on.
She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
But when she found out we won the money,
she had a heart attack.
You know the
story.
CRAIG
Yeah.
A sad moment.
DAY-DAY
Go on and make yourself at home.
I'mma
go get dressed for work.
CRAIG
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
DAY-DAY
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping
center.
I'mma talk to my boss and see if
he got a little position for you.
'Cause
you been unemployed for a long time now,
Craig.
CRAIG
Thanks for reminding me.
Day-Day exits.
Craig is left to look around, until something
outside catches his eye.
Craig waves back, but something ain't right.
Uncle Elroy
steps in with SUGA (39), his nymphomaniac girlfriend.
She's
wearing a sexy nightie that's a size too small.
UNCLE ELROY
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady,
Suga.
Suga, this is Craig.
SUGA
Oooh, ba-by!
She gives Craig a big, juicy hug and kiss, grabbing his ass
in the process.
SUGA (cont'd)
(hugging and grabbing)
You even cuter than your baby pictures.
CRAIG
Thank you.
SUGA
(whispering in Craig's ear)
You know, I'mma be your new auntie.
We
can keep it all in the family if you want
to.
Uncle Elroy un-hugs them.
UNCLE ELROY
Okay, okay, that's enough.
Go put on
some damn clothes.
SUGA
(pouting)
Elroy.
UNCLE ELROY
Suga.
Go ahead and get us something to
smoke on.
SUGA
Okay.
(winking)
Bye, Craig.
CRAIG
Nice to meet you.
Suga walks out.
UNCLE ELROY
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day.
Viagra ain't working.
My back keep going
out... she don't never get enough.
But
check this out.
I got to lay some ground
rules.
(gets closer to Craig)
Your my family and I love you.
You're
welcome to anything you want in my home.
But I don't wanna catch you in the
refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you
feel me knocking?
CRAIG
Yeah.
UNCLE ELROY
Well, let me in.
CRAIG
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's
car?
He looks.
UNCLE ELROY
Oh, that's D'Wana.
His ex.
(yelling upstairs)
Day-Day, the crazy bitch is back!
Day-Day runs down the stairs to get a look.
He's holding a
piece of paper.
DAY-DAY
Aw, naw.
He runs out the door.
They rush Day-Day into the shower.
DAY-DAY
(confused)
Hold on.
What you doing?
Uncle Elroy turns on the cold water.
Day-Day screams.
He
tries to get out.
They push him back in.
UNCLE ELROY
Wet your eyes, boy.
Stay in there for
about 20 minutes.
DAY-DAY
20 minutes?
UNCLE ELROY
Yeah, 20 minutes.
Trust me.
I've been
pepper sprayed nine times.
20 minutes.
Uncle Elroy slams the door.
Day-Day stands in the shower
fully dressed and soaking wet.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Let me show you my back yard.
You know
it's bigger than y'all back yard.
They exit, leaving Day-Day in the shower.
Day-Day's room is junky.
Clothes are everywhere.
He's
putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc T-shirt.
Craig comes
in.
CRAIG
You straight?
DAY-DAY
Yeah, I'm alright.
Is my face still
orange to you?
Day-Day's face looks sunburned.
CRAIG
Just a little.
DAY-DAY
I can't taste nothing.
CRAIG
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
DAY-DAY
Man, it's a long story.
I met D'Wana
three months ago.
She had a little pudge
in her stomach but I didn't pay it no
attention.
Come to find out, she six
months pregnant.
Saying I'm the daddy!
CRAIG
What?
DAY-DAY
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago
and she's been harassing me ever since.
She don't care about the restraining
order or nothing.
CRAIG
Restraining order?
Where the hell you
meet this girl?
DAY-DAY
I went back to Watts to sell my old car
and met her on the way.
Worst day of my
life.
CRAIG
Damn, you got a stalker.
DAY-DAY
That ain't the worst part.
Her little
sister, Baby D.
She's the one that gets
real physical.
But I got a restraining
order on her, too.
CRAIG
You got a restraining order on a little
girl named Baby D?
DAY-DAY
(very serious)
You don't know Baby D.
He looks at his watch.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired
like you.
Day-Day exits.
Craig is close behind.
Craig steps into the house.
UNCLE ELROY
Nephew, you got perfect timing...
Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.
He has a Phillies'
Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
We about to start a little puff, puff
give in this mothafucka.
Are you down?
Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine.
She moves over, making
room in the middle.
SUGA
(patting the couch)
Come on, Craig.
Sit down right here.
Craig does.
Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight.
Uncle Elroy licks the cigar.
UNCLE ELROY
I know you smoke weed, right?
CRAIG
Why you say that?
UNCLE ELROY
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the
long way.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
All I smoke is blunts.
Them fuckin'
Zigzags don't do nothing for me.
Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash
can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already).
Suga
presses against Craig.
SUGA
Would you like a glass of wine, baby?
CRAIG
No thank you. It's too early.
Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed.
He's
concentrating.
UNCLE ELROY
Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them
bitches in Havana.
I know Willie don't
let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya
uncle.
I don't care how high you get in
my house.
Long as you let me hit it...
He licks and rolls.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Look at that.
It's perfect.
SUGA
Fire it up, Roy.
Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter.
UNCLE ELROY
Now I'mma show you the real "Puff Daddy."
He lights the blunt.
Craig's watching, so is Suga.
Uncle
Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time.
Maybe too
long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke
(cough with your mouth closed).
And toke.
And toke.
And
toke.
It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a
big puff of smoke.
Then he starts to cough, and cough, and
cough out of control.
Craig and Suga are amazed at this display.
Uncle Elroy falls
to the floor on his hands and knees.
Still coughing.
He
falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
(still coughing)
It's the Bombay.
Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips.
He hits
it, holds it in and looks at Suga.
Suddenly, his eyes bulge
out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke.
He
starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle
Elroy who's still coughing.
Craig passes the blunt to Suga,
who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the
CAMERA.
(As if to say, "Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.").
All three are passed out on the couch.
Uncle Elroy is
snoring with a little slobber hanging.
Craig's knocked out
with his mouth open.
Suga's head is not secure and she's
starting to bob.
She bobs so hard that her head falls in
Craig's lap.
He wakes up and looks down.
CRAIG
Suga.
He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him.
UNCLE ELROY
Negro, what the hell you doing to my
woman?
CRAIG
(confused and dazed)
I don't know!
UNCLE ELROY
Suga!
SUGA
(face in lap)
Huh?
UNCLE ELROY
What you doing to my nephew?
SUGA
(lifting her head)
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.
(to Craig)
Craig, what are you doing to me?
CRAIG
I don't know, I think I passed out or
something.
I don't remember.
UNCLE ELROY
Passed out?
Can't hang, huh?
Boy, I
knew you was a lightweight.
Passed out
on one funky ass blunt.
They don't make
'em like they used to, baby.
Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Come on, woman.
I'm faded and feeling X-
rated.
It's Mr. Nasty time.
SUGA
Mr. Nasty time?
UNCLE ELROY
Mr. Nasty time.
(grabbing his back)
But take it easy on me, girl.
SUGA
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight
around here.
Suga takes Elroy's hand.
UNCLE ELROY
Make yourself at home.
They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.
It's too
quiet now.
He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.
Flicks
a few channels.
He picks up the blunt and the lighter.
ON TV
A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center.
It's SMOKEY!
SMOKEY (V.O.)
Hi, my name is Smokey.
And I'm a bud-
head.
But here at the King/Drew Rehab
Center, they help you curve your crave
for marijuana but still let you get your
drank on.
He lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English.
SMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.)
It's too hard to stop everything all at
once.
So some days they let you smoke,
but not drank.
And other days you can
drank, but not smoke.
And if you're
really making progress, the nurses will
get fucked up wit you.
Helping you kick
the habit by smoking up all yo shit.
So
come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center
and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B.,
man!
BACK ON COUCH
Craig is high.
He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on
his face.
It seems like the walls are shaking.
He looks
over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic
Park.
Plaster falls from the ceiling.
He listens, it's
Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.
UNCLE ELROY (O.S.)
Oh, baby, right there.
Right
there...bite the nipple, baby.
Bite it!
Bite it!
Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come
on, baby, get busy...
His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door.
Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.
The
KNOCKING gets LOUDER.
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
Delivery!
CRAIG
Hold on.
Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.
The
KNOCKING CONTINUES.
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
Delivery!
CRAIG
I said hold on!
DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda
hot out here.
Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open.
ON PORCH
The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts
and a buzz cut, is looking into the house.
CRAIG
Can I help you?
DELIVERY GUY
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer.
You must be one of those entertainers.
What team you play for?
CRAIG
I don't play for no team.
DELIVERY GUY
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.
Got a
white wife, huh?
Blonde bombshell type.
Remember what happen to O.J... what team
do you play for?
You're not related to
the Jacksons, are you?
CRAIG
(in his face)
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker
Killers.
You want tickets?
DELIVERY GUY
Okay, buddy.
Don't send your entourage
out here to do a 187 on me.
It's just a
certified mail delivery.
He hands Craig a letter.
DELIVERY GUY (cont'd)
Sign here.
Craig signs.
CRAIG
What is it?
DELIVERY GUY
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope
the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if
not, back to the ghetto you go.
Wife
stays here, of course.
He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle.
DELIVERY GUY (cont'd)
'...temporary layoffs?
Good
Times...hustling and surviving... Good
Times...ain't we lucky we got'em...' Oh
shit!
Cheeco starts to chase him down the street.
Craig looks at
the notice.
"DELINQUENT! YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED AND
AUCTIONED -- TOMORROW AT 9AM
PAY TODAY!"
CRAIG
Oh damn.
He SLAMS the DOOR.
We FOLLOW Craig upstairs TO Uncle Elroy's
room.
He knocks softly.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Uncle Elroy?
No answer.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Uncle Elroy, you got a tax notice.
Still no answer.
He turns the knob.
It's open.
Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace.
Black lights,
candles, velvet posters - the works.
There's even a leather
fuck swing hanging from the ceiling.
Uncle Elroy and Suga
are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed.
Craig is amazed.
He
slowly walks over to the bed.
Uncle Elroy is calling the
hogs.
Snoring.
CRAIG
(whispering)
Uncle Elroy...Uncle Elroy?
He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big
grunt.
It startles Craig.
He looks over at Suga.
She's
completely under the covers.
Uncle Elroy rolls over on his
stomach, then he rolls on his back again.
Craig shakes him.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Uncle Elroy, wake up.
You got a letter
today.
No response.
Craig tries again.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Unc.
Uncle Elroy jumps up like a hibernating grizzly.
UNCLE ELROY
(half asleep)
Come on here, Suga...
He goes after Craig, who has to fight him off.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
I like it rough now.
CRAIG
Naw, naw!
Unc, wake up!
It's me!
Wake
up!
Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed.
Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but
now everything is totally still and quiet.
Uncle Elroy
starts to snore again.
He's asleep.
The coast is clear now.
Craig tries to make his escape.
He crawls over Suga to get
away.
She grabs him and starts to kiss him.
SUGA
(half asleep)
Ohhh, baby!
Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room.
On his
exit, he hangs himself on the "fuck swing" and hits the floor
with a thud.
He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of
there.
Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever
happened.
IN HALLWAY
Craig tries to gain his composure.
He gets an idea.
Mr. Jones' dog truck sits in front.
DEBO
Here's the plan.
You gonna call over
there and say you have a very urgent
message for Mr. William Jones.
EZAL
What urgent message?
DEBO
If you shut up I'll tell you.
The urgent
message is...Drop everything!
Craig is
in trouble.
Come quick, don't call.
EZAL
That ain't gonna work.
Debo slaps him in the back of the head.
DEBO
Just do it.
EZAL
I don't know the number.
Smack!
Debo slaps him again.
DEBO
It's on the outside of the building, now
pick the phone up!
Ezal picks up the phone.
He starts to dial.
EZAL
Hello...Yeah, I got an urgent message for
a nigga named Mr. Willie Jones.
Debo slaps him again.
DEBO
William.
EZAL
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a
customer named William Jones.
Drop
everything, Craig is in trouble.
Come
quick.
Don't try to call.
Ezal hangs up the phone.
EZAL (cont'd)
Man, you better stop hittin' on me for I
do you like Craig did you.
DEBO
Let's go.
Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck.
Debo
opens the back and lets all the dogs out.
They run for it.
DEBO (cont'd)
After I get in, close the door.
Debo is a hard fit.
Ezal stuffs him in there.
EZAL
You too big.
DEBO
Keep pushing.
Finally he's in.
Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.
Just
then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich
in hand.
MR. JONES
Oh my God!
He gets in and speeds off.
Everything is pink inside this mom and pop record store.
The
latest RAP HIT PLAYS in the B.G.
A few people exit the store
with bags.
Day-Day is scanning inventory.
A bud-head by the name of
ROACH is on top of the counter with his skateboard.
ROACH
Yo, Day-Day!
Check me out.
He tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his
board.
Wrong!
Off the board and on his ass.
DAY-DAY
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never
worked in a record shop before and you're
a little excited.
But if Pinky catches
you doing that X-Games shit off his
counter top, we both getting fired.
You
feel me?
ROACH
I feel you.
I've just been practicing
that one move all week.
(disappointed)
I thought that was it.
An unhappy CUSTOMER walks in holding a CD without the cover.
CUSTOMER #1
I can't get jiggy with this shit.
(getting loud)
Where is the damn manager?
DAY-DAY
Sir, the manager stepped out for a
moment.
I'm currently running the store.
Can I see the CD?
The customer throws the CD on the counter.
Day-Day picks it
up.
CUSTOMER #1
No, give me my damn money back.
Right
now, and I don't have no damn receipt
neither.
DAY-DAY
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
CUSTOMER #1
I don't have no damn cover.
Craig walks in with the notice in hand.
DAY-DAY
I can't give you your damn money back on
this.
CUSTOMER #1
Bullshit!
I'll go postal in this
mothafucka!
DAY-DAY
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
The customer KNOCKS over a counter display and then turns to
get away.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Hey!
Craig bumps him and he falls into the Rap cassette rack.
CUSTOMER #1
I'm sorry!
Don't hit me!
Don't hit me.
He jumps up and slips on a few more cassettes on his scramble
out the door.
DAY-DAY
...and if you come back, it's gonna be
worse.
Roach can't believe what just happened.
ROACH
Did you see that?
That was a W.W.F. hit
right there, huh, Day-Day?
DAY-DAY
Yeah, it was.
How you get up here?
CRAIG
I walked.
DAY-DAY
You walked?
CRAIG
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.
It came
certified mail.
He gives it to Day-Day.
DAY-DAY
Craig, this Roach.
Roach, this is my
cousin, Craig.
ROACH
What up, bro?
Craig nods his head.
CRAIG
I tried to wake up Uncle Elroy but he
thought I was Suga.
Day-Day reads the notice.
DAY-DAY
You know what this is?
CRAIG
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
ROACH
What it say?
Day-Day ignores Roach.
DAY-DAY
How can they do this?
CRAIG
I don't know.
Did ya'll forget to pay it
or something?
ROACH
What it say?
DAY-DAY
Ever since my momma died the bills are
always late.
CRAIG
See how much it is?
Day-Day opens it.
A PHONE starts to RING.
ROACH
What is it?
DAY-DAY
Don't worry about it, man.
Get the
phone.
Roach skateboards over to the phone.
ROACH
Pinky's.
Day-Day reads on.
DAY-DAY
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
CRAIG
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from
the lottery?
Day-Day goes for his bank book.
He flips a few pages.
DAY-DAY
$247.
CRAIG
Okay, plan B.
Day-Day is overwhelmed.
Roach skates back over.
ROACH
That was a girl on a cell phone.
She
said she's outside in the parking lot
waiting for you to take her to lunch.
Day-Day looks at Craig.
He runs over to the door.
OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT
D'Wana sits in her car with her play sister BABY'D (her name
does not fit her body).
DAY-DAY
Oh my God.
That's D'Wana.
And she got
Baby'D with her.
Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back.
Craig and
Roach follow.
CRAIG
What's the matter?
DAY-DAY
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
ROACH
That the big one, huh?
DAY-DAY
You damn right that's the big one.
The PHONE starts to RING again.
D'Wana and Baby'D are at the
door.
D'Wana is on her phone.
Baby'D starts to knock.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm
gone.
CRAIG
I ain't trying to get in it.
DAY-DAY
You already in.
The knocking gets louder.
CRAIG
No I'm not.
ROACH
I'll do it.
DAY-DAY
No.
You can't handle a girl like D'Wana.
It's got to be Craig.
AT FRONT DOOR
They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign.
D'WANA
That white boy said he was in there.
BABY'D
Day-Day, don't make me break this window!
Craig is peeking out.
He hesitates.
DAY-DAY
Watch out for Baby'D.
Craig walks out the back.
He steps over the door.
Unlocks
it, and cracks it open.
CRAIG
Day-Day ain't here.
They don't believe him.
D'WANA
Who are you?
CRAIG
I'm his cousin.
BABY'D
You suppose to work here now or
something?
CRAIG
Yeah, I work here now.
D'WANA
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
CRAIG
Yes you did.
D'WANA
No we didn't.
We came to buy a CD.
BABY'D
Now move.
Baby'D kicks the door.
Craig has no choice but to let 'em
in.
D'WANA
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was
here?
CRAIG
I don't know... I think he went out the
back.
D'WANA
Can I look for myself?
Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area.
ROACH
Hey, ladies.
D'WANA
Where's Day-Day?
ROACH
I don't know, he must've left.
D'Wana looks at Baby'D.
CRAIG
I thought ya'll wanted to buy a CD?
BABY'D
I do... can you help me find the jazz
section?
Craig looks at Roach for directions.
He nods over towards
the front of the store.
CRAIG
Right this way.
You know damn well you
don't listen to no jazz.
Baby'D checks out Craig as he leads the way.
D'Wana looks
around.
D'WANA
If Day-Day comes back, tell him I came by
and need to see him.
Lamaze classes are
Wednesday.
ROACH
Will do.
D'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'D.
D'WANA
Come on, 'D, let's go.
But first she doubles back towards the storage room.
CRAIG
Where you going?
D'WANA
Ain't the rest room this way?
I gotta
pee.
ROACH
Yeah.
D'WANA
Thank you.
As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake.
BACK STORAGE AREA
DAY-DAY
Shit.
Day-Day makes a run for it.
She spots him ducking out the
back door.
D'WANA
He's in there!
INSIDE STORE
Baby'D knocks Craig out of the way.
BABY'D
Where is he?
D'WANA
He ran out the door.
Baby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind.
DAY-DAY
What was that?
ROACH
(looking out window)
You don't wanna know.
Day-Day is devastated.
DAY-DAY
Thanks a lot, Craig.
CRAIG
I know we cousins and all, but don't try
an' hook me up with the big little
sisters.
DAY-DAY
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
ROACH
For sure.
That's how I like 'em.
CRAIG
Not me.
DAY-DAY
Are they still out there?
ROACH
Negative...they vamped.
Day-Day starts to walk into the back storage area.
ROACH (cont'd)
Shouldn't we straighten up out here
before Pinky gets back?
Day-Day is like a zombie now.
He doesn't answer, just keeps
walking.
CRAIG
Day-Day?
No answer.
Craig looks at Roach.
They follow.
BACK STORAGE AREA
Day-Day sits with the notice in hand.
DAY-DAY
Today ain't my day.
ROACH
Bummer, huh?
And Friday is suppose to be
a kick-ass day.
CRAIG
Yeah it is...the best day before the
weekend.
ROACH
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Day-Day is still sad.
ROACH (cont'd)
I know how you feeling.
And if I had my
bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til
you choke.'
Dude, right here.
All out.
No lungs.
All I got is this.
Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it.
CRAIG
What's the green stuff poking out?
ROACH
That's cron-don, sir.
My mom hates for
me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies.
Wanna bite?
CRAIG
Naw, I already ate.
ROACH
Come on, Day, try it.
For moms.
Day-Day shakes his head.
Craig reaches into his fifth
pocket.
CRAIG
It ain't a bong but, wa-la!
He has the joint from this morning.
ROACH
Wo!
Roach snatches it.
CRAIG
Hey.
Craig snatches it back.
ROACH
Sorry, bro, reflexes.
How did you do
that?
CRAIG
Black magic.
Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth.
DAY-DAY
Give me dat.
I'm the one with the
problem.
Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter.
ROACH
Weed doesn't solve problems.
It eases
the mind, and the soul.
Enjoy.
He lights the joint.
Day-Day takes a hit.
CRAIG
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
DAY-DAY
(letting out the smoke)
I don't.
ROACH
(taking the joint)
I do.
DAY-DAY
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.
I
didn't even pass it.
ROACH
(hitting it good)
Sorry, dude.
CRAIG
You better open up a window or something
before the smell gets out.
DAY-DAY
Ain't no windows in here.
ROACH
I got an idea.
He hands the joint to Craig.
Gets up and closes the door.
Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner.
ROACH (cont'd)
This is a little theory of mine... it
should work.
He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON.
He puts the nozzle
in Day-Day's face.
DAY-DAY
Blow.
CRAIG
That ain't gonna work.
ROACH
Fuck yeah.
Day-Day hits the 'J and blows into the nozzle.
It quickly
sucks up the smoke.
DAY-DAY
(passing the 'J)
It works.
CRAIG
Still gonna smell it.
ROACH
No way.
Watch this.
Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else.
Smoke starts
to come out of his ears.
Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of
that.
Mr. Jones is driving and eating at the same time.
He
finishes off the last few bites of his sandwich.
MR. JONES
Just hold on, Craig.
I'm on my way.
Debo and Ezal are smashed inside the dog cages.
EZAL
Debo!
Debo!
DEBO
What?
EZAL
I can't feel my legs no more.
DEBO
Me neither.
How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
EZAL
I don't know.
Uncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a S&M; mask and
holding a tube of KY jelly.
He removes the mask.
Day-Day
hands him the notice.
Uncle Elroy takes it with his greasy
hands.
UNCLE ELROY
Ah damn.
Damn.
DAY-DAY
I got fired too.
UNCLE ELROY
What?!
He starts to beat Day-Day with a sex toy.
The private party is starting to heat up.
Big Joker sits on
the couch with a PRETTY YOUNG GIRL on his lap.
He's smoking
on a perfectly rolled cone joint.
Li'l Joker dances with the
other girlfriend, as an OLD SCHOOL JAM PLAYS in the B.G.
The
other senorita is pouring herself a drink.
Karla walks into the room.
KARLA
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
JOKER
I'll take you later.
KARLA
When?
After you get all drunk and
loaded?
JOKER
Hey!
I said I'll take your fuckin' ass
later.
Now get out of here.
You're
scaring our company.
Karla storms out the room.
Baby Joker walks in carrying the
chrome pump.
JOKER (cont'd)
Get up.
The Pretty Girl moves off Joker's lap.
JOKER (cont'd)
Take it in the room.
Baby Joker carries the pump in the bedroom.
Joker is close
behind.
He SLAMS the DOOR.
The Girl dancing with Li'l Joker
gets too nosy.
GIRL #1
What was that?
LI'L JOKER
What was what?
GIRL #1
That silver thing.
LI'L JOKER
I didn't see no silver thing, and neither
did you.
The SA brothers are having a good time.
Joker is getting
nasty with one of the Girls.
He pulls her by the hand.
GIRL #2
No.
JOKER
Fuck that.
Joker picks her up and carries her to the bedroom.
She
screams.
He laughs.
He goes for the door.
It's locked.
JOKER (cont'd)
Who locked this door?
Everybody looks confused.
JOKER (cont'd)
Who locked this fuckin' door?!
Joker starts to kick the door.
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Craig hurries to put the pump back.
He's about to go for the
window when: BANG!
There's a KICK on the door.
All Craig
can do is go for another door on the other side of the room.
BANG!
The door flies open and Craig is out there just in
time.
JOKER
I don't want no doors locked around here.
You hear me?
Joker walks in and hits the lights.
He throws the girl on
the bed.
GIRL #2
Oh, poppy, I like it rough.
JOKER
(taking off shirt)
Good, 'cause that's how you gonna get it.
Baby Joker has his back turned when we see Craig sprint
behind him and up the stairs.
Baby Joker turns around.
He
thinks he saw something.
He slowly starts to walk up the
stairs.
LI'L JOKER
Karla!
Karla is in her room working out.
Craig runs in.
He's
shocked to see her.
She doesn't see him, but he's frozen.
Then she turns around and he startles her.
KARLA
What are you doing?
Think fast, Craig.
CRAIG
Huh?
KARLA
What are you doing here?
CRAIG
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I
just had to come in here and show you I
ain't scared of yo' punk ass
brothers...and you wouldn't have be
scared of 'em neither if you had a man
like me in yo' life.
KARLA
What??
So you snuck in my room to tell
me that?
CRAIG
Yes I did.
Excuse me.
Her door flies open.
Smashing Craig behind it.
It's Li'l
Joker.
LI'L JOKER
Who you talking to?
Craig looks nervous.
KARLA
Nobody.
LI'L JOKER
I heard a voice.
KARLA
No you didn't.
Get out my room.
Go back
down to your little girlfriends.
Karla pushes Li'l Joker out.
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
Day-Day is having a fit.
GIRL #2 (O.S.)
Shut the window.
JOKER (O.S.)
You shut the window.
She does.
DAY-DAY
Oh shit.
Day-Day takes off.
He hops the fence in record speed.
CHEECO
...is laying on his back looking through the fence.
He's
calm and cool now.
OTHER SIDE
Roach is on his back looking through the fence.
He hits a
joint and blows the smoke into Cheeco's face.
ROACH
...like I was saying.
A guy like me, and
a dog like you, don't need this bullshit.
We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to
fat funks in flower shirts.
You feel me,
C?
Cheeco is passed out.
Day-Day sneaks around the corner.
He
whispers.
DAY-DAY
Roach...Roach, come on.
ROACH
Where's Craig?
DAY-DAY
He's inside the house?
ROACH
Why did he go in the house?
DAY-DAY
Don't worry about it.
We gotta figure
out a way to get Craig out of there.
He's probably getting tied up now.
Craig is sweating.
Karla is standing in front of him.
KARLA
You did all this for me?
CRAIG
Most of it.
I just hate to see you in
this situation.
KARLA
Thanks for noticing.
It used ta be
peaceful before they got out.
Took over
the house and caused my mother's nervous
breakdown.
CRAIG
Why didn't she put'em out?
KARLA
Easier said than done.
We saved up to
get away from them, but they followed us.
CRAIG
I'm sorry to hear that.
Craig walks over to the window.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Can I get out this way?
Karla walks up behind him, looking very sexy.
KARLA
I thought you came up here to see me.
Craig turns around.
CRAIG
I did.
Is that door locked?
KARLA
It's locked.
CRAIG
Make sure.
Karla turns around to check the door.
KARLA
You so nervous, I already locked this
door.
Craig drops a thick roll of money into her purse.
She shakes
the knob.
KARLA (cont'd)
See.
All locked.
She walks over to him.
They're face-to-face.
KARLA (cont'd)
What's your hurry?
CRAIG
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
KARLA
(getting even closer)
So what?
Let's make'em wait.
Craig looks AT the CAMERA.
CRAIG
I be damn.
Joker storms in with the AK.
Li'l Joker is in the corner
with his girl, and Baby Joker is on the floor.
Joker TURNS
DOWN THE STEREO.
JOKER
You fuckin' lover boys hear that?
BABY JOKER
Hear what?
The KNOCKING continues.
Li'l Joker and Baby Joker push the
girls aside and jump up.
Li'l Joker grabs a big knife.
Baby
Joker grabs a 9mm.
Joker looks at the girls.
JOKER
Don't fuckin' move.
They won't.
The brothers run to the door.
OUTSIDE
Roach is still kicking.
DAY-DAY
What's wrong with you, fool.
Stop
kicking their door.
They might think we
the police.
The front door swings open and before we know it.
Day-Day's
got an AK pointed in his face, and Roach is looking at a 9
close up.
JOKER
What the fuck you want?
Day-Day's tongue doesn't work.
DAY-DAY
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup
of sugar?
JOKER
What?!
This look like a 7-11 or
something?
Get the fuck outta here!
DAY-DAY
(starts to leave)
Alright, no problem.
We gone.
ROACH
Hold on.
A man, you broke my fuckin'
board and I don't appreciate it.
Immediately Day-Day and Roach are snatched inside the house,
and the door is SLAMMED.
Day-Day and Roach are sitting on a couch looking nervous.
The Joker brothers hold guns on them.
The three half-dressed
Mexican Girls look a bit scared themselves.
DAY-DAY
Look, man, this is a big
misunderstanding.
All we wanted to do is
borrow some sugar.
ROACH
And some rolling papers.
DAY-DAY
...and some rolling papers, that's it.
We didn't mean to mess up y'all get
together or nothing.
(to the Girls)
How y'all doing?
They answer --
GIRLS
Fine.
DAY-DAY
That's good.
My name's Day-Day and this
is my friend, Roach.
ROACH
(waving)
Hey.
DAY-DAY
Ya'll live around here?
JOKER
Shut up!
Both of you right now!
DAY-DAY
(to Roach)
Shhhh!
Roach, shut the fuck up.
JOKER
I don't believe this sugar shit.
Something ain't right.
Joker thinks for a moment.
Then he turns to Baby Joker.
JOKER (cont'd)
(in Spanish)
Go check on the money.
Baby Joker obeys the order.
LI'L JOKER
Here comes Karla, put the guns away.
JOKER
Keep your mouth shut.
Karla walks back in.
KARLA
Hey, what's going on?
JOKER
Nothing.
What you want?
KARLA
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
JOKER
Take your car.
KARLA
'Take your car?'
JOKER
Yeah, and hurry up.
Karla doesn't believe it.
KARLA
Okay.
She grabs the keys off the bar.
KARLA (cont'd)
I'll be back in a bit.
'Bye.
She's out the door.
Joker turns to Day-Day and Roach.
JOKER
If everything's alright.
We might let
you leave, too.
It's the same scene as before.
Two angry Mexicans, three
half-naked Girls, plus Day-Day and Roach in the middle.
Baby
Joker returns.
BABY JOKER
(in Spanish)
Some of the money is missing.
JOKER
(upset)
What?!?!
DAY-DAY
What?!
(as he looks at Roach)
What that mean?
ROACH
I don't know.
JOKER
It means you Miyateas are staying with
us.
(to Baby Joker)
Get the duct tape.
(to Li'l Joker)
You know what to do.
Li'l Joker turns to the girls.
LI'L JOKER
Put your clothes back on.
The scared Girls start to dress.
Craig, Mr. Jones, Uncle Elroy, Suga and Miss Ho Kym are
peeking out the window.
CRAIG
You see that?
MR. JONES
I saw it.
UNCLE ELROY
Me, too.
You think they're in there?
CRAIG
Yup.
MISS HO KYM
Why for?
Them boys are real player
haters.
CRAIG
It's a long story.
Right now we gotta do
somethin'.
MR. JONES
You come way out here to get into more
trouble.
You could've stayed at home.
UNCLE ELROY
Willie, shut up.
Yo' old ass need to get
in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
MR. JONES
(rolling up his sleeve)
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.
I ain't
lost none of my street skills.
SUGA
If ya'll don't come back not in ten
minutes, I'mma callin' the po'lice.
Craig, Uncle Elroy and Mr. Jones are about to go on a
mission.
UNCLE ELROY
Wait a minute.
I gotta go get my shit.
Uncle Elroy runs upstairs.
Li'l Joker is almost finished duct-taping Day-Day and Roach.
Baby Joker holds the AK.
Joker paces the floor.
Day-Day and
Roach try to make peace by singing an old "War" song.
Day-
Day is serious.
DAY-DAY & ROACH
'Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we
be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?'...
DAY-DAY
(still singing)
'I hope my cousin call the C.I.A.'
Joker throws a BOTTLE against the wall.
It SHATTERS into a
million pieces.
JOKER
Shut the fuck up!
The singing stops.
JOKER (cont'd)
If you don't tell me where my money is,
I'mma show you how close we can get.
DAY-DAY
Money?
Man, we came over here from some
sugar and rolling papers.
We was going
to get high, and I was going to show this
white boy how to make Kool-Aid.
That's
all.
ROACH
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro.
It's Friday.
Joker walks over to Roach and kicks him in the mouth.
JOKER
I'm hearing a lot of talking, but I'm not
hearing the right words.
BABY JOKER
Maybe the other guy took it.
DAY-DAY
Why would he take it?
He don't even know
you.
JOKER
(thinking)
Shut up!
Where's that other miyatea?
Joker is getting tired of the games.
And Day-Day is pleading
for his life.
JOKER
Tape his mouth shut.
DAY-DAY
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot
for this community.
By letting us go,
you can improve black and brown
relations.
ROACH
Yeah, brown and white relations, too.
Day-Day looks at Roach.
DAY-DAY
Boy, you gonna get us killed.
Li'l Joker grabs Day-Day and tapes his mouth shut.
He does
the same to Roach.
JOKER
I'm sick and tired of bullshitting with
you guys.
(in Spanish)
Baby brother, go get the chainsaw.
Baby Joker hands him the AK and he's gone.
Day-Day and Roach
look terrified.
Everything has turned serious.
Debo and Ezal are still asleep.
Debo wakes first.
DEBO
Ezal!
Ezal!
EZAL
Huh?
DEBO
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
EZAL
Good, let's get out.
They both try to get out.
But it's no way to get out from
the inside.
DEBO
Hey, how you get out of here.
EZAL
I don't know.
They both start to go nuts on the door.
OUTSIDE
The dog truck is shaking like crazy.
The terror continues.
JOKER
My little brother went out to get my
chainsaw.
I'mma show you what happens to
fools who don't tell me what I wanna
hear.
You ever see Scarface, mothafucka?
Day-Day starts to cry.
Roach tries to scream through the
tape.
Joker turns to Li'l Joker.
JOKER (cont'd)
Go see what's taking him so long.
Li'l Joker obeys.
We FOLLOW Li'l Joker THROUGH the house and
OUT the back door.
Joker is pissed.
JOKER
Where are these fucking guys?
He storms out the room.
Day-Day and Roach try to escape.
They flap around on the ground like a fish out of water.
Day-Day and Roach have made it a little further to the door,
but they still look like fish searching for H2O.
Uncle Elroy
stumbles in.
He grabs a knife and starts to cut them loose.
UNCLE ELROY
Boy, Day-Day, I'mma kick yo' ass for
getting me into this mess and hurting my
back!
I moved out here to get away from
this kinda shit!
The "Jefferson's" theme song, "Movin' On Up," PLAYS on the
TV.
Uncle Elroy is face down on the floor looking at the TV.
Miss Ho Kym walks on his back with her shoes off.
He moans
in pleasure.
Mr. Jones eats chicken wings.
MR. JONES
Jump up and down on him.
MISS HO KYM
That's next.
UNCLE ELROY
Don't listen to him.
How much we got?
Suga is at the table counting money.
She takes a few
hundreds for herself.
SUGA
We got forty-seven thousand, three
hundred and fifteen dollars.
MR. JONES
Good Lord.
MISS HO KYM
That's a whole lot of scrilla.
UNCLE ELROY
It's gonna feel good to pay my taxes.
Craig is tending to his wounds.
CRAIG
You're welcome, Unc.
DAY-DAY
What about me?
UNCLE ELROY
You didn't do nothing.
Roach and Cheeco are about to leave.
He has a handful of
money.
ROACH
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
DAY-DAY
Thanks for the help.
ROACH
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine.
Thanks for the dog, and the money.
Maybe
my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
DAY-DAY
Call me.
ROACH
Okay, later, bro.
Hey, Craig, nice

CRAIG
You too.
MR. JONES
Smokin' what?
CRAIG
Nothing.
ROACH
Later, Mr. Jones.
Bye, Suga.
ALL
Bye, Roach.
Roach is gone.
Day-Day shuts the door.
Miss Ho Kym is
finished.
She steps off of Uncle Elroy.
MISS HO KYM
All done.
Stand up.
Uncle Elroy gets up.
He's better.
UNCLE ELROY
Hey, that George Jefferson shit works.
Thanks, Miss Kym.
Uncle Elroy walks over to the table and grabs a stack of
hundred-dollar bills.
He hands it to Miss Ho Kym.
MISS HO KYM
I can't accept.
UNCLE ELROY
You better take this money.
She takes the money.
MISS HO KYM
(in Korean)
Thank you.
(in English)
I can take a trip back to Korea now.
Find a freak daddy, bring him back to
America.
Make 'em my bitch.
SUGA
You go, girl.
Uncle Elroy helps Miss Ho Kym out the door.
MR. JONES
Well, we better hit the road, too.
Craig, get your stuff.
UNCLE ELROY
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Suga hugs Craig.
SUGA
Yeah, baby, it's a shame you leavin'.
Aunt Suga gonna miss yo.
And the others have to agree.
DAY-DAY
You sure you don't wanna stay?
CRAIG
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.

sure you get that car fixed.
DAY-DAY

When can I come visit?
CRAIG

Probably next Friday.
They're out the door.
