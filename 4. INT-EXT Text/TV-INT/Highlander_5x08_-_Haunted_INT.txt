      JENNIFER HILL, an attractive woman in her late twenties,
      lies in bed sound asleep.  All is quiet, until...

                                    ALEC (V.O.)
                            (whispering; echoey)
                      Jennifer...

      Her eyes pop open.  She listens...

                                    ALEC (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Jen...

      She sits up, confused; only half awake.

                                    ALEC (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Jennifer...

      She clears her head and quickly reaches for the lamp on the
      night stand.  She clicks it on and off several times --
      nothing.  She eyes her clock -- it's dead.  The storm has
      knocked out the power.

      With an anxious look on her face, Jennifer slowly gets up
      and moves to the bedroom door.


      She steps out of the room and looks to another bedroom door
      that sits ajar at the end of a long, dark hall.  Lightning
      flashes, thunder rolls.

      A RATTLING SOUND comes from the room.  She starts cautiously
      down the hall.  Her thin, white nightgown billows and swirls
      as she walks, giving her an almost ghostly appearance.

      The closer she gets to the end of the hall, the louder the
      rattling and the more anxious she becomes.  Her breathing
      grows labored.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96507       "Haunted"        2.       Final Shooting Script 8/22/96

      Her hand quivers as it guides her along the banister.

      She finally reaches the door, takes a deep breath and pushes
      it open...

      Nothing.

      Everything is as it should be.  She eyes a parakeet fluttering
      around his cage -- the source of the noise.  She breathes a
      sigh of relief.  She turns and starts moving back toward her
      bedroom.  Then, from far off, a PIANO playing an old fashioned
      tune ("Aura Lee").

                                      JENNIFER
                          (trembling)
                    Alec?...

      She moves tentatively through the house toward the music.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    ALEC?...

      Her heart about to leap from her chest,


      She steps to the banister and looks over -- nothing.  She
      cautiously starts down.

      She arrives at the bottom of the stairs and begins to creep
      through the darkened house, flashes of lightning
      intermittently illuminating the room.


      Passing a hall table, she reaches into a drawer, pulls out a
      flashlight and clicks it on.  The beam shines over the room. 
      Nothing out of the ordinary.

      THE MUSIC

      grows louder from the living room.  The beam of light quivers
      as her hand trembles.


      The room is furnished with an eclectic mix, Far East meets
      Boston.  Only a few modern items distinguish it from the
      same room in 1888.

      THE MUSIC STOPS

      as she steps in, shining the beam around -- all is quiet. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)96507       "Haunted"        3.       Final Shooting Script 8/22/96

706CONTINUED:706

      No one is at the old piano.  She lets out a deep breath,
      shakes her head...  relaxes for the moment, then

      CRASSSSSHHH

      Without warning a gust of wind blasts a large tree branch in
      through the dining room window, shattering it.

      She SCREAMS and nearly drops dead from fear.

      She backs away from the window, almost hysterical.  She turns
      to leave the room.  As she spins the beam of light catches a
      mirror.  In it, the blurred image of a man.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (pleading)
                    Alec...  Alec, is it you?!

      She moves toward the mirror.  The image disappears.  The
      front door rattles closed.


      A bare chested RICHIE, lost in concentration, moves around
      the mat with a practice sword.  His moves are calculated,
      his grasp tense.  He moves with caution, all the while sizing
      up an invisible foe.  His moves are intense, precise,
      impressive.

      He lets loose with a flurry of moves, spins quickly as he
      swings the sword -- and comes to an abrupt halt.  His
      concentration breaks, he stumbles, but quickly recovers as
      his eyes lock on

      JENNIFER HILL

      is standing in the doorway.  A pretty woman with youthful
      energy and a certain sweetness about her, she looks tired
      and a bit haggard.  She eyes Richie with a faint smile. 
      She's obviously been standing there watching him.

                                      JENNIFER
                    You're pretty good.

      Richie's a little embarrassed.

                                      RICHIE
                    It, ah...  it looks kinda stupid
                    unless you're picturing the other
                    guy.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (being cute)
                    Did you get him?

                                      RICHIE
                          (smiles)
                    Always do.

      He steps over to her, obviously charmed.

                    Richie Ryan.

      They shake.  He holds her hand a moment longer than is
      appropriate for just a friendly greeting.  She doesn't mind,
      and smiles again.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    I'm looking for Duncan MacLeod.

                                      RICHIE
                    Lucky guy.

      Richie grabs his shirt from a nearby bench.  As he lifts it,
      a harmonica falls from his pocket.

                                      JENNIFER
                    You play?

                                      RICHIE
                    Just learning.

      He gestures to the elevator.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Mac's upstairs.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Thanks.

      She starts for the elevator.  Richie calls after her.

                                      RICHIE
                    It needs a key.
                          (holds up his)
                    Can I give you a lift?

                                      JENNIFER
                          (with a smile)
                    Usually I don't take rides from
                      strangers...  but I'll make an
                    exception in your case.


      MACLEOD has an antique mirror propped against the coffee
      table, carefully polishing it.  As he works, he cradles a
      telephone.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    You should see it, Julius.  It's
                      beautiful.  I found it at an estate
                    sale.  I'll have it to you on
                    Saturday.

      He gets the BUZZ.

                    I'll talk to you later.

      MacLeod hangs up and gets to his feet as the elevator arrives. 
      Richie and Jennifer step out.

                                      RICHIE
                    I found a friend of yours.

                    Duncan.

      MacLeod smiles brightly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Jen.  What a terrific surprise. 
                    It's been, what?  Two years?

      He gives his hands a quick wipe as he moves toward her.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (expectantly)
                    Where's Alec?

      Her face tells it all.  She just shakes her head.  MacLeod
      takes a long beat.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (understands)
                    I'm sorry...  I'm so sorry.

      He opens his arms and wraps her in a comforting embrace. 
      She accepts it gratefully, buries herself against him.  Her
      eyes glisten.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (plaintive)
                    He wasn't supposed to die before I
                    did.

                          (with emotion)
                    He found Gerard Kraven.

      Richie is clearly affected by the story.  He looks to MacLeod.

                    You ever find the guy?

                          (off his look)
                    Maybe Alec was right.

      refuse?  MacLeod nods.


      Jennifer and Richie sit across from each other at a table. 
      Dawson eyes them from the bar as he serves some customers.

                    When Alec first told me about
                      Genevieve, about him, I thought he
                    was crazy.  I wasn't raised believing
                    in ghosts, or spirits.

      Richie nods wryly.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Exactly.  But you're real.

      She puts a hand over his, leaning in, intent.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Why not this?

      Richie doesn't know what to say.  It's a lot to absorb.  And
      he's got his eyes locked on Jennifer -- somehow, whatever
      she says seems so real.

                                      RICHIE
                    What about what Mac said?  That maybe
                    Alec believed because he needed to
                    believe.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Maybe.  Maybe he did.
                          (beat)
                    I don't think I could handle being
                    one of you, Richie.  The fear... 
                    the fighting.  Everyone you know,
                      everything you care about dying.

      Richie is touched by her empathy.

                                      RICHIE
                    I try not to think about it too much.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Sorry.
                          (beat)
                    You're very brave.  All of you.

                                      RICHIE
                          (shakes his head)
                    I don't have much choice.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe you're the brave one.  You
                    knew what Alec's life was about but
                    you stayed with him.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Maybe I didn't have a choice either.

      She leans into him a little closer.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    It was more than love.  Our souls
                      connected.

      A pause.  Richie is drawn to this woman in the strongest of
      ways.

                                      RICHIE
                    Think that could ever happen again?

                                      JENNIFER
                    I don't know.  Held have to be very
                    kind, very sweet...  Someone... 
                      someone...

      She looks deep into Richie's eyes.  Her hand moves over his. 
      Her nails gently brush his knuckles.

      Their eyes lock.  They lean in closer, inexorably drawn to
      one another.

      Their lips almost meet, then she realizes what's about to
      happen.  She breaks the stare and rises.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Whoa!
                          (standing)
                    There a ladies' room around here?

      Richie, speechless, points.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                          (confused and ashamed)
                    I'm sorry.

      She runs off.

      Dawson watches as she goes, then steps out from the bar. 
      Richie tries to collect himself after that last exchange. 
      He takes out a small cigar and lights it as Dawson steps up
      to the table and takes a seat.

                                      DAWSON
                    You smoking now?

                          (letting it go)
                    Joe.  I could use some advice.

                                      DAWSON
                    Tell me about it.  You and Alec Hill's
                    wife?

                                      RICHIE
                    It's not like that.  She's a little
                    shakey.  Mac asked me to keep an eye
                    on her.  Try to cheer her up.

                                      DAWSON
                    He what?

      Richie wonders what's so strange.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah.
                          (beat)
                    He went to San Francisco to whack
                    the son-of-a-bitch who killed her
                    husband.

      Dawson's surprised.  Richie doesn't know.  Dawson looks him
      straight in the eye -- no easy way to say this...

                                      DAWSON
                    Richie...  you re the son-of-a-bitch
                    who killed her husband.

      And off Richie's complete shock --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Richie is in denial...  stunned.

                                      RICHIE
                    It can't be!  I never even met the
                    guy!

                                      DAWSON
                    No? San Francisco, the beginning of
                    July.  Blond hair, carried a U.S. 
                    Cavalry Saber?

      A look of recognition...

                                      RICHIE
                    That was Alec Hill?

                                      DAWSON
                    That was Alec Hill.

      Richie looks like he just took a punch to the stomach.

                                      RICHIE
                    I never knew his name.  I had no
                    idea he was her husband.

      Dawson looks down, stoically.  A long beat.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    It was live or die, Joe.
                          (beat)
                    I never thought about him having a
                    wife or anything.

      Dawson looks at him sharply.

                                      DAWSON
                    Everyone leaves someone behind,
                    Richie.  Everyone.

                                      RICHIE
                          (still reeling)
                    Mac's going after the wrong guy.

                                      DAWSON
                    You better hope to God he doesn't
                    have a bad day.

      This is all way too much for Richie to handle.  Before he
      can respond, Jennifer approaches the table.

      Richie looks at her like a rabbit looking at a hawk.  She s
      feeling a little awkward, too, but has no idea what's just
      happened.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Richie...  maybe you should take me
                    home.

                                      RICHIE
                          (out of his depth)
                    Uh..  Joe's gonna call you a taxi. 
                    I, uh, I really have to go.

      He stumbles up from the table.

      Jennifer thinks this is  about the near kiss, calls after
      him --

                                      JENNIFER
                    Richie, I'm really sorry!

      But he's gone.


      MacLeod steps inside and enters the eerie light that is
      bleeding through a doorway.  MacLeod moves towards the music.


      There he finds in an incense haze

      ALEC HILL

      sits at the piano.  The light in the room emanates from
      candles.  Alec looks tired, haggard, his clothes have a lived-
      and slept-in look.  His hair is long and uncut.  His eyes
      closed, he just keeps playing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Alec.
                          (no acknowledgement)
                    Alec.

      Alec opens his eyes and looks at Duncan.  He smiles.

                                    ALEC
                    Hello, Duncan.

      MacLeod smiles sadly.  He strikes a match and lights a couple
      of kerosene lamps.  The room brightens considerably.

      There is a coat rack in the corner upon which woman's clothes
      are neatly hung.  A hat rack nearby boasts a number of woman's
      bonnets.

                                    ALEC (CONT'D)
                          (with eerie wonder)
                    Did you feel her?

      MacLeod speaks.  His voice carries more enthusiasm than he
      feels.  He's seen Alec like this before and is doing his
      best to lighten the moment.

                    saloon in a poker game.  She'd love

                    and dressed and go down to the Double
                    Eagle for some dinner?

                                    ALEC

                    You don't eat.

      MacLeod moves to the clothing rack.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You put her clothes out as if you
                    expect her to wear them.

                            room)
                    She was right there, listening to me
                    play.

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Genevieve's dead, Alec.  We buried
                    her together two years ago.

                    Only her body.

      Alec moves to a table and picks up an old leather-bound
      volume.

                                    ALEC (CONT'D)

                    It was my pride that drove them off

      Alec changes the subject.  He sits down at the piano.

                    Genevieve loved this piano.

      He begins to play "Aura Lee."

                                    ALEC (CONT'D)
                    In New York, I'd sit in the parlor

                    Good night, Duncan.

      MacLeod smiles sadly at his friend.

                    Good night, Alec.

      MacLeod turns and leaves.


      It's Richie playing.  He's slumped down in the sofa wearing
      sweats.

      A knock comes at the door.  Richie gets up and opens it. 
      Jennifer stands there.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Hi.

                                      RICHIE
                    Hi.  What's up?

                      I couldn't sleep.

                    Can I come in?

      Richie steps back from the door.

                                      RICHIE
                    Sure.

      Richie waits a long beat, steeling himself.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Jen, I have to tell you something.

                    You don't have to explain.  I know.

                    You know?

      He looks at her askance.  She doesn't.  She can't.  She's
      too calm.

                                      JENNIFER
                    That this is happening way too fast. 
                      I shouldn't have said what I said.

                    But I do.

      She moves closer.  Richie backs up, uncomfortable.

                    it couldn't be just me.

      She steps toward him again.  This time she doesn't back away. 
      She looks up into his eyes.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                          (hopefully)
                    Richie...  This only happened to me
                    once before.

      He feels it all right.  Tries to resist.

                                      RICHIE
                    You gotta listen to me, Jen, this is

      She touches him, one hand on either side of his waist.  He
      flinches like she'd touched him with ice, but he doesn't
      pull away.  He can't.  His eyes are locked on hers.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    But I know in my soul that this was

                    That we're meant to be.

      Almost as though compelled, he leans down and kisses her
      gently.  She melts into his arms.

      Prelap a woman's MOAN as we --


      An incredibly cheesy two-wall set stands on the stage floor. 
      A sexy, YOUNG BLONDE is on a sofa kissing a HOT STUD
        passionately -- both half naked.  The woman moans, rather
        unconvincingly, as the man starts to kiss her neck.

        A smattering of CREW people hover about the scant set watching
      the take.

      A man sits in a folding director's chair -- Gerard Kraven..

                                      KRAVEN
                    Cut!  Cut cut cut.

      He storms onto the set, stepping over to the Blonde.  The
      Stud steps away.

                                      KRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    What the hell was that?!

      He imitates her moaning.

      The Crew is used to this.  With little more than shrugs,
      they leave the equipment and head out.

      BUZZ.

      Kragen reacts to the voice and the BUZZ.

                    Don't bother.  This picture's shut
                    down.

      Relieved, she hurries out.

      As soon as she's out of sight, MacLeod pulls his sword, steps
      from the shadows.

      Kragen pulls a sword from behind a sound cart.

      Richie and Jennifer are enmeshed in each others arms, kissing
      passionately.

      They intermittently gasp for air.  He kisses her neck.  She
      is breathless with pleasure.


      Kragen explodes into a flurry of swings, attacking MacLeod
      full force.

      Their swords clank together as they thrust and parry through
      the set, knocking over lights and equipment.

      MacLeod take a huge swing.  Kragen side steps.  MacLeod slices
      into one of the flats that make up the set.


      Richie and Jennifer roll in each other's arms, completely
      consumed by passion, pure ecstasy.

      Kraven charges.  MacLeod maneuvers and slices, catching
      Kraven's hand.  Kraven screams out in pain and drops his
      sword...  He falls to his knees...


      MacLeod raises the katana.

      FADE IN:


      It's early morning.  Place isn't open yet.  Richie's sitting
      on the weight bench, staring off into space, clearly troubled. 
      He gets the BUZZ as MacLeod enters, tired from his trip.

                                      MACLEOD

      MacLeod is intense, agitated.  His eyes never leave Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, say something to me.  Don't
                    just stand there.

                    You killed him over nothing.

                          (in frustration)
                    It was a fair fight.  I won.

                    What'd you want me to do, let him
                    kill me?

      MacLeod's pissed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And then you sleep with his wife?

                                      RICHIE
                    I wasn't thinking.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's obvious.

                                      RICHIE
                      I couldn't help myself.  It was like
                    she said.  Like something was drawing
                    us together.  Something stronger
                    than either of us.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Save it for the romance novels.

                                      RICHIE
                    If I could fix it, I would.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can't fix it, Richie.

      Richie's pacing, trying to figure an out.

                                      RICHIE

                    Maybe she'd understand.

      MacLeod grabs his arm, pulls him close.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie.  She is not going to
                      understand.
                          (with emphasis)
                    You killed her husband.

      He drops Richie's arm and, quietly:

                    Mac... ?

                          (with an edge)
                    Now.

      Whoa.  Richie nods.

                                      RICHIE
                    What about Jennifer?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll take care of Jennifer.
                          (beat)
                    Let her think the man who killed
                    Alec is dead.

      Richie hesitates.  Tries to think of something else to say,
      some solution.  But there isn't one.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac...  I'm sorry.

      Mac just nods, curt.  Richie turns and goes.


      A sparse daytime crowd.  MacLeod and Jennifer are at a table. 
      Jennifer's lunch is untouched in front of her.

                                      JENNIFER
                    You can't know what it means to me,
                    knowing that Alec's spirit can rest... 
                    in you.

      MacLeod is uncomfortable with this.

                    It's not exactly like that.

      She looks at him intently.  Trying to find something in his
      eyes.

                                      JENNIFER
                    I was hoping there'd be something... 
                    Alec told me when you take an
                      Immortal's head, you get his soul.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Alec was wrong.  It's different.
                          (beat)
                    Jen, let it be.  It's over.

      Jennifer looks down at her food for a moment then back up to
      MacLeod.

                                      JENNIFER
                    But it still hurts.  When does it go
                    away?  When do I stop seeing him in
                      strangers?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's different for everyone.

                    You just have to give yourself time.

                          (beat)
                    How much time?  I don't know what
                    I'm doing anymore.
                          (beat; as a confession)
                    I was with Richie last night.

                            (uncomfortable)
                    Jen...

                                      JENNIFER
                    I know it's insane.
                          (beat)
                    God, I don't know what I feel.  When
                    I was with Richie, it felt...  it
                    felt right.
                          (beat)
                    And then I think of Alec.  I feel so
                    guilty.

      MacLeod's trying to gently steer her away from Richie.

                    Jennifer, when it's really right,
                    you'll know.  You won't doubt it. 
                    Maybe you're not ready.

      She leans in to him and lowers her voice.

                                      JENNIFER
                    I saw him again last night.
                          (off his look)
                    He was watching us.
                            (distressed)
                    What if I hurt him?  What if he feels
                    betrayed?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (gentle)
                    You can't hurt Alec.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe you think you see him because
                    you're not ready to give him up. 
                    That's okay.  There's no rush.

      She meets his gaze, considering his words.  Smiles.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Thanks for not thinking I'm crazy.
                          (a sad smile)
                    There's a lot of Alec in you now,
                    even if you don't believe it.

      MacLeod returns the smile weakly.  Jennifer kisses him gently
      on the cheek as she stands to leave.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Duncan.  For everything.

      She exits.

      AT THE BAR (E)

      MacLeod approaches to pay for the meal.  As Dawson rings it
      up.

                    What else could you do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I lied to her.

      Dawson tries to make it better.

                    You didn't actually lie to her.

      You just withheld some information.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)

                    And she left here felling better.

                    And you hate to break your own rules.

                    So...  why did you do it?

                          (a shrug)
                    Like you said.  It made her feel
                    better.
                          (beat)
                    Because she needs to move on with
                    her life.  To start healing.  To do
                    that, she has to think this is
                    finished.

                                      DAWSON
                    So you let her think Alec's killer's
                    been punished.  It's a white lie.

                    What were your other options?  Who'd
                    be helped if you told her the truth?

      MacLeod knows but that doesn't make it easier.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nobody.  I know.

                                      DAWSON
                    So?

                                      MACLEOD
                    So why don't I feel good about it?

                                      DAWSON
                    Because a friend of yours is dead
                    and Richie killed him.

                    There's no way for you to make sense

                    through it.

                    Thanks, Joe.

      He proffers a bill to pay for the meal.  Dawson waves it
      aside.

      Richie's just finishing filling his duffel bag when a knock
      comes at the door.  He opens it to find Jennifer.

                                      RICHIE
                    Hi.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Hi.  Can I come in?

      This is a little awkward.

                                      RICHIE
                    Ah, sure.

      She steps in and closes the door behind her.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Where are you going?

                                      RICHIE
                    Out of town for awhile.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Because of me?

                                      RICHIE
                    Kinda.  Yeah.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Richie, please don't go.

      She steps closer to him.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    I had a long talk with Duncan.  It's
                    going to be okay.

                                      RICHIE
                    MacLeod sent you?

                                      JENNIFER
                    He helped me to understand a lot of
                    things.
                          (beat)
                    I've been holding on to Alec's ghost
                    because I'm afraid of moving forward. 
                    But it's okay.  It's time to put it
                    behind me.  To live again.

      She steps even closer.  Richie steps back.

                                      JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Duncan said when it was right, I'd
                    know it.  With you, I know.

      She leans in to kiss him, but Richie resists.

                                      RICHIE
                    Jen, no.  This can't happen.

      Her eyes well.  She's vulnerable, near tears.

                                      JENNIFER
                    I don't understand.  I know what you
                    feel because I feel it, too.  How
                    can you do this?

      This is tearing Richie up.  He wants to take her in his arms;
      it's an act of will not to.

                                      RICHIE
                    I have to.  I have to go.

      He tries to get around her.  She steps in front of the door.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (a sob)
                    Why?

      He can't bear it.  He touches her face, raises her chin so
      she's looking into his eyes.

                                      RICHIE
                    Jen, I'm sorry.  It's not you, really. 
                    I'd do anything to be with you.

                                      JENNIFER
                    That's all that matters.

                                      RICHIE
                    No!  No, I can't.

                    Why?  Why can't you be with me?

      There's no choice now.  He has to do it:

                                      RICHIE
                    Because I killed Alec!

      She stops in shock.  It hasn't sunk in.

                                      JENNIFER
                    What are you talking about?

                                      RICHIE
                    It wasn't Kragen.  He never got to

                          (beat)
                    It was me.

      She's frozen in horror.  Richie tries to explain:

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know about you.  I didn't
                    know who he was.  It just happened. 
                    I'm so sorry.

                    This isn't happening.

      He reaches out to touch her.

                                      RICHIE
                    Jen...

      She recoils so fast she backs into the door, hard.

                                      JENNIFER
                    You murdering bastard!  How could
                    you touch me!

      She staring at him, eyes wide, breathing hard.  Her hand
      pressed to her mouth, sick with horror.  The bile rising in
      her mouth --

                    Oh God....

      Richie backs off, holding up his hands, placating.

                                      RICHIE
                    Jen, please.  I just wanted to help.

      Her horror turns to cold fury and her voice goes hard as:

      behind her and slams his forehead against it, filled with
        self-hatred.

      Richie sits at the end of the bar, smoking a cigar, staring
      at an untouched beer and trying to get a handle on everything
      that's happened.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac was right.  I shouldn't have

      Mid-scene.  Jennifer is venting her anger at MacLeod.

                    You know that.  You cared about him.

                    And you let it happen.

      She hugs her arms around herself, holding in a shudder as
      the physical memory passes through her.  MacLeod takes her
      arm, meets her gaze, tries to get through to her:

                    Jennifer, wait.

      He takes her by the arm to gently detain her.  She whirls
      around, her voice rising, desperate.

                    Leave me alone!

      She turns to run out.  The place is quiet as a tomb.  All
      the eyes are on MacLeod.  He can't follow.  He has to back

      Pretty much cleared out.  Richie, duffel in hand, is heading
      out.  He opens the door.

      JENNIFER

      stands there.  She's calm now -- all cried out.  Richie stops
      in his tracks.

      It's a little spooky.  Richie looks at her warily.

                    What am I supposed to say, Jen.

      She steps in a little further.

                    I had some time to think.  About
                    what this all means.

                    I figured out what I need to do.  To

      There's a beat while Richie waits for her to finish.  Then
      her hand comes up and Richie sees

      THE GUN

      in her hand, rising in SLOW MOTION.

      RICHIE

      meets her gaze in shock, too late to object, too late to
      avoid.

      BLAM! BLAM!

      Red holes bloom in Richie's chest.  He recoils from the shots
      and lunges backward, crashing to the ground.

      moves to stand over him.

      RICHIE

      is struggling for breath as she aims at him again.


      The door bursts open and MacLeod comes through it, then stops
      in his tracks as he sees --

      RICHIE

      lying 'dead' on the floor, unmoving.  And standing over him:

      JENNIFER

      Richie's sword in hand, ready to kill him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Jennifer, no! D on't do this!

      He starts to move toward her.  She raises the sword quickly.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Don't try and stop me.
                          (re the sword)
                    Alec taught me to use it, Duncan. 
                    One stroke.
                          (a little distant)
                    One stroke.

      MacLeod is too far away to stop her physically.  He stays in
      the doorway, goes into negotiation mode.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Jennifer, listen to me.

      His eyes go to Richie's still form.  He can't conceal the
      fear for his friend's life that passes behind his eyes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    He's twenty-two years old.
                          (beat)
                    He didn't mean to hurt you.  Richie's
                    not like that.

      He's moving slowly toward her as he speaks.  She wavers.

                                      JENNIFER
                    He killed Alec.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    And killing him won't bring Alec
                    back.
                          (beat)
                    If any part of Alec still lives,
                    it's in Richie.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (doesn't want to hear
                          it)
                    No!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's what Alec believed.  It's what
                    you wanted to believe.

                                      JENNIFER
                    No...  You don't understand.
                          (dreamy)
                    Alec is here.  He wants me to do
                    this.

      JENNIFER'S POV

      Alec is standing over Richie's body.

      MACLEOD S POV

      There's no one there but Richie and Jennifer.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Jennifer, there's no one else here. 
                    There's nothing here but your grief
                    and your guilt.

      JENNIFER'S POV - ALEC

                                      JENNIFER
                    He wants me to do this.  He needs it
                    so he can rest in peace.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      including MacLeod.  From where he stands, there's no Alec --
      just Jennifer staring at an empty space.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Jennifer)
                    Killing doesn't bring peace.

                          (from the soul)
                    When you kill, it haunts you for the
                    rest of your life.

      Jennifer's not listening to him.  She's staring at --

      JENNIFER'S POV - ALEC

      He raises his arm, holding a ghostly sword; Jennifer raises
      hers in unison, prepared to swing.

      MACLEOD

      is desperate.  He has to get through to her.  He addresses
      the empty space where she sees Alec --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Alec, don't make her do this!

      Jennifer hesitates, looks from MacLeod to the Alec that only
      she sees.  Does MacLeod really see him?

      He doesn't, but he knows Jennifer needs him to.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (to 'Alec')
                    Is this what you want for her?  You
                    want her to know what it's like to
                    kill someone?  To hold on to this
                    moment, this murder, for the rest of
                    her life?  Is this what you want her
                    to carry?
                          (to Jennifer)
                    He loves you.  If you think that's
                    what he wants, then go ahead.

      There's a long pause.  Then the ghostly Alec lowers his sword
      and Jennifer does the same, tears streaming down her face.

                                      JENNIFER
                          (of Richie)
                    Let him carry it.
                          (unforgiving)
                    Let Alec haunt him forever.

      She lets Richie's sword fall to the floor with a clatter.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He will.

      MACLEOD

      steps forward and hugs her.  Alec's ghost is gone.  It's
      over.

      FADE IN:


      Jennifer has left.  MacLeod waits by Richie's side.  Suddenly
      Richie GASPS hard.  He starts coughing.  MacLeod watches.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can get up now.

      Richie sits up and looks around.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    She's gone.

      Richie starts to rise.  He winces.

                    She had a choice.  She could walk
                    away.

                    We can't.

                    I thought you didn't believe in
                    ghosts.

                    I believe in the kind you carry with
                    you.  Everyone you've killed...
