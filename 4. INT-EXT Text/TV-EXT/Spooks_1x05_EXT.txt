 
  Pitch black night. The spitting fire of six automatic 
  weapons blazes into the night. Men are laughing, 
    hysterical with delight. 
 
  CLOSE UP: a cigar lighter flares. The face of SERGAI 
  LERMOV - in arabic clothes - lighting a cigar. He is 
  grinning. He turns. 
 
  From his POV: A magnificent desert tent. It belongs to a 
  prince. From within there is the low, yellow glow of 
  lamps. 
 
  LERMOV shouts to the tent. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      Wilder! Maynard! Join the fun! 
 
 
  Flat countryside. A sunny day. An open prison. A driveway 
  off a country road. Steel fencing. A pale blue sign: 
   H.M. Prison Sidham.  
 
  Press are waiting at the gates. A big turn out: some are 
  on ladders with their cameras. One looks at his watch. 
  Police are waiting. 
 
  We see that DANNY is standing at the back of the media 
  scrum. He turns away and whispers to his pal.

                                        DANNY 
                                  No show yet. 
 
  Go to a TV news team from the BBC. The 1ST BBC MAN, with 
  a news camera, is up a ladder. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                            (Looks at her watch.) 
                              What s keeping him? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                  Paying the Governor his backhander. 
 
  Stale laughter. 
 
  Figures can be seen through the metal gates. A tall man - 
  it s HAMPTON WILDER - is shaking hands with others, 
  obviously Prison Officers. They laugh at something WILDER 
  says. Obviously he s been a popular prisoner. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                                    Where s ITN? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                          (Looking over the heads.) 
                          Ten feet to your right. 
 
  The press surge forward. In the scrum the BBC WOMAN kicks 
  and trips another woman. The ITN woman goes down with a 
  cry. 
 
                                BBC MAN (CONT'D) 
                                      Result! 
 
  Police hold them back, but the situation is immediately 
  out of control. The BBC WOMAN fights toward the front. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      (At the back. Into his lapel.) 
                                    Go go go! 
 
  He plunges into the scrum. 
 
  The BBC WOMAN is at the front. A smiling HAMPTON WILDER 
    approaches her. 
  The Press are calling out. 
 
                                  PRESS VOICES 
              Hampton! Hampton! Hampton? Hampton look at 
                                  me! Hampton!

                                        DANNY 
                                Come on come on! 
 
  A car is pressing forward. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                    (Jostled, gets her question out.) 
              Mr. Wilder, what are you going to do now? 
 
  WILDER s immense self-confidence is masked by a humble 
  manner but it still shows through. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                  I want to apologise. I let down my 
                      colleagues, my friends, my ... 
                            (A hesitation. Tears?) 
                ... My country. The pleasures of life 
              overwhelmed me. I abused the sacred trust of 
          my high office. I lied, I stole public money, 
                and I have now paid for that mistake. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                        Mr Wilder. BBC Television. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Ah old friends. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                Was the real reason for your conviction 
            illegal arm sales when you were Minister ... 
 
  WILDER has turned away and speaks over her. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I now go into private life. The one shining 
            thing for me, from my time in prison, is to 
          have found that the Lord Jesus is my saviour. 
 
  He moves forward into the ruck. 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                              (To the BBC WOMAN.) 
                        What are you trying to do? 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                        Get at the truth?  Truth?  
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                                      Oh that.

                                        WILDER 
                        Thank you all so very much. 
 
  DANNY s got to HAMPTON WILDER. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      Mr. Wilder Sir, in the back. 
 
  DANNY opens the back door and WILDER gets into the car. 
  Then he gets into the car shouting  Go! Go!  
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                                What s going on? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
            Must have sold his story to a tabloid. Now, 
            no doubt,  on his way to a secret location.  
 
    ESTABLISHING - THAMES HOUSE EXTERIOR - DAY 1. 1141 
 
 
  A large rose bed. Police tape is all around it. PRISON 
  OFFICERS are digging up the roses one by one. TOM and 
  DANNY are supervising. 
 
  A rose bush is pulled out of the earth. There is a 
  plastic bag buried beneath it. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                I think we ve ... 
 
  He holds up a plastic bag. 
 
  TOM goes to him, takes the bag. He s wearing gloves. He 
  brushes dirt from the plastic. He opens it and takes out 
  a large slab of dope. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                                  Jesus Christ! 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          That what I think it is? 
 
    A Prisoner with a wheelbarrow sees this, slams his wheel 
  barrow down. 
 
                                      PRISONER 
                              Anyone for a spliff? 
 
  The sound of laughter and shouts throughout the prison. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                              (To two officers.) 
            Miles! Basset! Return all prisoners to rooms. 
 
  The two Prison officers run off towards the buildings. 
 
 
  The rosebed is now fully dug up. DANNY pulls out a cloth 
  from beneath the last rosebush. Unravels it. It contains 
  a ferocious looking hunting knife. 
 
  TOM is getting really browned off. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Officer Blunden. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer approaches. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                    Another little something for you. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer takes the knife, both hands, 
  with bad grace. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
              Shouldn t you wear gloves? That s evidence. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer is embarrassed, he tries to 
  hold the knife by its end, then he takes out a crumpled 
  tissue from his pocket. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                Going to put the roses back now,  Sir ? 
 
  TOM does not even try to hide his anger. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Did you or other Prison Officers know what 
                                was buried here? 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
          It s no big deal, just prison bits and pieces                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 18
 

                                        ... 
 
                                        TOM 
              This is an area of importance to national 
            security. Special Branch will supervise. Now 
                        I want to see the Governor. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                              (A touch of fear.) 
                                        Right. 
 
 
  The furious MARK stumbles out of the door. 
 
  He walks away then has a thought. He turns back and looks 
  at TOM s car. He looks at the number plate. He takes a 
  pen out and scribbles the number on his wrist. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 23
 

 
  MARK HODD rings a number on his mobile phone, walking 
  along. 
 
                                        MARK 
            Brian. It s Mark Hodd. ... Yeah! Back in the 
            land of the living ... Listen Brian, I want 
            to pull a favour off you. A number ... You 
              are brilliant. It s a Vauhall Vectra, the 
                                  number s ... 
 
  He looks at his wrist.

  TESSA and MAYNARD are talking. She wears a head-scarf and 
  dark glasses. They are tense. Behind them the lights from 
  within The Orangery are beginning to shine as the light 
  fades. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I have been whizzing round the tube system in 
            and out of three stations. I have caught two 
              buses and had two purposeless taxi rides. 
            Sorry if I sound a prick but I am a minister 
            of the crown y know, I do have better things 
                                      to do. 
 
  MAYNARD stares at her. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              (Machine gun speed.) 
            Are you taking kickbacks from illegal arms 
                              sales in the gulf? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Dick, they re going to crawl all over you. 
                  How well do you know Sergai Lermov? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I told Harry. I met him once. What is this, 
                          where s this coming from? 
 
                                        TESSA 
              Hampton Wilder came to see us the moment he 
                                  was released. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              Hampton Wilder? You believe what that ... 
                          You ve got to be joking. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            You ve got a lot of enemies. Now please. Tell 
              me: are you involved in any kind of deal? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                    Do you for a moment believe ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Believe you re a lying, unpatriotic bastard? 
              I don t know. You can cheat on your wife 
                  maybe you can cheat on your country.

                                      MAYNARD 
                        Oh God, dear God Tessa ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
              I ll help you. But you ve got to tell me. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          There is nothing to tell! 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                Think about it. 
 
  She kisses him tenderly on the cheek and walks away. 
 
  Stay with MAYNARD. He looks one way then another. The 
  nightmare has begun for him. 
 
 
  A lot of traffic. Some passersby. 
 
  MARK is walking along. His mobile rings. 
 
                                        MARK 
              Oh Brian yeah ... What you got ... What s 
                            listed mean ... What? 
 
  Two men are behind him listening to this. One nods to the 
  other. They turn a corner. 
 
                                      1ST MAN 
                                    Mr. Hodd? 
 
  MARK turns.

                                      2ND MAN 
            Good evening sir. Could we have a word with 
                                        you? 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    What about?

                      The phone call you just made. 
 
  MARK is stunned. He steps back. They close on him. 
 
                                      2ND MAN 
            Now you re not going to be stupid are you? 
 
  MARK s frightened face. 
 
 
  A South London park. There is a bandstand, a pond nearly. 
  Rising ground. 
 
  TOM is walking to a bench. He sits. A DERELICT MAN - 
  street sleeper in a filthy state - is sitting at the end 
  of the bench. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                            (Not looking at TOM.) 
                                  That s Lermov. 
 
  Last seen he was in Arab clothes. Now he is a dapper man 
  in a fine coat. He is throwing bread to ducks on the 
  pond. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Where is it? 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                              (Middle-class accent.) 
                      Back of the Bowling Green Hut. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Tell all of Section A to clear the area. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
            Took us months to find this drop, don t blow                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 36
 

                                    it for us. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Higher thinking. Sorry. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                    Ah well, when the gods command. 
 
  TOM stands and walks away. 
 
  A moment later, behind him, the DERELICT MAN stands and 
  shuffles away. 
 
 
  On the park bench. LERMOV has a slight, smoothed out 
  accent. His English is precise. 
 
  TOM has the polythene package in his hand. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Instructions from Moscow? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              It will tell you nothing, it s a deadlock 
                                        code. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Doesn t matter, now that you re a useless 
                                        asset. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              Is that what I am? 
 
  TOM pockets the package. 
 
  A sharp look from LERMOV. 
 
                                LERMOV (CONT'D) 
                                You re not MI6. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            You have bad manners. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Never mind the messenger, hear the message. 
                                  You are blown. 
 
  Now LERMOV s glance is sly. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 40
 

                                        LERMOV 
                                    You are  5? 
 
                                        TOM 
                    You have been blown for months. 
 
  LERMOV is relaxed. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            Confident, aren t you? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Very much so. 
 
  LERMOV boils inside at what he sees as a smug little 
    Englishman from a puny organisation. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Listen to me, little dog pup. You think you 
            are safe because you have the powers of the 
            state behind you. But a state can disappear 
                                    like that! 
                                (Clicks fingers.) 
                I saw it happen. I was a servant of the 
                Soviet Union and suddenly ... Freefall. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Cold War. We won, you lost. 
 
  LERMOV scoffs. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Yes. But personally, the fall of the Soviet 
            Union was a rebirth. All the communism washed 
                off me and I was born anew. Capable of 
                                  amazing things. 
 
                                        TOM 
          You think capitalism has turned you into some 
                              kind of superman? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
          It is true that now that I make my own way in 
                  the world, I am much more powerful. 
 
                                        TOM 
              I could change my mind and have you in an 
            Immigration Detention Centre within the hour. 
              Or be more unofficial, summon friends now 
                            lurking in the bushes? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 41
 

  TOM turns and looks at him. The physical threat from TOM 
  hangs in the air. LERMOV shrugs and decides to trade. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              What is it you want? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Oh ... Your contact in the Ministry of 
              Defence? Helping you with illegal weapons 
                                    procurement? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                He went to gaol. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          But he has a successor. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            Really? Introduce me. 
 
  TOM, intimately. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Sergai, we won t touch you. You re a window 
            through which we can see the filthy world you 
            live in. But you must ... Keep open. We own 
                                you now, Sergai. 
 
  A beat. LERMOV laughs. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            You use my Christening name, that is rude. 
                    You are a cocky little dog pup. 
                                (Anger in him.) 
            I have more powerful friends than you who are 
                                  not so rude. 
 
  TOM turns and calls out. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Good evening, Bill. 
 
  The DERELICT MAN walks out of the bushes and strands 
  behind the bench. He stands at full height - a formidable 
  figure. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Like the good old days. The name you want is 
                                Richard Maynard. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 42
 

  They stand still for a moment. Then TOM stands and walks 
  away, his back to LERMOV, who remains seated. The man 
  follows TOM then peals away. On TOM s face: worry, his 
  eyes flickering. 
 
 
  TOM and HARRY are waiting, both irritated. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                This is damn ... 
 
  Looks at his watch. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 48
 

 
  JOOLS approaches TOM and HARRY. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Gentlemen thank you so much for coming out 
            here it s Die Walkure you know, been waiting 
                              for this all year. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Was it worth it? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        You re not Wagner are you. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Isn t it the most repugnant music ever 
                                      written? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            (Not at all put out.) 
              It is a bit of a closet thing these days 
            people can t handle the dark side. Anyway Act 
            Three kicks off in twenty minutes so what can 
                                  I do for you? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Have you turned an SVR agent called Sergai 
                                      Lermov? 
 
  JOOLS is in very good humour. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Sergai, yes, terrific agent. Course we 
              noticed your Section A s been all over him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              You noticed we ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Don t get on your high horse Harry this isn t 
                for once a turf war. We like you people 
                  tailing him it gives him credibility. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 49
 

  He laughs. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  We ve had to have a word with him. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                  May I ask why? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We think he s trying to smear a Government 
                                      Minister. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Oh Lermov will say anything about anyone it s 
              part of his charm. I assume we re talking 
                      about the Dick Maynard thing. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          Jools what is going on? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Oh alright I ll send them over in the 
                                      morning. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Send what over? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Hampton Wilder s memoirs. They re what you re 
                              salivating for, no? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    They exist? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Course they exist, we dug them up soon as he 
                  put them in the prison s rose bed. 
                                      (Laughs.) 
            You re really not on top of this one are you. 
              No we put an agent into the prison as an 
                        inmate. Just to keep an eye. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                MI6 had an agent inside the prison ... 
 
  He can hardly retain his wrath. 
 
                                        TOM 
          What do you have on Dick Maynard? Do you have 
              any trace that he and Lermov did business                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 50
 

                                      together? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                          Not outside the memoirs. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        So it s a straight slander. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                              It looks that way. 
 
  He takes a breath and expels air slowly before replying. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Alright I ll tell you. It was Dick Maynard 
          who shopped Hampton Wilder to us. Without him 
            blowing the whistle, Wilder would never have 
                              been brought down. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      So this is straight revenge. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          The trouble with whistle blowers is they play 
                                their own tune. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            You distrust Maynard? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          To my mind there s an ambiguity there. Do you 
                              do ambiguity, Tom? 
 
  TOM refuses to rise to the bait. 
 
                                        TOM 
          No. In the end, a thing s a lie or it s true. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                    What an admirable point of view. 
 
  JOOLS looks at TOM for a moment - quizzical, alert. Then 
  he s back into the persona. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT'D) 
              Mustn t miss the ride of the Valkyrie. Nice 
            to see you working so late gentlemen. Thank 
            God someone s running the country while the 
              rest of us are at the opera. Good evening. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 51
 

  And he s gone. 
 
  TOM and HARRY look at each other. They are deeply 
  suspicious. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Why is he being so nice to us? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  I do not know. 
 
 
  SERGAI LERMOV and a YOUNG MAN who is heavily made up. 
  They are going down steps into a corner of the Square. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              What s your accent?

                                      YOUNG MAN 
                                    Vladivostock. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Ah the mysterious far East of our country. 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN 
                              Sexy far East ... 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              Do you miss Russia? 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN 
                                My homeland ... 
                            (Whispers into his ear.) 
                  ... Is anywhere I m being shagged. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                        Ah. 
 
  He looks around. He is suddenly nervous. 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN 
                                    Like here. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
          Why not? Heart of what used to be the British 
                                      Empire. 
 
  They are in each others arms, squared up to each other. 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN 
                  They say you re a party animal ... 
 
  Immediately LERMOV is alert. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                      Who say? 
 
  The YOUNG MAN is dead still. 
 
                                LERMOV (CONT'D) 
                          Who say I am a party ... 
 
  LERMOV is pulling at his pocket, but the YOUNG MAN is 
  close. The flash of a thin bladed knife. The YOUNG MAN 
  whispers into the dying LERMOV s ear. 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN 
                  Death to traitors to the Motherland.

  LERMOV slumps to the ground. The YOUNG MAN walks away, 
  calmly. 
 
 
  RICHARD MAYNARD comes out of the tube. He looks around. 
 
 
  TOM is watching from across the street. 
 
  From his POV: a puzzled MAYNARD is looking around him. 
 
 
  TOM watches MAYNARD who is now looking around bad-
  temperedly. He turns to go back into the tube. 
 
  TOM dodges traffic across the road. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Hey Dick I saw you across the road. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 66
 

                                      MAYNARD 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Jack Ballantine, Hackney Labour Party. 
                                  (Low, fast.) 
                          We cross the road. Now. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                    Oh. Right. 
 
  General POV: TOM and MAYNARD crossing the street, TOM 
  talking animatedly to him. 
 
 
  TOM and RICHARD MAYNARD are walking down a country road 
  (it leads to the Siegfried Sassoon estate, now occupied                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 67
 

  by Middlesex University.) 
 
  MAYNARD is talking too much because he s nervous. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              The wonders of the end of the Piccadilly 
            Line, eh? You come out of a tube station and 
                        you re ... Sort of nowhere. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Let s go in that field. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                  (Scared now.) 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
              So I can put a bullet in the back of your 
                                neck, why else? 
 
  CLOSE UP: MAYNARD laughs but he is very, very tense. 
 
 
  TOM and MAYNARD are sitting on two big stones by a hedge, 
  under a tree. 
  TOM has a grass stalk between his teeth. TOM does not 
  look at him. His tone is matter-of-fact, remorseless. 
  MAYNARD becomes increasingly exasperated - which is TOM s 
  purpose. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          One more time. I only met Sergai Lermov once. 
 
                                        TOM 
            He was stabbed last night. Stabbed to death. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I m sorry, that s terrible but nothing to do 
                                      with me. 
 
  TOM doesn t look at him. He has adopted a casual, 
    ruminative manner. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 68
 

                                        TOM 
                            Good for you, though. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        How? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Lermov can t be a witness against you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          Are you saying that I ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                Illegal arms is a dangerous world to be 
                                  involved in.. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I m NOT involved! Dear God what times are we 
            living in? Does just to SAY you re innocent, 
                              prove you re guilty? 
 
                                        TOM 
              It began nine years ago, didn t it? The 
              Confederated Gulf States. You, Lermov and 
              Hampton Wilder, a night under the stars? 
 
  TOM takes out a photograph of the hunting party which we 
  saw in HARRY s office. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                All right! All right I ll tell you what 
                                      happened. 
 
  MAYNARD looks out over the field and composes himself. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT'D) 
            Wilder made a proposal. He wanted me to come 
                                  in on a deal. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            A deal. Involving what? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            The illegal sale of anti-tank weapons. I was 
            on the Commons Committee scrutinising arms 
            procurement. He wanted me to make sure no one 
                                got wind of it. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  And did you? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 69
 

  MAYNARD, furious. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            No I went straight to MI6! I shopped Wilder. 
            Dear God it was me who put them on to him, I 
            brought him down. I am an unsung hero. So why 
            am I being persecuted? I mean who is doing 
                                    this to me? 
 
  He is desperate. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT D) 
              You re a spook, find out who is destroying 
                                        me. 
 
  For the first time in the interview TOM looks him 
  directly in the eye. 
 
 
  TOM rests his forehead on the door. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  (Low. He cannot possibly be heard.) 
                        Ellie. Ellie. Please. Ellie. 
 
  His mobile rings. 
 
  He doesn t respond. He stays with his head pressed 
  against the door. The mobile rings on. 
 
 
  A red cliff of a building, garish in sodium lights. 
 
  TOM crosses the road toward it. 
 
 
  TESSA is across the street looking at the  Hotel 
  Gardenia  - a quiet, exclusive hotel in a Chelsea 
  backstreet. 
 
  She crosses the road toward the hotel. 
 
 
  TOM rings the doorbell. 
 
  WILDER opens the door. He is wearing black slacks and a 
  white shirt. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                          Why, a secret policeman. 
 
  TOM follows him into the flat. Soulless reproduction 
  regency. The flat does not look lived in at all.
