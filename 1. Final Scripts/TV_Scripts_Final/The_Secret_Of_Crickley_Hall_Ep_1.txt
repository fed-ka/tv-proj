  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 111

  Six year old STEFAN runs from the big grey stone slab of 
  Crickley Hall, more institutional than residential. 

  Children singing.

                              CHILDREN
                On the farm no poor rabbit
                Comes to harm because I grab it
                They jump and frolic whenever I go by
                They know I help 'em to dodge the rabbit 
                pie!

  A figure grabs him by the collar and lifts him off his feet.

  Stefan kicks wildly in mid-air as he pivots to face his 
    tormenter.  Terrified that it might be:

  AUGUSTUS CRIBBEN.  We don t see his face yet.

                              CRIBBEN O.S.
                You re mine.

  Stefan screams.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 122

  EVE wakes up with a start, next to her husband GABE, still 
  sleeping. She gets out of bed. Present day London.

  INT. CAM S BEDROOM - DAY 133

  Eve opens the door to her son s bedroom. CAM is the same age 
  as the boy in her dream. He s sitting on the end of his bed, 
  rubbing his eyes. She sits next to him.

                              EVE
                Me too. What was yours?

                              CAM
                I can t remember.

                              EVE
                Maybe it was my dream and you picked it 
                up. Sorry.

                              CAM
                Why can t we have our own dreams?

                              EVE
                I know! Do you want some milk?            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      2.



                              CAM
                Coffee.

                              EVE
                You re not getting coffee.

                              CAM
                Really milky coffee.

  EXT. GABE S HOUSE - DAY 144

  The bedroom light comes on.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 155

  GABE turns over and reaches for Eve. Makes grumpy noises in 
  his half-sleep.

  INT. GABE S KITCHEN - DAY 166

  Eve is on her laptop in the kitchen, eating cereal.

  There are several windows open on her screen showing a 
  marking database. A pile of homework books next to it.

                              GABE
                Why, love?

                              EVE
                Oh I m sorry. Go back to bed.

                              GABE
                Can t you just wing it?

                              EVE
                Never seen you wing it.

                              GABE
                It s a bit tricky with structural 
                  engineering. No-one dies if you skim a 
                bit.

                              EVE
                You haven t met their parents.

  Gabe hugs her and tries to lift her out of her chair.

                              GABE
                You re working too hard. Even for you.

                              EVE
                Let me get through open day and I m yours 
                for the weekend.            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      3.



  Gabe sees Cam playing with the dog Clyde.

                              EVE (cont d)
                I woke up so he woke up.

                              CAM
                We ve got work.

                              GABE
                You know you don t have to copy 
                  everything your Mum does. He s going to 
                be wrecked the whole day.

                              EVE
                You don t say!

  INT. CAM S BEDROOM - DAY 177

  Gabe dumps Cam on his bed.

                              CAM
                Let s play bombs!

                              GABE
                What s bombs? I can t keep up.

  Cam pulls Gabe over to his lego construction. It s a house. 
    Impressively constructed for a five year old.

                              GABE (cont d)
                That s a pretty solid job there my man. 
                You know where you get that from don t 
                you.

  Cam retrieves a bowling ball from under the bed and totters 
  towards the lego house with it. 

                              GABE (cont d)
                Oi monkey I ve been looking for that.

  Gabe watches bemused, winces.

                              GABE (cont d)
                You re going to drop that on your toe -

  Gabe tries to intercept him but Cam waves him off, 
  determined. Cam drops the bowling ball on his lego house, 
  exploding it utterly. Shouting:

                              CAM
                Bomb!

  The multicolored bricks scattered over the carpet. Gabe nods, 
  solemnly.            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      4.



                              GABE
                Good game.

  INT. LOREN S BEDROOM - DAY 188

  Gabe is trying to wake his eleven year old daughter LOREN.

                              GABE
                Last warning. Or I m hitting you with the 
                cold hands up the back of the neck and 
                down the spine. Loren. Loren.

  Loren grunts.

  INT. CALLY S BEDROOM - DAY 199

  Gabe pulls the bedclothes from his four year old CALLY s bed.

                              CALLY
                No.

  Cally turns over.

                              GABE
                Cally come on!

                              CALLY
                No!

  INT. GABE S KITCHEN - DAY 11010

  Eve is dressed for work. Cam asleep on the sofa. Clyde 
  sniffing around.

                              GABE
                Dog s up.

                              EVE
                Well thanks for coordinating everything 
                with such military precision.

                              GABE
                Go. I ll get everyone where they have to 
                be.

                              EVE
                I m walking away.

  She kisses Gabe lightly. Scoops up Cam from the sofa.

                              EVE (cont'd)
                Come on boy.

  Eve s taking Cam out when he cries out.            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      5.



                              CAM
                No! Daddy.

  Eve turns back to allow Cam to claim his kiss from Gabe.

  When Gabe separates, Cam reaches out to take his hand.

                              GABE
                He doesn t want to go.

                              EVE
                He s been saying for weeks he wants to 
                spend the day with me.

                              GABE
                But when it comes down to it ...

                              CAM
                I love you Daddy.

                              GABE
                Do I love him?

                              CAM
                Say it!

                              EVE
                We re out of here.

  Gabe mouths  I love you  to Cam. Cam reaches for Clyde.

                              CAM
                Bye.

  Gabe is touched but a little unnerved. Cally stumbles into 
  view behind him.

                              CALLY
                Where s breakfast?

                              GABE
                You want to help me look for it?

                              CALLY
                No.

  INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY 11111

  Eve meets parents at her school open day.

  She keeps an eye on Cam who s in the corner creche with other 
  little ones supervised by a teaching assistant.            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      6.



                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

  The end of a frantic day. Eve picks up Cam from the teaching 
    assistant.

                              EVE
                I ve lost the plot. I don t know what day 
                of the week it is.

                              CAM
                Friday.

                              EVE
                Thank God.

                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                He s gorgeous. He s been no trouble at 
                all.

  She plays with his little finger.

                              EVE
                Have you been showing her your magic 
                finger?

  Close on the little finger of his left hand - shorter than 
  the one on the right.

                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                I d never have noticed. Is it rare?

  Eve puts her hands next to his - same feature.

                              EVE
                My mother had it.

                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                Does it mean anything?

                              EVE
                Just that we re connected. We hear each 
                other sometimes. Don t we?

                              CAM
                All the time.

                              EVE
                We tend to wake up at the same time.

                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                That must be ...

                  Incredibly annoying.            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      7.



                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                I was going to say reassuring.

                              EVE
                It is. Well darling are you happy you 
                came? You made enough of a fuss about it. 
                What did you like best?

                              CAM
                I wanted to be with you.

                              TEACHING ASSISTANT
                Oh God I want one so badly.

                              EVE
                That s how it starts.

  EXT. GABE S HOUSE - DAY 11212

  Eve parks outside their house.

  INT. EVE S CAR - DAY 11313

  Eve reaches for her homework pile on the back seat.

                              CAM
                Slide!

                              EVE
                You are not serious.

                              CAM
                Please.

                              EVE
                Why?

                              CAM
                I didn t go outside.

                              EVE
                You did go outside!  You are such a big 
                liar!

                              CAM
                I need fresh air.

  Eve laughs, despite her exhaustion. She gets out his blue 
  woollen hat and pulls it over his ears.

                              EVE
                Okay here it is: you can do the slide or 
                the roundabout or the swings but not all 
                three. Do we have a deal?            THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      8.



                              CAM
                Deal!

                              EVE
                Deal means you promise.

                              CAM
                Deal!

  EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 11414

  A montage of Cam having his fun on slide, roundabout, swings 
  and a few more besides with Eve supplying the momentum with 
  the last of her energy.

                                                                  CUT TO:

  Eve watching Cam with love and deep exhaustion from a bench. 
  He s still racing around, tireless. She s catching up with 
  homework marking.

  There are other mothers and children around.

                              CAM
                Look at me!

                              EVE
                I am looking. Five minutes.

  Clouds pass.

  Eve can t focus on the handwritten scrawl of her pupils.

  Cam is standing on the highest part of the climbing frame 
  gazing at Eve.

  Her eyelids are drooping.

  Cam gazes at her intently. Whispering:

                              CAM
                Love you Mummy.

  Even though Eve is too far away to hear she mumbles a 
  response.

                              EVE
                Love you more.

  Eve closes her eyes for a moment.             THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      9.



  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 11515

  Stefan is carried screaming and kicking back to Crickley 
  Hall. Cribben slams the front door.

  A distant cry.

                Mummy.

  EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 11616

  Eve wakes up with a start.

  Surely she s only been asleep for seconds.

  But the playground is empty. No other mothers. No other 
  children.

  And no Cam.

  Her marking lying on the grass. She wipes her mouth. Stands 
  up.

                              EVE
                Cam?

  She looks around, confused. 

                              EVE (cont d)
                Cam?

  She runs into the centre of the playground. Just his blue 
  woollen hat on the ground. She picks it up.

  She runs to the adjacent path and looks both ways.

                              EVE (cont d)
                Cam!

  Back into the park. Criss crossing. Scans the horizon 
    desperately.

                              EVE (cont d)
                Please no.

  She shrieks into the abyss.

                              EVE (cont d)
                CAM!!

  EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT 11717

  A full police search is underway where Cam was last seen.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      10.

                Eve.

  Eve stands up as Gabe approaches her. He looks as numb as she 
  is but hugs her tight.

                              EVE
                I fell asleep.

  Gabe kisses her.

                              EVE (cont d)
                I fell asleep.

                              GABE
                Don t.

                              EVE
                Someone must have been watching us.

                              GABE
                He may have just wandered off.

                              EVE
                Someone must have seen something.

                              GABE
                They said we should go home.

  Eve looks at him like he s insane.

                              EVE
                I m not leaving here.

                              GABE
                Loren and Cally need you.

  Eve is in torment.

                              GABE (cont d)
                I ll take over here.

                              EVE
                Will you?

                              GABE
                I ll stay.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      11.



                              EVE
                He might have hurt himself or ... fallen 
                under something. I ve covered every inch 
                of the park but the streets ...

                              GABE
                I ll be here. Go and see the girls.

  Eve absorbs a new horror.

                              EVE
                They re going to ask me what happened.

                              GABE
                It s not your fault.

                              EVE
                It is.

                              GABE
                It is not and don t tell them that.

  Gabe hugs her again.

                              EVE
                Say we re going to find him.

                              GABE
                Of course we re going to find him. How 
                can we not find him.

  Eve nods. Fumbles for her keys. Gabe closes his hand round 
  hers.

                              GABE (cont d)
                They re driving you.

  Eve begins to move away.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Eve.

  He hands her the marking. No reproach from him. But she feels 
    a terrible judgment.

  INT. CAM S BEDROOM - NIGHT 11818

  Eve sits dazed among the scattered lego bricks in Cam s 
  bedroom.

                              LOREN
                Mum.

  Eve turns to her eldest daughter.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      12.



                              EVE
                  Sweetheart try to sleep. Please.

                              LOREN
                I can t stop thinking about it. Why would 
                he run away?

                              EVE
                We don t know what happened.

                              LOREN
                You were watching so there wasn t time 
                for him to just wander off. Someone must 
                have grabbed him.

  Eve closes her eyes in despair.

                              EVE
                Loren please.

                              LOREN
                Is that what the police think?

                              EVE
                They re just looking. That s all they re 
                doing right now.

                              CALLY
                Mummy.

  Eve stands up.

                              EVE
                Oh no. No. We re not having a conference 
                about this. There s nothing we can do and 
                we can t keep turning it over worrying 
                  ourselves sick. If you can t sleep let s 
                watch TV or I ll read a book to you.

                              CALLY
                Why can t you just ask him?

  Eve stops dead.

                              CALLY (cont d)
                You always say you can hear him. Just ask 
                him.

  Eve is shaking.

                              CALLY (cont d)
                Can t you hear him Mummy?          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      13.



  Eve breaks down. Loren hurries to comfort her. Cally starts 
  crying.

                              CALLY (cont d)
                Why can t you hear him?

  EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 21919

  Eve returns to the playground at dawn. Gabe still there. 
  Police dispersing. Eve searches Gabe s face. He shakes his 
  head.  They look across the barren dawn landscape.

                              GABE
                He s gone.

                              EVE
                No.

  He holds her as we pull back and:

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

  EXT. GABE S HOUSE - DAY 32020

  Eve returns from the shops laden with bags. Close on her 
  face, she looks hollow.

  Caption: Eleven Months Later.

  She notices something out of the corner of her eye and stops 
  dead.

  A lamp post with a missing cat poster.

  She approaches it, astonished.

    Underneath we can see another poster peeking out from the 
  corners.

  Eve furiously rips away at the missing cat poster.

  Gradually Cam s faded photo is revealed underneath. 

  Someone has pasted a missing cat poster over her missing 
  child. 

  She s crying as she uncovers her son s face.

  She calls out to the surrounding houses.

                              EVE
                Who did this? Who could do this?          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      14.



  She breaks into a run, leaving her shopping scattered over 
  the pavement.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 32121

  Eve washes a pill down with a glass of water.

  The door opens downstairs and she hears Loren and Cally.

                              LOREN O.S.
                Mum someone said you dropped your 
                shopping are you okay?

                              CALLY O.S.
                The eggs are broken.

  Eve forces herself up. She has to hold it together for them.

  EXT. GABE S HOUSE - DAY 32222

  Gabe returns home.

  INT. GABE S LIVING ROOM - DAY 32323

  Loren s doing her homework as Gabe enters. Without looking 
  up:

                              LOREN
                Cally s with her.

  Gabe sits opposite Loren. Studies her as she concentrates.

                              GABE
                I need to ask you something.

  Loren continues making notes.

                              GABE (cont d)
                How would you feel about moving?

  Loren nods.

                              GABE (cont d)
                I don t mean permanently. But out of 
                London. Just for a couple of months. I 
                don t want her here for the anniversary.

                              LOREN
                She ll never go.

                              GABE
                She might if it comes from you.

  Loren looks up.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      15.



                              GABE (cont d)
                If you say you re finding it too hard. 
                You could say you can t concentrate. I 
                know I m asking a lot. I just don t think 
                she ll get through this if we don t get 
                away from here. And I don t think she ll 
                go unless it comes from you.

                              LOREN
                Where?

                              GABE
                There s a project come up on the coast up 
                North. I can ask for a temporary 
                  transfer.

                              LOREN
                What about school?

                              GABE
                They have schools. I know it s not great 
                on you.

                              LOREN
                This is more important than school.

                              GABE
                I ll drive your friends up for weekends 
                whatever it takes to make it easier.

                              LOREN
                I think it s a good idea.

                              GABE
                Thank you.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 32424

  Gabe opens the bedroom door to see Eve and Cally curled up 
  together asleep. Eve is holding Cam s blue woollen hat.

  Gabe turns away, stricken.

  INT. CAM S BEDROOM - DAY 32525

  The bedroom is tidied up but still very much Cam s.

  Gabe reaches under the bed to retrieve the bowling ball.

  He slides his fingers into the sockets.

  Clyde tries to comfort him.

  Gabe pushes him away, wretched.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      16.



  He sits cross-legged on the carpet, cradling the bowling 
  ball.

  He forces himself not to submit to despair.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 32626

  Eve sleeps fitfully.

  DREAM MONTAGE2727

  Close-up images of:

  The narrow dormitory window lashed by rain.

  Battered orphans  shoes.

  Pendulum from the grandfather clock.

  Carbolic soap scrubbing an orphan s scalp.

  A boy screaming.

  Pages turning on the punishment book.

  INT. GABE S BEDROOM - DAY 327A27A

  The sound of a cane wakes Eve. She looks around for Cam s 
  blue hat. It s on the floor. 

  EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY 42828

  Gabe s car speeds along a country lane.

  Caption: One Month Later.

                              CALLY O.S.
                How far?

                              GABE O.S.
                Ten minutes less than the last time you

  They pass a sign.

                              CALLY O.S.
                Devil s Cleave! Dad! It s called Devil s 
                Cleave! Is that like cleavage?

  EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY 43030

  Gabe s car winds its way through narrow country lanes.

  INT. GABE S CAR - DAY 43131

  Through the windscreen, we see Crickley Hall loom up into 
  view. More institutional than residential. The house from 
  Eve s dream.

                              GABE
                Big enough for you?

                              LOREN
                It s a mansion.

                              CALLY
                It s a castle!

  Eve is disturbed as she sees the house. She knows she s seen 
  it somewhere before. She notices Gabe watching for her 
  reaction. He looks at her with love and some trepidation.

                              GABE
                Too much?

                              EVE
                      (SMILING)
                Always.

  She kisses him.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - DAY 43232

  Eve approaches the imposing grey slab of a building. Trying 
  to figure out where she s seen it before.

                              EVE
                Which way s the school?

                              GABE
                Two miles ... that way. There s a school 
                bus for the village they said they ll 
                make a stop.

                to struggle down to the bus stop.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      18.



  Gabe unlocks the front door.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Clyde! Come on! Stop sulking.

  Eve looks back to the car and the open back door. The dog is 
  watching them gravely.

  Gabe gets some treats from his pocket and shows them to 
  Clyde. But Clyde doesn t move.

                              GABE (cont d)
                You are sick.

  Eve follows Clyde s gaze to the narrow top window in the 
  house. An image from her dream she half-remembers.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / DORMITORY - DAY 43333

  From the upstairs window, a view of Eve in the drive. Hand-
  held as if the point of view of someone in the house.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 43434

  The girls charge up the open stairs which run past the big 
  window. Eve follows Gabe towards a large drawing room in the 
  austere space.

                              EVE
                Was this a family home?

                              GABE
                I don t know. It s not been rented in a 
                while. I think they re pretty desperate. 
                I got cleaners in.

                              EVE
                They ve really gone to town. What is that 
                smell - carbolic soap?

  She remembers a flash image of carbolic soap scrubbing a 
  young scalp.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / DINING ROOM - DAY 43535

  Gabe opens a window in the dining room.

                              EVE
                Have the police got the landline here? 

                              GABE
                He s got my office and the mobile. I ll 
                give him this place too.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      19.



                              EVE
                People do remember things on 
                  anniversaries.

                              GABE
                If they do we re a phone call away.

  Eve nods, trying not to be tearful. Being brave for him.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / DRAWING ROOM - DAY 43636

  Eve places three photos on the mantelpiece above the fire now 
  burning in the grate. Loren and Cally together. A family 
  group shot with Cam. The third photo - Cam alone. Eve looks 
  at it solemnly.

                              EVE
                We love you baby.

  As if in response, Eve hears a tapping sound from the 
  entrance hall.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 43737

  Eve looks at the grandfather clock. The pendulum is 
  stationary. The same pendulum from her dream. But she seems 
  to hear it ticking. She looks closer.

  Something moves on the stairs, startling her. She looks up 
  the staircase but there s no-one there.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LANDING - DAY 43838

  From the landing, another pov shot from child s height 
  looking at Eve through the bannisters. Someone is there.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LANDING - DAY 43939

  Eve peers at the bannisters. Although she can see nothing she 
  senses someone.

  Loren and Cally come down from the second floor back to their 
  room on the first, breaking the moment.

                              EVE
                What s up there?

                              LOREN
                Junk room. It s the only place I can get 
                  a signal.

                              EVE

                put you on best behaviour?

                              CALLY
                He said I could have -

                We like it here.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CELLAR - DAY 44040

  Eve descends the stone steps into the cellar. Gabe is working 
  on the boiler in the corner. She approaches the low circular 
  wall round the well. It has a metal safety grille over it. 
  She peers into the pit and hears the rushing sound of fast 
  running water.

                That s what makes the house cold.

                No that d be the dodgy boiler.

  Eve tugs at the metal grille covering the well to verify it s 
  well secured.

                I ve checked it but we ll ban them.

                Is that a generator?

                They get power cuts.

  Eve nods, still looking around. Gabe studies her.

                              GABE (cont d)
                There s a B&B a few miles further out.

                              EVE
                No I d rather it was just us. Good

  She watches him with love. He s in his element. Fixing 
  things.

  From far down in the well, a presence seems to wait.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / KITCHEN - DAY 44141

  Loren is examining the old-fashioned basin and taps.

                              CALLY
                There s no dishwasher!

                              LOREN
                I m going to teach you a new game. It s 
                called washing up.

  Loren finds a single cup lying in the sink and picks it up. 
  Mould dribbling out. She looks up and sees an elderly man 
  gazing at her through the window. She gasps and drops the 
  cup. It shatters on the stone tiles.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CELLAR - DAY 44242

  Eve is climbing the steps from the cellar as Cally calls.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / KITCHEN - DAY 44343

  Eve enters the kitchen where the back door to the garden is 
  open. PERCY is helping Loren pick up the last pieces of the 
  broken cup.

                You keep your girls out of the cellar and *

  He leaves with a last look over his shoulder at the girls. 
  Closes the door. Eve confronts Loren. Very firm.

                              EVE
                What have I told you.

                              LOREN
                He s a nice man.

                              EVE
                You don t know that -

                              LOREN
                You were just downstairs -

                              EVE
                It only takes a second -

  Gabe enters, wiping oil from his hands. Eve stops herself, 
  getting too loud and heated. 

                              CALLY
                There s a man who looks after the house.

  Gabe gives Eve s arm a calming squeeze and kneels in front of 
  Loren.

                              GABE
                Show Mum your moves.

  Loren makes a fist.

  Loren carefully slides her thumb out from inside the fingers 
  to rest outside the curled fist.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Aiming for what part of the nose?

  Loren places her fist at the bridge of Gabe s nose.

                              EVE
                Or: don t let them in.

  Cally s looking out the window after Percy.

                              CALLY
                Does he know about Cam?

  Percy stops and looks back at the house. He s on the edge of 
  tears. On his pov of the house we dissolve back seventy years

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 34545

  On the outside not much has changed. On the doorstep is a 
  young woman NANCY, dressed for an interview.

  Watching her from the same spot as elderly Percy, is young 
  Percy, seventeen.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - 1943 DAY 34646

  MAGDA, thirty-ish, answers the door.

  Nancy is barely out of her teens. She keeps her right arm 
  concealed and shakes Magda s hand with her left.

                              MAGDA
                How are things in London?

                They ve calmed down.

  Magda sees Nancy looking over her shoulder.

  A six year old boy is peering through the bannisters on the 
  landing, exactly where Eve sensed someone seventy years 
  later. STEFAN is the boy from her dream.

                              MAGDA (cont d)
                Come down here young man.

  Stefan trudges down the staircase.

                              MAGDA (cont d)
                This one s the worst. He came to us from 
                Germany. He s run away four times. Where 
                he thinks he can escape to I have no 
                idea. We have to watch him like a hawk.

  Stefan arrives.

                              MAGDA (cont d)
                He knows very well where he s supposed to 
                be. He doesn t seem to agree with our 
                prayers. Isn t that right?

  Nancy smiles supportively at Stefan.

                              NANCY
                What s your name?

                              MAGDA

                  Understands every word but refuses to 
                speak it.

  Nancy gets down to his level.

                              NANCY
                You shouldn t run away Stefan. It s very 
                  dangerous back in London. You re much 
                safer here.

                              MAGDA
                There s no-one else who s going to look 
                after you. Go on. 

  Nancy watches him trudge away.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / MAGDA S STUDY - 1943 DAY 34747

  Nancy sits in front of Magda in a formal interview situation. 
  Magda enjoying her moment of power, studying Nancy s 
    references minutely.

                              MAGDA
                You re an orphanage girl yourself. I 
                suppose you believe that gives you a 
                special insight into our charges.

                              NANCY
                  I believe I understand what some of them 
                are going through.

                              MAGDA
                This isn t the place for sentimentality. 
                That won t do for these children. They 
                need to learn respect for authority if 
                they re going to amount to anything.

                              NANCY
                  I believe in discipline.

  Nancy glances at the empty chair beside Magda. She was 
  expecting another interviewer.

                              MAGDA
                My brother sends his apologies. You ve 
                been told about his injury I m sure. You 
                don t have to pretend. People can t wait 
                to gossip about misfortune. I m sure 
                you ve had your fair share of that.

  Magda s looking at Nancy s right arm.

                              MAGDA (cont d)
                May I?

  Nancy s reluctant.

                              MAGDA (cont'd)
                I need to see the extent of your 
                  affliction if you re going to work for 
                us.

  Nancy uncovers her withered arm.

                Do you have any use of it?

                              NANCY
                  A little.

                              MAGDA
                Well I daresay there s no heavy lifting 
                  required. There we are so you ll 
                  understand the need for sensitivity in

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - 1943 DAY 34848

  Magda sees Nancy out. Magda looks at the grandfather clock 
  and goes to it to open it and stop the pendulum.

                              MAGDA
                This thing makes a terrible racket.

  Nancy looks into Cribben s study where there seems to be a 
  shape working.

                              NANCY
                I was told Mr. Cribben is fully 
                  recovered.

  Close on Magda. No he isn t.

                              MAGDA
                It s important you understand how much he 
                needs peace and quiet. He can t tolerate 
                chaotic behaviour of any kind.

                              NANCY
                I should hope I could provide order.

                              MAGDA
                I m relying on it. I won t beat around 
                the bush Miss Linnet. My brother needs us 
                to be on our very best form.

                              NANCY
                The children deserve nothing less.

  Magda smiles thinly.  She closes the door.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 34949

  Percy reaches for her case. Nancy ignores him and picks it up 
  with her good left arm.

                              NANCY
                There s nothing wrong with me.

                              PERCY

                I don t touch it I m afraid.

  Percy watches her stride off with her suitcase. He s 
    impressed.

                              PERCY
                You let me know when that changes.

  Stefan climbs into a cupboard on the first floor landing and 
  shuts the door. He peeks through the slats and sees a figure

  dormitory and points at the cupboard to the figure looming 
  towards him. Stefan whispers the Jewish Shema prayer to 
  himself.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LANDING - NIGHT 45252

  Dead of night in present day Crickley Hall. We move in on the 
  landing cupboard now closed up. There s a tapping noise 
  coming from inside. Gabe approaches, wearing his boxer shorts 
  straight from bed, woken up by the noise. He opens the 
  cupboard. Nothing inside. He sees some pipes running up along 
  one corner. He touches them.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LOREN S ROOM - NIGHT 45353

  Loren returns to her room. She gets into bed and a thump from 
  upstairs dislodges dust from the ceiling onto her face.

  Gabe s climbing the stairs towards them. Eve waves him to 
  stop. She listens. Silence.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / DORMITORY - NIGHT 45555

  Gabe turns on the light to reveal the large long room we 
  recognize as the orphans  dormitory. No-one there. 

                              GABE
                Might have been a rat, I heard one in the 
                cellar.

  Loren looks at him.

                  Squirrels. Cute rats.

  Loren opens the cupboard door and there s nothing there. A 
  box topples from a shelf with a clatter, making them all 
  jump. They look at the contents. Toys and dolls. Nothing 
  plastic. Old-fashioned and old. Eve picks up a spinning top. 
  Rust obscuring the image of dancing children painted around 
  the circumference.

  Loren pulls back some dust sheets covering a line of rusted

  Crickley Hall nestles peacefully in the moonlit valley.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT 45757

  Eve wakes up in the dark. She s crying. Short of breath. She 
  looks around the room. Sits up, pulling herself together. She 
  reaches under her pillow to hold the blue woollen hat to her 
  cheek. She can hear Clyde howling. Gabe is not there.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 45858

  Eve descends the stairs. Clyde has stopped howling. Eve s 
  feet step into puddles of water on the stairs. She looks up 
  at the ceiling to see if she can spot the leak.

  She reaches the foot of the stairs and sees the door to the 
  cellar is open. Eve moves to shut the cellar door. Gabe 
  appears from what used to be Cribben s study.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      31.



                              GABE
                Clyde s being a drama queen it s not that 
                cold.

  Eve sees Gabe s laptop open on the study table. There s a 
  website on it:

  Have You Seen Our Son? 

  A photo of Cam. A phone number.

  On the corner a counter of days missing: 361.

                We got a couple of emails. I forwarded 
                them on.

  He looks more closely at her and wipes the tears from her 
  cheek. No need to ask why.

                              EVE
                No it was a good one. I could smell him 
                he was so close. He said he s not dead. 
                It s funny I feel closer to him here.

  He holds her. Doesn t know what to say. He sees the puddles 
  on the stone floor.

                And all the way up the stairs.

                I didn t know it was raining. What were 
                you doing in the cellar?

  Nancy looks across to see Magda in her socks.

  Nancy takes her shoes off, nonplussed. She glances up and 
  sees a figure cross the first floor landing.

                The Jews are always being chased out of 
                one country or another. There must be a

  Maurice leaves. Nancy is shaken.

  there s a well with a circular wall.

  He lifts out a bucket from the black rushing sound and pours 
  out a glass of water. He hears movement in the shadows.

                              CALLY
                Mummy are you sad today?

                              LOREN
                Shut up.

  Eve comes to attention. Smiles at Cally.

                              EVE
                Give me a reason not to be sad.

  Cally looks around, thinks hard. Eve looking at her with 
  love. Cally points at a newsagents.

                              CALLY
                Sweets!

                              EVE
                I m happy!

  INT. BARNABY S INN - DAY 57070

  The locals look up as they enter. Gabe whispers in a cod 
  Northern accent:

                              GABE
                We don t like strangers round here.

  Loren shushes him.

                                                                  CUT TO:

                Passing through?          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      39.



                              GABE
                I m working here for a couple of months. 
                Staying up at Crickley Hall.

                              LANDLORD
                Big place that. You ll be rattling round 
                in it.

                              GABE
                Why is it called Devil s Cleave? Not 
                exactly touristy.

                              LANDLORD
                Ah well now. Centuries ago, the Devil 
                himself tried to cut his way inland from 
                the sea to flood all the villages 
                  hereabouts. First he took a bite out of 
                the cliffs and that s how Hollow Bay came 
                to be. They say after he took his first 
                bite he tried to gnaw his way up to the 
                moors but his teeth eventually got wore 
                down to the gums and he couldn t get no 
                further. So he sloped off back to sea 
                swearing his revenge one day. And he did, 
                but I ll leave that for another day.

                              GABE
                Perfect. Thanks.

  He takes the drinks over to their table.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Cally I got a good one.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 57171

  The presence stops outside the kitchen door. Then moves 
  forward through the closed door.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / KITCHEN - DAY 57272

  Close on Clyde s paws tearing desperately at the back door. 
  There s blood.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL / GARDEN - DAY 57373

  Clyde s barking stops abruptly. Now we hear louder and more 
  frantic sounds as we withdraw from the house. High-pitched 
  keening. An animal in terrible distress.

  EXT. BARNABY S INN - DAY 57474

  Cally gnaws on a stick of rock as they emerge from the sweet 
  shop. Eve looks at the church opposite.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      40.



                              EVE
                Can we?

  Gabe s not happy about churches.

                              GABE
                Sure.

  INT. CHURCH - DAY 57575

  Eve and the girls light a candle for Cam near the front of 
  the church. Gabe loiters at the back, fighting resentment. He 
  scans the memorials on the wall. He finds a large plaque.

                In memory of those orphans who drowned in 
                the Great Flood of 1943.

  EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 57676

  Gabe moves among the headstones. He looks down at a 
    gravestone and sees the inscription and year of death - 1943. 
  He moves on a couple of paces and sees another with the same 
  year. And another.

                              PERCY
                Mr. Caleigh?

  Percy carries some weeding instruments. He nods towards Eve 
  at the church door with the reverend.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                I met your wife up at Crickley Hall

                              PERCY
                I look after the orphans.*

  Percy searches Gabe s face to see how much he knows. Gabe 
  doesn t follow. Percy is relieved.

                              PERCY (cont'd)
                You re settling in all right.

                              GABE
                  Everything s great thanks. And we ve got 
                your number.

  Gabe watches Percy head over to a corner of the cemetery 
  where he kneels and begins tending the grave stones.

  EXT. CHURCH - DAY 57777

  Gabe returns to the church entrance where Eve is with the 
  vicar. Gabe indicates the headstones.*

                              GABE
                1943 was a bit of a bad year for you.

                                ANDREW
                The flood didn t reach the church thank 
                God but yes. Sixty-eight people lost 
                their lives.

                              EVE
                How?

                                ANDREW
                It was a flash flood. People were drowned 
                in their sleep.

  He glances at Loren and Cally, both rapt.

                              GABE
                Don t mind them the gorier the better.

                              EVE

                              GABE
                  Sightseeing.

  Andrew s eyes meet Gabe s. Gabe is radiating polite 
    hostility.

                              GABE (cont d)
                God doesn t do anything for us I m

                                ANDREW
                How can you say that with two beautiful 
                girls.

  Gabe s got an answer ready but:

                              EVE
                I d love to come to a service.

                                                                  CUT TO:

  Nancy alone with Susan.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                You know how Maurice is Magda s eyes and 
                ears? I d like you to be mine. I d like 
                you to come to me with anything that 
                  frightens you. Anything you feel 
                  shouldn t be happening.

                              SUSAN
                Yes Miss.

                              NANCY
                Cribben uses a cane doesn t he.

                              SUSAN
                I don t know Miss.

                              NANCY
                You can tell me.

  Susan says nothing.

                              NANCY (cont'd)
                You know I m on your side.

                              SUSAN
                You go home at night Miss.

                              NANCY
                I can still help you.

                              SUSAN
                And if I get sent back to London where 
                will you be then Miss?

                              NANCY
                Has someone threatened to send you back 
                to London?

                              SUSAN
                No Miss. No-one s threatened anything. 
                What reading do you want me to prepare?

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - 1943 DAY 58787

  Nancy readies herself to leave Crickley Hall. She has her hat 
  and gloves. She sees all the orphans  shoes lined up at the 
  foot of the stairs.

  She hesitates and looks into the darkened study. She looks 
  upstairs. No-one seems to be around.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      48.



  The silent grandfather clock.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / STUDY - 1943 DAY 58888

  Nancy enters the study. The curtains are drawn. She scans the 
  room. The heavy books on the shelves. Medals and trophies.

  A framed slogan on the wall:

  Train up a child in the way he should go
  And when he is old he will not depart from it

                                       PROVERBS 22:6

  She does a quick search and finds:

  Cribben s cane.

  She gives it a practice swipe through the air. She tries it 
  out on her withered hand. 

    Swish-thwack.

  It leaves the same mark as on Stefan s.

                              CRIBBEN
                You need correction?

  Nancy gasps and drops the cane.

  Cribben in the doorway.

                              NANCY
                He s only six.

                              CRIBBEN
                Then we re just in time. For the others 
                it may be too late. I m sorry we haven t 
                met.

                              NANCY
                Nancy Linnet.

                              CRIBBEN
                Augustus Cribben. My sister admires you 
                greatly.

  Nancy can t hide her surprise. Cribben is amused.

                              CRIBBEN (cont d)
                She s that way with everyone she admires. 
                The more she expects of them.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      49.



                              NANCY
                She expects a great deal from children.

                              CRIBBEN
                Indeed we both do. Well observed. Someone 
                expected a great deal from you when you 
                were a child else you d not turned out as 
                you have.

                              NANCY
                May I speak frankly Sir?

                              CRIBBEN
                My sister tells me you do little else.

                              NANCY
                You don t need to instill fear to get 
                respect.

                              CRIBBEN
                It s clear you ve never been in charge of 
                  children.

                              NANCY
                They behave impeccably in class.

                              CRIBBEN
                And why do you think that is.

  Running footsteps can be heard upstairs. Cribben bellows.

                              CRIBBEN (cont d)
                DO YOU WANT ME TO COME UP?

  The footsteps stop.

                              CRIBBEN (cont d)
                It s not pleasant Miss Linnet. But it is 
                in the nature of children to rebel. It is 
                our duty to meet them with consequence. 
                Good night.

  Nancy walks nervously past him as he replaces the cane.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CELLAR - NIGHT 58989

  The rushing sound from the well increases intensity. The door 
  to the cellar glides open.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 59090

  We track along pools of water towards the stairs.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      50.



  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CALLY S ROOM - NIGHT 59191

  Cally is playing with a colouring book. She hears the sound 
  of crying. She turns. It s coming from outside the room.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LANDING - NIGHT 59292

  Cally approaches the cupboard on the landing. The crying is 
  coming from inside. She looks at the handle to the cupboard. 
  Her hand reaches out gingerly to open the cupboard.

    SWISH-THWACK.

  A fast blurring movement slicing down on Cally s hand.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / KITCHEN - NIGHT 59393

  Eve hears Cally scream shrilly. She runs.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 59494

  Eve runs up the stairs two at a time.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LANDING - NIGHT 59595

  Cally is sitting on the landing in floods of tears, holding 
  the palm of her hand.

                              EVE
                Oh what have you done to yourself!

                              CALLY
                He HIT me!

                              EVE
                Let me see.

  There s no mark. Eve examines Cally s hand for splinters.

                              CALLY
                I wasn t being naughty why did he HIT me?

                              EVE
                Who?

                              CALLY
                The MAN!

                              EVE
                There was a man here?

                              CALLY
                He went down there!          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      51.



  Cally points down the stairs. 

                              EVE
                Cally I would have seen him. Did you fall 
                asleep?

                              CALLY
                No I didn t!

  Eve leads her downstairs. 

                              EVE
                Let s go and get a biscuit and no more 
                playing games by yourself okay?

                              CALLY
                I wasn t playing I was trying to help!

                              EVE
                Let s have another look for Clyde in the 
                garden before we get ready for bed.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CLASSROOM - 1943 DAY 69696

  Nancy stands in front of the assembled orphans.

                              NANCY
                I ve got a special treat for you today.

  She takes out an antique Bible.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                The library has been kind enough to allow 
                me to borrow a very old Bible for you all 
                to look at. But I promised there wouldn t 
                be any grubby paws so let me check before 
                I pass it round.

  The orphans present their hands palm up. Nancy scrutinizes 
  each. There are no marks from Cribben s cane.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Very good. You perform your ablutions 
                  admirably. I presume the water is cold.

  She arrives at Stefan. He looks pale. She studies his hands 
    carefully. He s wearing a long sleeved vest under his jacket 
  which stops at his wrists. She releases his hands and Stefan 
  rubs his arms.

                              MAURICE
                He s got flu Miss that s why he s wrapped 
                up.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      52.



  She looks evenly at Maurice. He s nervous.

                              NANCY
                Thank you Maurice.

  Maurice brazens it out. Nancy looks back at Stefan.

                              SUSAN
                He ll be fine Miss. Really.

  Nancy looks around the class. They re all terrified.

  Nancy can t decide what to do. She looks back to Stefan. He 
  looks down, utterly subdued. A single tear rolls out.

  Nancy considers for some moments.  Wrestling with her fears.

                              NANCY
                Maurice you re going to need to fetch Mr. 
                Cribben for me. Would you do that please.

                              MAURICE
                He s not to be disturbed.

                              NANCY
                You ll get him right now or I ll kick you 
                all the way up those stairs.

  The class gasps in unison. Maurice gets up, reddening. Nancy 
  lunges at him.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                MOVE!

  Maurice runs out. Nancy sits beside Stefan.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Take off your jacket please Stefan.

  Stefan shakes his head.

                              SUSAN
                Don t Miss.

  Nancy strokes Stefan s hair.

                              NANCY
                This has to stop. This is going to stop.

  Nancy tries to take his jacket off. Stefan winces in pain.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                I m sorry.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      53.



  Nancy gets the jacket off but Magda s in the room before she 
  can get any further, Maurice behind her, breathless.

                              MAGDA
                You re fired. Leave the premises 
                  immediately.

                              NANCY
                I ll speak to the organ grinder not the 
                monkey. 

  Magda is beyond astonished.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Is it only children he likes to bully?  
                Where is he? Bring him. 

  Nancy pulls off Stefan s jumper and opens his shirt.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                I m sorry darling.

  Magda moves to stop her.

  Nancy slaps Magda. Magda reels back, stunned.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                I m not afraid of bullies.

  Nancy peels off Stefan s vest.

  Both arms and back are covered in livid bruises and welts.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Oh dear God.

  Magda hurries out to get Cribben.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Everyone up. You re coming with me. 
                Quickly.

  The children rise.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 69797

  Nancy leads the children out of Crickley Hall.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - DAY 69898

  The school bus is parked outside Crickley Hall. Eve is seeing 
  Loren onto the bus. Cally is waving from the door. Loren 
  waves back sleepily.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      54.



  Once Eve s back is turned, Loren sees a girl on the bus Tina 
  waving sarcastically then commenting to her friend and 
  laughing. Loren gets on the bus, nervous.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / KITCHEN - DAY 69999

  Eve joins Gabe in the kitchen with Cally. He s collecting his 
  stuff.

                              CALLY
                What about Clyde?

                              GABE
                He s probably found a better offer by 
                now.

                              CALLY
                No!

                              EVE
                He s going to look for him. Why do you 
                think he s leaving this early.

  Gabe kisses Cally.

                              GABE
                He never liked us. He only pretended. 
                First chance he got - whoosh!

                              CALLY
                Stop it!

  And Gabe s off.

                              EVE
                I m sure we re going to find him.

                              CALLY
                I think the man took him.

                              EVE
                What man?

                              CALLY
                The man who took Cam.

  Eve strokes Cally s hair.

                              EVE
                We don t know if that s what happened. 
                Maybe Cam got lost and a nice woman is 
                looking after him.

  She can barely say it.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      55.



  INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 6100100

  Loren is by herself at break time, looking through her books 
  as children play around her.

                              TINA
                Loren Caleigh.

  Loren looks up at TINA and her two friends.

                              TINA (cont d)
                Is that how you say it?

                              LOREN
                Yes.

                              TINA
                My Nan works at Crickley Hall.  How come 
                you re on holiday if your brother s 
                missing.

                              LOREN
                We re not on holiday. My Dad s working. I 
                don t want to talk about it.

                              TINA
                Your Mum fell asleep when she was looking 
                after him and that s how he went missing 
                is that true?

                              LOREN
                It s none of your business.

                              TINA
                You should be with social services. Your 
                Mum should be in prison.

  Loren punches Tina just as Dad taught her right on the bridge 
  of the nose. The flow of blood is impressive. Tina drops. 
  Some boys watching from a distance break into applause.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / DINING ROOM - DAY 6101101

  Eve is in the dining room. She s cleaned the rust from the 
  spinning top to reveal the brightly coloured dancing 
  children. She uses a can from Gabe s tool box to squeeze a 
  drop of oil into the innards.

  She puts the top on the table and presses the ratchet. The 
  top spins, emitting a high-pitched hum.  Inside the hum Eve 
  hears children s voices. She stares into the blur of motion, 
  transfixed.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      56.



                              CHILD S VOICE
                Mummy.

  Eve gasps.

                              EVE
                Cameron?

                              CHILD S VOICE
                I m not dead Mummy.

                              EVE
                I know baby.

                              CHILD S VOICE
                It s dark.

  Eve can t bear it.

                              EVE
                Just tell me where you are.

                              CHILD S VOICE
                I m cold.

                              EVE
                Are you alone?

                              CHILD S VOICE
                I can see them.

                              EVE
                Who s with you?

                              CHILD S VOICE
                They re dead.

  The top slows down. The voice becomes indistinct.

                              CHILD S VOICE (cont d)
                They know where I am.

                              EVE
                Cam! Who knows? Cam!

  The toy topples. The sounds are gone.

                              CALLY
                Mummy!

  Eve moves out into the entrance hall, in shock.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      57.



  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 6102102

  Cally is pointing at the window by the stairs. Eve sees a 
  glimpse of an image as if a child ran across it.

                              CALLY
                They re playing!

  Eve moves slowly up the stairs. She sees another figure run 
  past the landing.

  Then another figure runs up the stairs to the dormitory.

  INT. DORMITORY - DAY102A102A

  Eve arrives at the dormitory landing and sees through the 
  glass door glimpses of children running around and jumping up 
  and down on beds that are now in their previous place.

  She reaches out to touch the door knob.

    SWISH-THWACK.

  Eve snatches her hand back. She looks back and the children 
  are gone. Cally watching solemnly. Eve looks at her hand. 
  This time there s a welt.

                              CALLY
                He doesn t like the children.

                              EVE
                Who Cally?

                              CALLY
                Can t you smell him?

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - 1943 DAY 6103103

  Magda leads the orphans back into Crickley Hall, accompanied 
  by a policeman and a nurse. They all look very friendly. A 
  shared laugh. The nurse examines the bruise on Magda s face. 
  Nancy watches from a distance, tearful as Percy joins her.

                              NANCY
                They said the other children did it. I 
                don t know what s more monstrous.

                They owned up Nancy. And Stefan said the 
                same.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      58.

                They re terrified! They are in fear of 
                their lives! Who s going to look after 
                them now?

                              PERCY
                You are.

  Nancy looks at him.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                No running away. I want you here when I 
                get back.

  He kisses her for the first time.

  INT. GABE S CAR - DAY 6105105

  Gabe s Range Rover pulls up outside Crickley Hall. Loren in 
  the passenger seat.

                              LOREN
                Do we have to tell her? I don t want her 
                to hear what they said.

  Gabe examines her bruised knuckles.

                              GABE
                Okay you did it playing hockey. I m not 
                  condoning it.

                              LOREN
                You would ve done the same thing.

                              GABE
                She s got problems. She s being brought 
                up by her gran. Her dad walked and her 
                mum dumped her.

                              LOREN
                I m not surprised. And it s no reason for 
                her to take it out on me.  What she said 
                was horrible.

                              GABE
                It s what people do when they re unhappy.

                              LOREN
                I m not apologizing. If she says sorry 
                I ll think about it.

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - DAY 6106106

  Eve leans down to Cally as Gabe and Loren approach.

                              EVE
                Now are you going to let me tell them in 
                my own way or are you going to belt it 
                out at the top of your voice.

                              CALLY
                Is it a secret?

                              EVE
                No it isn t a secret I just want to say 
                it in the right way.

  Gabe and Loren arrive at the door. Gabe looks at Cally.

                              GABE
                What are you smirking about?

  Cally looks up at Eve, bursting. Back to Gabe.

                              CALLY
                We ve got ghosts!

  EXT. CRICKLEY HALL - DAY 6107107

  Loren calls into the darkness, scanning the trees with a 
  flashlight.

                              LOREN
                Clyde! ... Clyde!

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT 6108108

  Gabe and Eve undress for bed. Gabe shuts the bedroom door.

                              EVE
                I m not afraid of ghosts. You don t even 
                believe in ghosts -

                              GABE
                The girls are scared.

                              EVE
                Cally s having the time of her life. A 
                ghost never hurt anyone.

                              GABE

                              EVE
                I heard Cam s voice.

  Gabe stares at her. Suppressed anger. Eve s unsurprised.

                              EVE (cont d)
                And that is why I didn t tell you.

                              GABE
                We don t get to grieve because you re in 
                denial for a year and now he s not just 
                dead he s a ghost -

                              EVE
                He s not dead! He s alive and he s trying 
                to reach me -

                              GABE
                You.

                              EVE
                Please.

                              GABE
                You think I don t hear his voice?

                              EVE
                Gabe.

                              GABE
                I hear his voice.

                              EVE
                This is real. It s the house. Somehow 
                he s able to reach me here where he 
                couldn t before.

                              GABE
                Well make the most of it cause we re 
                going.

                              EVE

  Loren is washing her bruised knuckles under the cold tap. 
  Cally is emitting a stream of consciousness.

                You re making that up.

                              CALLY
                Ask Mum. You better not do anything bad 
                or he ll come and get you.

                              LOREN
                You first.

  Loren sprays water at Cally who screams delightedly.

                              CALLY
                No! No! He s going to get you!

  Close on their bare feet making noise as they run about.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / CELLAR - NIGHT 6110110

  View from the bottom of the well looking up. The ceiling of

  Pools of water on the stone floor. And on the stairs.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT 6112112

  Gabe and Eve are in bed. Back to back. Eve gently clasps his 
  hand. He returns the gesture.

                              EVE
                Did Loren say anything to you about 
                school?

                              GABE
                No.

                              EVE
                You believe that story about her hand.

                              GABE
                Sounded plausible to me.

                              EVE
                Maybe she s being bullied.

  INT. CRICKLEY HALL / LOREN S ROOM - NIGHT 6113113

  Loren is in bed, studying her bruised knuckles. She can t 
  resist smiling at the memory. A little bit proud of herself. 
  She reaches out to turn the bedside lamp off.  

  As the light snaps off the covers are torn from her bed, 
  exposing her bare legs. She looks up into the dark figure 
  towering over her. 

  Cribben is in her room. His arm raised holding his cane. 

  Loren gasps, frozen. Whispers.

                              LOREN
                Daddy -

  Cribben brings down the cane, savagely lashing at Loren. 
    SWISH-THWACK. On her scream:

                                                                  CUT TO BLACK.
