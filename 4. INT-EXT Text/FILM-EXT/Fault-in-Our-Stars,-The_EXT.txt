Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.
HAZEL
I'm so excited I can barely
breathe.
GUS
As opposed to other days...?
She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
tank, and up they go towards his front door.
As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
Like, obnoxiously loud.
Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
no response.
GUS
Maybe he can't hear over the music?
Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
Still excited.
A moment later the door swings open.
It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:
MAN IN PAJAMAS
What?!
Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?
GUS
Mr. Van Houten?
At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
door, they hear this:
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
(SHOUTING)
LEEE-DUH-VIGH!
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Are they here, Peter?
So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
There are two --
(BEAT)
Who the hell's "they?"
71.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
They are Augustus and Hazel, the
young fans with whom you've been
corresponding.
Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
help things take a turn for the better.
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
The Americans?
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
You invited them, remember?
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
You know why I left America,
Lidewij? To never have to encounter
Americans. Get rid of them.
Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
(30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:
VAN HOUTEN
Which of you is Augustus Waters?
Gus raises his hand tentatively.
Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.
LIDEWIJ
Please. I am sorry. Come in.
Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
a step. Hazel follows. They walk:
INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
Van Houten sits in the chair.
Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
twist-tied.
HAZEL
Trash?
72.
LIDEWIJ
Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
opens it.
Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.
VAN HOUTEN
Yours are the first missives to
which I've replied and look where
that got me.
Hazel and Gus take their seats.
VAN HOUTEN
Scotch?
HAZEL
Um, no thanks.
VAN HOUTEN
Augustus Waters?
GUS
It's 11am.
VAN HOUTEN
Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
soda.
LIDEWIJ
Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?
VAN HOUTEN
She thinks I have a drinking
problem.
LIDEWIJ
I also think the Earth is round.
Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.
VAN HOUTEN
So you like my book.
HAZEL
Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
meeting you his Wish so that we
could come here and talk to you.
Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.
VAN HOUTEN
Did you dress like her on purpose?
HAZEL
(looks at her shirt)
Kinda.
73.
Van Houten says nothing to that.
VAN HOUTEN
I do not have a drinking problem. I
have a Churchillian relationship
with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
govern England and do anything I
want to do. Except not drink.
He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.
GUS
Incidentally, thank you for dinner
last night.
VAN HOUTEN
(TO LIDEWIJ)
We bought them dinner last night?
LIDEWIJ
It was our pleasure.
VAN HOUTEN
(SIGHS)
You've come a long way so... what
is it I can do for you?
HAZEL
We have some questions --
VAN HOUTEN
Uh-huh...
HAZEL
About what happens, you know...
after... the end of your book.
Specifically to those who Anna
leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --
VAN HOUTEN
(INTERRUPTING)
How familiar are you with Swedish
hip-hop?
Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?
HAZEL
I would say... limited?
VAN HOUTEN
But presumably you know Afasi Och
Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."
GUS
Um...
VAN HOUTEN
Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
immediately.
74.
Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.
HAZEL
(yelling over the music)
I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
Swedish.
VAN HOUTEN
(YELLING)
Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying, but
what the voices are feeling.
The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.
GUS
Are you messing with us?
VAN HOUTEN
Pardon?
GUS
Is this some kind of performance?
VAN HOUTEN
Rudolf Otto said that if you had
not encountered the numinous then
his work was not for you. And I say
to you, my friends, if you cannot
hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
response to fearfulness, then my
work is not for you.
Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
this way for this?
HAZEL
So anyway... when the book ends,
Anna's mom --
VAN HOUTEN
(raising a hand to silence
HER)
Let us imagine that you are racing
a tortoise.
Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.
VAN HOUTEN
The tortoise has a ten yard head
start. In the time it takes you to
run ten yards, the tortoise has
moved maybe one yard. And so on,
forever.
(MORE)
75.
VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
You are faster than the tortoise
but you can never catch him, you
see, you can only decrease his
lead. Now certainly you can run
past the tortoise as long as you
don't contemplate the mechanics
involved but the question of how
turns out to be so complicated that
no one really solved it until
Cantor's proof that some infinities
are bigger than other infinities.
Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.
VAN HOUTEN
I assume that answers your
questions.
GUS
(TO HAZEL)
I don't know what's going on.
VAN HOUTEN
And yet you seemed so intelligent
in print, Mr. Waters.
(under his breath)
Must be all that cancer in your
brain.
LIDEWIJ
Peter!
Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
situation.
HAZEL
Can we please, maybe, talk about
Anna for a sec? I mean, I
understand that the story ends mid-
sentence because she dies or she
becomes too sick to continue --
VAN HOUTEN
I'm not interested in talking about
that book.
HAZEL
- but that doesn't mean her family
and everyone she loves doesn't have
a future, right?
VAN HOUTEN
I said I'm not interested --
HAZEL
(GETTING UPSET)
But you promised!
(CALMS HERSELF)
(MORE)
76.
HAZEL (CONT'D)
Mr. Van Houten, you said you would
tell us what happens and that's why
we're here. We... I need you tell
me. Surely you've thought about it.
I mean, as characters --
VAN HOUTEN
Nothing happens to them! They're
fictions. They cease to exist the
moment the novel is over.
This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't
accept it.
HAZEL
They can't!
(again, has to calm
HERSELF)
I mean, I understand. In a literary
sense. But it's impossible NOT to
imagine some future --
VAN HOUTEN
I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid
of them, please.
(Lidewij doesn't move, he
turns back to Hazel)
I won't indulge your childish
whims. I refuse to pity you in the
manner in which you're accustomed.
HAZEL
I don't want your pity --
VAN HOUTEN
Of course you do. Like all sick
kids, your existence depends on it.
LIDEWIJ
Peter!
VAN HOUTEN
(on a roll)
You are fated to live out your days
as the child you were when
diagnosed, the child who believes
there is life after a novel ends.
And we, as adults, we pity this, so
we pay for your treatments, for
your oxygen machines. We give you
food and water though you are
unlikely to live long enough --
LIDEWIJ
PETER!
VAN HOUTEN
You are a side effect of an
evolutionary process that cares
little for individual lives.
(MORE)
77.
VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
You are a failed experiment in
mutation.
LIDEWIJ
I RESIGN!
Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But
not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.
She rises from the couch.
HAZEL
Hey listen douchepants. You're not
gonna tell me anything I don't
already know about illness. I need
one thing and one thing only from
you before I walk out of your life
and that's for you to tell me what
happens to your goddman characters!
VAN HOUTEN
(BEAT)
I cannot tell you.
HAZEL
Bullshit!
VAN HOUTEN
I cannot --
Van Houten goes to take a drink but...
HAZEL
Make something up.
... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,
surprising everyone.
After a beat:
VAN HOUTEN
Lidewij. I'll have a martini
please.
LIDEWIJ
I have resigned.
VAN HOUTEN
Oh don't be ridiculous.
No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.
VAN HOUTEN
I'd like you to leave now.
HAZEL
You're really not gonna tell us?
VAN HOUTEN
I would like you... to leave.
78.
Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:
EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.
VAN HOUTEN
Have you ever stopped to ask why
you care so much about your silly
questions?
A beat.
HAZEL
Go fuck yourself.
Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.
GUS
Hey. It's ok. It's ok...
(beat, an idea)
I'll write you a sequel.
(she cries harder)
I will. Better than any shit that
drunk could write. With blood and
guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
gives her a hug. Afterwards:
HAZEL
I spent your Wish on that asshole.
GUS
You did not spend it on him. You
spent it on us.
They embrace once more.
HAZEL
I wanted...
GUS
I know... I know. Apparently the
world is not a wish-granting
factory.
This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
outside. Clearly she's been crying too.
LIDEWIJ
I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
him cruel. I thought meeting you
would help him, if he would see
that his work has shaped real
lives, but... I'm very sorry.
79.
Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.
LIDEWIJ
Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.
Have you seen the Anne Frank House?
GUS
I'm not going anywhere with that
monster.
LIDEWIJ
He is not invited.
EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.
LIDEWIJ
I'm afraid there's no elevator.
HAZEL
Oh, um, that's alright.
LIDEWIJ
No, there are many stairs. Steep
stairs.
HAZEL
I can do it.
GUS
HAZEL --
HAZEL
I can do it!
Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
today. They are going inside. CUT TO:
INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.
LIDEWIJ
Shall we?
Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
far so good. They find themselves in an office space.
LIDEWIJ
This is the bookcase that hid the
Frank family and four others.
The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.
80.
Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
tank.
Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
breathing the entire time.
ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.
GUS
You're a champion.
Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
he looks at Hazel:
GUS
That's enough --
HAZEL
(RESOLUTE)
I'm ok.
Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
herself through.
Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.
GUS
We're at the top. That's it.
Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
their story.
LIDEWIJ
The only member of the whole family
to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
Gus takes Hazel's hand.
LIDEWIJ
I don't know how you go on, without
your family.
81.
Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
same. The room is dark.
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
"At such moment's, I don't think
about the misery..."
Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
"...but about the beauty that still
remains."
Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
Their eyes meet. The emotions build...
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
"Try to recapture the happiness
within yourself. Think of all the
beauty in everything around you...
and be happy."
And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
small eternity.
Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:
INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:
GUS
It's above my knee.
She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.
GUS
It tapers a little and then it's
just skin --
HAZEL
What?
82.
Hazel pulls away from him.
GUS
My leg.
(BEAT)
Just so you're prepared --
HAZEL
Oh get over yourself.
Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:
HAZEL
I love you, Augustus Waters.
GUS
I love you too, Hazel Grace.
They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:
INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.
EXT CAFE - DAY
Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.
HAZEL
"Get up you fat bastard."
GUS
"I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."
HAZEL
I said "get up."
GUS
"Standing is for fools!"
HAZEL
God, what an asshole.
They both giggle at the whole thing.
83.
HAZEL
It was awful, Mom. You can't
imagine.
FRANNIE
And then what happened?
HAZEL
Then we went to the Anne Frank
museum.
FRANNIE
And after that?
A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.
HAZEL
We just... walked around.
Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
in check in front of her Mother.
FRANNIE
Sounds lovely.
A few beats later.
FRANNIE
Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
a little. Give the two of you some
time to talk.
HAZEL
(THAT'S WEIRD)
Um... ok...
As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
has left them:
HAZEL
That was weird.
Gus doesn't respond except to say:
GUS
Shall we?
EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER
They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
with something.
HAZEL
Augustus?
84.
GUS
There's something I have to tell
you...
They walk in silence a few beats.
GUS
Just before you went into the
hospital... There was this... I
felt this... ache in my hip.
Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.
HAZEL
Oh no...
Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
tightly, trying not to cry.
GUS
I had a PET scan.
Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
Before he even says it, she knows.
GUS
It lit up like a Christmas tree,
Hazel...
HAZEL
Oh god.
GUS
The lining of my chest, my liver...
everywhere.
HAZEL
Oh my god no!
Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
him for dear life, her head in his lap.
HAZEL
I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so
SORRY --
GUS
I'm sorry too --
HAZEL
It's so unfair --
GUS
I should have told you --
HAZEL
It's so fucking unfair!
A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.
85.
GUS
Apparently the world is... not a
wish-granting factory.
And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
sad and feel awful.
But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.
GUS
Don't you worry about me, Hazel
Grace. I'll find a way to hang
around and annoy you for a long
time.
She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.
HAZEL
Does it hurt?
GUS
It's ok.
(BEAT)
I'm ok.
HAZEL
Ok.
GUS
Ok.
But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.
Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.
GUS
What?
HAZEL
I'm just... I'm very fond of you.
He grabs her hand and holds it.
GUS
I don't suppose you can forget
about it, treat me like I'm not
dying.
HAZEL
I don't think you're dying,
Augustus. You've just got a touch
of cancer.
Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.
GUS
Would it be absolutely ludicrous to
make out right now?
86.
Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the
two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:
INT AIRPLANE - LATER
Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,
leaving Amsterdam behind.
INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY
As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing
amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -
instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and
Gus)."
Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He
kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his
hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
Hazel sits with her father on the couch.
HAZEL
Gus had a recurrence.
MICHAEL
(NODS)
Mrs. Waters told us the night
before you left.
(BEAT)
I'm sorry Hazel.
They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes.
HAZEL
You're not gonna say it?
MICHAEL
What's that?
HAZEL
The usual. "Everything happens for
a reason..."
Michael shakes his head.
MICHAEL
I don't know, Haze.
(BEAT)
I always thought being an adult
meant knowing what you believe...
(BEAT)
... that has not been my
experience.
Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO:
87.
INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY
Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through
a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.
Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.
HAZEL
How are your eyes?
ISAAC
Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're
not in my head is the only problem.
GUS
I hate to one-up you but... seems
my entire body is made out of
cancer now, so...
Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He
goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.
GUS
Whoa, I'm taken.
Isaac laughs.
ISAAC
(to Hazel, re: Gus)
Did you write his eulogy yet?
Hazel is confused.
GUS
Dude.
ISAAC
What?
GUS
I haven't asked her.
ISAAC
Oh.
(BEAT)
Oops.
HAZEL
What are you talking about?
ISAAC
My bad.
HAZEL
(STILL CONFUSED)
Augustus?
Gus looks at her, grows a little serious.
88.
GUS
I need speakers at my funeral. I
thought maybe you and Isaac... but
especially you --
ISAAC
Hey!
GUS
Would you be kind enough to whip
something up?
HAZEL
(touches his hand)
It would be an honor.
They hold holds.
ISAAC
You guys are adorable.
Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm.
HAZEL
How's your love life? Anything from
Monica?
ISAAC
Not a word.
HAZEL
She hasn't even like, texted to ask
how you're doing?
He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.
HAZEL
That is so messed up!
ISAAC
I've stopped thinking about it.
Moving on. There's a new girl in
Support Group with these humongous -
Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.
HAZEL
How do you even know that?
ISAAC
I'm blind but I'm not that blind.
GUS
Hazel Grace!
They turn to him.
GUS
Do you happen to have four dollars?
89.
No one knows what that means. CUT TO:
INT HAZEL'S CAR - LATER
Gus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel
returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.
HAZEL
Ok now what?
Gus smiles. CUT TO:
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring
something down.
ISAAC
Is it there?
GUS
Oh it's there.
REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.
ISAAC
She's in the house?
GUS
Who cares where she is? This is not
about her. This is about you.
(sticks out his hand)
Hazel...
Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts
it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't
see a thing - towards the Firebird.
Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.
It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:
ISAAC
I didn't hear anything.
GUS
A little to the left.
ISAAC
My throw was to the left or I
should aim to the left?
GUS
Aim left.
Isaac turns his shoulders.
90.
GUS
Lefter.
Isaac turns some more.
GUS
Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.
Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -
missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.
GUS
Bullseye!
ISAAC
Really?
GUS
No you missed it by like 20 feet.
(hands him a THIRD)
Try one more time.
Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.
Isaac's face lights up.
HAZEL
Woo hoo!
Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a
throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's
enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car
door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.
GUS
Keep throwing, keep throwing!
Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his
mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.
Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.
MONICA'S MOM
What in God's name --
Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks.
GUS
Are you Monica's mom?
MONICA'S MOM
(CONFUSED)
I am.
GUS
Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done
an injustice and we've come here
seeking revenge. We may not look
like much. Between the three of us,
we have five legs, four eyes, and
two and a half working lungs.
(MORE)
91.
GUS (CONT'D)
But we also have two dozen eggs. So
If I was you, I would go back
inside.
Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,
she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus
on the cheek. And over we hear:
HAZEL (V.O.)
A few days later, Gus landed in the
hospital with chest pains.
INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She
stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down.
HAZEL
How's he doing?
MRS. WATERS
He's had a tough night, Hazel. His
blood pressure's low. His heart --
Mrs. Waters starts to cry.
HAZEL
What about the chemo?
MRS. WATERS
(shakes her head)
They're gonna stop the chemo.
They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.
HAZEL
Can I see him?
MRS. WATERS
(BEAT)
We have to be a family now.
Hazel nods. She understands.
MRS. WATERS
We'll tell him you were here.
HAZEL
If you don't mind, I'll just hang
for a while.
Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy
doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair
Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.
92.
EXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot
on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this
time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into
little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but
it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.
HAZEL
What are you thinking about?
GUS
Oblivion.
HAZEL
Augustus...
GUS
I know it's kid's stuff but... I
always thought I'd have a grand
story to tell, you know? Something
that would run in all the papers. I
always thought I was special.
HAZEL
You are.
GUS
Yeah but... you know what I mean.
Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus
can tell he's said something wrong.
GUS
What?
HAZEL
I do know what you mean, I just...
I don't agree.
Hazel stands up, anger building.
HAZEL
This obsession with being
REMEMBERED --
GUS
Don't get mad --
HAZEL
But I am mad!
(BEAT)
I think you're special, is that not
enough?
GUS
HAZEL --
93.
HAZEL
You think the only way to live a
meaningful life is for everyone to
love you, for everyone to remember
you. Well guess what, Gus, this is
your life. This is all you get. You
get me, and your family, and this
world. And if that's not enough,
well I'm sorry, but it's not
nothing. Cause I'll remember you,
I'll love you --
GUS
You're right --
HAZEL
And I just wish... I just wish
you'd be happy with that.
GUS
You're right. I'm sorry.
(pulling her back down)
I'm sorry.
Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to
hers in a toast.
GUS
It's a good life, Hazel Grace.
She softens. They toast.
HAZEL
It's not over yet, you know.
Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there
isn't much time. CUT TO:
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -
"Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in
her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:
HAZEL
Hello?
GUS (O.S.)
(WEAKLY)
Hazel Grace.
HAZEL
(RELIEVED)
Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!
GUS (O.S.)
I'm at the gas station --
94.
HAZEL
What?
GUS (O.S.)
Something's wrong. You gotta...
please come help me.
INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually
finding herself at the Speedway gas station.
Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next
to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and
blood. She gags from the smell.
GUS
(MUMBLING)
Hi.
Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to
his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE
sticking out of it.
HAZEL
(PANICKED)
Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.
GUS
No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do
not call 911 or my parents -- I'll
never forgive you -- Don't, please.
Gus starts to cry.
GUS
Please just look at it.
Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.
HAZEL
I think it's infected...
Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.
HAZEL
Gus, what the -- why are you here?
Why aren't you home?
Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his
mouth away from his lap.
HAZEL
Oh, sweetie...
GUS
I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I
lost my pack. Or they took it.
(MORE)
95.
GUS (CONT'D)
I don't know. They said they'd get
me another one but I wanted... to
do it myself. Do one little thing
myself.
Hazel doesn't know what to do.
HAZEL
I can't fix this. I have to call
someone. I'm sorry.
GUS
No, Hazel, please!
But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which
point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying
teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:
HAZEL (V.O.)
I wish I could say Augustus Waters
kept his sense of humor till the
end, did not for a moment waiver in
his courage and his spirit soared
like an eagle to the sky...
GUS
(to himself, shaking)
I hate myself I hate myself I hate
this I hate this...
HAZEL (V.O.)
...but that is not what happened.
LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel
is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts
moving, Gus grabs her hand.
GUS
Read me something.
HAZEL
Read you something?
GUS
Do you know any poems?
HAZEL
I know one.
GUS
Read it to me.
HAZEL
"The Red Wheelbarrow" by William
Carlos Williams.
(beat, tries to remember)
"So much depends / upon / a red
wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /
water / beside the white /
chickens."
96.
GUS
(BEAT)
Is that it?
That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.
Hazel thinks fast.
HAZEL
No of course not. Um... what
else...
(THINKS)
so much depends/ upon a blue sky/
cut open by the branches/ of the
trees./ So much depends/ on the
transparent G-tube/ erupting from
the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.
Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head
in her arms. And continues...
HAZEL
So much depends upon this observer/
of the universe...
As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:
HAZEL (V.O.)
One of the less bull-shitty
conventions of the cancer genre is
the convention known as the "Last
Good Day..."
EXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but
he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.
INT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in
his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest
room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.
HAZEL (V.O.)
This is where the victim of cancer
finds himself unexpectedly with
some hours...
EXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY
Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading
a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into
nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking
from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.
97.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... when it seems like the
inexorable decline has suddenly
plateaued, when the pain is for a
minute bearable.
INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching
her food.
HAZEL (V.O.)
The problem, of course, is that
there's no way of knowing that your
last good day is your "Last Good
Day." At the time, it's just
another decent day.
The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.
HAZEL
Hi, Augustus.
GUS (O.S.)
Good evening, Hazel Grace.
His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.
GUS (O.S.)
Quick question for you. Did you
ever write that eulogy I asked you
to prepare?
HAZEL
I may have...
GUS
Excellent. Do you think you could
find yourself at the Literal Heart
of Jesus in 20 minutes.
HAZEL
Um... sure. Is everything --
GUS (O.S.)
I love you Hazel.
The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.
HAZEL
I gotta go.
FRANNIE
Finish eating first.
HAZEL
I can't, I have to meet Gus.
98.
FRANNIE
You haven't eaten a thing.
HAZEL
I'm not hungry.
FRANNIE
You can't not eat, Hazel.
HAZEL
I am aggressively unhungry, ok?
MICHAEL
HAZEL --
HAZEL
I have to go.
FRANNIE
Sit down.
HAZEL
No!
MICHAEL
Hazel, listen to your mother.
Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.
FRANNIE
You have to eat, Hazel. You're not
gonna starve yourself to death just
because Gus is sick. You have to
stay healthy --
HAZEL
I can't! I can't stay healthy
because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am
dying. I am going to die and leave
you here alone and you won't have
me to hover around and you won't be
a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,
but I can't do anything about it,
ok?! Just leave me alone!
Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately
regrets this.
FRANNIE
You heard me?
Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling
terrible.
FRANNIE
You heard me say that to your
father?
Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.
99.
FRANNIE
Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was
wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not
something I believe.
Michael sits across from them.
FRANNIE
As long as either of us is alive, I
will be your mother. Even if you
die, I --
HAZEL
When.
FRANNIE
Even when you die, I will still be
your mother. I will always be your
Mother.
By now Michael is crying too. They all are.
HAZEL
I worry that you won't have a life.
That you'll sit around all day with
no me to look after and stare at
the walls and be miserable or off
yourselves or something.
FRANNIE
We're not gonna off ourselves. It's
gonna hurt like hell to lose you
BUT --
MICHAEL
Hazel. You of all people know it's
possible to live with pain.
She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.
FRANNIE
I don't just sit around, you know.
Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I
say something?" She goes for it.
FRANNIE
I'm taking some classes. Online. To
get my master's in social work.
HAZEL
You are?
Hazel is stunned.
HAZEL
So when you're waiting for me
outside Support Group or whatever,
you're always --
100.
FRANNIE
Working or reading. If I get my
MSW, I can council families in
crisis or lead groups dealing with
ILLNESS --
HAZEL
Why didn't you tell me?
Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.
MICHAEL
We didn't want you to feel
ABANDONED --
HAZEL
Are you kidding? Mom, this is
awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my
god!
Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.
HAZEL
I'm so excited! You're gonna be so
great, Mom!
FRANNIE
Thank you. That means everything to
me.
Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:
FRANNIE
I'd still really like you to eat.
HAZEL
I know Mom. And I will. I promise.
But right now... I really gotta go.
INT CHURCH - LATER
Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now
empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his
wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner
than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.
GUS
Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.
HAZEL
I know, right?
(BEAT)
So, um, what's going on guys?
ISAAC
You're late.
HAZEL
Late for what exactly?
101.
Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.
GUS
I wanted to attend my funeral. By
the way, will you speak at my
funeral?
Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
him on the mouth.
GUS
Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
attend as a ghost, but just to make
sure, I thought I'd - well, not to
put you on the spot, but I thought
I'd arrange a pre-funeral.
HAZEL
Why now?
GUS
No time like the present.
HAZEL
(looks around the room)
How did you even get in here?
GUS
Would you believe they leave the
door open at night?
HAZEL
Um, no.
GUS
As well you shouldn't.
He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.
Isaac clears his throat.
ISAAC
"Augustus Waters was a self-
aggrandizing bastard. But we
forgive him. We forgive him... not
because he had a heart as
figuratively good as his actual one
sucked, or because he got 18 years
when he should have gotten more."
GUS
17.
ISAAC
I'm assuming you've got some time,
you interrupting bastard! I mean
seriously...
(back to the speech)
"Augustus Waters talked so much
that he'd interrupt you at his own
funeral. And he was pretentious.
(MORE)
102.
ISAAC (CONT'D)
Sweet Jesus that kid never took a
piss without pondering the
resonances of human waste
production. And he was vain. But
that comes with superhuman
handsomeness."
Gus nods - that part is true.
ISAAC
"But I will say this: when the
scientists of the future show up at
my house with robot eyes and they
tell me to try them on, I will tell
the scientists to piss off, because
I don't even want to see a world
without Augustus Waters."
Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate
emotional waterfall.
ISAAC
"And then, of course, having made
my rhetorical point, I will put my
robot eyes on because, I mean...
robot eyes!"
Gus has a big smile on his face.
ISAAC
"So anyway, Augustus, my friend...
Godspeed."
Gus nods a couple times.
GUS
Thank you Isaac.
This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.
ISAAC
Goddamn it, Gus.
GUS
Hey don't swear in the Literal
Heart of Jesus.
ISAAC
Shit! Ass! Balls!
Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.
ISAAC
Can I get a hand here, Hazel?
Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get
him, walks him back to her seat.
GUS
Hazel Grace, it's down to you.
103.
Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes
a beat to ready herself.
HAZEL
"Augustus Waters was the great star-
crossed love of my life. Ours was
an epic love story, and I won't be
able to get more than a sentence
into it without disappearing into a
puddle of tears.
(BEAT)
Like all real love stories - ours
will die with us, as it should. I'd
hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,
because there's no one I'd rather
have..."
And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets
it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.
HAZEL
(beat, composing herself)
"I can't talk about our love story
so instead I will talk about math.
I am not a mathematician, but I
know this: there are infinite
numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1
And .12 And .112 And an infinite
collection of others. Of course,
there is a bigger infinite set of
numbers between 0 and 2, or between
0 and a million. Some infinities
are bigger than other infinities. A
writer we used to like taught us
that. I want more numbers than I'm
likely to get, and God, I want more
numbers for Augustus Waters than he
got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot
tell you how thankful I am for our
little infinity. You gave me a
forever within the numbered days,
and for that I am eternally
grateful. I love you."
Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:
BLACK.
Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is
ringing and it's 4am.
She knows instantly.
104.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Augustus Waters died eight days
later in the ICU...
Hazel's head falls into her chest.
HAZEL (V.O.)
... when the cancer, which was made
of him, stopped his heart, which
was also made of him.
Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
embrace her in the bed.
HAZEL (V.O.)
It was unbearable. The whole thing.
Every second worse than the last.
EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME
Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:
HAZEL (V.O.)
One of the first things they ask
you in the ER is to rate your pain
on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
asked this question hundreds of
times and I remember once, early
on, when I couldn't catch my breath
and it felt like my chest was on
fire, and the nurse asked me to
rate the pain and though I couldn't
speak, I held up 9 fingers.
The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
She falls apart nonetheless.
HAZEL (V.O.)
Later on, when I'd been feeling
better, the nurse came in and she
called me a fighter. "You know how
I know," she said. "Because you
called a ten a nine."
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING
Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.
HAZEL (V.O.)
But that wasn't the truth. The
reason I called it a nine was... I
was saving my ten.
105.
INT CHURCH - DAY
The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.
Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
family and extend their deepest condolences.
HAZEL (V.O.)
And this was it. The great and
terrible ten.
When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.
MRS. WATERS
He loved you so much.
Hazel nods. Hugs them back.
HAZEL
He loved you so much too.
More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
herself.
HAZEL
It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.
MINISTER
I think we're ready to begin.
Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
the middle of the room.
MINISTER
Augustus Waters fought hard for
many years. His battle was a
courageous one and his strength was
a source of inspiration for each
and every one of us...
Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:
MALE VOICE
What a load of shit, eh kid?
Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.
106.
MINISTER
Let us pray.
Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.
VAN HOUTEN
We need to fake pray now.
Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
appearance.
MINISTER
Now I call on Augustus's close
friend Isaac to say a few words.
Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.
ISAAC
Of all the things I've lost in my
life, this hurts the most.
And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
walks back up.
MINISTER
And now we'll hear from Gus's...
special friend Hazel Lancaster.
Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
room at the words "special friend."
HAZEL
I was his girlfriend.
Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.
HAZEL
There's a beautiful quote in Gus's
home that reads "if you want the
rainbow, you gotta deal with the
rain."
Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:
HAZEL (V.O.)
I didn't believe a word, of course.
But that was ok. Funerals, I'd
decided, aren't for the dead.
They're for the living.
Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:
107.
EXT CEMETARY - DAY
Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.
Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.
Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:
LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.
HAZEL
I'll be fine.
FRANNIE
Are you sure? We can drive you --
HAZEL
No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for
a while.
Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.
VAN HOUTEN
Could I hitch a ride?
Hazel doesn't want to help this man.
VAN HOUTEN
Just to the bottom of the hill.
Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:
HAZEL
How did you even --
VAN HOUTEN
The internet.
HAZEL
And you just... bought a ticket?
VAN HOUTEN
The drinks are free drinks in First
Class.
Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a
swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.
VAN HOUTEN
Omnis Cellula e cellula.
Hazel ignores him.
VAN HOUTEN
Your boy Waters and I corresponded
quite a bit in his last --
HAZEL
You read your fan mail now?
108.
VAN HOUTEN
I would hardly call him a fan. He
despised me. But he was quite
insistent I attend his funeral and
tell you what became of Anna and
her mother. So here I am and that's
your answer: omnis cellula e
cellula.
HAZEL
I'm so not in the mood --
VAN HOUTEN
"Life comes from life."
HAZEL
Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.
VAN HOUTEN
You don't want an explanation?
HAZEL
Nope. Thanks though. Have a great
life.
VAN HOUTEN
You remind me of her.
HAZEL
(BEAT)
I remind a lot of people of a lot
of people.
VAN HOUTEN
She was eight, my daughter. She
suffered... beautifully. For so
long.
Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.
HAZEL
She had leukemia? Like Anna?
VAN HOUTEN
Just like her, yes.
HAZEL
Were you married then?
VAN HOUTEN
Not when she died, no. I was
insufferable long before Anna, my
dear. Grief doesn't change you,
Hazel, it reveals you.
Hazel takes that in.
HAZEL
Well I'm sorry for your loss.
109.
VAN HOUTEN
And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry
for everything, for being so rude
to you two, for ruining your trip --
HAZEL
You didn't ruin our trip, you
asshole. We had an awesome trip.
VAN HOUTEN
Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You
asked me to tell you what happens
and I wish I could do that. I wish
that I could. But I can't. No one
can. No one knows, Hazel. They
don't talk to us. Unless...
Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.
HAZEL
You think I care about that? I
don't give a shit, Van Houten.
Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.
HAZEL
You're a drunk and a jerk and a
failure. And I'd like you to get
out of my car right now so I can go
home and grieve.
VAN HOUTEN
(STUNNED)
BUT --
HAZEL
Get out of the car!
Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
there as Hazel peels out.
In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but
she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she
can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.
INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon
there's a knock.
110.
HAZEL
(THROUGH TEARS)
Occupada.
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Can I come in?
Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.
MICHAEL
I'm so so sorry.
(BEAT)
It was a privilege to love him,
though, wasn't it?
Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.
MICHAEL
Gives you an idea how we feel about
you.
Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws
strength from him.
EXT ISAAC'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.
They sit on the roof.
ISAAC
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?
HAZEL
He was really fighting for breath,
I guess. He eventually went
unconscious, but it seems like,
yeah, it wasn't great or anything.
Dying sucks.
ISAAC
(LONG BEAT)
It just seems so impossible.
HAZEL
Happens all the time.
ISAAC
Are you angry?
HAZEL
Very.
111.
ISAAC
Me too.
(a few beats)
Gus really loved you, you know.
HAZEL
I know.
ISAAC
He wouldn't shut up about it.
HAZEL
I know.
ISAAC
It was annoying.
HAZEL
I didn't find it that annoying.
They sit there in silence a few beats.
ISAAC
Did you read the note or whatever
from your author friend?
HAZEL
He is not my friend and -- how do
you know about that?
ISAAC
We talked at the cemetery. Said he
came all this way to give you that.
HAZEL
Yeah well I'm over it. I never want
to read another word of that
asshole's again.
ISAAC
Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus
did.
HAZEL
(STUNNED)
What?
ISAAC
That's what he said. Gus had
written something, sent it to Van
HOUTEN --
Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.
ISAAC
What?
HAZEL
I... I have to go. I... Are you...?
112.
ISAAC
I do it all the time. Go.
As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,
enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.
INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY
Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash
in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to
give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:
GUS'S VOICE
Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person
but a shitty writer. You're a
shitty person but a good writer.
We'd make a good team. I don't want
to ask you any favors but if you
have the time, and from what I saw
you have plenty, please fix this
for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
Hazel is overcome with emotion.
GUS'S VOICE
She asked me to write one and I'm
trying, I just, I could use a
little flair. See the thing is...
we all want to be remembered.
She smiles to herself, remembering:
- That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
- The staring contest in Support Group.
GUS'S VOICE
We all want to leave a mark.
- Driving (badly) in Gus's car.
- Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."
GUS'S VOICE
But not Hazel. Hazel is different.
Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
want a million admirers, she just
wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
she wasn't loved widely but she was
loved deeply. And isn't that more
than most of us get?
- And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.
GUS'S VOICE
When Hazel was sick, I knew I was
dying. But I didn't want to say so.
113.
INT ICU - FLASHBACK
Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.
She sleeps. He kneels by her side.
GUS'S VOICE
She was in ICU and I snuck in for
ten minutes and sat with her before
I got caught. Her eyes were closed,
her lungs were intubated...
Gus takes her hand and holds it.
GUS'S VOICE
... but her hands were still her
hands, still warm, and the nails
painted this dark blue back color
and I just held her hands and I
willed myself to imagine a world
without us and what a worthless
world that would be.
- AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that
story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:
EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen
tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and
looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.
GUS'S VOICE
She's so beautiful. You don't get
tired of looking at her. You never
worry if she's smarter than you
cause you know she is. She's funny
without ever being mean.
SHE REMEMBERS:
- The magical dinner at Oranjee.
- The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.
- The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.
- Falling onto the bed together.
[All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
beautiful - because they're real.]
GUS'S VOICE
I love her, god I love her. I'm so
lucky to love her, Van Houten.

114.
GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
You don't get to choose if you get
hurt in this world but you do have
a say in who hurts you.
- AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her
chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.
GUS'S VOICE
I like my choices. I hope she likes
hers.
Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.
GUS'S VOICE
Ok, Hazel Grace?
A beat. Another.
Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:
HAZEL
Ok.
BLACK.
