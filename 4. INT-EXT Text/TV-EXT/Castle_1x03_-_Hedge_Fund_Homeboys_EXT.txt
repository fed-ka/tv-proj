      We open on a pristine LAKE in a lovely country setting. The 
      glassy surface of the lake is broken by the prow of a ROWBOAT 
      gliding by. A YOUNG MAN S ARM dangles lazily off the side, 
      his fingers trailing through the water. Peaceful.

      But as the CAMERA rises, it tells a different story. We see a 
      dozen CROWS crowded around. Suddenly, the crows scatter. 
        Revealing...

      The LIFELESS BODY of a TEENAGE BOY, his shirt soaked in 
      blood. And off this, we PAN UP revealing that we are...


      We see city buildings rising like sentries behind the trees. 


      A crisp, sunny day. Castle hops out of a taxi just as BECKETT 
      emerges from her car. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Hey, look at this. We re in sync.

                                    BECKETT
                    We are not in sync.

                                  CASTLE
                    What? Not a Timberlake fan?

      Castle hustles after Beckett into the park together.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    C mon, admit it. You re beginning 
                    to appreciate my mad crime-solving 
                    skills.

                                    BECKETT
                    You re giddy this morning.

                                  CASTLE
                    The park. Gets me every time. The 
                    birds and the bees. Nature taking 
                    its course. Young lovers doing what 
                    young lovers do. Murders needing to 
                    be solved. Life is good.

      Beckett looks at him, is about to respond, then just gives 
      up. They duck under police tape to --


      It s an active crime scene with UNIFORMS at the perimeter.  
      ESPOSITO and RYAN approach.

                                  RYAN
                    Nice day, huh? We gotta get out 
                    here more.  And not just when 
                    someone gets whacked.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why s everyone so back to nature 
                    this morning?

                                  RYAN
                    We all go back to nature 
                      eventually, Detective.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah, about that...  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  5.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    One victim. Donald Kendall, 18.  He 
                    was a senior at Redding Prep. 

      They approach the ROWBOAT containing the BODY, which has been 
      pulled to shore. LANIE, in wading boots, attends to the body 
      from the side of the row boat.

                    What s he doing in a boat?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    No idea.

                                    BECKETT
                    How are you, Dr. Parish?

                                  LANIE
                    My feet are cold.  

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you got for me, so far?

                                  LANIE
                    Single GSW to the chest.  Fairly 
                    large caliber... And from the lack 
                    of blood inside the boat, I d say 
                    he wasn t killed at sea.

                                    BECKETT
                    Someone moved him.

      Lanie indicates dirt and grass on the victim s shoes.

                    late last night.  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  6.

      Beckett then notices several rowboats tied up nearby.

                                    BECKETT
                          (to Esposito and Ryan)
                    If he was dragged here, it couldn t 
                    have been far.  Get some Uniforms 
                    to do a perimeter walk from those 
                    boats there out to Fifth.  Tell 
                    them, they re looking for a blood 
                    pool, maybe a shell casing.

                                  RYAN
                    Roger that.

      Esposito and Ryan get on it, Beckett steps toward the lake s 
      edge, takes it in. Castle joins her.

                                    BECKETT 
                    So why the burial at sea?

                                  CASTLE
                    Vikings believed that in order to 
                    reach Valhalla, you needed a 
                    vessel.  

                                    BECKETT
                      Gun-toting Viking? That your 
                    theory?

                                  CASTLE
                    No. Vikings launched their dead 
                    with a sacrificial woman. 

      Beckett turns and gives Castle a sharp look,

      Markum points out a cluster of FIVE KIDS, all around 18 years 
      of age, gathered around a table.

                    How are they doing?

      Markum gives a sympathetic shrug.

                                  MARKUM
                    They were very close. Called 
                      themselves the six pack. It s 
                    strange seeing them without him....

      Beckett nods. She and Castle cross toward the kids.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Donny, 18, Caucasian, model good looks, charismatic, in a

      We pull back and we are...Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  10.


      Pulling back from the phone, we see the five kids with 
      Beckett and Castle. BRANDON, 19, quiet, thoughtful, smiles 
      and shakes his head as he closes the app on his phone.

                                    BRANDON
                    That was before they moved and 
                      everything....

      MAX, 18, a little geeky, looks down, emotional. ROMY, 18, 
      Asian, wipes the mist from her eyes.

                                  ROMY
                    You hear about this kinda stuff 
                    happening to other people, but...

                                    BECKETT 
                    Were any of you with Donny last 
                    night?

      They shake their heads. SPENCER, 18, explains.

                                    SPENCER
                    We hung for a bit after school, but 
                    we all headed home around five.

                                    BECKETT
                    Can you think of any reason he 
                    might ve been in the park?

      Silence. The kids look at each other a beat. Castle senses 
      they know something.

                                  CASTLE
                    We just want to find who did this.

      Finally, AMANDA, the edgy one of the group, multiple ear 
      piercings, and a small tat peeking out from under her 
      starched white shirt at her shoulder, speaks up...

                    Yeah. I mean, he just kinda fell 
                    apart.

                    Fell apart how?

                    It s okay, he can t get in trouble.

                                  AMANDA
                    He kind of... got into drugs.

                                    BECKETT
                    Drugs?

                                    BRANDON
                    He was just really hurting.

                    He started dealing... In the park.


      Castle and Beckett exit, talking. Head to their car.

                    means  goat-song?  

      Beckett shoots Castle a look - What are you talking about?Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  12.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Yeah. It makes no sense to me 
                    either, but whatever that first 
                    story was, I can t help but think 
                    bad things must ve happened to that 
                    goat.

      Beckett turns and puts her finger in Castle s face. She wants 
      to say something, but she doesn t know what. Her CELL RINGS. 
      She bites her lip and shakes her head at Castle as she 
      answers.

                    Beckett.

      Castle leans in close to hear the call, their heads almost 
      touching, intimate. Still on the phone, Beckett reaches with 
      her free hand and grabs Castle s ear, pulling his head away 
      from her.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                          (into phone)

                    On my way.

      Beckett releases him and takes off. Castle hustles after her:

      At another CRIME SCENE, on some grass behind a PARK BENCH, 
      which sits along a paved pathway. Ryan walks toward a bench 
      with Beckett and Castle. RED CONES mark a trail to the

                    I m figuring he was probably

                    pretty much an open bazaar, 
                       specially at night.

                    So?  Lanie said the bullet was 
                    large caliber.

                                  CASTLE
                    Right.  But if this kid was dragged 
                    while he was a fresh kill, wouldn t 
                    there be more of a blood trail?

                    If it s a drug dealer, he realizes 
                    the cops are gonna think drug

                                  CASTLE
                    So he moves the body to throw us 
                    off the trail.

                                  RYAN
                    I dunno, Castle. A smart drug

      The  camera-work  is jerky. It s the same pathway where we 
      saw the blood pool earlier. We re TIGHT on BRANDON as he 
      raises a joint to his lips.

      Spencer snags the joint from Brandon. The camera catches his 
      eye.

                    Blast me, Max-oh. Take me out!

      The others crack up. Spencer passes the joint to Romy, but 
      before she can take a drag, Max, already holding the gun, 
      snags it from her.

                                  CASTLE
                    I was just thinking about Donny s 
                    parents. What they ll go through 
                    when they watch that video...
                          (off her empathetic look)
                    Guess it s not too often you get a 
                    murder caught on tape.

                                    BECKETT
                    He was smart to keep it.  Without 
                    it, they all might be looking at a 
                      Manslaughter charge.

      Which gets Castle thinking...

                                  CASTLE
                    That was pretty smart when you 
                    think about it, wasn t it?

                    I get filming their little game the 
                    first few times. It s exciting. But 
                    the tenth time? The fifteenth? What 
                    was so special about that night?

                    Is because you know what s going to
