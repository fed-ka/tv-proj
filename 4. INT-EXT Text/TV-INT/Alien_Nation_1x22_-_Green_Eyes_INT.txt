      of a judge's world - black robe hung on a coat stand, 
      framed university degrees, law books, a gavel on the desk. 
      Also on the desk is a name plate: HON. JULES KAISER, and 
      several brightly coloured cloth balls about the size of 
      baseballs. Between RINGS of the phone, we hear a man 
      GASPING.

      NEWCOMER JUDGE JULES KAISER struggles to answer the phone. 
      He is gravely ill, shaking and gasping for air. An 
      answering machine picks up the phone.

                                  VOICE
                    Hello, this is Judge Kaiser - I'm unable to 
                    come to the phone right now. Please leave a 
                    message when you hear the tone and I'll 
                    call you back as soon as possible.

      BEEP. Judge Kaiser heaves himself toward the desk.

                    Jules, this is Marsha. We missed you at the 
                    mayor's reception this evening.

      Kaiser inches closer.

                    I called your house - there was no answer. 
                    I'm at least glad to know you're not 
                    working late again. You drive yourself so 
                    hard - it's terrible for your health.

      Kaiser's hand reaches trembling for the phone.                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Don't forget, Doug and I are taking you to 
                    the Bolshoi on Saturday.

      CLOSE - KAISER'S FINGERS are within inches of the receiver.

                    George's only been a detective for a year. 
                    Hell, he's only been on this planet for 
                    six.

                    This is Phyllis Bryant of the Human Defence 
                    League - a Purist group. They mounted an 
                      unsuccessful campaign to have Judge Kaiser 
                    removed from the bench.

      BRYANT, at the desk of another detective, turns to Sikes. A

                    I realise this is your job, but doesn't it 
                    bother you, that with all the crime in this 
                    city, you have to waste your time with the 
                    death of this parasite?

      George holds up some letters, encased in a zip-los plastic

      Westside, upscale. Briefcase in hand, Newcomer PETER MOSS

      and pours himself an aperitif. Moss' human maid, MARTHA, 
      enters from the bedroom. She holds a gift-wrapped package.

                    supposed to be sixteen.

      Lorraine disappears into the bathroom as Sikes pops a 
      marshmallow in his mouth. There' s a KNOCK at the door. 
      Still holding the bag of marshmallows, Sikes opens the 
      door, discovering Cathy.

                    Matt, I know it's late, but I just heard on

      Cathy turns to see Lorraine brushing her hair as she comes 
      from the bathroom.

                    I thought I heard your voice. How are you?

      Lorraine' s presence disconcerts Cathy. Her mind works to 
      understand it.                                  CATHY

      Cathy nods, exits.

      IN THE HALLWAY - CATHY pauses, processing what she's just 
      seen. She reaches her hands up, miming Lorraine brushing 
      her hair.

      Albert is at George's desk, taking the latter's shoes as 
      Sikes walks over.

                    I'll get these so shiny, you'll be able to

                    Matt, the letter from this National Purist 
                    Front was printed on the same computer 
                    paper, by the same printer, as one received 
                    by Judge Kaiser. The first letter was

                    were... what is known as french kissing.

                                    MARILYN
                            (laughs)
                    Who told you this?

                                  FISHER
                    You know I can't divulge the person's name.

                                    MARILYN
                    I know where it came from. Noah Ramsey's 
                    jealous of Buck - I bet he told his 
                    parents.                                  FISHER
                            (leading)
                    Jealous?

                                    MARILYN
                    Because Buck's a better student. I have not 
                    been 'intimate' with him - I spend time 
                    with Buck because he's interested in 
                    learning.

                                  FISHER
                    I've heard about your extra-curricular 
                    reading program. I've had complaints about 
                    that, too.

                                    MARILYN
                    These kids deserve better than the 
                      'approved' reading list.

                                  FISHER
                            (sighs)
                    As always, you know more than anyone.

      Fisher stands, coming around his desk.

                                  FISHER
                    Ms. Houston, this is all part of a larger 
                    problem. The radical politics - the 
                    activism - you're always pushing - always 
                    testing.
                            (beat)
                    This time, you've gone too far.

                                    MARILYN
                    You don't take that accusation 
                      seriously... .

                                  FISHER
                    I think you'd be happier at another school 
                    - I think you should put in for a transfer.

                                    MARILYN
                    You can forget about that, Mr. Fisher.                                  FISHER
                    Then I'll be forced to refer this matter of 
                    you and Buck Francisco to the School Board.

                                    MARILYN
                    You're going to blackmail me with this?

                                  FISHER
                    With any kind of molestation or sexual 
                      impropriety charge, the Board tends to err 
                    on the side of caution.
                            (beat)
                    You might find you won't be teaching 
                    anywhere.


      George signs Michael Bukowski out. He turns to two burly 
      medical orderlies and a uniformed cop.

                                  GEORGE
                    You can take him.

      They escort Bukowski from the station. George turns, 
      entering:

      THE SQUAD ROOM - GEORGE walks to his desk, glancing at 
      Sikes who is at his computer.

                    Matt, I realise you're not very well 
                    disposed to me right now, but we can't let 
                    that affect our case. Despite your feelings 
                    of envy, we still have to work together.

      Sikes looks at him - Something George's said has sparked an 
      idea. Sikes returns to his computer, quickly typing.

                    here.

      Sikes exits. George considers a beat, then follows.


      Sikes enters just as the phone RINGS. He lets it RING a 
      couple times, not wanting to talk to anyone. When it 
      continues, Sikes sighs and picks up the receiver.

      Still depressed, he hangs up.


      George, Susan and Emily sit on the floor playing Tenctonese 
      Scrabble. George is distracted.

                                  EMILY

                    It's also a verb - Like Na veebo/ taya

                    Right, Dad?

      George is lost in thought.

                                  SUSAN
                    It's an expression - you haven't been 
                    yourself.

                                  GEORGE

      She opens the door, revealing a human DELIVERY MAN who's 
      holding a basket arrangement of flowers.

                                  DELIVERY MAN
                    Hi. This is for a Mrs. Francisco.

                                  DELIVERY MAN

      He exits as Emily smells the flowers.

                                  EMILY
                    Mmmmm. Smell them.

      Susan does so as George comes over.                                  SUSAN
                    They're lovely.

                            (smelling the flowers)
                    No.

      Susan opens the card.

                                  EMILY
                          (to Susan)
                    Who're they from?

                            (reading)
                    "You're far lovelier than these flowers..." 
                    Signed... "An Admirer".

      Hearing "An admirer," George pales.

                                  GEORGE
                    Let me see that card...

      Taking the card from Susan, he stares down at it in horror.


      Sikes and Lorraine sit on the couch with the remains of 
      their jerk chicken take-out dinner on the coffee table. 
      Lorraine leans back with a contented SIGH.

                    I'm so full, I'm gonna throw up.

      Reaching for his glass of red wine, Sikes stops in mid-
      movement and looks at her with alarm. Lorraine notices and 
      laughs.

                                  LORRAINE
                    Just kidding!

      Relieved, Sikes picks up his wine glass. Lorraine watches 
      him.                                  LORRAINE
                    Tell me something, would you rather I 
                    hadn't come over tonight?

                    Why?

                            (looks at her)
                    I'm glad you came. Really.

      He turns back to drink his wine. She studies him a beat, 
      then, on an impulse, leans to kiss him on the cheek. Sikes 
      Starts, spilling some wine on his shirt. He leaps to his 
      feet.

                                  LORRAINE
                    Oh, gods

      She grabs a napkin to blot his shirt.

                    It's okay.

      He starts unbuttoning his shirt.

                    Hey... it's nothing... .

      They look at one another a long beat. Each moves 
      simultaneously to kiss the other. Lorraine wraps her arms 
      around Sikes' bare back as the kiss continues. There is a 
      loud KNOCKING at the front door.

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                            (urgently)
                    Matt! Matt, it's Cathy!

      Pulling back from Lorraine, Sikes hurries to open the door. 
      Cathy is upset, agitated.

                                  SIKES
                    What is it?!

                                  CATHY
                    I just got a call from my medical centre. 
                    George, Susan, Emily were just taken to 
                    intensive care - it's that bacteria. 
                    They've been exposed.

                                  SIKES
                    Lemme get a shirt on.

      Sikes moves from the door to his closet, revealing Lorraine 
      to Cathy. The two women stare at one another.


      Purist leader, Phyllis Bryant, dressed incongruously in an 
      evening gown, is escorted by her bodyguard into:

        A MAKE-SHIFT LAB

      where technicians are setting up equipment. Chiselled 
      former Green Beret, MARK GUERIN, sees Bryant and picks up a 
      capped test tube.

                                  GUERIN
                            (holding up the test tube)
                    We have it.                                  BRYANT
                    I saw the news. Why'd you blow up his boat?

                                  GUERIN
                    Parris wanted a million dollars. He 
                    wouldn't negotiate.

      She nods approvingly.

                                  GUERIN
                            (re: lab)
                    We have all the equipment we need - it'll 
                    take about two weeks to produce enough 
                    bacteria to spray L.A. County.

                                  BRYANT
                    You've done a good job, Mark. For the first 
                    time in six years, I feel like there's 
                    hope.
                            (beat)
                    Soon, we'll look back on the Newcomers as 
                    if they were just a bad dream.
                            (beat)
                    Good night.

      She turns to exit. Her bodyguard follows her out.

      GUERIN holds up the test tube, examining it in the light. 
      CAMERA PUSHES IN on the murky liquid as we:

                                                                              FADE OUT


                                        THE END
