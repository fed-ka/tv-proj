Very busy.
A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
quickly and efficiently.
No small talk.
A CLERK
Older than the others, sad-eyed,
adds a sheet of paper to a large
pile in his out-box.
CLOSE SHOT
An outgoing telegram.
It reads:
"We regret to inform you...killed in
action...heroic service..."
This is
the paperwork of death.
THE CLERK
Pulls out a file.
Reads.
Finds
something troubling.
Quickly shuffles
through some other papers.
Finds
what he's looking for.
Rises from
his desk and hurries out of the
office.
Seen through the glass wall.
The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
office with the clerk on his heels.
Again, seen through a glass wall.
The Young Lieutenant speaks
to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
bothered by what he's being told.
The Captain takes the
papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.
A busy office.
Aides and secretaries scurry about.
The
walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
deployment charts.
A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.
He clearly
hasn't slept in a long time.
The Young Captain, his staff
officer, walks in.
Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
about.
One-armed colonel Yes?
Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.
One at Omaha
Beach, the other at Utah.
Last week in Guam a third brother
was killed in action.
All three telegrams went out this
morning.
Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
this afternoon.
The life drains from the Colonel.
Others in the room hear
and freeze.
One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.
Young captain There's more.
There's a fourth brother.
The
youngest.
He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
Airborne the night before the invasion.
He's on the front.
One-armed colonel Is he alive?
Young captain We don't know.
The Colonel regains his bearings.
Stands and motions curtly
to the Captain.
One-armed colonel Come with me.
The Colonel regains his bearings.
Stands and motions curtly
to the Captain.
One-armed colonel Come with me.
The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
heels.
The aides and secretaries watch them go.
Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.
Half-
a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
the Young Captain, wait.
General Marshall puts down the
file.
GENERAL MARSHALL
(softly)
Goddamn it.
One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
brothers died on the Juneau.
GENERAL MARSHALL
Any contact with the fourth brother,
James?
One-armed colonel No, sir.
He was dropped about thirty miles
inland, near Ramelle.
That's still deep behind German lines.
General Marshall hardens.
GENERAL MARSHALL
Well, if he's alive, we're going to
send someone to get him the hell out
of there.
That's just what the
General's staff wanted to hear.
Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
continue through the scene.
Miller salutes a Major.
MILLER
Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.
Major Go on in.
Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
Very busy.
A field map dominates the center of the small
space.
The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
respectfully.
He's clearly someone special.
COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
the storm.
He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.
COLONEL ANDERSON
(into field-phone)
...I understand your problem, but if
we don't get those tanks off-loaded
by 0600, we're going to have an entire
division up at Caen with its ass
hanging out of its pants...
A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
paper.
Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.
MILLER
My what?
Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
action.
Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.
MILLER
Find a chaplain.
COLONEL ANDERSON
(into field-phone)
...alright, let me know when.
Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Have the Second and Third Regiments
hold at St. Michel until we get those
tanks.
Aide Yes, sir.
Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Report.
MILLER
Sector four is secured, we put out
the last three German one-fifty-fives,
found them about two miles in from
Ponte du Hoc.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Resistance?
MILLER
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
them over to intelligence.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Casualties?
MILLER
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.
MILLER
They didn't want to give up those
one-fifty-fives, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON
It was a hard assignment, that's why
you got it.
MILLER
Yes, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Where are your men now?
MILLER
Pinned down, a mile east of here,
waiting for some help from the navy
guns.
COLONEL ANDERSON
I'm sending Simpson to take over for
you, the division is going to Caen,
you're not coming with us, I have
something else for you.
MILLER
Sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON
There's a Private James Ryan who
parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
First near Ramelle.
I want you to
take a squad up there.
If he's alive,
bring him back to the beach for
debarkation.
Take whoever you need,
you've got your pick of the company.
MILLER
A private, sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON
He's the last of four brothers, the
other three were killed in action.
This is straight from the Chief of
Staff.
MILLER
But, sir...I...I...
COLONEL ANDERSON
Spit it out, Captain.
MILLER HESITATES, THEN:
MILLER
Respectfully, sir, sending men all
the way up to Ramelle to save one
private doesn't make a fucking,
goddamned bit of sense.
(beat)
Sir.
The other officers freeze, listening without turning.
Colonel
Anderson glares at Miller.
COLONEL ANDERSON
You think just because you hold the
Congressional Medal of Honor, you
can say any damn thing you please to
your superior officers?
Miller considers the question, then smiles.
MILLER
Yes, sir, more or less.
Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
off, then he smiles, too.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Alright, I'll give you that.
Continue.
MILLER
The numbers don't make sense, sir.
His brothers are dead, that's too
bad, but they're out of the equation.
Sending men up there is bleeding
heart crapola from three thousand
miles away.
One private is simply
not worth a squad.
Colonel anderson
This one is.
He's worth a lot more
than that.
Which is why I'm sending
you, you're the best field officer
there is.
Miller Shrugs.
MILLER
Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
Fine officer, regular church goer,
writes poetry, he might like a mission
like this.
(beat)
And he's taller than me.
Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
time to get back to business.
COLONEL ANDERSON
That's enough, Captain, you have
your orders.
Major Thomas will fill
you in.
Miller knows when to back off.
He salutes.
MILLER
Yes, sir.
Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.
COLONEL ANDERSON
Good luck, John.
MILLER
Thank you, sir.
Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
the other officers in the tent watching.
A glare and they
go back to work.
Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
white, taut-lined tent.
A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
and CHATTERING men move out around them.
DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.
Miller hops out.
MILLER
Wait here.
He strides into the tent.
Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
nerds the day before finals.
They're breaking down and
gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.
Tedious,
detailed work.
One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
glasses.
He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
Miller strides in.
Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.
Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.
Upham Sir, I'm Upham.
MILLER
I understand you speak French and
German.
Upham Yes, sir.
MILLER
Do you have an accent?
Upham A slight one in French.
My German is clean.
It has a
touch of the Bavarian.
MILLER
Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
we're going to Ramelle.
Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.
Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.
MILLER
That's my understanding.
Upham Lots of them.
MILLER
Do you have a problem with that,
Corporal?
Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.
I make maps.
I
translate.
MILLER
I need a translator, all mine have
been killed.
Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.
MILLER
It'll come back to you.
Get your
gear.
Upham hesitates.
Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?
Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.
Upham I'm writing a book and I...
Miller's expression gives him his answer.
Upham Uh, how about a pencil?
MILLER
A small one.
Miller shoos him off.
MILLER
Go, go...
Upham scurries away.
Miller sighs.
Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
others in the back of the jeep.
As they drive off, the CAMERA
CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
in military history.
The scope of the operation is stunning.
The beach is covered
with mountains of supplies.
A steady stream of vehicles
winds up the dunes.
Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.
Off-
shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
swarming over it like ants.
Beyond that, thousands of ships
and boats of every type and description.
The smoke of
hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.
EXPLOSIONS, some
distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.
It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.
Miller and his tiny
band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
bulk of the American Army behind.
Ext. french road - day
Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
infantrymen moving forward.
The sides of the road are
littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
equipment, bodies.
Sarge drives.
Miller reads a map.
Upham, cradling a pristine
M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.
Jackson and Wade calmly
take in the view.
Reiben checks out the close quarters in
the back of the jeep.
REIBEN
Captain, can I ask you a question?
MILLER
Sure, Reiben.
REIBEN
Where are you planning on putting
Private Ryan, sir?
Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.
REIBEN
(continuing)
It's just that it's kind of crowded
back here, I was wondering if you're
expecting to have more room on the
way back?
Miller points out a turn to Sarge.
MILLER
Left.
Sarge makes the turn.
Miller folds up the map and pockets
it.
MILLER
Now we've got a straight shot, due
north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
two villages between here and there,
St. Mere, then Bernay.
We'll take
the jeep as far as we can, then go
on on foot.
SARGE
We in radio contact with anybody up
there?
MILLER
Somebody put the wrong crystals in
every one of the Hundred-and-First's
radios the night before the drop,
not one of them works.
We're going
in blind.
REIBEN
I usually like surprises.
SARGE
What are we likely to run into?
MILLER
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
drops were completely fouled up,
we've got little pockets of
paratroopers all over the place,
trying to hang on.
Command says we
hold St. Mere, but north of that,
it's all Krauts.
Even if Ryan's
where he's supposed to be, he's more
than likely dead.
SARGE
Hell of a mission.
MILLER
Yep, hell of a mission.
IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP
Upham avidly takes in everything.
He notices Reiben staring
at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
smile.
Upham Hi.
So, uh, you're all Rangers?
Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
insect.
Upham I'm Upham.
(pointing at his corporal's stripes)
Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
Their jaws drop.
REIBEN
(to Wade)
You want to shoot him, or should I?
Wade It's not my turn.
REIBEN
(politely)
Jackson?
JACKSON
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.
Upham Miller?
MILLER
I don't want anybody to shoot him,
that's an order.
He speaks French
and his German has a touch of the
Bavarian.
Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?
Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.
UPHAM
(continuing)
...who won the Congressional Medal
of Hon...?
Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
of Miller's men.
Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
faced.
No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
if it had never happened.
REIBEN
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
of this mission is fucking killing
me.
MILLER
Yeah, how so?
REIBEN
I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
of the greatest composers ever lived
and he goes deaf.
Go figure, I mean,
who'd he piss off?
And here I am,
the Beethoven of ladies foundation
garments, one step away from Caen,
the center of the known lingerie
universe and instead, I'm going to
Ramelle to save some fucking private
who's probably already dead.
MILLER
There's to be a bright side, look
for it.
REIBEN
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
for?
Cheese.
The rest of the company
is going to Caen and we're going to
the goddamned cheese capital of
France.
There is no bright side.
MILLER
There's always a bright side.
REIBEN
I'm listening, sir.
MILLER
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Wade pipes up cheerfully.
Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
something up there for me to blow up.
REIBEN
Well, you're a happy idiot.
THEY ROUND A TURN
SKID TO A STOP AT A:
BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES
A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.
Miller calls to him.
MILLER
How's the road up to St. Mere?
Lieutenant Bad, sir.
There're some eighty-eights hiding
somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.
MILLER
Anybody getting through?
Lieutenant The lucky ones.
Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.
They take off, spraying
gravel behind them.
Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
down the road, fast.
The road is pock-marked with craters.
They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.
Direct
hits.
Sarge swerves around them without slowing.
AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS
On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
a dozen American troops.
It's a nightmare vision.
Upham
grows weak at the sight.
Miller takes note of Upham's
reaction.
IN THE BACK
The men bounce up and down like
stuffed animals, doing their best to
not be thrown out.
REIBEN
Hell, this is better than Coney
Island!
A HUGE BUMP
Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
down on his shovel.
He HOLLERS IN
PAIN.
MILLER
Just trying to make room for Ryan.
Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
shovel from under his bruised ass.
THEY ROUND A BEND
See a long, straight stretch of road.
Half-a-dozen burning,
obliterated American vehicles.
A gauntlet to run.
AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN
Lands right behind them.
BLOWS A NEW CRATER
MILLER
(sweetly)
Sarge?
SARGE FLOORS IT.
Everyone hangs on.
ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
Thirty yards ahead of them.
MILLER
Directs Sarge off the road.
MILLER
They've got the road zeroed.
SARGE
Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
off the road.
THE JEEP BOUNCES
Off the shoulder.
Nearly throwing
everyone out.
Somehow they hang on.
The jeep tears along the rutted field.
ANOTHER EXPLOSION
Just behind them.
SARGE DRIVES MADLY
Not slowing down.
Trying to avoid
the biggest ruts and bumps.
ANOTHER EXPLOSION
Close on their side.
Showers them
with debris.
SARGE
Jesus Christ!
MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN
Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.
MILLER
They've got a hell of a spotter
somewhere.
ANOTHER EXPLOSION
Even closer.
The jeep's PEPPERED
WITH SHRAPNEL.
They BARREL THROUGH
the smoke.
MILLER
S-curves, Sarge.
SARGE
Turns shallow curves without slowing
down.
SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER
Tries to avoid it.
Too late.
Brakes.
PLOWS into overturned
earth.
STOPS SHORT.
REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON
THROWN from the jeep.
TUMBLE into the dirt.
Not hurt.
SARGE AND MILLER
Hang on.
Stay in the jeep but are
battered.
All stunned.
MILLER Is
first to regain his bearings.
Jumps
up.
Checks out the jeep.
Undamaged.
Deep in the soft dirt.
AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT
MILLER
Sarge!
Reverse!
Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
The wheels spin.
Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
Yells to the others.
MILLER
COME ON!
YOU WANNA WALK?
STILL DAZED
Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
their heads back on.
Shoulder into
the jeep.
Push for all they're worth.
The WHEELS STILL SPIN.
ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT
MILLER IGNORES IT
He's the only one who does.
SARGE
Captain, they got us zeroed.
Upham is very nervous.
UPHAM
That's bracketing, right?
They all ignore him.
UPHAM
I know about bracketing.
I read
about it.
The next one is going to
land right on us.
MILLER
FORWARD!
FORWARD!
(beat)
NOW REVERSE!
Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.
Rocks it.
SLAMS IT BACK
INTO FORWARD.
Makes progress.
ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.
WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.
SARGE
Uh, Captain...
MILLER
PUSH!
SARGE
Uh, Captain...
THE TIRES SCREAM
A bit more progress.
It's almost
out.
THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS
Knowing the shell is coming any second.
Upham is beside
himself.
SARGE
(sweetly)
Oh, Captain...
ONE MORE PUSH
The jeep rocks back in, deeper.
MILLER
SHIT!
THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN
MILLER
GO!
THE MEN
Instantly take off.
Away from the
jeep.
As fast as they can.
THE SHELL SCREAMS IN
The men hit the dirt.
DIRECT HIT
OBLITERATING THE JEEP
THE MEN
Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
STUNNED by the concussion.
SHOWERED
with dirt, rock and debris.
MILLER
Is first up.
Sarge and the men
struggle to their feet.
Hear MORE
INCOMING.
Miller grabs Upham by the
collar and pulls him up.
MILLER
HERE COME THE MORTARS!
THEY ALL TAKE OFF
Running as fast as they can.
THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN
The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.
But
there must be a dozen mortars firing.
The shells are almost
constant.
THE FIELD
The six Americans run madly, in zig-
zag patterns through the gauntlet of
MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.
BOOM
RUNNING, STUMBLING
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM
UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND
Miller yanks him up.
Half-drags him to the edge of the field.
THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES
Keep running.
Through the bushes and brambles.
Thirty yards
in.
THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.
Struggling
to catch their breath. Check their
body parts.
Everything's there.
They have their weapons, most of
their gear.
Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
nothing more than a burning carcass.
He shakes his head.
REIBEN
General Gavin is going to be very
irritated at you, Captain.
MILLER
Stands on the edge of the woods,
almost in a trance.
UPHAM
Captain, I...
SARGE
Sssssh!
Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
position to position.
MILLER
Sarge, maps.
Sarge quickly opens up the map case.
The men are dead silent,
frozen in place.
MILLER
Two eighty-eights, just under two-
and-a-half miles, that way, vector
from the jeep, through those two
trees at the base of the hill.
The
mortars came from behind that rise,
there, four of them.
Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.
Miller snaps out
of it.
MILLER
Wade, the radio.
Wade instantly starts cranking it up.
Upham is amazed.
UPHAM
You can tell all that, just by the
sound, sire?
MILLER
That's not all.
There were nine
gunners on the eighty-eights, one
had a broken heel on his boot, two
had bratwurst for supper last night,
one of them is named Fritz, the other,
Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
to tell.
JACKSON
Corporal, you have just seen one of
Captain Miller's many God-given
talents.
If, by some miracle, you
survive, you will witness many more
of them.
Sarge finished vectoring.
SARGE
Got it, sir.
We gonna go take care
of those eighty-eights?
MILLER
That's not what we're here for.
WADE
(re. radio)
I've got command, Captain.
Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.
MILLER
(into radio)
This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
three by baker-three.
Two eighty-
eights.
Tell our boys to come in
low from the east in case the Krauts
have ack-ack.
Good hunting.
Over.
A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.
Wade
packs up the radio.
Miller folds up the map.
Jackson Sir,
wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.
SARGE
He's right, Captain, it might be
kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
MILLER
Tell that to Private James Ryan.
We've got our orders.
Let's go.
Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.
The rest
of the men don't like it, but they follow.
Upham trails,
amazed at Miller.
Within sight of the bridge.
Sarge carefully plants a wire-
triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.
He
sets the wire, then carefully backs away.
