    A PLANE LANDS at McCarran.  TOURISTS flood the Strip.



  The TRAM moves across the elevated tracks running parallel
  to Las Vegas Boulevard, enters the Palermo station.



  -- The BOY and MOM now on Fremont.  This is precocious EMMETT
  DRAKE and his mom NANCY DRAKE (30's, Midwestern).  Emmett*
    rushes over to a VENDOR, dressed as a showgirl selling
    everything under the sun, including baseball caps.  

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                        (re: one ballcap)
                  Look, Mom.  Secret Seal!*

                                  NANCY DRAKE*
                  Who's Secret Seal?*

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                  He's a seal but he knows everyone's*
                  secrets.  *

                                  NANCY DRAKE*
                How much?

  Nancy smiles, sets down her pink lemonade cup as she digs
  into her purse for money.  We MOVE OVER her cup, MOVE INTO
  the bright pink...  

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:



  ... then PULL BACK off the pink TO REVEAL we're looking at a
  pink Taurus .32 auto gun.  WIDER, we see it's in the hands
  of a tank-topped HOT YOUNG WOMAN.  

  Next over is BOB MUNDLER (40's, our man in the COWBOY HAT).*
  He blasts a 9mm Beretta.  Intense, focused and a little odd. 
    Perhaps Mundler's thinking about killing a man.  He smiles.*

  -- the Tram moves from the Palermo to the Mediterranean.



  ANGLE ON a MALE BODY (20's) lying on the ground.  Plaid shirt,
    boots, jeans.  Sara stands over the D.B., studying the*
    injuries as...  Greg splits off from an ND CORONER, Sheriff's*
    DEPUTY nearby.  He crosses to Sara -- *

                                  GREG
                  Camper found him.  No ID.  

  As Sara takes a knee, Greg gives her a look --*

                                  GREG
                You as happy as I am to be off that
                  tram?

                                  SARA
                  Give the guy a break.  It's only*
                  been a month.  *

                                  GREG
                  Don't you think he's a little out*
                  there?  *
                          (conspiratorial)*
                  I mean, the guy grew up on a commune. *
                His parents were like... hippies*
                  before there were hippies.  They*
                  lived in a van! --   *

                                  SARA*
                -- And?*

                                  GREG
                He was 'van-schooled'.  It's weird. *
                The whole thing is weird.*
                        (as if to prove it)*
                  Yesterday, he put on a murder vic's
                  watch, kept asking me for the time. *
                So I'm like, "Hey Fitch, what time*
                is it?"  Then he'd just look at the
                  watch and not say anything.  Over
                and over. 

                                  SARA
                  He's trying to get inside the POV
                of the victim, Greg.  *

                                  GREG*
                  Isn't the evidence supposed to do*
                  that?*

                                  SARA*
                  Dude, his evidence caught the Gig*
                  Harbor Killer. *

  Greg nods, fair enough.  Sara turns to inspect the Vic.*

                                  SARA
                No sign of animal activity.  *

                                  GREG
                  Coroner said he found a puncture
                  wound in his belly.
                          (looking around)
                So where's the blood?

                                  SARA
                  Could be a knife and dump.

  Sara gently pulls open the unbuttoned shirt. It falls away,
    revealing - the severely wrinkled torso of a 90-year-old
  man.  Greg and Sara are momentarily speechless.  Then --

                                  GREG
                -- That's some unfortunate man-boob.

                                  SARA
                  Face of a Jonas Brother, body of my
                  Grampa Pete. 
                        (eyes shirt)
                  Shirt's stretched out, incremental tears. 
                All buttons missing except one.  

                                                                        SNAP ZOOM TO:  CSI: "73 Seconds" - 1201 - WHITE - 7/19/1115.


27ECU - ON THE SHIRT27

    A two-hole white bone button remains, hanging by threads.

                                  GREG
                  Ripped off during a scuffle?

                                  SARA
                Or the second time he was moved.

  OFF Greg's look... Sara stands, follows faint drag marks in
  the dirt.

                                  SARA
                  Body was dragged from... here.

  Sara looks up at Greg.  Looks around, doing the math...

                                  SARA
                  County line's about thirty feet
                  that way.  

  Sara eyes the Deputy and the Coroner, who swap a busted look. 

                                  SARA
                          (sotto, to Greg)
                  Lazy bastards.

  She waves over to the Deputy and Coroner --

                                  SARA
                  Thanks, guys.





    Fitch, Nick, Emmett and a FEMALE UNI walk down the platform*
    toward the casino, the tram in the BG.  Emmett slows his
  pace, looks down at the floor, stops walking.  

                                    FITCH*
                You okay?

    Emmett won't look at him, takes a deep breath.

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                  I did something bad when I was going
                to the train.

                                    FITCH*
                I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                  Some money fell out of a man's
                  pocket.  It was on the floor.  I
                  took it.

    Emmett takes off his cap, fidgets with it.

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                Can we look for him and give it
                  back?

                                  NICK
                Do you still have the money?

    Emmett nods yes, digs into an inside panel of his cap.  He
  hands Fitch a folded, crisp 100 dollar bill - it's spotted*
  with DRIED BLOOD.  

  Nick and Fitch look at each other.  *

                                  NICK
                Did this belong to the man in the
                  51's jacket?

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                No.  He was smaller.  

    Emmett watches as Nick bags his hundred dollars.  Fitch*
    notices this, and --

                                    FITCH*
                  Emmett, people who help the police
                get a reward.  So you're going to*
                get a nice, new hundred dollar bill. *
                And Nick here is going to spring*
                for an ice cream.  

  Nick shoots Fitch a look, then hands a ten dollar bill to*
  the Uni, who takes a beaming Emmett by the hand, leads him*
  off.  

                                    FITCH*
                        (re: bindled bill)*
                If this is Tom's blood, he was*
                  stabbed before he got on the tram.  *

                                  NICK
                He couldn't have been stabbed on
                the platform or in the casino, or
                we would've seen it on surveillance.

  Fitch looks around.  Sees the rest rooms down the way.*

                I'm guessing they don't have
                    surveillance in bathrooms.
