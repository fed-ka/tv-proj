      Damascus, Early 2003


      Oliver Mace and Muhammed Khordad - leader of an powerful 
      Pakistani terror group - The Path of Light - sit on either 
      side of a small table.  Mace wears a Western suit.  Khordad, 
      is in simple robes.

      They are in a small roof garden on top of tower block in the 
      Syrian capital.

      Khordad points to a small row of catci in a tray near them. 
      He speaks in Urdu.


                                    KHORDAD
                          (subtitled)

                    You know this plant has been known 
                    to survive in sand measured at 
                    80 C. It has no known predator.


      Mace watches him.  He resumes in English.


                                    KHORDAD
                    Early in  97, I was told that there 
                    was a traitor in my organisation - 
                    but by the time I uncovered him, it 
                    was already too late -  he had 
                    already been ... spirited away.

      He looks over at Mace.


                                    KHORDAD
                    And I assume you and the Americans 
                    are still looking after him.  The 
                    witness protection scheme or 
                    whatever misnomer you give it.

      Mace doesn t react but he knows what s coming.


                                    KHORDAD
                    This man is the price of our co-
                      operation.

      Mace shakes his head. 


                                  MACE
                    That s not going to be possible. 
                    Why on earth do you think we would 

                    betray an old friend like that?

                                    KHORDAD
                    Because I m your new friend and am 

                    now more important to you than the 
                    old one. 


      The picture suddenly FREEZES into a BLACK AND WHITE still of 
      the two of them - taken from high above.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      Danny walks Harakat down the corridor out of the hospital.
                                                                                              **

                                  DANNY
                      A safehouse.  Where we can keep an 
                    eye on you.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Will it be you ... ?

                    Some of the time ... I ll be doing

                                    HARAKAT
                    And I can go home when?

                                  DANNY
                      Truthfully?

      Harakat laughs at this.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Danny, you work for British 
                      intelligence, that s the last thing 
                    I expect.

                                    HARAKAT
                    What is it that s written at C.I.A 
                      headquarters ... isn t there a 
                    motto?

                                  DANNY
                     You shall know the truth and the 
                    truth shall set you free. 

                                    HARAKAT
                    So then - when do you set me free?

      Danny looks at him.

                                    HARAKAT
                    This isn t going to be over soon is 
                    it?

                                    HARAKAT
                    Will you do something for me?

                                  DANNY
                    Sure.

                                    HARAKAT
                    If I give you a list of books would 
                    you collect them from my shop for 
                    me?

                                  DANNY
                    OK.

                                    HARAKAT
                    And if there s anything you fancy - 
                    help yourself. 

      Danny laughs.

                                  DANNY
                    Thanks, I think there are probably 
                    rules about no freebies.  There are 
                    about most things.

                    Ah.  I can see that there s a lot 
                    about this that I don t understand.

                                  	ZOE
                    It becomes instinctive.  There are 
                    certain things you can do to make 
                    sure ...

                    Like going twice around a

      Zoe laughs.  They get out of the car.

      Waiting up the road for a fare is a SMALL MOUSTACHED CABBIE. 
      His on board computer doubles as an intel image receiver.  On

      is matching them to all the people in the street.

      BIG RON - their legendary last line of defence.

      Adam s team head past on beside his cab.  Big Ron munching on 
      a sausage sandwich sifts through the rest of the street - his 
      practised eye looking for likely candidates.  Then he spots

      She stands, pausing for a moment.

                    The reason I m here ... why I 
                    passed on the photograph ... is 
                    because I disapprove of what s 
                    going on.  This is being done more 
                    for the Corporations more than for 
                    anyone else.  Their hold over our 
                    foreign policy grows by the hour. 
                    It s not something I approve of. 
                    You need to go.

      But in that moment she s the one who is gone.  As if she was 
      never there.

      Adam reaches for his phone until he remembers it won t work 
      here.


      And there are TWO MEN IN DARK COATS heading up one of the 
      paths towards him.  A WOMAN with a camera sitting on a bench. 
      Could be something.  Could be nothing.

      He gets up and heads off.

                    Danny after this, there s something 
                    important I have to tell you.

                                  DANNY

      Harry, waiting on a street corner, has just heard.  He takes 
      his ear piece out and stops still.
                                                                                              *

      On the bridge midway between the two agencies, Oliver Mace 
      and Harry stand looking over the river.

                    Do you know how Harakat behaved 
                    when he worked for them? Before he 
                    got a conscience and came over to 
                                                                                              *

                    Not much there was.

      A boat passes beneath them.  The light is beginning to go.

                    We had taken on a responsibility to 
                    protect Harakat.  We made a deal. 
                    If we so disapproved of him then 
                    you shouldn t have been in business 
                    with him in the first place.

                                  MACE
                                  (MORE)
                    The deal with him was superseded by 
                    another.  We gave Khordad our word 
                    as well.

      He shrugs.

                                  MACE
                    Just wait and see - who s to say 
                    that Harakat s life isn t worth all 
                    the lives that will be saved by 
                      befriending the new-improved 
                    Khordad? 

      Harry walks for a while in silence.

                                  MACE
                    If you re asking me - is there at 
                    present anything we shouldn t do to 
                    achieve our ends? Then frankly I 
                    don t know. Post 9/11 we made a 
                                                                                              *

                    don t, can t, say anymore,  This we

                    better than we do.  In the long 
                    term it ll be proved the right 
                    strategy.

                                  HARRY
                    Who s long term are we talking 
                    about?

                                   MACE
                    Harry, before you get on your hobby 
                    horse, think about this: do you 
                    think we did this alone, without 
                    help from Langley?

                                  HARRY
                    And that justifies it?  Part of the 
                    reason for all this trouble stems 
                    from the fact that most Americans 
                    believe anywhere East of the Hudson 
                    is like those blank spaces on 
                    medieval maps, where they drew in a 
                    monster and wrote  Here Be
