  Peter watches his electric bug zapper as mosquitos fly into 
  it and meet a quick, sizzling death. He's eating a piece of 
  pie with a fork.

                                  PETER

                Heh. Stupid mosquitos. (THEN) Wonder 

                what that feels like.

  Peter notices a nearby electrical outlet. He looks at his 
  fork.

  As Peter walks toward the outlet with his fork, MEG runs up 
  sobbing.

                                  PETER (CONT D)

                Meg, you're home late.

                                  MEG

                I stayed after school to try out for 

                  cheerleading!

  A beat. Meg continues sobbing.

                                  PETER

                Well, don't keep me in suspense. How'd 

                you do?

                                  MEG

                I'll give you a hint. I (AS A FAKE 

                CHEER) S-U-C-K-E-D. Rah! I hate high 

                school. I just can't find a group I 

                fit in with.

                                  PETER

                Boy, do I know that feeling.


  The JETS of "West Side Story" are snapping their fingers as 
  they dance through an alley (to jazzy, cheap, sound-alike 
  Bernstein music). Peter follows, trying to blend in.

                                  RIFF

                (TO PETER) Uh, okay man, you are 

                really throwing me off. It's step-kick-

                  step-twirl. Got it?

                                  PETER

                top, people! (TO PETER) Why don't you 

                just hang back and stretch?

  Peter looks disappointed.


                                  MEG

                I don't get it. The harder I try to 

                make friends, the more people hate me.

                                  PETER

                Listen, Meg, you're a one of a kind, 

                special girl with a mind of her own. 

                Now see, people hate that. You want 

                friends, ya gotta blend in.

                                  MEG

                But Mom keeps saying I should just be 

                myself.

                                  PETER

                Aw, that's the worst thing you can do. 

                I'm tellin  ya, just be the girl you 

                think everyone else wants you to be.

                                  MEG

                Wow, it s so obvious. Thanks, Daddy!

  She gives him a kiss and runs into the house as Lois comes 
  outside.

                                  MEG (CONT D)

                (TO PETER) Well, I haven't seen Meg 

                this happy since that bus broke down 

                in front of our house.


  Peter and Meg are on the porch as a bus with the words 
  "HANSON - NATIONAL TOUR" rolls to a stop in front of the 
  Griffins' home. (The radiator of the bus emits steam.) Meg 
  stands up, overjoyed. The three blonde mop-topped HANSON BOYS 
  get out.

                                  HANSON KID

                Hi, can we use your phone?

                Holy crap, it's the Children of the 

                Corn!

  Peter grabs a rifle and starts firing at them.


                                  PETER

                We just had a little father/daughter 

                talk.

                Well, it seems to have worked.

  He raises his overshirt, revealing a t-shirt that says, "#1

                Oh, Peter, they're growin' up so fast. 

                This could be our last first birthday 

                ever. You know, when Meg and Chris 

                turned one, I was so busy with the 

                  decorations and the games and the 

                cake, I feel like I missed everything.





  Meg is at her open locker. She sees a gaggle of CHEERLEADERS 
  pass her by.

                                    CHEERLEADER #1

                Boy, it sure is great being thin and 

                popular.

                up with.

  Meg slams the door to her locker, revealing JENNIFER, a 
  pretty girl with very short hair.

  Peter is heading toward his car as CLEVELAND and QUAGMIRE 
  pull up in Quagmire's 1956 Buick Convertible.

                Lois has her heart set on the place. 

                Besides, she told me they're givin' us

                But that was a very sophisticated 

                scam.

  CLOSE ON A XEROXED SIGN -- It's a picture of a cat and it 
  reads, "Missing. $100 Reward!" Peter takes the sign and 
  studies the picture. He enters into:



  Some WORKMEN are finishing setting up a party tent. Peter, 
  Quagmire and Cleveland look on, drinking beers.

                You ain't seen nothin' yet. Here comes 

                the petting zoo.

  A huge ark on a boat trailer pulls up to the curb. A grey, 
  bearded MAN in a long white robe (with a dove perched on his 
  shoulder) looks over the side.

  Lois starts to cry and runs into the house. Peter calls after 
  her.

                                  PETER

                What s wrong? It s the ice sculpture, 

                isn't it. Too anatomically correct.

  Brian brings Peter a beer.

                                  BRIAN

                Peter, I think she's upset because 

                Meg's not here.

                                  PETER

                What's the big deal? It's not like she 

                won't be back.

                                                              FLIP TO:



  The party is underway. Parents are there with other babies. 
  Stewie, in his birthday sailor suit, watches the merriment 
  with disdain. Chris runs over with some ice cream.

                                  CHRIS

                Hey, Stewie, you want some coffee ice 

                cream? It ll give you a buzz.

                                  STEWIE

                (GETTING RID OF HIM) Look! A moo cow!

                                  CHRIS

                (LOOKING O.S.) Cool!

  Chris runs off. Stewie goes back to eyeing the crowd with 
    suspicion.


  Stewie examines the crowd with high-tech field glasses.

                                  STEWIE

                None of these blithering idiots could 

                possibly be capable of returning me to 

                the womb.

  He lowers the field glasses.FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       41.                         


                                  STEWIE (CONT D)

                If only I knew his countenance! The 

                answer must be in the memory of my 

                escape.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:


  Stewie snaps out of his reverie.

                                  STEWIE 

                The Man in White! Of course. That 

                cervical warden failed to thwart my 

                escape into the outside world. Now, on 

                the anniversary of his blunder, he's 

                  returning to rectify his mistake and 

                put me back in the womb! But I shall 

                be prepared.



  Accompanied by cheezy Vegas music, DAVID COPPERFIELD has 
  Cleveland in a vertical box. He appears to be inserting 
  sheets of metal right through Cleveland's body! The PARENTS 
  watch, entertained.

  ANGLE ON QUAGMIRE, talking to an attractive SINGLE MOM.

                                  QUAGMIRE

                I got a trick for you. Write your 

                phone number on this piece of paper.

  She does.

                                  QUAGMIRE (CONT'D)

                Now don't tell me what it is. Just put 

                it in my pocket. (AS SHE DOES SO) All 

                  riiiiight.

  ANGLE ON CLEVELAND, whose head (still in a box) is now 
  detached from his body and being held aloft by Copperfield.

                                  CLEVELAND

                Mr. Copperfield, you are truly the 

                master of prestidigitation.

  Peter runs over.

                                  PETER

                  Cleveland, I gotta find Meg. You gotta 

                take me to that party she's at!

                                  CLEVELAND 

                Peter, I'm in no condition to drive. 

                I've had three beers. Besides, a man 

                can't leave his own son's birthday

                                  PETER

                Aw, he won't even notice I m gone. 

                He's playing with his little friends.

  PAN TO Stewie, surrounded by other one year olds in diapers. 
  He paces up and down before them like a general addressing 
  his troops.

                                  STEWIE

                 The hour of reckoning is at hand. The 

                Man in White is coming for me. You 

                could be next. And you!

  The children look at him, cluelessly. One of them falls over.

                                  STEWIE (CONT'D)

                But today I offer you the opportunity 

                to join with me in glorious battle. I 

                know there are some amongst you whose 

                motor skills are not yet developed. 

                Sadly, you will be used as decoys. But 

                your children's children will know 

                that you fell for a noble cause. Now, 

                who's with me?

  They stare at Stewie. One of them smiles.

                                  INFANT

                  (HAPPILY) Ducky?

                                  STEWIE

                Useless, everyone of you! Fine! I'll 

                defend myself and the rest of you can 

                rot in hell! (BEAT; AGGRAVATED SIGH) 

                There, I ve gone and soiled myself.

  Peter is on the doorstep. He calls back to the open door.FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       51.                         


                                  PETER

                Come on, kids, pile into the car. 

                We've got a party to go to.

  Peter waits for a beat. From inside, we hear a loud thud. 
  Peter waits another beat.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)

                Okay. We'll take separate cars.


  The party is winding down. Lois looks around sadly.

                                  LOIS

                (SADLY) Well, I guess there's nothing 

                left but the birthday cake.

  Meg comes out of the house holding the cake.

                                  MEG

                One vanilla-fudge swirl with 

                  buttercream frosting, coming right up!

                                  LOIS

                Meg!

                                  MEG

                I'm sorry, Mom.

  Peter enters. Lois sees him.

                                  LOIS

                  (TOUCHED) Thank you, Peter.

                                  PETER

                No problem. (CHEERFULLY) Hey, now that 

                we're all here, what say we cut the 

                damn cake!

                                  LOIS

                Gather round, everyone, it's time for 

                Stewie's big moment.


  The Cult Leader knocks on the front door. The door slowly 
  swings open with a creak.

  He enters, tentatively.


  Lois is lighting a big candle on the cake.

                                  PETER

                Hey, anybody seen Stewie?

  From behind, we see the whole inside of the house light up 
  from the laser and hear a pshoooo sound.

                                  MEG

                Yeah, where's the birthday boy?

  Stewie comes swaggering out of the yard, brushing some dust 
  off his clothes.

                                  LOIS

                Yes, and this cake is yours, too, if 

                you blow out your candle.

                                  CHRIS

                Hey, Stewie, make a wish. If you blow 

                out the candle, it'll come true.

                                  PETER

                That s right, little buddy. What do 

                you want most in the whole world?

                                  STEWIE

                (RUBS HIS HANDS TOGETHER, EVILLY) All 

                right. (INHALES, THEN RECONSIDERS) Oh, 

                what the hell.

  He blows out the candle. There's a puff of smoke, and 
  suddenly the yard is filled with funkadelic music. As 
  everyone, including Stewie, starts doing the same funky 
  dance, we:

                                                              FADE OUT.
