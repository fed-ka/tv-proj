      FADE IN:

      INT. SANDS HOME. FOYER - DAY (D/1)11

      Early morning.  A grand turn-of-the-century Victorian high on 
      a hill in Pacific Heights, San Francisco.  A beautiful 
      combination of old and new; art and high-tech gadgets abound.  
      But tonight architectural charm has been compromised by a 
      break-in.  The place appears mostly intact, but BFS TECHS are 
      already at work collecting forensic evidence. 

      JANE, LISBON, and RIGSBY are escorted through the photo 
      covered foyer by SFPD INSPECTOR COLLEEN MULVEY, 30 s.

      ANGLE: Jane eyes assorted collectibles in the house -- an oil 
      painting, an antique vase, a new bag of golf clubs resting in 
      the corner.  Nothing taken.  

                                  LISBON
                    Mind running it for us, Inspector?

                                  MULVEY
                          (a tad sulky)
                    Not sure why you all were called 
                    in.  We could handle it.  Place 
                    belongs to Jason Sands.  Investment 
                    banker.  Big-ass political 
                      contributor.

                                  LISBON
                    That s why we were called in. 
                    Attorney General likes to stay on 
                    top of this kind of thing.  But 
                    hey, if you like political hot 
                    potatoes, I ll be happy to call the 
                    boss, tell him SFPD wants it. 

      Mulvey gives Lisbon a sardonic beat.

                                  MULVEY
                    Mister Sands  wife Jennifer comes 
                    home with their daughter about nine 
                    o clock last night.  She finds her 
                    husband gone.  And this...   

      Mulvey leads the CBI team into...         THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      2.


      INT. SANDS HOME. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS22

      Classic masculine decor -- leather seats, oak desk.  The room 
      is covered with President s Cup and sailing memorabilia.  
      Papers are strewn throughout, drawers open and things knocked 
      over.  A big bloodstain mars the carpet and a heavy chair is 
      tipped over.  

                                  MULVEY
                    There s been no ransom demand yet, 
                    but I expect we ll get something 
                    soon.  If you want our tech guys to 
                    set taps I got to let them know...   

                                  LISBON
                    That s okay.  We can handle it.  
                    Where s his family now?

                                  MULVEY
                    With friends.  Mrs. Sands thought 
                    it was best for the little girl and 
                    we agreed.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Any sign of forced entry?

                                  MULVEY
                    Nope.  Must have been a front door 
                    job.  Posing as a courier or what 
                    have you.  

      We re looking closer at the room now -- from Jane s POV:       
      Lying on the floor near the overturned chair is a SIMPLE 
      REMOTE CONTROL UNIT, WITH A 123 KEYPAD with bloody handprints 
      on it.   Jane s focus lands on one specific sheet of paper 
      wedged partially under a wall unit bookcase. 

                                  JANE 
                    He s still here.

                                  MULVEY
                          (eyeing his tag)
                    Uh, not unless he s invisible he s 
                    not, Agent Jane.   

                                  LISBON
                    He s not an agent.  He s a 
                      consultant.

                                  JANE
                    No badge no gun, they won t even 
                    give me a dental plan.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      2A.

      CONTINUED:22

      Mulvey looks at Jane, intrigued, but not in a good way.

                                  MULVEY
                    Oh.  Yeah.  You re the one they 
                    were telling me about... the 
                    psychic.

      CONTINUED: (2)22
                                  MULVEY (CONT'D)
                    Well I m sorry, Gandalf, but we did 
                    look around pretty good in our 
                    bumbling way.  He s not here.

                                  JANE
                    He s here.  And there s no such 
                    thing as psychics.  They tortured 
                    him in this chair...

      He tilts the chair back up.  It sits at the center of the 
        bloodstains, picks up the remote control unit... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    ...To give them a pass-code.

      Jane begins rapidly punching in the top ten pass-codes.  

                                  MULVEY 
                    Pass-code to what? 

      Jane points to the sheet of paper under the bookcase.

                                  JANE 
                    Would you humor me, Inspector 
                    Mulvey?  Would you try to pick up 
                    that sheet of paper? 

      Mulvey sees no reason not to, bends to pick it up, and the 
      paper tears in half, stuck under the bookcase.  Beat... as 
      everyone gathers the significance of that.

                                  MULVEY
                    The bookcase must have moved...

                                  LISBON
                    After these papers were scattered 
                    on the floor.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s a door.  To a safe?

                                  LISBON
                    Or a safe room.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  

      He s still tapping away at the keypad.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    The intruder must have been 
                      distracted by something.

                    Left Sands alone for a moment.  
                    Sands punches in the code and 
                    before they can stop him gets into 
                    the safe room, shuts the door 
                    behind him. 


                                  LISBON
                    Which will open if you press the 
                    buttons a lot.

                                  JANE 
                    I m entering the top ten pass-code 
                    choices.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    But, if there was a safe room, 
                    wouldn t it have a silent alarm? 
                    Connected to a security company?

                                  JANE
                    Not if you re the paranoid 
                    secretive type.  You make a safe 
                    room only you know about.    

      He s run thru his list of pass-codes.  Mulvey turns to a UNI.

                                  MULVEY 
                    Go call a locksmith.

                                  JANE 
                    Hang on a second, Inspector.  

      ANGLE -- Jane looks around the room -- PHOTOS of Sands  wife, 
      JENNIFER, and 7-year-old daughter, JULIE.  PHOTOS of Sands 
      with sailing buddies.  Trophies for sailboat races.  Multiple 
      PICTURES of the boats he s raced, their numbers prominently 
      displayed on their sails... 24, 44, 37.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (sing song)
                    Farewell and adieu to you fair 
                    Spanish maidens.

      He types in the corresponding digits on the sails and -- Clunk.  
      Doesn t work.  Keeps tapping in the numbers in various order...   

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Farewell and adieu to you ladies of

                    ...To sail back to Boston...

      And pushing the door open, Lisbon and Rigsby reveal a beaten 
      and bloody, JASON SANDS, 30 s, slumped on the floor in a big 
      pool of blood.  Very dead.  Mulvey crosses herself.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. YACHT CLUB. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY (D/2)33

      A bucolic garden setting with the marina in the b.g.  A 
      PHOTOGRAPH of Jason Sands rests on an easel surrounded by 
      flowers.  Family and friends have gathered to mourn Sands  
      passing.  JENNIFER SANDS, 30 s, dressed in black, forlorn but 
      naturally lovely, stands beside the photo trying her best to 
      receive well-wishers.  Young JULIE, 7, stands alongside 
      stoically, doll in hand.  Hovering nearby Jennifer is MICHAEL 
      BENNETT, 40 s, the family attorney, who appears equally 
      thrown by recent events.     

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, VAN PELT and Rigsby (in business attire)  
      observe the crowd from a slight distance. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    I look around, I don t see anyone 
                    here could torture a man to death 
                    with pliers and a lit cigar. 

                                  JANE
                    Picture them naked and ravenously 
                    hungry.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Eew.  

                                  CHO 
                    Strictly speaking he wasn t 
                    tortured to death.  He bled to 
                    death on his own in his hidey hole 
                    there.   

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Kind of almost has himself to 
                    blame, huh?

                                  CHO
                    Kind of.

                                  JANE 
                    How s the widow check out?

                                  LISBON 
                    Night of the murder she and the

                    Yup.

      Jane is watching Jennifer closely.  There s something going 
      on between Bennett and the widow, in whispers and looks and 
      gestures.  Hard to read though.      

                                  JANE

                    Michael Claymore Bennett the third.  
                    Sands  lawyer.

      Lisbon sees the predatory gleam in Jane s eye.

                                  LISBON
                    What about him?

                                  JANE
                    The widow s scared of him.  Or...

                    Or?

                                  JANE
                    Or they re having an affair and 
                    he s reassuring her about something 
                    else that she s scared of.

                    Which is it?

                                  JANE
                    Not sure.  Could be both.  

      Beat on the team clocking the widow closely.  Hmmm.

                    confess.  

      Lisbon exits.  Van Pelt follows.  Jane watches Rigsby 
      wistfully watch Van Pelt leave.  As soon as Lisbon s gone 
      Rigsby leads the way to THE BUFFET TABLE and they start 
      grazing....

                                  JANE
                    Can I ask you a personal question?

                                  RIGSBY
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Have you told her how you feel?

      Rigsby has a visceral dislike of talking about his feelings. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    She s a co-worker.  It s against 
                    the rules.  That s how I feel.

                                  JANE
                    That s not how you feel.

                    I sent out the vibes.  I got none

                    That s where he stares at the back 
                    of her neck for several hours.  
                    Women love that.

                    Meh, seduction is easy.  Once you 
                    grasp the basic principle.  There s 
                    nothing to it.    

                                  RIGSBY
                    Really.  I don t see a crowd of 
                    women following you around.

                                  JANE
                    Why would I want a crowd of women 
                    following me around?

      Jane is watching the Widow argue very discreetly with 
      Bennett.  Sees Bennett squeezes her hand a little tighter 
      than a lawyer squeezes a client s hand.  We can t tell 
      whether it s a gesture of passion or oppression.  But 
      Jennifer looks horribly sad for a moment, before putting on a  
      brave face again.  Or was that an angry face?  The situation 
      between them is ambivalent, but clearly charged with emotion.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Okay.  I ll bite.  What s the basic 
                      principle?

                                  JANE
                    Cost you a dollar.

                    For what?

                                  JANE
                    So you ll pay attention. 

      Rigsby hands him a dollar.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Love and affection.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Give me my dollar back.

                                  JANE
                    When you seduce someone, what are 
                    you offering?  Love and affection.  
                    Who doesn t want love and

                    Okay.  The widow.

      A big grin from Jane.

                    Watch me.  

      Jane hands Rigsby the bottle of water he s holding,and heads 
      right for the widow. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Wait a minute, what are you...

                    Jane, no... Jane!

      Too late.  Jane s in the receiving line.  He pats little 
      Julie on the head. 

                                  JANE
                    Hello, sweetheart.  

      Jane nods hello to Bennett, and takes Jennifer s hand.

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      She nods.  He gazes very intently at her for a long beat -- a 
      Daniel Day Lewis/Madeline Stowe kind of a deal -- until she 
      gets uncomfortable.

                                  JENNIFER

      flashlight.

                                  JANE 
                    --Back up.  Now.

      Bennett does as he s told, hurrying off to find security 
      guards.  Everyone s watching.  Jane switches off the glare 
      and turns his gaze back to Jennifer, who is transfixed. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      He lets go of her hand, turns and walks away as Rigsby and 
      Cho and a pair of blazered Security Guys converge on him.

      A man whose soft features and unkempt seventies mid-level 
      bureaucrat style contradict his position at CBI.  Minelli 
      must be damn good at his job because every other indicator 
      says he shouldn t be.

      Jane and Lisbon are taking the heat.  Lisbon is a martyr to 
      her authority figures.  Jane just lets Minelli roll off him 
      like water.

                                    MINELLI
                    I m disappointed I m very

                    How could you do this to me?  
                    I told the mayor of San Francisco 
                    I was putting my best people on 
                    this. 
                          (in annoyance)

                    Is this real or is it the decaf? 
                    How you meant to know which is 
                    which?

                    twice as much.  

      Minelli shrugs -- good idea -- and sets about doing as Jane 
      suggests.

                    What kind of idiot drinks decaf 
                    anyhow?  What s the point?
                    And what the hell were you thinking

                    No excuses.  I mistakenly treated

      Minelli s PHONE BEEPS.  He looks at it and frowns, answers

                    She wants to hear it in person.

      Jane sits on a toy chest, admiring an array of trolls that 
      Julie produces one by one from a special box, using her doll 
      as a silent co-worker.

      trying to be strong for her girl and smile through grief and

      Jennifer hands Jane a cup of tea.  Jane glances down to the 
      pool area where Julie is playing with the Nanny, making 
      bubbles.

                    No.  Maybe a little.  We need to 
                    talk to the lawyer, whatshisname.

                    You need to stay well away from 
                    him.  Did you say maybe a little?

                                  JANE
                    She s a gorgeous grieving widow.  
                    Of course maybe a little.  It s not 
                    going to effect my work.  I m a law

      Lisbon smiles at that.

      EXT. DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO - LATER THAT DAY1111

      The STATE CAPITAL looms in the distance.  Lisbon and Bennett 
      walk together. 

                                  LISBON
                    Thanks for meeting me. 

                                    BENNETT
                    No problem.  I was lunching with a  
                    couple of your deputy AGs. 

                                  LISBON
                    My sincere apologies for the 
                    behavior of our operative Jane by 
                    the way.  Unconscionable.  
                      Supervising Agent Minelli gave him 
                    a severe reprimand.

                                    BENNETT
                    Think nothing of it.  I can t tell 
                    you how sad I am about all this.
                    How can I help you?  

                                  LISBON 
                    I ll try and keep this brief.  
                    You re Sands  lawyer.  You must 
                    have known he was in ruinous debt.  

                                    BENNETT
                    I knew there were difficulties, 
                    yes.  But I had no idea he was in 
                    as deep as he was.  I don t deal 
                    with his business affairs.  I m his

                    I look after his personal financial 
                    matters, and those were in good 
                    shape, until very recently.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  Two weeks ago, he converted a 
                    ten million dollar pension fund to 
                    cash.  Pretty much all he had.

                                    BENNETT
                    As was his right.  I only learned 
                    of it from his accountants after 
                    the fact.  It was a large 
                      withdrawal, but of course, I 
                    thought he had much more in 
                    reserve.

                                  LISBON
                    Did you ask him what he was doing 
                    with the money?

                                    BENNETT
                    I did.  He said he needed it to 
                    surprise his wife. 

                                  LISBON
                    He did that alright.

                                    BENNETT
                      I believed him.  

                                  LISBON 
                    What do you believe now?

                                    BENNETT 
                    He was looking at jail time.  
                    I think he grabbed all the cash he 
                    could and he was going to run away. 

                                  LISBON
                    Who do you think stopped him?

      Bennett shrugs.

                                    BENNETT
                    You re the detectives.  You tell 
                    me. 

      Lisbon extends a handshake.

                    We found out where that money was

      Cho and Lisbon step inside the rear cabin of the luxury boat.   
      The place has been completely trashed by someone on a very

      Cho and Lisbon silently draw their weapons and using hand 
      signals, they split up to search the place.

      Jane stays quietly by the door, so quietly that ADRIANNA 
      JONOVIC -- a tough Serbian stripper-type, but classy -- slips 
      in next to him, small revolver in hand.  She only starts a 
      little when she sees Jane.

                    Jason bought ten million dollars of 
                    diamonds, for when we would run 
                    away.  I was looking for them. 

      Jane and Lisbon look at each other.  Ah ha.

                    A month ago.  Once he showed me 
                    them.  Beautiful.  Oh my God.  Then 
                    he hid them somewhere.  I don t

                    He was going to jail or be killed. 
                    So we make a plan.  We will run

                    It s a strong possibility.  

      Jennifer is cast down again.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Life is so complicated.

      Jennifer takes a long beat.

                                  LISBON
                    Let me guess.  She s leasing a high 
                    end vehicle and recently bought a 
                    nice house in Oakland. 

                                  CHO
                    You are good.

      INT. CAR/EXT. OAKLAND HOUSE - DAY2121

      Rigsby and Van Pelt sit in their car eyeing a big rundown 
      party house.  The lawn is brown.  A mint CADILLAC and 
      CORVETTE sit in the driveway.

      ANGLE -- A neighboring Mom tries to corral her Kids and get 
      them in the car.

      Rigsby and Van Pelt both wear Kevlar.  Van Pelt studies the 
      rap sheets of CARTER LEWIS and DIETER WEBB, both early 30 s, 
      sleazy white hipsters.  Rigsby looks around impatiently, 
      watches the Mom and her children across the way.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Where s the entry team?  They were 
                    supposed to be here twenty minutes 
                    ago.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Relax.  It s not even noon.  
                    Way too early for guys like these 
                    to be awake.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    They could be up from the night 
                    before.  They might go out for 
                      breakfast.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    We can deal with them.

                    Suddenly she s Steve McQueen. 

      Van Pelt laughs.  Suddenly --

      THEIR POV -- As WEBB and Lewis exit the house and head for 
      the Mercedes in the driveway.  One tosses the other the keys.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    They re on the move.

                    C mon, let s take  em.  

      Just as the suspects climb into their car, Rigsby flips on 
      the SIREN, guns the engine and screeches to a halt blocking 
      them in.   

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt jumps out, shotgun in tow, rushes to the 
      passenger window and levels it at a dazed Carter Lewis. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Police.  Hands where I can see 
                    them!

      NEW ANGLE -- Dieter Webb decides to run.  He leaps from the 
      driver s side and bolts across the yard.  Rigsby gives chase.  
      Both men race through a sprinkler.  Dieter finds he is in a 
      dead end, fails to scale a wire fence, and is tackled by 
      Rigsby with great force.  As Dieter moans in pain, Rigsby 
      handcuffs him.

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt smiles and waves to the Mom and Kids 
      watching this all from their adjacent driveway, stunned.

                    Ah.  Someone s coming.

      A hooded figure holding an umbrella ghosts across the lot and 
      climbs into the passenger seat.  It s Adrianna.  She holds a 
      gun on Jane with casual menace, like someone who s done this 
      kind of shit before.  She clutches a cellphone in her other 
      hand.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    This better not be a trap.  I will

                    you.  Give me the diamonds.

      Jane shows her a leather bag, opens it, flashes a look 
      inside.

                                  JANE
                    Where s Julie?

                    me.  Here, have a look at them.  
                    You ve seen them before. 

      Here Jane employs a classic mentalist street con known in the 
      trade as  the Russian scam.   It s played slow and graceful, 
      rather than swift and comical.    

      He offers her the bag.  She wants it, but is momentarily 
      stymied because she has a gun in one hand and a cellphone in 
      the other.  He offers to take the cellphone with one hand and 
      offers to give the leather bag with the other.  Adrianna 
      automatically complies, and gives him the phone.  He hands 
      her the diamonds.  

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, sorry.

      He takes back the leather bag, replaces them with a bottle of 
      water.  He shakes his head no, that s not right, just as she 
      does.  He hands her back the diamonds and takes the gun.  

      Now he s got the phone and the gun.  But hey, she figures, 
      confused momentarily, I got the diamonds.  She opens the bag.  
      Jane flips open the purloined phone and touches keys, whilst 
      doing the same with his own phone.

                                  LISBON
                    Bennett s our man.  Killed Jason 
                    Sands for ten million in diamonds.

                    Either the widow or the mistress 
                    acted as his accomplice. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Well, which?

                                  LISBON
                    We re trying to nail that down now.  
                    Bennett could tell us, if he makes 
                    it.  But it doesn t look like he

                    Jane has an idea, but if we 
                    generate any complaints, as to how 
                    we go about this, you have our 
                    backs, right?

                                    MINELLI
                    That depends obviously.  We need a 
                    win here.  But I won t sanction 
                    anything underhanded or actionable.

                                  LISBON
                    That s kind of vague.  No

      Jennifer looks like she might go and smack Adrianna, and 
      Adrianna gets ready to fight with convincing alacrity.  
      Jennifer thinks better of it, and takes the high road.  

                                  JENNIFER
                    You ve obviously led a very sad and 
                    difficult life, to be so twisted.  
                    Truly Adrianna, you have my 
                    sympathy.

      Adrianna does kind of feel that way about herself so it hits 
      home.  She nearly goes for Jennifer.  But instead, chokes off 
      her anger.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Lick my shoe, chicken-face.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  Wendy.  Do either of you know 
                    a woman named Wendy?

      Both women think a beat.  Shake their heads. 

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    No?  Shame.  She d be worth 
                    knowing.

      Both women frown at this news.  Van Pelt and Cho exit.  
      Adrianna and Jennifer stare at each other as if Sergio Leone 
      was directing them, at each other, then at the exit door, 
      then back...

      Jennifer subsides into resignation, a leaden feeling in her

                    It was Bennett.  He forced me into

                                  JANE
                    No.  Bennett is an idiot who thinks

                    like a violin, with those big eyes

                    I had a real breakthrough insight.  
                      I realized that our whole marriage 
                    had been like this.  Withholding.  
                      Withholding.  Always withholding.  

      They start arguing and shouting at each other.  They 
      momentarily forget about Sands, who is not as out of it as he 
      looks.  He presses a code into the remote...

      The book shelf opens noiselessly and Sands throws himself 
      into the safe room before Bennett and Jennifer can stop him.  
      The door swings shut.  Bennett frantically punches in numbers 
      while Jennifer screams at him.

      INT. JULIE S BEDROOM - DAY4747

      Jane and Jennifer t te- -t te...

                                  JENNIFER
                    Whatever it was I most needed to 
                    nurture myself, that was what Jason 
                    would refuse to give me.   

       The WAIL of POLICE CARS coming closer.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    Tell me.  Where are they?  The 
                    diamonds? 

      Jane opens the curtains slightly and points upward.  Jennifer 
      looks up at the CRYSTAL CHANDELIER suspended from the 
      ceiling.  Her eyes go wide with revelation, then sharp with 
        indignation.  And as the chandelier shimmers...

      EXT. SANDS HOME - DAY4848

      Jane and the CBI team watch as Inspector Mulvey puts a 
      handcuffed Jennifer into a SFPD vehicle.  Jennifer looks at 
      Jane as the door closes.  

                                   CHO
                    When did you first suspect it was 
                    her?

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I had an idea at the funeral 
                    service. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    No you did not.

                                  JANE
                    I did so.  She was looking way too 
                    good.  Nobody should glow at their 
                    husband s funeral.

                                  LISBON
                    So you made that bet with Rigsby, 
                    that you could seduce her, with the 
                      deliberate intention of snaring 
                    her?

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  I meant to win the bet 
                    too.  Only when it came to it, 
                      I couldn t.

      Van Pelt comes over.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Just because I lost doesn t mean 
                    you shouldn t take my advice. 

                                  RIGSBY 
                          (waving him away)
                    Yeah yeah.  Hush.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      56.

      CONTINUED:4848

                                  JANE
                    I m serious man.  Go for it.

      Jane exits, tugging Cho with him.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What s he talking about?

      Long beat, while Rigsby considers taking Jane s advice.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Nothing.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
