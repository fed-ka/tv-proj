The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the
faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in
their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott
drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.
MRS. PRESCOTT
Why do they always put braces on
teenage girls at the exact moment
when they're the most self-conscious
about their appearance?
Pause.
MR. PRESCOTT
I don't know.
UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP
TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.
MRS. PRESCOTT
Tom --
MR. PRESCOTT
I see him...
The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough
time to spare.
MRS. PRESCOTT
Tom!
MR. PRESCOTT
Jesus!
Mr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and
clears the truck as --
Another pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP
over the HILL directly in FRONT of them --
MRS. PRESCOTT
(Screams)
Tom!
Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and
there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.
CUT TO:
The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big
finger RINGS the BELL.
A moment.
AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the
door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY
(Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on
their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy
is eleven. Terry is eight.
REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses
and a mustache, looks down at AMY.
SHERIFF
Hello, Amy.
AMY
(Puzzled)
Hi, Darryl.
SHERIFF
(Thinking)
Amy, would you please tell the kids
you'll be right back, and then shut
the door and come outside to talk to
us for a minute?
AMY
OK.
(To kids)
Be right back, you guys!
SAMMY
You're not supposed to go out, Amy.
TERRY
She's going to smoke a cigarette.
AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl
doesn't know how to start.
CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the
little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.
On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green
country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on
her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.
She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved
from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality.
An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office
clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light
raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds
and then bows her head and closes her eyes.
CREDITS END.
Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores
next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few
restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World
War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets
wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know
there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity
during the daytime.
SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-
year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school
knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY
calls out the car window.
SAMMY
Rudy, come on! I'm really late!
Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging
his knapsack into the backseat.
Sammy stops the car outside a heavily THICKETED DRIVEWAY
(CAROL'S HOUSE), and RUDY gets out.
SAMMY
Don't forget your backpack.
Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back.
RUDY
It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.
SAMMY
Don't forget your knapsack.
Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back.
SAMMY
Give me a kiss.
Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and
squeezes her neck.
He withdraws, slams the door. As Sammy DRIVES AWAY, he slogs
up the long twisting driveway.
Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the
half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for
bank employees.
She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt
as she goes.
The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years'
more wear on it.
Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches
half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.
The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a
very grim street in a grim little city.
Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A
GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the
highway.
The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-
coaster road.
Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his
shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town
going about its Saturday afternoon business.
Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed
into nice clothes.
Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out
his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he
looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.
Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny
man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake
hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some
other people.
He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter
and grayer.
SHERIFF
Whoa there!
TERRY
Sorry.
The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.
SHERIFF
God damn! Terry Prescott! How you
doin'? Gimme a cuddle!
The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and
selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.
TERRY
How you doin', Darryl?
SHERIFF
Which way you headed?
TERRY
I'm just goin' to see Sammy at
Dawson's...
SHERIFF
Can I walk with you a little?
TERRY
Sure, yeah --
SHERIFF
So Sammy says you been out in
Alaska...?
TERRY
Yeah, I was workin' out there for a
little while...
The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious
about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The
Sheriff does not seem to notice.
SHERIFF
-- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards
from all across the country.
TERRY
Yeah, I've been all over the place...
They stop outside Dawson's.
SHERIFF
Well, it's good to have you back
here, I'll tell you that.
TERRY
Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the
peace.
SHERIFF
Well, that'll be a little harder now
that you're home, but I'll do what I
can.
TERRY
No, man, I'm reformed.
SHERIFF
Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.
TERRY
Thanks, Darryl.
Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking
for Sammy.
Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table,
talking to the waitress.
She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy
as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.
Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses
his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window
we see them make their way toward each other.
Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a
big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.
Terry watches while Sammy inserts her card in the ATM and
punches in her code. Terry waits. She punches in $300. The
machine grinds out her cash. She gives him the money.
TERRY
Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna
pay this back.
She takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet.
A bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville.
Inside the little white church they're singing.
People are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of
the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six
months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy
is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind,
waiting for her.
Crickets buzz loudly outside the house.
The CLOCK on the front of the TOWN HALL reads 3:31.
The SCHOOL BUS pulls up across from the town hall and
disgorges a handful of kids. Rudy comes out with his knapsack,
looking around...
POV RUDY: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of
Sammy's car, smoking.
Rudy walks over to him.
RUDY
You showed up.
TERRY
Looks that way.
Terry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's
age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up
and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with
no great skill.
TERRY
Hey. Look.
He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.
TERRY
You hold it further down, you're
gonna get a lot more power. You should
be able to put that nail down with
two or three hits. Look:
With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the
wood.
TERRY
Try it.
RUDY
That's not the way I hold it.
TERRY
Well, the way you hold it is wrong.
RUDY
Why can't I just do it my own way?
Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment.
TERRY
(Shrugs)
You can.
He goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment
he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry
looks up and watches him.
Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the
hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the
side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering
happily away with Terry and Ray.
She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance
and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a
very cheerful sight.
The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the
stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks
apprehensive.
RUDY
I don't think they let kids in there.
TERRY
Well, we're not allowed to watch any
more TV, so it's this or nothing...
But if we run into any trouble, let
me do the talking.
RUDY
OK.
Terry swings the door open.
The house is dark. Terry and Rudy are walking from the car
to the house.
RUDY
We creamed those guys! We creamed
them!
TERRY
(Stopping suddenly)
Ssh...! Don't move.
They listen. A CAR is COMING.
TERRY
It's them!
They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key. He gets
the door open.
TERRY
Go! Go! Go!
He and Rudy run inside the house. The lights go on. BOB'S
CAR pulls into the DRIVEWAY.
Terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside
the window. RAIN FALLS on his HEAD.
DISSOLVE TO:
Early morning. The RAIN is still falling. Only a few cars
are in the employee parking lot yet.
The rain falls on Main Street.
The rain comes down hard on Orrin's construction project.
Tarps cover everything. No work today.
The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the
restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter.
He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to
her. They start talking. We HEAR:
SAMMY
They were where?
RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold.
The RAIN pours down.
Rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the
center of town. He is completely drenched.
Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and
Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway.
SAMMY
Look, I'm glad you guys are getting
along so well -- like, you have no
idea -- but if I can't rely on you
to remember to get him once a day...
TERRY
You can!
SAMMY
-- And what are you doing taking him
to play pool in the middle of the
night, and then telling him to lie
to me about it?
Pause.
TERRY
I don't know.
Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in
a silent rage. The rain has let up.
TERRY
Get out of the car.
RUDY
What are we doing?
TERRY
You're going to Carol's house and
I'm going home.
RUDY
Why can't I come with you?
TERRY
Because if you're such a baby you
gotta tell your Mommy about us playin'
pool when I totally asked you not
to, and I gotta listen to her shit
all day, then you're goin' to the
baby-sitter's so you can stay at the
baby house.
RUDY
But I didn't tell her!
TERRY
You know what? Don't even fuckin'
talk to me.
RUDY
I didn't!
TERRY
Just get out of the car.
He leans over Rudy roughly and pushes open the door. Rudy
gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway. He
bursts into tears.
Terry watches him go, then drives off.
Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car.
This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.
BRIAN
Sammy?
SAMMY
Yeah?
BRIAN
I want you to tell me who changed
the colors on my computer screen.
SAMMY
I'll never tell.
They start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs
his head. They laugh.
We pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout
faucets of water down on the car.
Sammy and Terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a
joint back and forth. It has stopped raining but the trees
and roof are still dripping. The crickets are chirping loudly.
SAMMY
So... Bob asked me to marry him.
TERRY
Wow.
(Pause)
Are you going to?
SAMMY
I don't know. If he'd've asked me
this time last year I would have
probably said yes. But the minute he
said it, I don't know, I felt like
somebody was trying to strangle me.
TERRY
Well... bad sign.
SAMMY
I know.
(Pause)
Plus, Terry...
(Whispers)
I fucked my boss...!
TERRY
What?
SAMMY
I know! And his wife is six months
pregnant.
TERRY
Jesus Christ, Sammy...!
SAMMY
I know, I know.
He passes her the joint. She declines. He puffs away. The
water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. She puts
her head on his shoulder. He puts one arm around her and
puffs away with the joint in his free hand.
SAMMY
Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before.
I just don't want him, you know --
terrified of "telling," if there's --
TERRY
Uh, well, that's not really his
problem, Sammy.
Sammy straightens up.
SAMMY
Oh really? What's his problem?
TERRY
His problem is that he's like totally
sheltered because you treat him like
he's three, instead of eight, so
that's how he behaves.
SAMMY
Oh yeah? And how do you think he
should behave?
TERRY
I think he shouldn't have to run and
tell his Mommy every time he does
something she might not like, for
one thing.
SAMMY
Uh huh. And what do you --
TERRY
(On "and")
I mean I took him to play pool! It
was a little clandestine thing we
did for fun! It wasn't like a big
secret, I mean who cares? I was
actually trying to be nice to him.
But he's so freaked out that he
disobeyed your orders that he has to
fuckin' squeal on me and I have to
listen to your fuckin' shit all day
when I didn't even fuckin' do
anything!
SAMMY
First of all, he didn't tell me
anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of
all, I don't really give a shit if
you took him to play pool: I was mad
at you because you left him standing
at the bus stop in the rain. But no,
I don't want you telling him not to
squeal, because I don't want him put
in that position!
TERRY
(Losing ground)
Well... that... is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.
SAMMY
You are in idiot.
They stand apart now. Silence.
TERRY
Darryl told you?
SAMMY
Yes!
They stand there. The rain gutters drip.
Brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station.
BRIAN
I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd
say hello.
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Sammy doesn't say anything.
BRIAN
Look, I know it's probably too late,
but is there any way you can come
out for a little while?
SAMMY
Brian, I think you're going crazy.
BRIAN
I know I am. Can you meet me?
SAMMY
Um, OK.
Sammy's car and Brian's car are parked side by side outside
a roadside motel.
Outside the motel, Sammy and Brian get into their respective
cars and start their motors.
Sammy heads toward the little white church building.
The SUN SHINES on Main Street.
Terry opens the door. It's Ron, the minister, in his civvies.
Rudy is playing basketball by himself.
The congregation is coming out of the church and milling
around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying
good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and
BRIAN go down the steps.
POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the
curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING
RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly.
REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the
church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a
look from the distance.
Services are over. Everyone has gone home.
Terry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a
wide running stream, fishing. The sunlight slants through
the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous
and peaceful.
RUDY
I've never been so bored in my life.
TERRY
Yeah... We really shoulda been out
here around seven or eight A.M.
RUDY
What time is it now?
TERRY
Two-thirty.
Silence. The birds sing.
RUDY
Was my father a good fisherman?
TERRY
Yeah, your father was good at all
that stuff. He knew everything about
the woods, everything about fishing,
everything about hunting and
everything about cars. If he wasn't
such a pain in the ass he would've
been a lot of fun to be around.
RUDY
Maybe he's nicer now.
TERRY
I doubt it.
RUDY
Well, I think he is.
TERRY
How would you know? Did you ever
meet him?
RUDY
No.
TERRY
Were you ever curious to meet him?
RUDY
I guess so.
TERRY
Well, he doesn't live very far from
here.
RUDY
I thought he lived in Alaska.
TERRY
No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad
lives in Auburn. Far as I know.
(Pause)
We could look him up in the phone
book. Wanna try?
RUDY
All right.
TERRY
OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have
to say this, but I'm not kidding,
man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother.
The crickets are chattering. The phone is ringing inside the
house.
The PHONE rings inside the house as the early morning sun
slants through the trees around the house.
On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait
as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff. The
Auburn Sheriff goes inside. Darryl comes over to Sammy.
SHERIFF
It's gonna be all right... We got on
the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a
little bit and he's calmed down,
just wants to forget about the whole
thing...
SAMMY
Darryl, I really appreciate this...
The Sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here.
Dressed for work and school, Sammy and Rudy walk to the car.
SAMMY
Look. I know you're upset about Uncle
Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's
just not in control of himself, and
I don't want him hurting your feelings
anymore -- or mine. And you may not
like it, but that's how it's gotta
be. OK?
RUDY
I don't care.
SAMMY
You don't care. I don't care either.
Terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his
way up the hill through the tombstones. He reaches his
parents' graves. He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He
puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.
He sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a
beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.
He looks out over the hilly scenery. After a moment he shakes
his head a few times. He doesn't even know he's doing it. He
sits there.
Sammy comes out and looks up and down the road.
Terry jumps out of RAY'S PICKUP. Sammy opens the front door
and Rudy runs out toward Terry.
RUDY
Hi!
TERRY
Hey, how's it goin', man?
Rudy stops short in front of Terry. Terry looks at Sammy, in
the doorway.
TERRY
Sorry I'm late.
The car stops across the street from the BUS. The LAST KIDS
are getting in. SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy,
Terry and Rudy all get out.
TERRY
So Rudy... If I write you a letter,
will you write me back?
RUDY
Yeah.
TERRY
OK, well, that's gonna be pretty
nice for you, because I write a pretty
Goddamn interesting letter.
RUDY
Yeah, we'll see.
TERRY
All right. Well, say good-bye.
RUDY
Bye.
Rudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome
and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.
Rudy walks to the BUS and gets on. The bus pulls away.
Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable. He moves
to get back in the car, and she does the same.
Sammy and Terry sit on a bench near the bus stop. Terry's
backpack is by his side.
SAMMY
Do you need some cash for the bus?
TERRY
No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you
gonna be late for work?
SAMMY
Oh -- Yeah. That's OK.
(Pause)
Terry, I don't even know where you're
going.
TERRY
Oh, well, I didn't really have a
concrete plan yet. I have to go back
to Worcester and get my stuff...
SAMMY
Oh, are you gonna try to see that
girl?
TERRY
Well... Yeah... You know... Thought
maybe I'd try to show my face... Let
her brother have a crack at me...
SAMMY
What?
TERRY
No...
SAMMY
...I don't want anyone to have a
crack at you.
TERRY
I'm just kidding. I just thought...
Just thought I'd check up on her...
(Pause)
Anyway, after that, I don't really
know. I've been thinking about Alaska
a lot. I still got some friends out
there. I don't really know. Anyway,
I'll write you.
SAMMY
You will?
TERRY
Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You
know that.
Pause.
SAMMY
What is gonna happen to you?
TERRY
Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell
you, I know things didn't work out
too well this time...
SAMMY
Well, Terry --
TERRY
...but it's always really good to
know that wherever I am, whatever
stupid shit I'm doing, you're back
at my home, rooting for me.
SAMMY
I do root for you.
She starts crying, and looks down.
TERRY
Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna
be all right... Comparatively... And
I'll be back this way...
SAMMY
I feel like I'm never gonna see you
again...!
TERRY
Of course you will, Sammy. You never
have to worry about that.
SAMMY
Please don't go till you know where
you're going. Please...!
TERRY
I do know where I'm going. I'm going
to Worcester and I'm gonna try to
see that girl. And then depending on
what happens there, I thought I'd
try to see if there's any work for
me out West. And if there is, I'm
gonna head out there for the summer
and try to make some money. And if
there isn't, I'll figure something
else out. Maybe I'll stay around the
East. I don't know... I really liked
it in Alaska. It was really beautiful.
You just -- It made me feel good.
And before things got so messed up I
was doin' pretty well out there.
Seriously. But I couldn't stay here
long, Sammy: I don't want to live
here. But I'm gonna stay in touch.
And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to
see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll
come home for Christmas. How about
that? We'll have Christmas together.
(Pause)
Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...
Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking
down her cheeks.
TERRY
Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look
at me...
She looks at him.
TERRY
Hey, Sammy... Remember when we were
kids, remember what we always used
to say to each other . . .?
(Pause)
Remember when we were kids?
SAMMY
Of course I do...!
She throws her arms around his neck. He pats her gently.
The DOORS OPEN and Terry comes up the steps and into the
bus. Outside, Sammy watches him pay the driver and move
through the bus toward his seat. The BUS DOORS CLOSE.
Sammy waves till the BUS DRIVES all the way down MAIN STREET,
turns a corner and is gone.
