      A cabinet swings open. Deaton grabs a bottle and turns to 
      Scott, who holds up his shirt where Derek slashed him.

                                  DEATON
                    They re on their way back. So we 
                    don t have much time to talk.

      Dousing a cotton ball, he reaches for Scott s wound.

                                  SCOTT
                    What is that?

                                  DEATON
                    Rubbing alcohol. You don t want it 
                    to get infected, do you?

      Scott takes a breath of relief as Deaton hurries to clean and 
      bandage the wound.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    You ll heal the same. Just not as 
                    quickly because of Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, how do you know all this? 
                    Actually, how do you know anything?

                                  DEATON
                    That s a longer story. What I can 
                    tell you is I know about your kind. 
                    Your kind I can help. This...

      He lifts the sheet from Bennett s torso to reveal numerous 
      and bloody slash wounds on the body.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you know what did it?

                                  DEATON
                    No. But the Argents will. And this 
                    is the crucial part. They ll have 
                    some kind of record or book. It ll 
                    have descriptions, histories, 
                    notations of all the things they ve 
                      discovered.

                                  SCOTT
                    All of the things? How many 
                    different things are there?

      Before Deaton can answer, the sound of TIRES ON GRAVEL turn 
      their heads toward the waiting area.

      A GLOVED HAND pushes open the front door. Boots tracking dirt 
      across the cement floor, Argent walks in followed by TWO 
      HUNTERS. They turn the corner to find--

      Deaton standing behind the body on the table. Alone.  

                                  DEATON
                    I m starting to think I need to buy 
                    a more prominent Closed sign.

      Gerard steps out from behind Argent and his men. Deaton 
      blinks, a moment of nervousness. He watches the man slip on a 
      pair of glasses to look over Bennett s corpse. 

                                  GERARD
                    Hello, Alan.

      Argent glances to his father, surprised that these two know 
      each other.

                                  DEATON
                    I did. I also noticed the gun 
                    powder residue at his fingertips.

                                  ARGENT
                    He was only 24.

                    All ages, sizes, shapes. It s the

                    How about you tell us what you 
                    found?

      Deaton turns the head to reveal a horizontal SLASH WOUND just 
      below the hairline on the nape of the neck.

                                  DEATON
                    See this cut here? Precise. Almost 
                    surgical. But this wasn t the wound 
                    that killed him. It has a more 
                      interesting purpose.

                                  GERARD
                    Related to the spine?

                                  DEATON
                    That s right. Whatever made this 
                    cut was laced with a paralytic 
                    toxin potent enough to disable all 
                    motor function.

      Deaton rolls the body back to reveal the chest wounds.

                    As you can see, it dug in and 
                    slashed upwards, eviscerating the 
                    lungs and slicing through the bone 
                    of the rib cage with ease.

                                  ARGENT

                                  ARGENT
                    Any idea at all what killed him?

                                  DEATON
                    No. But I can tell you it s fast, 
                      remarkably strong and has the 
                    capacity to render its victim 
                      essentially helpless within 
                    seconds.

                    If you re saying we should be 
                    cautious, we get it.

                                  DEATON
                    I m saying you should be afraid. 
                    Very afraid.

      From the cage room, Scott listens to Deaton s warning with 
      growing trepidation.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Because in the natural world, 
                    predators equipped with a paralytic 
                    toxin use it to catch and eat their 
                    prey. This prey wasn t eaten. That 
                    means whatever killed him only 
                    wanted to kill him. In fact...

      He gazes at the men, fear in his own eyes.

      Pushing through the door of the WAITING ROOM, Stiles waves 
      his hands, trying to get the Mechanic s attention.

                                  MECHANIC
                    Yeah, but it looks like your whole 
                    exhaust system s got to be replaced 
                    too.

                                  STILES
                    Why do I get the feeling you re 
                    slightly overestimating the damage?

                    Probably going to run about twelve

                    Seething with impotent rage.

      Stiles grabs the waiting room door handle, but his hand slips 
      on a clear, sap-like substance.

      No longer listening, the Mechanic fires up a DRILL and gets 
      back to work.

      IN THE WAITING ROOM - Stiles wipes his hand on his jeans as 
      he glances at a picture on the wall. It s the Mechanic in a 
      Beacon Hills lacrosse uniform.

      Reaching into his pocket for his phone, Stiles starts to hit 
      the HOME button but oddly, he can t seem to curl his thumb.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What the...?

      He takes the phone with his left hand while trying to flex 
      the fingers of his right. But when both hands lose strength, 
      the phone slips from his grasp and clatters to the floor.

      Alarmed, he glances to the door handle where he touched the 
      strange substance and then--

      THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW - he sees the Mechanic digging 
      through a tool chest while above him, SOMETHING MOVES inside 
      the Jeep. 

      Perched within, A SHADOWY FIGURE reaches its ink black-
      skinned and muscular arm through the open window.

                    Hey--HEY!

      The Mechanic looks up as the CREATURE darts out of the Jeep s 
      window. Tail whipping about, a clawed hand slashes at the 
      back of the Mechanic s neck.

      Knocked off his feet, he falls to the floor of the pit below 
      the Jeep.

      Almost simultaneously, a frightened Stiles falls to his knees 
      in the waiting room as the paralysis takes hold. He 
      collapses, face hitting the floor. 

      INSIDE THE GARAGE - at the bottom of the pit, the same 
      paralysis overtakes the terrified Mechanic. Unable to move, 
      he watches the creature slip underneath the Jeep. Using a 
      single claw, it severs a cord attached to the lift.

      BLACK HYDRAULIC FLUID showers down and the Jeep begins to 
      lower toward the Mechanic s frozen body.

      to reach his phone. Fingers trembling toward the screen, he 
      manages to unlock it and hit 9. Then 1. And then--

      Stiles can t hit the last 1. Paralyzed, he watches through 
      the crack underneath the door as his Jeep and all of its 
      three thousand pounds glide slowly yet purposefully down.

      Stiles shuts his eyes as the Mechanic s SCREAMS fill the 
      garage, weakening to choking gasps and then finally--

      Silence.

      All Stiles can hear now is his own nervous gasps. He looks to 
      the space underneath the door where he sees--

      REPTILIAN EYES staring back at him. As Stiles sucks in a 
      frightened breath, the creature disappears from sight.

      Glancing up, Stiles sees the doorknob turn. With a chilling 
      CREAK, it begins to open and--

      A RINGING fills the waiting room. Coming from Stiles s phone. 
      His finger rests on the display, finally having managed to 
      hit the last 1 in 911. 

      As the door opens to reveal the now empty garage, a voice 
      BLARES out from the phone--

      glances to the dashboard where the time is 8:55. She quickly

                    It s okay. I was just--

                    Expecting someone else?

                    Yes. I mean--no. Definitely no.

                    Good. We can talk for a minute.*

      With a smile, he shuts the car door for her.


      A cell phone s display LIGHTS up, illuminating the woods 
      around Scott. He glances at the time: 9:00 PM. 

      Returning his gaze to the light-speckled town of Beacon 
      Hills, he searches the roads as if he might recognize 
      Allison s car simply by her headlights.

      But as the display light goes out, Scott s hopeful expression 
      seems to dim as well.


      Racing through the woods, Allison desperately tries to make 
      her meeting with Scott. But when she arrives at the lookout 
      point, she finds it empty.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She turns, trying to see in the darkness, when her eyes land 
      on something. She approaches an outcropping of rock to 
      discover a message scrawled in chalk--

      Couldn t wait. Missed U.

      Disappointed, Allison presses her hand to the rock and begins 
      carefully wiping away Scott s message.


      Stiles gets into the passenger side, slamming it closed. From 
      behind the wheel, Scott watches his friend, concerned.

                                  SCOTT
                    You okay?

                    You know how when you see a friend *
                    in a Halloween mask, but all you *
                    can actually see is their eyes? You *

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      At the end of the dark corridor, Isaac stands with his hands 
      at his sides, head slung low. He takes a breath, teeth 
      clenched and goes down. 

      Hands hitting the pavement, Isaac LAUNCHES himself forward in 
      a lope. Pushing off with his feet, he springs up with power 
      and grace, heading right for--

      Derek. Standing like a monolith, waiting until the very last 
      second as Isaac leaps at him in a ferocious attack.

      When Derek finally moves, it s fast and focused. He grabs 
      Isaac and twists the boy around, SLAMMING him back down to 
      the cement.

      Out of the shadows, Erica appears, bounding up to swing a 
      clawed hand at Derek. But he takes her out even more 
      brutally. Hand wrapping around her ankle, he sends her 
      sprawling across the floor.

      Boyd looks out from behind a steel column, shyly eyeing 
      Erica. Smiling back at him, she pushes herself up.

                                  DEREK
                    Anyone want to try not being 
                      completely predictable?

      He spins as Erica attacks again. She lands right on him, 
      literally latching onto his torso with her legs. He staggers 
      back with her attached to him when--

      She kisses him. Lips and tongue all over his. For just a 
      moment, Derek allows it. But then he breaks her grip and 
      drops her back to the floor. Right on her ass.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    That s the last time you do that.  

                                  ERICA
                    Why? Because I m a Beta?

                                  DEREK
                    Because I have someone else in mind 
                    for you.

      A weary Isaac pulls himself to his feet.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1213.

                                  ISAAC
                    We done? There s about a hundred *
                    bones in my body that could use a 
                    few hours to heal.

      Derek grabs his arm and CLENCHES down on it. The SHARP CRACK 
      of bone is followed by Isaac s ear-piercing SCREAM.

                                  DEREK
                    Hundred and one.*

      As Isaac cradles his arm, Derek addresses them all.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You think I m teaching you to 
                    fight? I m teaching you to survive.

                                  ISAAC
                    If they want us dead how come 
                    they re not coming after us now? 
                    What are they waiting for?

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know. But they re planning 
                      something. And you especially know 
                    that s not the only problem...
                          (to the others)
                    Whatever killed Isaac s father? I 
                    think it killed someone else last 
                    night. Until I figure out what it 
                    is, all of you need to learn 
                      everything I know. As fast as I can *
                    teach you.


      The bedroom door clicks open and Mrs. Martin hurries in to 
      wake Lydia. She lies buried under a mountain of covers.

                                  MRS. MARTIN
                    Time to get up.

      Mrs. Martin reaches to pull the covers off.

                                  MRS. MARTIN
                    Lydia, please--

      SHE SCREAMS, hands jerking back from the BLOOD-STAINED 
      covers. There s blood everywhere. As a stunned Lydia sits up, 
      her panicked mother grabs her arms to find the source.

                                  MRS. MARTIN (CONT D)
                    What did you do? Oh God, what did 
                    you do to yourself?

      She searches Lydia s wrists for the tell-tale slashes, but 
      the cuts are only on the knuckles of her right hand. As if 
      she d punched something.

      Mrs. Martin looks into Lydia s wide, confused eyes. She 
      follows her daughter s gaze to a SHATTERED VANITY MIRROR, 
      shards hanging off it.

                                  MRS. MARTIN (CONT D)
                      Lydia--sweetheart--why did you do 
                    that? Lydia?

      But the girl shakes her head. No idea why. 

      Mother and daughter turn to look into the mirror shards, the 
      reflection of their own bewildered faces gazing back at them.


      Lydia sits outside a door that reads Guidance Counselor. Her 
      hands are now covered by a fashionable pair of gloves. 

      A cute JUNIOR sits next to her, also waiting. They share a 
      look. He smiles. She doesn t. 

                                  JUNIOR

                      narcissistic girls.

      Lydia stares at him in disbelief. Before she can fashion a 
      comeback, the door opens, revealing Ms. Morrell.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Are you ready, Lydia?

      Without another glance to the Junior, Lydia steps inside the 
      office.


      Stiles stands opposite Scott, looking deep into his eyes.

                                  STILES
                    Sorry about the other day. I m

                    Allison seriously have to find a

                    Yes. Message complete. Now tell me 
                    about your boss.

                                  SCOTT
                    He thinks Allison s family has some 
                    kind of record of all the things 
                    they ve hunted. Like a book.

                    No. Pretty sure I don t. It s like

      Stiles races back to Allison, now gasping.

      Stiles collapses against the wall next to Scott, nearly 
        hyperventilating.

      Gerard pulls his KEYS out of his office door and slips them 
      into his coat pocket. He turns to find Allison waiting for 
      him.

      Slipping his arm through hers, they head out of the school.   


      Gerard's keys hang from the lock of the open door of his

                    Hey, Stiles.


      Erica shoves Stiles into the darkened pool area. Derek *
      bounces a basketball ominously back and forth.*

                    Stiles. What did you see at the

      Derek punctures the basketball with a claw, deflating it. He 
      lets the crumpled remains fall to the floor at Stiles s feet.  

                                  DEREK
                    Let s try this again...


      Erica and Derek wait for Stiles to explain.

                                  STILES
                    All right, the thing was pretty 
                    slick looking. Skin was dark, kind 
                    of patterned. I think I actually 
                    saw scales. Is that enough? Because 
                    I have someone I really need to 
                    talk to.

      Behind him, SOMETHING ON THE WALL begins to crawl into view.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Okay, um... Eyes. It s eyes are 
                      yellowish. Slitted. It has a lot of 
                    teeth.

      Becoming alarmed, Derek and Erica watch the CREATURE crawl 
      down the wall headfirst, tail flicking up and about.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Oh, and it has a tail. Okay, we

                    What? Have you seen it? You ve got 
                    this look like you know exactly 
                    what I m talking about.

      Then he notices Derek and Erica are not looking at him, but 
      past him. Stiles spins around just as--

      The creature LEAPS off the wall.

      Erica darts in front of Derek to protect him, but the thing 
      moves too fast for her. Whipping about, it SHOVES her across 
      the floor. Her head SNAPS BRUTALLY into the wall. While she *
      slumps unconscious--

      Derek grabs Stiles to get him out of the way. The creature s 
      claws slice through the air, tail snaking up.

                                  DEREK
                    Run!

      He pushes Stiles up toward an EXIT door and turns back just *
      as a CLAWED FOOT lands on his chest.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1230.



      KICKED BACK, Derek flies past Stiles and tumbles across the *
      tile floor.

      Pushing up, Derek flips back onto his feet, eyes FLARING with 
      an angry RED GLOW.

                                  DEREK
                    Get behind me.

      Stiles nods, retreating back. But when he does, something 
      catches his eye. A SLASH MARK at the nape of Derek s neck. 
      Exactly how the Mechanic was cut.

                                  STILES
                    Derek. Your neck...

      As he turns to Stiles, hand coming up to his neck, Derek s 
      legs give out. He drops to his knees on the floor, paralysis 
      taking hold.

                                  DEREK
                          (stunned)
                      Scott--get Scott.

      But instead of running, Stiles grabs him. Pulling Derek s arm 
      over his shoulder, he attempts to drag him to the exit just a 
      few yards beyond the edge of the pool.

                                  STILES
                    Where is it? Do you see it?

                    No. Hurry.

      Derek struggles to stay on his feet with the little strength 
      he has left. Stiles pulls his phone from his jacket.

                      Stiles--what are you doing--Stiles!

      BEHIND THEM, the creature emerges from the darkness, slow and 
      stealthy in its approach.

      As Derek s strength disappears, Stiles loses his balance. 
      Forced to use both hands to hold Derek, Stiles DROPS his 
      phone to the tile floor. But then Derek slips out of his 
      grasp as well.

      As Stiles gropes for a hold on him, Derek tumbles backwards 
      and GOES RIGHT INTO THE POOL.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1231.

      Without hesitating, Stiles jumps in after the sinking Derek. 
      Water splashes up, waves rippling out. Then, just as the pool 
      seems to settle, Stiles and Derek burst to the surface, 
      gasping for air.

      The front door clicks open. Argent and Victoria look out from 
      the kitchen to see Gerard and Allison stepping in.

      Scott sits opposite Allison, surrounded by the Argents as 
      they quietly, silently eat dinner. Gerard sets down his knife 
      and fork. He looks to his family. Then to Scott. 

                                  GERARD
                    All right, why s everyone so quiet?

                    centuries since I was a teenager, 
                    but even back then we dated and 
                    broke up all of the time.

      Stiles struggles to keep Derek above the surface of the water

      Kicking out, Stiles draws Derek toward the pool s edge when--

                                  DEREK
                    Stop!

      Stiles splashes to a halt. Both of them spot the GLOWING EYES *

                    What s it waiting for?

      But Derek doesn t respond, watching that perfectly still pair *
      of eyes as if trying to find the answer in them.*


      Argent rests a sympathetic gaze on Scott.

                                  ARGENT
                    No offense, Scott, but I think 
                    maybe Allison felt the two of you 
                    were just growing apart.

      Hand wrapping around Scott s throat, Argent shoves him 
      against the refrigerator.

                                  ARGENT

                    I m kind of wondering what would

                    It wouldn t be good for me. But 
                    then, I d have plenty of chances to 
                    redeem myself. And that wouldn t be 
                    good for you.

      He lets Scott go. The two of them stare at each other in a 
      tense stand off. Finally, Scott grabs the cookie plate. 
      Argent grabs the cake. Still eyeing each other. Holding 
      cookies and cake. They walk out.


      From the center of the pool, Stiles and Derek watch the 
      creature approach the edge. But then, oddly, it retreats 
      back.

                                  STILES
                    You see that? I don t think it can 
                    swim.

      Derek meets Stiles s eyes. They turn back to the creature 
      which HISSES, slashing at the water. Darting forward only to 
      back away a moment later.


      Allison finishes her meal and sets the fork down.

      Powerless to stop them, Argent and Victoria watch Allison and

      Slipping down the hall, Allison pulls Scott into the guest 
      room where Gerard is staying.

                    Hurry.

      They quickly search through books, papers and odd items, 
      finding nothing. Until Allison moves a coat to reveal a SAFE.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    There goes that plan.

                                  SCOTT
                    Actually, let me try something.

      Kneeling, Scott places his ear against the safe and carefully 
      begins turning the dial. He concentrates, focusing his 
      hearing on the LOCKING PINS dropping into place.

      With a final turn of the dial, the safe door clicks open. 
      Allison almost laughs.

                                    ALLISON
                    Want to hit a few banks later?

      Lying atop other papers inside is the worn leather book 
      Allison saw Gerard put in his pocket. She grabs it, flipping 
      it open. But her look of triumph falls to one of failure.

      Noticing, Scott takes the book and reads aloud. 

                                  SCOTT
                    Salmon Moutarde Creme Fraiche? What 
                    is this?

                                    ALLISON
                    A recipe. It's a cook book.


      At the table, Gerard holds up his fork with the last of his 
      meal on it. He delicately closes his lips over it, savoring 
      the bite with a proud smile.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1236.

                    Two days to prepare. But worth it.


      Energy waning, a breathless Stiles adjusts his grip on Derek.

                                  STILES
                    I don t know how much longer I can 
                    do this.

      As the creature continues to circle the pool, Stiles glances 
      to his phone on the wet tile nearby.

                                  DEREK
                    Don t even think about it.

                                  STILES
                    Can you trust me for half a second?

                                  DEREK
                    No.

                                  STILES
                    I m the one keeping you alive if 
                    you hadn t noticed.

                                  DEREK
                    When the paralysis wears off, who s 
                    the one who s going to be able to 
                    fight that thing? You or me?*

                                  STILES
                    So that s why I ve been holding you 
                    up for two hours?

                                  DEREK
                    Yes. You don t trust me. I don t 
                    trust you. But you need me to 
                    survive. Which is why you re not 
                    letting me go.

      Stiles looks Derek dead in the eye. And lets him go.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      A BLACK SHAPE sinks to the bottom of the pool. Derek, eyes 
      wide, lips pursed together as he tries to hold his breath, 
      while above-- 

      Stiles scrambles over the edge of the pool. He turns to see 
      the creature quickly bounding out of the shadows, coming 
      right toward him.

      Slipping across the wet tile, Stiles snatches his phone up, 
      turning as he hears the creature SHRIEK. With a desperate 
      leap, he jumps back into the water.

      Hand shooting up, he manages to keep the phone above the 
      surface. He dials Scott, while glancing down to see--

      Derek at the bottom of the pool. Beginning to drown. Stiles 
      looks to his phone which reads: Dialing Scott.


      Allison places Gerard s book back in the safe and shuts it. 
      Both of them jump when Scott s phone RINGS.

                                    ALLISON
                    Shut it off!

      Scott sees Stiles's name come up on the display. 

                                  SCOTT
                          (into the phone)
                    I can t talk right now.

      He hits END, hanging up.


      Stiles gazes at his phone, incredulous. Unable to even speak. 
      He looks down at Derek who is still under water. With no 
      other choice, he lets the phone go and dives down to Derek. A 
      moment later, they burst to the surface.

                                  DEREK
                          (gasping)
                    Tell me...  you got him.

      But the look on Stiles s face says otherwise.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1238.



      Scott and Allison desperately look about the room for an 
      answer.

                                  SCOTT
                    Without it we have no idea what 
                    this thing is.

                                  ALISON
                    But where else do we look? 

                                  SCOTT
                    What haven t we thought of?

                                    ALLISON
                    What if it s not a book? Something 
                    else he d keep close to him...

      Allison trails off, realization hitting her.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I know where it is.


      The door to Gerard's office lies open, keys still in the 
      lock. The item Allison and Scott have been looking for hangs 
      between the other keys...

        A high-capacity USB THUMB DRIVE.


      Scott rushes back into the dining room to grab his jacket.

                                  SCOTT
                    Principle Argent--Gerard, Mr. and 
                    Mrs. Argent. Thank you for dinner 
                    but I just realized I m totally 
                    late to pick up my mom from work.

      With a smile, he bullets out of the door. Allison sits back 
      down at the table with an innocent glance to her relieved 
      parents. 

      Gerard turns to them.

                                  GERARD
                    I don't get it. What's not to like?              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1239.



      Scott races in to find the keys still hanging in the doorknob 
      to the Principal's Office. He yanks them out of the lock and 
      then... pauses. Head cocking to the side, he HEARS something.


      Legs kicking with more and more effort, Stiles and Derek keep 
      dipping below the surface.

                                  STILES
                      I can t--I can t stay up. I need to 
                    hold on to something.

                                  DEREK
                    The diving board. Try to reach...

      Freeing one hand, Stiles swims them toward the diving board. 
      But when he reaches up to grab it, his fingers slip. They 
      both go under, descending into the dark when--

      TWO HANDS burst down through the surface.

      Both Derek and Stiles SURGE UP out of the water and land 
      sprawling onto the tile floor.

      Crouched on the diving board, Scott, now a full werewolf, 
      rises up with claws out. He lets loose a FEARSOME ROAR, 
      challenging the GLOWING-EYED creature as it approaches from 
      the shadows.

      But the thing is unbelievably fast and surprisingly strong. 
      Scott leaps up to meet it in mid-air. Both crash to the tile 
      floor, clawing and snarling at each other.

      The creature wraps a tail around Scott s leg and lifts him 
      right off the floor with it. Scott hurtles back, tossed into 
      a WALL MIRROR.

      GLASS SHATTERS, fragments raining down.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1240.

      The creature inches forward for the kill. Desperate, Scott 
      grabs one of the larger mirror shards to use as a weapon.

      And then something strange happens.

      The creature pauses, focusing on its own REFLECTION in the 
      glass, almost as if confused by it. For one brief moment, its 
      eyes return to those of a HUMAN. But only for a moment.

      Baring a fearsome set of DOUBLE-ROWED TEETH, the creature 
      hisses at itself and retreats back.  

      It LEAPS onto the wall. Crawling across it like a spider, the 
      creature darts out one of the high windows and disappears 
      into the night.

      With a breath of relief, Scott lets the mirror shard fall to 
      the floor. Then turns back to see an exhausted Stiles and 
      still weak Derek slowly pulling himself to his feet.


      In the darkened garage, Sheriff Stilinski gazes up at the 
      hydraulic line, fingers touching the edge where the Kanima 
      severed it. He puts his phone to his ear.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1242.
