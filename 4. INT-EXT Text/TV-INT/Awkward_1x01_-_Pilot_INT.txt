      A dark auditorium.  The room is packed with sweaty PRE-TEENS 
      spastically dancing in  Chadwick Day Camp  shirts as a MIDDLE-
      AGED DJ spins Top 40 hits under a makeshift BANNER reading 
       End of Summer Daze .  A few TEENAGE COUNSELORS (in shirts 
      that spell it out) animatedly talk by the refreshments 
      relishing their short-lived authority.  Behind them we...

      PAN ACROSS a row of brace-faced, frizzy-haired campers. At 
      the end of reject row is a counselor, JENNA HAMILTON (15). 
      Jenna has a simple, understated beauty... if you re looking 
      ...hard.  Making her the kind of girl who spends more time 
      fantasizing about a life than living one. Right now, she s 
      fixated on...

      MATTY MCKIBBEN (15), a gorgeous, charismatic counselor with a 
      million dollar smile.  He looks directly at Jenna and WINKS. 
      We FREEZE on the wink.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    There it was.  The signal.  I was 
                    hoping he d do something more 
                    inspired like sniff his armpits but 
                    Matty had a habit of doing that.  A 
                    lot.  

      Matty sniffs his armpits.

                                  JENNA (V.O.) 
                    Attention to personal hygiene was 
                    just one of Matty s many stellar 
                      attributes.  He was adolescent 
                      perfection.   

      Jenna nervously dribbles punch down her chin.

                                  JENNA (V.O.) 
                    Unlike me.  I was a hot mess of 
                    nerves cuz after a summer of 
                    flirting and exchanging seventy-two 
                    texts, Matty McKibben wanted me to 
                    meet him in the utility closet.                                                                                        2.



      A pathetic LONE CANDLE BURNS in the corner of the dirty 
      closet to create the illusion of romance.  

                                  JENNA
                    It s so beautiful. 

                                  MATTY
                    Your boobs are amazing.

      Like music to her ears, Jenna is swept away, figuratively and 
      literally as Matty pulls her onto a bed of dusty rags. 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      Jenna and Matty laying on each other, making out as they 
      clumsily shift their positions.  Something s not getting 
      in...not working... painful.  

                                  JENNA (V.O)
                    I know what you re thinking and no, 
                    this wasn t the inciting incident 
                    of some sappy  Tyra  special about 
                    how I got knocked up on the last 
                    day of summer camp.  I knew better 
                    than to bareback.   

      They shift again, it s in.  Matty starts pumping with 
      reckless abandon as Jenna braces herself stoically, holding 
      onto the dusty rags beneath her with a death grip. 

                                  JENNA (V.O)
                    Our passionate, bumping of uglies 
                    was a sign.  This year would be my 
                    year.  For once I wouldn t be 
                      overlooked or invisible.  Not with 
                    Matty at my... 

                                  JENNA
                    Back door!   

                                  MATTY
                    Sorry.  It slipped.

      He adjusts.

                                  MATTY
                          (stoked)
                    Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh...

      FREEZE ON Matty in ecstasy and Jenna smiling through gritted 
      teeth as a TEAR of repressed agony rolls down her cheek.                                                                                      3.


                                  JENNA (V.O)
                    Change was in the air.  I could 
                    smell it.  There was change 
                      and...Pine-Sol.  

      RESUME MOTION as Jenna s hand pushes away a wet mop.  Matty 
      stops and looks down.  He sweetly brushes away the hair in 
      her face. 

                                  MATTY
                    Am I hurting you? 

      ANGLE ON Jenna.  Her tightly locked eyes cannot stop the 
      waterworks that are now streaming down her cheeks.  She opens 
      her pained eye-lock and nonchalantly feigns a smile.

                                  JENNA
                    All good.  

                                  MATTY
                    But you re crying.

      Jenna touches her face and wipes away the tears. 

                                  JENNA
                    Um, it s probably just an allergy 
                    attack.  I get  em all the time.  
                    Don t let it stop you.

      With that, Matty doesn t hesitate to push forward.  

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    It was a lie.  My lady business was 
                    on fire but somehow admitting my 
                    virgin status seemed like a buzz 
                    kill.

      Three more pumps and Matty comes to Jesus. 

                                  MATTY
                    Awe-some.

      He rolls off of Jenna who looks more than a little relieved. 
        Immediately, he pulls up his shorts and Jenna takes the cue 
      to put herself together. With teen post-coital awkwardness, 
      they quietly smooth out their matching  Counselor  t-shirts 
      looking anywhere but at each other. 

                                  JENNA
                    So...

                                  MATTY
                    Are you bummed that summer s over?                                                                                      4.


                                  JENNA
                    Yeah.

                                  MATTY
                    Any plans for your last two weeks?

                                  JENNA
                    I dunno.  Probably just hang out.  
                    Watch movies.  Swim or something.

                                  MATTY
                    Cool.

                                  JENNA
                    You going to sophomore orientation?

                                  MATTY
                    Don t we have to?

                                  JENNA
                    Yeah, right, of course.  What I 
                    meant was...

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                      I couldn t help myself.  Matty had 
                    cracked my hard candy shell and I 
                    was oozing with sticky sweet love.  

                                  JENNA
                    ...do you wanna go...together?

      Matty gives her a sweet kiss then cups her exuberant face.

                                  MATTY
                    You re the shit, J-town...

                                  JENNA (V.O)
                    So he wasn t a poet.  He was still 
                    Matty McKibben.

                                  MATTY
                    ...but no one can know that I like 
                    you.

      HOLD ON her horrified and wounded expression.


                                  JENNA (V.O)
                    And I was still Jenna Hamilton.


                                                                   SMASH CUT TO:

                         THAT GIRL                                                                                       5.


                                        ACT ONE


      Jenna, disheveled and depressed, stumbles into the kitchen 
    and takes a seat next to her mom, LACEY (mid 30 s, immature, 
      sexy, self-absorbed and superficial).  Lacey s talking on the 
      phone as Jenna subtly tries to get her mother s attention.

                                  LACEY
                          (into phone)
                    That s ridiculous.  Allison is not 
                    a size two.  I saw her last week at 
                    the club.  She was falling out of 
                    her tennis skirt and not in a good 
                    way. 

      Lacey finally sees her daughter and hands her a letter. 

                                  LACEY
                          (to Jenna)
                    This came in the mail. 
                          (back into phone)
                    Are you kidding?!  Jim Donnahe s a 
                    plastic surgeon.  He would never 
                    sleep with her.  

      Jenna looks at her mom hoping she ll see the devastation 
      written all over her face.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    My mother always knew when 
                    something was wrong...

      Lacey looks at Jenna, concerned, then hands her a pile of 
      folded laundry.

                                  JENNA (V.O)
                      ...and promptly avoided the 
                      conversation.  

      Jenna heads out of the kitchen, dejected.

                                  LACEY
                    Sweetie?

      Jenna turns, hopeful.  Then, 

                                  LACEY
                    I m not paying Dominick to do your 
                    hair anymore if you aren t going to 
                    style it.                                                                                      6.



      In her room, Jenna s on her bed, LAPTOP on her lap.   

      ANGLE ON her computer screen. She s on her Facebook page.   
      Jenna s  Friends  bank is compiled with only 11 friends. 

      She types in  Matty McKibben  taking us to his page where we 
      notice Jenna s Awaiting Friend Confirmation.  

      Jenna closes it out and pulls up her online blog  Invisible 
      Girl Daily .  Her online diary. Thinking out loud:

                                  JENNA
                    What do I call the worst day of my 
                    life?

      She looks down at her red and raw inner thighs peeking out 
      from under her shorts.  She types as she answers her own 
      question:

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Rubbed Raw and Reeling.

      Suddenly an IM pops up from  SexieT :  Calling you! 

      Jenna s cell phone RINGS.  She picks up. 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      TAMARA (15, cherubic, boy-crazy, smarter than she thinks, not 
    as beautiful as she acts) sits on her bed snacking on 
      crackers while talking into the phone.

                                  TAMARA
                    Okay, don t tell me, let me see if 
                    I can guess.  I had this psychic 
                    moment today when my mom couldn t 
                    find her purse.  It was so freaky, 
                    I just knew it was in the car. 

                                  JENNA
                    Have at it, gypsy.  What do you 
                    see?

                                  TAMARA
                            (concentrating)
                    Okay, so I m sensing that Matty 
                    took you to the closet and...um, 
                    nada.  I got nothing.                                                                                      7.


                                  JENNA
                    Neither do I.

                                  TAMARA
                    He blew you off?! That s crap-ass.  
                          (beat)
                    But I sorta saw it coming. 

                                  JENNA
                    And you didn t warn me?

                                  TAMARA
                    It wasn t like I saw it psychically 
                    or anything.  It s just that guys 
                    like Matty, don t go for girls like 
                    us.  At least not until college 
                    when the playing field is leveled 
                    and our fourth grade indiscretions 
                    are erased.   

                                  JENNA
                    I peed my pants during an 
                      earthquake.  I was nine!  That s 
                    not an indiscretion.  And bringing 
                    that up isn t making me feel any 
                    better.

                                  TAMARA
                    I m sorry.  Look at the bright 
                    side, Matty didn t finger you, 
                    broadcast it to the entire band and 
                    then ditch you at the winter formal 
                    to hook up with  Scary Kerry .  
                    That was hard core humiliation.  In 
                    your scenario, at least nothing 
                    happened.  

                                  JENNA
                    Yeah, at least nothing happened.

      Jenna crosses her legs, cringing.

                                  TAMARA
                    I mean, can you even imagine how 
                    suicidal you d be if, god forbid, 
                    you actually took your shirt off?

                                  JENNA
                    I can only imagine.

                                  TAMARA
                    Jen, I sense some major depressed 
                    action on your end and you gotta 
                    snap out of it.

                                  TAMARA (CONT'D)
                    Marching band s having a kegger at 
                    Ricky Schwartz  house tonight.  I 
                    need my favorite wing woman there 
                    since Keiko s bagged out. 

                                  JENNA
                    Is she grounded again?

                                  TAMARA
                    Yeah, she can t get her PSAT scores 
                    above ten seventy.  Her parents are 
                    starting to think she might not be 
                    Japanese. 

                                  JENNA
                    That s not cool.

                                  TAMARA
                    I didn t say it.  Keiko did.  So, 
                    will you come? 

                                  JENNA
                    I ll think about it.  Call you 
                    later?

                                  TAMARA
                    I ll keep my phone up close and 
                    personal in anticipation.  It s on 
                    vibrate.

                                  JENNA
                    I just puked a little.

                                  TAMARA
                    That s my girl.  Now go sob in your 
                    blog.  And feel free to quote me. 

                                  JENNA
                    Thanks, mom.  I m hanging up now.

                                                                    END INTERCUT:

      Jenna hangs up and inches off her bed dropping the unopened 
      LETTER on the floor.  She looks at the mysteriously typed 
      envelope- no return address- and takes it to the bathroom.


      Jenna runs a bath then she sits on the edge of her tub.  She 
      opens the letter and as she reads her face falls.  As she 
      reads we hear the letter.                                                                                      9.


                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Jenna, as you are now, you could 
                    disappear and no one would notice.

      Jenna looks up. Mortified.  She looks at the bottom of the 
      letter, it s signed  A Friend .

                                  JENNA
                    Oh my god.

      She continues reading.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Below is a list of suggestions you 
                    should take into serious 
                      consideration.  Number one: It s 
                    time to be brave.

      There s more to list but Jenna puts it down before we catch 
      what s on it. Tears welling, Jenna returns to her room while 
      the bath runs.


      She goes to her phone. Looks at it-- then puts it down.  
      Instead she pulls up her online blog  Invisible Girl Daily . 

      As the cursor blinks, Jenna s lip starts to quiver.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      MINUTES LATER

      Jenna s typing away in a mad, sob-filled fury.  She types, 
      then deletes, then retypes some more. She stops to catch her 
      breath and to calm herself down.  She looks over at the 
      letter and we hear/see as she types...

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                            (devastated)
                    Whoever wrote the letter didn t 
                    pull any punches.  It was the truth 
                    and the truth hurt.   

      We now realize that Jenna s voice over is her blog.

                                  LACEY (O.C.)
                    Dinner in ten!!

    She puts her laptop down on her bed, then stops, thinks and 
      heads back to write one last sentiment (that we don t see).   

    She heads into the bathroom.                                                                                    10.



      Jenna turns off the water and looks at herself in the mirror.  

                                  JENNA
                    You do look awful.

      Jenna grabs the blow dryer and turns it on.  She gonna try to 
      do something to her hair.  As she attempts to tame her mane, 
      she sizes up a big Costco-sized bottle of aspirin in her 
      medicine cabinet.  

                                  JENNA
                    Costco, take me away.

      She puts down the blowdryer- still on- and she throws back 
      two pills without water then...starts choking, the pills are 
      lodged in her throat. 

        Immediately, she drops the bottle of pills, spilling them on 
      the floor.  

      In her attempt to cough up the pills, she slips on them 
      causing her to flail backwards, twisting her arm and knocking 
      her head on the side of the bathtub which launches the pills 
      out of her mouth while also simultaneously knocking the blow 
      dryer and a set of razors into the bathtub.  

      Suddenly, the circuit breakers shut off.  All the lights in 
      the house go dark.  Silence. 

      ANGLE ON the crazy bathroom and an unconscious Jenna in the 
      middle of the floor of pills as the blow dryer and razors 
      float on the surface of the water.... 

      Off camera we hear Jenna s mom running upstairs: 

                                  LACEY (O.C.)
                        Jenna?...Jenna?...JENNA!!!

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      Jenna s last blog entry still up on her computer screen:  

            Sometimes being a teenager makes you want to die.


      Jenna groggily comes to in a hospital room full of flowers, 
      balloons and get-well wishes.  

      PULL BACK to see that Jenna s in a NECK BRACE and her left 
    arm is in TRACTION.                                                                                      11.


      Next to her bed, Lacey s with her husband and Jenna s father, 
      KEVIN HAMILTON (30s, kind, insightful and grounded).  They re 
      standing with a DOCTOR, worried.

                                  DOCTOR
                      Physically, she s on the road to 
                    recovery but emotionally, it s 
                    going to be a long haul.

                                  LACEY
                    Why can t she just be like every 
                    other teenager and just starve 
                    herself?  I can wrap my head around 
                    that.  But this?

                                  KEVIN
                    Lacey, this isn t about you.  Our 
                    daughter is suicidal.

      WHIP PAN TO JENNA- her eyes now wide open.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    I wasn t suicidal!  

                                  DOCTOR
                    Did she exhibit any warning signs?

                                  KEVIN
                    She s always been a shy kid.  I 
                    didn t really think there was 
                    anything to worry about...

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Dad to the rescue.  He had my back. 

                                  KEVIN
                    ...until I found the note on her 
                    computer.


                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

            Sometimes being a teenager makes you want to die.

                                                                            BACK TO:

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    To clarify, it was just a dramatic 
                    teenage rant.  Not a cry for help.

                                  LACEY
                    She spends a lot of time alone on 
                    her computer.  Is that a sign?                                                                                    12.


      Jenna MOANS, constricted by her bandages.  

                                  KEVIN
                    Hey, sweetheart. 

      She MOANS again.  Lacey shushes her with her finger against 
      Jenna s lips as they wrap themselves around her.

                                  LACEY
                    It s okay, honey. Rest. 
                      Everything s going to be okay. 
                    You re going to be okay.

      As her parents coddle her, Jenna s eyes go wide with panic.

                                  JENNA  (V.O.)
                    This was a misunderstanding of epic 
                      proportions.  God, I wanted to die. 
                      I mean...you know what I mean.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    13.


                                        ACT TWO


      Students gossip in a quick series of shots:

    By the lockers...

                                  SPORTY BOY
                    That girl was in my Western Civ 
                    class last year.  I had no idea she 
                    was huffing spray paint...

    In the bathroom...

                                  NERDY GIRL
                    ...my mom s manicurist s friend s 
                    therapist was at the hospital when 
                    that girl came in.  I swear, it was 
                    pop rocks and coke... 

      Under the bleachers...

                                  STONER BOY
                    ....dude, way.  I heard when they 
                    pumped that girl s stomach they 
                    found like seven hundred pills. 

                                  STONER GIRL
                          (popping a pill)
                    What kind of pills?

    In the hall...

                                  EMO BOY
                    ...no, it was auto-erotic 
                      asphyxiation.
                          (tightening a skinny tie)
                    I love that girl.


      Jenna, now a little less banged up than before, sports a neck 
      brace and a cast on her arm, fixed in a L-shaped  raised 
      hand  position.  She carefully maneuvers down the hall 
        encountering the unabashed STARES and WHISPERS of passing 
      students. 

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    When I was initially charting my 
                    course to visibility, I really 
                    should have spent more time 
                    defining the kind of visibility I 
                    wanted.                                                                                    14.


      ANGLE ON a TINY TEENAGER being hassled by his friends who are 
      holding their noses and fanning their hands at him.

                                  TINY TEENAGER
                    It s not me.  I didn t do it!

      Jenna walks by and winces at the smell. 

                                  FRIEND OF TINY
                          (taunting)
                    Those who deny it, supply it...

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                      Ironically, that expression was 
                    also applicable to suicidal 
                      tendencies.  For two weeks, I tried 
                    to explain that my accident was 
                    just that, an accident.  But the 
                    more I denied it, the more worry I 
                    was supplied with.  Either way, the 
                    stink was hard to shake. 

      Jenna passes the MEMORIAL OF BRANDON TUCKER- a dead kid now 
      memorialized via a cheap plaque in the school hallway. 
      Flowers and stuffed animals are piled around the plaque. 

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Brandon Tucker was found slumped 
                    over a half-eaten peanut butter 
                    sandwich. Rumor had it he was 
                    allergic to the spread and 
                    purposely ate his way to the 
                    afterlife.  Personally, I think it 
                    was an impulsive craving gone bad. 

    As kids walk by looking at Jenna looking at the memorial,  
    the irony isn t lost on her.

                                  JENNA
                    R.I.P. Brando, I know the truth.

    The BELL RINGS taking us to:


      A CHALKBOARD spelling out  Sophomore English  written above 
    the title  HAMLET .  The ENGLISH TEACHER walks up and down 
    the aisle of students.

                                  ENGLISH TEACHER
                     Hamlet  is one of the most 
                    powerful and influential pieces of 
                    literature in the English language. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    15.

                                    ENGLISH TEACHER (CONT'D)
                    The famous expression  To be or not 
                    to be ... what do you think 
                    Hamlet s saying there?  Anybody?

      Nobody has any clue.  

                                    ENGLISH TEACHER
                    Hamlet s contemplating his death.

      The teacher catches a glimpse of Jenna.  He stops, then 
      quickly heads to the board, erasing the text. 

                                    ENGLISH TEACHER
                    On second thought, maybe we should 
                    start with something lighter. 

      Jenna closes her book, perturbed.


      Jenna sits in a stall.  Under the stall we see TWO PAIRS OF 
      FEET.

                                  GIRL #1
                    I can t believe that girl showed 
                    up.

                                  GIRL #2 
                    Shouldn t she be in a mental ward? 

      They laugh. 

      ANGLE ON Jenna s face. Near tears she awkwardly attempts to 
      hide her cast from peaking above the stall and makes a THUD.  
      The girls stop laughing.

                                  GIRL #1 (O.S.)
                    Shut up.  
                            (whispering)
                    She s in here.

      A LOCKER SMASHING SHUT TAKES US TO:


      PRINCIPAL JONES (50s, stoic and a bit disheveled) stands 
      before his student body on STAGE.  He s mid-lecture.                                                                                    17.


                                  PRINCIPAL JONES
                    For this reason, the administration 
                    has taken measures to implement a 
                    zero tolerance policy.  Any student 
                    caught bullying, being insensitive, 
                    or taunting their classmates will 
                    be suspended or expelled.  Not to 
                    mention, it will be reflected in 
                    your permanent record.

      Some students laugh.

                                  PRINCIPAL JONES
                    Reggie Maxwell, that includes 
                    youtube parodies.  Now, does 
                    anybody know how to spot a student 
                    in distress?

      He sees Jenna s lone cast in the air.

                                  PRINCIPAL JONES
                    You, in the back...

    The students, once again, shift their eyes toward Jenna. 

                                  JENNA
                    I m not raising my hand. 

    As she slinks in her seat we...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


    The students jam to exit the room, bumping into one another, 
    but taking great care to give Jenna space.  

                                  JENNA
                          (to Keiko)
                    Can you take the sign off my 
                    forehead that says  fragile ?

                                  KEIKO
                    It s not on your forehead. It s 
                    around your neck.

      Jenna tries to laugh.

                                  JENNA
                    Owww...I can t even freakin  laugh 
                    in this contraption.  Just go 
                    ahead, I m gonna wait out the herd.                                                                                     18.


                                  TAMARA
                    You sure?

                                  JENNA
                    Please pretend I m not handicapped.

      Keiko gives Jenna back her bag.

                                  KEIKO
                    Okay, okay, the short bus is 
                    leaving.

      Now alone, Jenna watches the room clear until she sees 
      something familiar...

      IN SLOW MOTION an arm lifts to expose an armpit to a sniff.  
      It s Matty, surrounded by a group of GORGEOUS GIRLS.

      RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Matty puts his arm down and his eyes 
      meet Jenna s.  

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    It was the first time we had seen 
                    each other since my deflowering...  

      He flashes his million dollar smile as a KID bumps into 
      Jenna s cast. 

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    ...and I d almost forgotten how 
                    jacked I looked.  I had to hide.

      But there s no where to run...even if she could. She finally 
      tries to appear nonchalant in her clunky brace  but to no 
      avail. She waves her cast. 

      Matty sweetly mouths:  Are you okay?   

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    It was a complicated question. 

      But before she can respond- the PA system blares:

                                  FEMALE (O.C.)
                          (over loudspeaker)
                    Jenna Hamilton please report to the 
                    office.

      Off Jenna s exasperated expression we...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    19.



      VALERIE MARKS (26, perky, annoyingly empathic and most 
      definitely still a virgin) sits across from Jenna.

                                    VALERIE
                    Jenna! Sooo nice to meet you! And I 
                    love your outfit. 

                                  JENNA 
                    Only took thirty minutes to put on.

      Valerie laughs.

                                    VALERIE
                    You go, girl!

      Jenna s awkward expression says it all: weird.

                                    VALERIE
                    So, I know that Mr. Michaels was 
                    your guidance counselor last year 
                    but considering your recent...

                                  JENNA
                    Accident.

                                    VALERIE
                    Yes, considering your recent 
                    accident, Mr. Michaels thought we 
                    might be better fit.  Ya know, girl 
                    on girl.  I mean, girl to girl.  
                    Sometimes it s easier to express 
                    yourself to your own kind. 

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    I m not sure what she was 
                      insinuating but she was definitely 
                    crossing lines.

                                    VALERIE
                    Your mom gave me a copy of the 
                    letter that you got in the mail. It 
                    wasn t very nice. 

                                  JENNA
                      Carefrontations never are.

                                    VALERIE
                    That s a nifty turn of phrase.

                                  JENNA
                    Nifty to say, not so nifty to get.                                                                                    20.


                                    VALERIE
                          (turning very serious)
                    So tell me, how d it make you feel 
                    when you read it?

                                  JENNA
                    Crappy?  But you should know that 
                    there s nothing to worry about.  I 
                    didn t try to kill myself. I mean, 
                    I have a seriously low threshold 
                    for pain.

                                    VALERIE
                    Oh, I m not suggesting that you did 
                    anything.  Not at all.  But for 
                    fun... would you mind if I looked 
                    through your bag?  Ya know, just 
                    wanna make sure we don t have any 
                    more  accidents . 

      Resigned, Jenna hands over her bag.  Valerie rummages through 
      Jenna s bag as she talks.

                                    VALERIE
                    We re gonna have awesome weekly 
                    chit chats.  Basically, I m here to 
                    ensure you have a happy, successful 
                    year.
                          (she pulls out a canister 
                          of pills; stern)
                    You weren t planing to ingest 
                    these, were you?

                                  JENNA
                    Actually, I was. They re breath 
                    mints.

      Valerie puts one in her mouth. Swashes it around.

                                    VALERIE
                    So they are.  
                          (sucking on mint)
                    Jenna, I had some troubles when I 
                    was your age, too.  Talk about 
                      disasters...

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    At that point, I was really 
                    starting to question the school s 
                    hiring practices.

                                    VALERIE
                    ...Ha! Who am I kidding? I m still 
                    a mess...
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
                          (getting serious again)
                    Which gives me a unique perspective 
                    to make strong connections with 
                    students like you.
                          (she pulls out lip gloss)
                    Stila.  Fancy. 

    She puts the lip gloss back in the bag and hands it over.

                                  VALERIE 
                    Do you have any questions? 

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    I had about a thousand but not one 
                    of them was appropriate.

                                  JENNA 
                    Nope.  I think you ve covered 
                      everything.

      Jenna gets up and is out the door when her cell phone BEEPS.  
    She looks down and opens a TEXT reading: 

      You re gonna kill this year!

      Another text BEEPS.  

      Just not yourself! - Valerie

      Jenna slowly looks through Valerie s door window....Valerie s 
      staring at her with a crazy smile.  Jenna awkwardly smiles 
      back then trudges on with a SIGH.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It s night.  Jenna s in her PJs looking at a Teddy Bear on 
      her desk when her dad knocks at the door.

                                  KEVIN
                    Ice cream?

                                  JENNA
                          (holding the bear)
                    Nanny cam?

                                  KEVIN
                    Damnit.  Nothing gets passed you.

                                  JENNA
                    I m fifteen.  I notice creepy 
                    stuffed animals in my room. 

                                  KEVIN
                    Will you just indulge your old man?                                                                                     32.


                                  JENNA
                    Show me an old man and I ll indulge 
                    him.

      Kevin wraps his arms around his daughter.

                                  KEVIN
                    You have no idea what I would do if 
                    I lost you.

                                  JENNA
                    I m okay, Dad. There s nothing to 
                    worry about.  I don t hate myself. 
                    Just high school.  But it s gonna 
                    end.  I know.  Eventually.

                                  KEVIN
                    Then I probably shouldn t tell you 
                    that high school starts in high 
                    school but it never ends.  Life, 
                      unfortunately, is high school.  

                                  JENNA
                    Your first instinct was right.  
                    Shoulda  kept that to yourself.

      Kevin sits down next to his daughter.

                                  KEVIN
                    No matter how old you get, you will 
                    always encounter people who are 
                    cruel and there are always going to 
                    be situations that make you feel 
                    bad.  You re never gonna be able to 
                    control the things that happen to 
                    you, sweetheart, but you will be 
                    able to control how you feel about 
                    them. 

                                  JENNA
                          (mocking him)
                    Turn your lemons into lemonade.

                                  KEVIN
                    Hey, I m trying. Can I have a 
                    little credit?

                                  JENNA
                    You can have all the credit you 
                    want.  You ll never max out with 
                    me, Dad.

      Kevin kisses his daughter on the forehead.                                                                                     33.


                                  KEVIN
                    I love you. 

                                  JENNA
                      I couldn t tell.

                                  KEVIN
                    Eat your ice-cream, smart ass. 

      He leaves as she moves to her desk, setting the bowl down. 

      ANGLE ON her computer. Using her good hand she slowly logs 
      onto her Facebook page and finds something unusual... 

      22 friend requests.  

      Jenna s taken aback.  She scrolls through them accepting one 
      after another as we hear the voices of students with their 
      messages of encouragement:  Kerry Shaw:  You rock balls!  
      Peter Dooner:  Will you marry me?  Cindie Zimmerman:  Way to 
      give it to Sadie!   

      She clicks on Jackson Narducci. There s no message but she 
      lingers on him. Curious.  Then, she sees the message of all 
      messages: Matty McKibben:  Thinking about you.   Jenna beams.

                    Things were looking up.
                          (she looks at her cast)
                    Besides my arm.

      She opens her desk drawer and pulls out the  letter .  
      Carefully unwrapping it, she looks to the list.

      ANGLE ON #1-  It s time to be brave.   With a sense of 
      accomplishment and Jackson s words ringing in her ears, she 
      crosses it off. She turns back to her computer and opens her 
      blog.

      CLOSE ON the title:  Invisible Girl Daily .  She puts the 
      cursor next to it and deletes.  

      Slowly, she types, spelling out  That...Girl...Daily .  She 
      moves the cursor down and starts a new entry.  We see/hear as 
    she pecks at the keys finger by finger.

                    Being  That Girl  was my new 
                    identity.  But I won t let it 
                    define me. I will define it.
