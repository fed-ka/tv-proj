      Witherspoon type, stopping her between classes, the two 
      talking loudly over the noise of students stampeding.

                                  KALINDA
                    What I don t understand, Miss 
                    Bauer, is I looked at your Student 
                    Profile Page and there s a 
                    different shot there.
                          (holds up the two photos)
                    See, this one is an earlier frame 
                    and this one is later-- from your 
                    cellphone video.

      Jenny looks up at  video -- uh-oh.  

                                  JENNY
                    Are you with the cops?

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, I was assigned to 
                    investigate.  

                                  JENNY
                    I erased it.

                                  KALINDA
                    The video?  I don t believe you.  
                    Someone who brags about helping the 
                    police on her Student Page isn t 
                    going to erase anything.

                                  JENNY
                    I have class.

    And Jenny starts off, books clutched to her chest, and...


      ...runs across the quad toward a brick sorority building...  


      ...to find Kalinda leaning casually there.  Yelping...

                                  JENNY
                    How d you...?

                                  KALINDA
                    Always know the shortcuts.

      Kalinda starts out the door, crossing the quad when...

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    What do you got?

      Kalinda smiles, turns to find Burton leaning against a wall.

                                  KALINDA
                    Detective Burton.  Funny to see you 
                    here.  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Comical.  Whaddayou got, Kalinda?

      Kalinda smiles, starts off.  Burton falls in behind her.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON (CONT D)
                    So this is what I hear.  Tell me if 
                    I m hot or cold.  You use cops, 
                    suck them dry of intel, then toss 
                    them aside.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Pretty much.  And you, let s see, 
                    how was it put to me?  You have an 
                      exquisitely complicated 
                      acquaintanceship with the truth.  
                          (off Burton s look)
                    You ve burned too many women not to 
                    have them talk.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    And that scares you?

      Kalinda laughs.  Are you fuckin  kidding?   

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON (CONT D)
                    You ve met your match, K.  You just 
                    don t know it yet.

      Kalinda stops.  Leans in toward Burton.  

                                  KALINDA
                    What are you looking for, 
                    detective?  You want to go steady 
                    or something?  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Chocolate malt with two straws. 

      Kalinda smiles.  Starts to say something.  Stops.  Then... 

                                  KALINDA
                    Good-bye, detective.  

    And she starts off.  Burton watches her go.


      Business hotel.  Right on the river.  On the nice side.


      Blue crisp skies.  Snow on the ground.  And a distant 
      smothered boom.  It s...
