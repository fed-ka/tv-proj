  POV -- the door of the Math Building.  CHARLIE walks out with 
  students, answers a question, heads off alone on a dark path.

  The POV follows Charlie into a dark, unseen area...

                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Charlie--

  Charlie turns, startled.  Face to face with RACHEL LAWTON (28-
  33).  Pretty in an unadorned way, face strained.

                                RACHEL
                Sorry, didn't mean to startle you--

  Charlie sees who it is --

                              CHARLIE
                Rachel?

                                RACHEL
                Hi Charlie--   

                              CHARLIE
                What are you doing here?  You still 
                working on the Geospatial project 
                at Stanford?          

                                RACHEL
                No, I -- listen, Charlie -- I'm 
                sorry to come to you like this, but 
                I need your help.  You and your 
                  brother's.

                              CHARLIE
                Why, what's going on?

  She hands him an envelope.  Her speech rushed, emotional.

                This is a list of people I know, 
                that I've worked with recently.  
                Three of them are now dead.  

                              CHARLIE
                Dead?  What--

                                RACHEL
                I think they found out something 
                they weren't supposed to know.  

  Charlie takes the list out, looking at it.

                                RACHEL (CONT'D)
                They were killed, even though it 
                doesn't look like it.  And I think 
                they're going to kill me as well.

                              CHARLIE 
                      (gently)
                Rachel, calm down.  Look, you know 
                if you take a group of random 
                people who've died in say the past 
                year, you'll find connections --     

  Rachel breaks in, her voice betrays rising fear.

                                RACHEL
                Don't you think I know that?  
                That's not what I'm talking about.  
                These aren't random people, they 
                had certain jobs-- 

                              CHARLIE
                All right -- I'm listening --    

                                RACHEL
                Charlie -- these people didn't die 
                over a year's time.  They died over 
                a two week period.  Two weeks. 

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, but Rachel, how did they die?  
                What's this all about? 

                                RACHEL
                I don't know.  I only worked on a 
                part of it.  

                              CHARLIE

                It's complicated.  I can't explain 
                it all right now.  Not here. 

                              CHARLIE
                You realize this sounds pretty wild 
                Have you gone to the police?

                                RACHEL
                I can't trust them.

                              CHARLIE
                But you can trust me?

                                RACHEL
                I know you.  I know you're who you 
                say you are.  If you take me to 
                your brother, I'll believe it's 
                your brother.

  She's crazy.  Trying to calm her, Charlie goes on -- 

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, Rachel, I'll take you to Don 
                  tomorrow.  At the FBI.  All right?    

                                RACHEL
                Yes.  Thank you.  I'll meet you 
                here tomorrow morning.  And I'll 
                bring documentation.  Just please, 
                look at those names.  They 
                  shouldn't be dead.  But they are.   

  Rachel turns to go.   

                              CHARLIE
                Rachel, take care.

  The Security Man stands off to the side.

                And you wind up with something you

                you're left with nothing.  Anyway,

                We re here about three people who 
                worked for you.

  David hands Tuttle three papers, each with a driver s license 
  photo and info.  Tuttle glances at them.

                Sam Chambers did research for me.  
                Not sure about the other two. 

                              DAVID
                They re also researchers.

                                TUTTLE 
                I hire a lot of consultants, don t 
                meet all of them in person.

  Not the slightest bit nervous or defensive.

  Tuttle eyes them oddly.

                Of course he does -- I m

                too many 3s and 7s.  And they don't 
                use enough 1s and 2s.  

                                OSWALD

  Millie smiles and heads off --

                              OSWALD
                Who's that?  She seems nice.

                              CHARLIE
                Dr. Finch, chair of the math, 
                physics and astronomy division. 

                                OSWALD 
                Really.  But she was, you know -- 

                              CHARLIE
                -- easy to talk to? 

                                OSWALD
                Okay, maybe.  But anyway-- 
                      (off the data)
                How do we find what this is?  

                              CHARLIE
                We've got math applications that 
                help analyze unlabeled sets of 
                numbers.  Items tend to come in 
                groups.  In a grocery store, a 
                dozen might mean a dozen eggs, a 
                half dozen would be bagels --

                                OSWALD
                --24 would be a case of beer --

                              CHARLIE
                It s called metadata -- information 
                about data.  For instance, the 
                numbers 1-2-3-4-5 are data.

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION:

  Handwritten numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 appear individually and 
  come together against a non-descript background.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They could refer to anything.  But 
                if you find out they re a zip code--

  PULL BACK to reveal it's on a STAMPED ENVELOPE -- in the area 
  one would find a zip code -- with no sending address.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They mean something specific.  In 
                this case, Schenectady, New York.

  ON THE ENVELOPE, a Schenectady, NY address burns in.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS  318/55  "Democracy"  BUFF Rev   2/21/07    22.

                So we use that to figure out what 
                Rachel s numbers are talking about--

  FBI sedan pulls up to a curb.  David and Colby get out. 

                              DAVID
                That the house?

                              COLBY
                Yeah, that's it.

  PARAMEDIC VAN in front of a home.  Emergency personnel 
  working, but not rushing.

  David and Colby go up to a Paramedic, David holds up his ID.

                slipped by the pool.  Hit his head, 
                fell in and drowned. 

  David and Colby exchange a look of grim realization -- then 
  start striding up the driveway -- 

                              DAVID
                Get everybody out, this is a crime

                in front of a judge.  It's like

                knows something's going on, but 
                nobody will talk about it.    

                              DON
                We need time.  Maybe if we put

  A MAN pulls a newspaper out of a vending machine, looks  
  around as he hurries up the street.  Nervous, watchful.

  Walks to a sedan, opens the driver s door.  Inside, clutter -- 
  clothing, food containers. 

  He gets in -- puts the key in the ignition.


  Colby and David have picked themselves off the street.  They 
  approach the burning wreck -- barely anything left.

                              DAVID
                  Detonated remotely?  Or a timer?

                You okay?

                              COLBY
                Didn t think I d be that close to a 
                car bomb again after Afghanistan.

  David has his cell, dialing.  Sirens in the distance.


  Pico sniffs the ground, walking along with Stacy. 

  A hooded FIGURE, shadowed by darkness, watches from the 
  shadows of trees.  As Stacy and the dog walk by, the hooded 
  figure starts to trail them.  Barely visible.

  Stacy looks around, as though sensing something, then walks 
  on more quickly.  Nervous. 

  The hooded Figure follows --  peering after her.

  Suddenly -- two MEN step into the Figure's path. 

  DAVID AND COLBY -- Colby holding up his badge.

  As David pulls back the hood.  Light catches the face--

  It's JANE ALIANO.  Scared to death.

  Colby walks with Don.

                              COLBY
                Aliano was hired to design a stock 
                analysis program, but she was told 
                it should also be able to alter 
                prices.  She didn't see the point, 
                but Tuttle was paying her a lot. 

                              DON
                Her program could change vote 
                counts?

                              COLBY
                  Apparently to a computer, stocks 
                and votes are the same -- just a 
                bunch of numbers --

  Don sees something --

                              DON
                What the hell--

  A black Mercedes rolls by.  The back passenger window down.  

  Tuttle inside, staring at Don.  Arrogant, challenging. 

  He and Don lock eyes.  Then, the window powers up, the car 
  pulls away.

                              COLBY
                That was Tuttle.

                              DON 
                Yeah. 

                              COLBY
                He's gonna try to get to Jane 
                Aliano.  That's a problem.

                              DON
                For us, and for him.     


  Jane in her hooded sweatshirt, with David and Colby, walking 
  quickly toward a car.  Jane holding her head down.

  They pass THREE MAINTENANCE MEN in work cloths, one working a 
  JACKHAMMER.  Another glances up as they pass.  

  With David, Colby and Jane as they walk --

  A POV COMING UP ON THEM FROM BEHIND

  The  Maintenance Men  following, closing the distance --

  Suddenly, DARK FIGURES rush from all sides --

  Colby and David turn, weapons up --

                              DAVID
                Get on the ground, now!

                              COLBY
                Do it!

  FBI SWAT -- assault rifles trained on the  Maintenance Men.   
  Each now seen holding a SILENCED GUN.

  David and Colby looking to "Jane."  Not Jane.  It's Megan.  


  Tuttle and TWO SECURITY MEN emerge from the house, walk to a 
  large sedan.  Don's SUV screeches to a stop, blocking the 
  sedan.  He jumps out.  The two security men step into Don's 
  path.  Don has one hand on his gun -- points with the other.

                              DON
                Don't.

  He pushes past them on his way to Tuttle.

                Agent Eppes.  I may be retired, but

                              DON
                We know what you did.  Election 
                fraud, conspiracy, murder. 

                                TUTTLE 
                You are constrained by limited 
                funds and inadequate manpower.  
                Plus you've got a suspect who's 
                made a full confession.  

                              DON
                He s lying.  We ll prove it.

                                TUTTLE
                You plan to spend the bureau's 
                  resources pursuing a case that's 
                already been solved?  Your 
                  superiors will see that as 
                  selective prosecution.  Especially 
                when members of Congress complain 
                to them about you.     

  He meets Don's eyes.

                                TUTTLE (CONT D)
                You're just one man.

                              DON
                      (matter of fact)
                So are you.

  Tuttle walks off.  Don watches after him.   NUMB3RS  318/55  "Democracy"  BUFF Rev   2/21/07    53.
