      HENRY IS STANDING AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE EXCEPT IN KATE'S 
      PLACE IS HENRY'S BEST FRIEND AND CO-WORKER, LARRY MEYER, 30. 
      HE'S CHUBBY, BEARDED, AND LOOKING MISERABLE.  THE OFFICE HAS 
      A SOFA AND TWO DESKS THAT FACE EACH OTHER.

                                  HENRY

                ...and we just stood like this, 

                staring into each other's eyes for I 

                don't know how long.  

                                  LARRY

                I don't know why we had to reenact it.

                                  HENRY

                I wanted you to get a sense of how 

                powerful the moment was.

                                  LARRY

                I want to let go of your hands now.

      LARRY PULLS AWAY AND CROSSES TO HIS DESK.

                                  HENRY

                I don't feel like you're happy for me.

                                  LARRY

                So all you did was save a person's 

                life and meet the girl of your dreams?  

                You didn't do anything the rest of the 

                night?  Like catch a bank robber or 

                have X-ray vision?

                                  LARRY

                This stuff doesn't happen to real 

                people!

                                  HENRY

                What was I supposed to do?  Let the 

                guy jump?

                                  LARRY

                Yes!  Yes, you were.

                                  HENRY

                I'm not gonna let you ruin this, 

                Larry.

                                  LARRY

                  (NOTICING BEHIND HENRY) Hey, you know 

                who's gonna love your story?  Erin.

                                  HENRY

                Not letting you ruin it.

                                  LARRY

                I'm not trying to ruin it.  I'm just --

                                  HENRY

                I feel too good.  You should have seen 

                me on my run this morning.  I was 

                taking these huge, ostrich steps --

                                  LARRY

                  (BLURTING)  Erin's coming!

      AND WITH THAT, HENRY DIVES BEHIND THE COUCH, RIGHT BEFORE 
      ERIN ADAMS, A PRETTY WOMAN IN HER LATE TWENTIES, ENTERS.

                                  ERIN

                It smells weird in here."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       11.


                                  LARRY

                Oh, hey, Erin.  Well, you know what 

                they say: she who smelt it --

                  (UNAMUSED) Where's Henry?

                                  LARRY

                But in this case it was in fact I who 

                dealt it.

                                  ERIN

                Just tell him I'm looking for him.

      ERIN EXITS.  HENRY REAPPEARS.

                                  LARRY

                Does it make you uncomfortable that 

                she clearly has a thing for me?

      HENRY STARTS PACING, LOOKING VERY TROUBLED.

                                  LARRY (CONT'D)

                Uh-oh.  Those don't look like ostrich 

                steps.

                                  HENRY

                God, I feel bad.  I thought I loved 

                her.  I mean, she's so smart and 

                pretty and funny...well, not funny.

                But I was prepared to lead a laughter-

                free existence with her.  It's just I 

                know now we're not supposed to be 

                  together.  Which is what I'm going to 

                tell her.  Soon."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       12.


                                  LARRY

                How have you avoided her this long?

                                  HENRY

                I've jumped behind a lot of things.  

                (OFF LARRY'S LOOK)  I don't like to 

                rush things.  (THEN, ADMITTING)  I 

                don't like when people are mad at me.  

                                  LARRY

                I'm mad at you.

                                  HENRY

                I don't mind when you're mad at me. 

                (THEN)  Hey, I'm meeting Kate tonight -

                                  LARRY

                Because you don't like to rush things.

                                  HENRY

                  (IGNORING HIM)  And we're both 

                bringing friends --

                                  LARRY

                Nope.

                                  HENRY

                Do we really have to do this?  You 

                always say nope and then you come.  

                                  LARRY

                Well, not this time, because this 

                time... Eh, forget it, I'll come.

                                  HENRY

                There you go.  Maybe you'll have fun."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       13.


                                  LARRY

                No.  Don't pretend I'm going to get 

                anything out of it.  You'll go off 

                with Meg Ryan and I'll be at the bar 

                with her "interesting" friend.  You 

                know what I find interesting?  Large 

                boobs.  And the best friend never has 

                large boobs.


      START TIGHT ON CONNIE GRABOWSKI'S FAIRLY FLAT CHEST.  CONNIE 
      IS 29 AND SHE'D BE ATTRACTIVE IF SHE GAVE A SHIT.  HER HAIR'S 
      A MESS.  SHE'S WEARING A BIG GRAY SWEATSHIRT THAT SAYS 
      'CALIFORNIA.'  WE'RE IN A LARGE, FANCY UPPER EAST SIDE 
      KITCHEN, WHERE CONNIE'S POURING COFFEE AND LISTENING AS KATE, 
      DRESSED FOR WORK, TELLS ABOUT LAST NIGHT.  IN THE B.G., A 
      VERY YOUNG, PLAYBOY PLAYMATE TYPE, TIFFANY MCDERMOTT (21), IS

                He wouldn't call himself that.  The 

                Times would, but he wouldn't.

                                  CONNIE

                Tiffany, please... as I've told you 

                everyday since I started working here 

                ten months ago, call me Connie.  And 

                it's 8:57.  I think I've also 

                  mentioned I don't start taking care of 

                your kids until nine.

                Sorry.  (RE: BABIES) I just feel like 

                they're mad at me.

                honey.  (THEN, TO CONNIE)  I swear 

                I've never felt anything like it.  It 

                was like this magnetic force that was 

                pulling me toward him.

                  McDonald's, I close my eyes and when I 

                open them, I'm in there, eating fries.

                No.  (OFF KATE'S LOOK) I'm not your 

                friend.  I'm your cousin.

                You guys are cousins?  (OFF CONNIE'S 

                LOOK)  I'm sorry.  I don't see it.

                (TO CONNIE)  I thought you'd be 

                excited to meet this guy.  I mean, I 

                can already tell Henry's great and if 

                his friend is anything like him --

                                  CONNIE

                He's not like him.  Good guys are like 

                golden tickets: there's only five of 

                them.  If Henry actually is a good 

                guy, that's one so the other four are 

                probably in Asia and South America.

                Okay.  If I can't convince you I'm 

                just gonna give up and go to work.

                No, don't do this.  I know what you're 

                about to--no, no, no!

      BECAUSE KATE HAS SUDDENLY TURNED AND RUN AT CONNIE.  SHE 
      TACKLES HER, WRESTLING HER TO THE GROUND AND PINNING HER ARMS

                Scary.  (THEN)  Now you seem related.


      IT'S A LITTLE BEFORE SIX IN THIS CROWDED, COZY BAR.  CONNIE 
      IS THERE, LOOKING ANNOYED.  SHE'S MADE ONLY A SMALL EFFORT 
      WITH HER APPEARANCE.  LARRY ENTERS AND, NOT SEEING HENRY,

                I'll take that as a 'yes.'  (AS HE 

                SITS)  Do I know you?

                Do people really say that?

                                  LARRY

                I'm serious.  You look familiar.

                                  CONNIE

                You actually look familiar, too.  But 

                that could be because I used to go to 

                a lot of pedophile conventions.

                                  LARRY

                I always thought it was cool when I 

                saw women at those.

                                  CONNIE

                There's the smile.  Don't feel bad.  

                Much hotter women than you have been 

                broken down by my charms."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       18.


                                  CONNIE

                No, you have no charms.  I smiled 

                  because...  You know how when you're 

                doing something excruciating, like 

                taking a test, or watching a Vin 

                Diesel movie, you think about when it 

                will be over in really specific detail 

                and it's that thought that gets you 

                through?

                                  LARRY

                Like a rainbow at the end of a storm?

                                  CONNIE

                Well, sure, but I didn't realize I was 

                talking to a five-year-old girl.

                                  LARRY

                It's funny you should mention a five-

                year-old girl, because chest-wise

                I'm just saying it's a fairly simple 

                concept and there's no need to drag 

                Vin Diesel into it, who's a legitimate 

                action star who can also play a lawyer 

                as he did in the underrated "Find Me 

                Guilty."

                Anyway, I was just thinking about how 

                in a couple minutes I'll never have to 

                speak to you again and that thought 

                made me smile without even trying.

                kind of thing where you say, I'll get

      BACK AT THE TABLE, KATE AND CONNIE ARE TALKING.

                                  CONNIE

                I'm just wondering if it would be a 

                good idea to take a breath, go home 

                and, you know, make sure he's not -- 

                                  KATE

                He's nothing like Sebastian.

                You don't...  Whoa, I thought we were 

                never allowed to say that name.

                                  KATE

                  Sebastian, Sebastian, Sebastian!  I'm 

                over him, Connie.  It took a year and 

                lots of therapy and way too many 

                animal adoptions, but it's over.  I 

                know Henry's different.  (THEN) Come 

                to his apartment.  It feels slutty to 

                go without you.

                                  CONNIE

                (BEAT)  Fine, but I don't want to be 

                alone with the hairy guy anymore.

      CONNIE AND LARRY SIT ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER IN THE LIVING 
      ROOM AS HENRY AND KATE FINISH THEIR TOUR OF THE APARTMENT.

                I guess I'd consider having sex with 

                you.

                                  CONNIE

                If the only thing that was produced in 

                the world was alcohol -- so I'm 

                  imagining a world where all the 

                textiles and oil and lumber and ore 

                are instead alcohol -- there still 

                wouldn't be enough alcohol in the 

                world for me to sleep with you.

                used to play Fairy Tale.  Kate was

                know.  She won.  Since we were babies, 

                people felt sorry for me.  Even my 

                parents like her better.  I like her 

                better.

                I like her better.  (THEN, GETTING UP)  

                Well, those two are done for the 

                night.  I guess we could go.

                I've made my point about the Mets.

                They can feed themselves?

      WE ANGLE BACK ON OSCAR WHO IN THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME HAS 
      COVERED HIMSELF WITH FOOD.  CONNIE COMES AND TAKES OVER.

                                  CONNIE

                I bet it's Larry's phone.  I guarantee 

                that was his brilliant idea.  "Use my 

                phone.  That'll fool her."  If there's 

                one person you'd want to talk to less 

                than Henry, it's Larry.

                The most irritating guy.  Just the 

                sound of his voice...


      THE APARTMENT IS A MESS.  A DIRTY AND UNSHAVEN HENRY HAS A 
      CELL PHONE TO HIS EAR WHEN WE HEAR A TOILET FLUSH.

                                  LARRY (O.S.)

                I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a 

                plunger on this one.

      KATE STARES OUT THE WINDOW, CATATONIC.  CONNIE'S SPEAKING 
      ANIMATEDLY TO TIFFANY.

                                  CONNIE

                Here's Larry: when I told him I was a 

                nanny for a twin boy and girl he asked 

                if it ever seemed like they were 

                  attracted to each other.

                                    TIFFANY

                You're talking about Larry a lot.

                                  CONNIE

                I know!  It's like an annoying song 

                that you can't get out of your head.

                                    TIFFANY

                Only songs I like get stuck in my 

                head.

                                  CONNIE

                Really?  You like "Tubthumping"?  (OFF 

                  TIFFANY'S NOD)  "Mmmbop?"  (ANOTHER

                No, I don't like that one.

                                  CONNIE

      CONNIE CROSSES TO KATE, SHIFTING FOCUS.

                                  CONNIE

                Okay, this is exactly what happened 

                with Sebastian.  You were angry for a 

                couple days and then you just got 

                quiet.  For a year.  You need to 

                confront this guy.  Face to face.  Get 

                some closure.

                                  KATE

                I don't like confrontation.

                                  CONNIE

                That's okay.  I like confrontation 

                enough for both of us.

      SHE PULLS KATE UP AND THEY START OUT.  TIFFANY CLEARS HER 
      THROAT.  CONNIE STOPS.

      FRAGMENTS OF MANY PHONES.  EVEN THE HOUSE PHONE IS BROKEN.  
      HENRY'S ON THE COUCH.

                I know it seems like I'm overreacting.

                                  HENRY

                But when I looked into her eyes I saw 

                us sitting out on the front porch, our 

                kids around us, a couple dogs, our 

                clothes drying on the line...  I need 

                to find out if she's the one.

                are.

                our penises touch we must never speak 

                of it, even if we're in a fight.

                The good news is, I'm not going 

                  anywhere.  The bad news is, Henry's 

                taking off but that seems sort of like 

                no news compared to the good news.

                                  HENRY

                  I wouldn't be good company tonight.

      STRETCHES MINIMALLY, AND PROCEEDS TO  WORK OUT  FOR LESS THAN 
      A MINUTE.  HE HITS THE STOP BUTTON, WIPES HIS DRY BROW, AND 
      THEN NOTICES CONNIE ON ONE OF THE ELLIPTICAL MACHINES.  

      SHE IS WEARING A BAGGY HOODED SWEATSHIRT, AND BIG SUNGLASSES.  
      SHE LOOKS ANGRY AT THE MACHINE AS SHE WORKS OUT.  WHEN SHE 
      SEES LARRY LOOKING AT HER, SHE LOOKS DOWN, BUT IT'S TOO LATE.  
      HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER.

                                  LARRY

                I knew I knew you!  You're the lady 

                who always looks mad at the machines.

                                  LARRY

                What can I say, I don't sweat.  I'm 

                like Roger Federer.

                                  CONNIE

                You're like Roger Ebert.

      A BEAT, AS SHE CONTINUES TO WORKOUT.

                                  LARRY

                Not that it's any of my business, but 

                it seems a little harsh that your 

                friend wouldn't even take Henry's 

                calls so he could explain himself.

                                  CONNIE

                Well, it's none of my business but I 

                don't think she wanted to hear it from 

                a guy who was making out with a skank 

                in a bar like two days after he was 

                  supposedly heartbroken.  (OFF LARRY'S 

                LOOK) She came to forgive him.  At 

                that bar you guys go to.

      LARRY LOOKS CONFUSED, THEN PUTS IT TOGETHER.

      THEY'VE MOVED TO A LITTLE TABLE.  LARRY IS FINISHING THE LAST 
      BIT OF A SMOOTHIE.

      LARRY PUTS THE CUP DOWN, WIPES HIS BEARD INEFFECTIVELY.

                                  LARRY

                Quite to the contrary.

                                  CONNIE

                (RE: BEARD) So charming.

                                  LARRY

                Thanks for the smoothie.

                                  CONNIE

                Well, you earned it out there.

                                  LARRY

                I would have paid for it myself, but I 

                never bring my wallet when I'm working 

                out.  It restricts my motion.  And as 

                a thank you, you know what I'm not 

                going to do?  I'm not going to burp. 

                                  CONNIE

                Do we really have to get them back 

                  together?  Because then I'm going to 

                have to see more of you.

                                  LARRY

                So, here's what I think we should 

                do... (THEN, TOUCHING HIS CHEST) And 

                there is a burp right here.  But 

                that's where it's going to stay. 

                                  CONNIE

                What do you mean 'what you think we 

                should do'?  I'll just tell Kate."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       45.


                                  LARRY

                No.  No, no, no.  You know why?  

                Because that's not romantic. 

      CONNIE JUST SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                  LARRY (CONT'D)

                Hey, no one hates all that mumbo jumbo 

                more than me, but Henry's a good 

                friend.  I score a lot of women I 

                might not score because of him.

                                  CONNIE

                Who says you're not romantic?

                I'm just saying, since that kind of 

                stuff is never gonna happen for us --

                                  CONNIE

                Don't lump me in with your sad life.

                                  LARRY

                Oh, yeah.  Your prince is gonna come.

                                  CONNIE

                Damn right he will.

                                  LARRY

                Well, in case he doesn't, maybe 

                playing a minor role in the romance of 

                their lives is the closest we're gonna
