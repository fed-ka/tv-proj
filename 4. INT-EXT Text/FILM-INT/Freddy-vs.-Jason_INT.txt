Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.
She
tries to open it -- locked.
Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.
She listens,
trying to make out the low murmur.
Then a little girl's
GIGGLE.
Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.
MEAGAN
Lizzy?
Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
belonging to Freddy).
Meagan enters a door at the
end of the hallway, moving into...
On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
old sister -- LIZZY.
Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
draws with crayons.
MEAGAN
Lizzy. What are you doing here?
LIZZY
Playing with my friend.
Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
of Freddy.
MEAGAN
Your friend?
LIZZY
He lives under the bed.
Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
Lizzy's bed.
Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
the door.
Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
tiny slash marks on her cheek.
Lizzy clucks.
LIZZY
(continuing)
You scared him...
Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.
MEAGAN
I scared him?
But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Lizzy?
Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
in the...
The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.
Meagan
goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.
Inside
-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
all over it.
Meagan screams and slams the lid back
down.
The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
Then it stops.
Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.
Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.
He grabs her arm.
FREDDY
Where ya been all my death, baby?
Meagan screams.
Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
tuxedo, crooning:
FREDDY
(continuing)
I've been waitin' at the altar for
a long, long time!
Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
spattered with blood.
Behind her, the chapel has
filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
of decay.
A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
asks:
SATANIC PRIEST
Are the bridesmaids in attendance?
Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
dressed in body bags.
SATANIC PRIEST
(continuing)
And the groomsmen...?
Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.
SATANIC PRIEST
(continuing)
If anyone here believes that these
two should not be joined in unholy
matrimony, let him speak now or
forever rot in hell...
>From the back of the chapel, a voice:
JESSE
Meagan!
Meagan turns.
It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.
He stands
in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
outstretched.
MEAGAN
Jesse!
Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
encircling one another.
She looks up into Jesse's
eyes... only it isn't Jesse.
It's Jason.
Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
it down between her eyes...
TRANSITION CUT TO:
Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
was dreaming.
She gets up quickly and crosses to her
dresser.
She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
on her cheek, and clucks.
Then she exits, going into...
Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
with a doll.
Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
she notices something not quite right about the doll.
She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
a hideous little Freddy doll.
Meagan gasps.
MEAGAN
Freddy...
Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:
FREDDY DOLL
Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!
The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.
HARD CUT TO:
Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
dream.
ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.
Meagan sits up
with a start again.
Her fright turns to rage as she
pounds the alarm clock into submission.
Meagan climbs
out of bed...
Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
her Raggedy Ann doll.
She gently pries the doll away,
tossing it disdainfully away.
Meagan picks up a small
glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
head.
MEAGAN
Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
up.
Lizzy's eyes flutter open.
She smiles at her sister,
then frowns.
LIZZY
I had a bad dream.
MEAGAN
Me, too.
LIZZY
I was scared.
MEAGAN
Don't worry... they can't hurt you.
LIZZY
Promise?
MEAGAN
Promise.
Lizzy hugs Meagan.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
I'll never let anyone hurt you.
CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.
A
NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
house.
NEWS REPORTER
(filtered)
As the sun rises on yet another
morning, still no end in sight for
the standoff between police and the
mysterious group known only as the
"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
house behind me just thirteen days
ago.
These cultists -- mostly run-
away teenagers -- have managed to
keep police at bay for almost two
weeks while inside they take mind-
altering narcotics in order to
communicate with their god --
Freddy.
The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
down orange juice.
Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
who is having coffee, reading the paper.
Meagan pours
herself a cup and sits.
MEAGAN
Morning.
Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.
Dad
looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
just a little too cheerfully:
MEAGAN'S DAD
Morning, Meagan.
Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
Meagan's mom bellows:
MEAGAN'S MOM
(calls upstairs)
Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
is almost ready!
Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
into his paper.
Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.
ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.
NEWS REPORTER
Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
was released on a legal technicality
but later burned to death at the
hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
parents.
Some years later, a rash
of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
age deaths began leaving many in
the area to wonder... is Freddy
really dead?
Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
breakfast.
The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
family like playing cards.
Lizzy picks up her Pop
Tart, whining.
MEAGAN'S MOM
Hurry up and eat. You don't want
to be late for special school.
MEAGAN
Mom! Don't call it that!
LIZZY
I hate that school. The other kids
are mean... and they're all re-
tard-ed!
Meagan snickers.
MEAGAN'S MOM
We don't use that word. They're
"special" children just like you're
"special".
Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
the paper.
ANGLE ON TV --
NEWS REPORTER
The cult members have declined to
an on-camera interview but did send
out a note with a message. The note
-- which, by the way, appears to
have been written in blood -- reads...
(reads the note)
To the parents of Springwood --
Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
take one of your children as his
virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
to rise and rule the darkness forever
and ever.
A horn TOOTS outside.
MEAGAN
That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.
Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
dad's cue to look at his watch and say:
MEAGAN'S DAD
Oh, look at the time! I've got to
be going... anyone need me to bring
anything home tonight?
MEAGAN
I need an alarm clock.
MEAGAN'S DAD
What's wrong with your old one?
MEAGAN
Broke.
Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
door.
Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:
MEAGAN'S MOM
We're almost out of vodka.
Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
say something.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Do you have to watch that crap all
the time? Months and months of the
O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...
Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
into her orange juice.
She takes a deep drink and
switches the set back on.
CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.
NEWS REPORTER
I'm standing here with State Trooper
Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
Governor has called in to deal with
the cultists because of his past
experience with occult-style
murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
is the only law enforcement officer
ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
killer -- Jason Voorhees.
(to Murdoch)
You received some pretty nasty
injuries in your battle with Jason,
didn't you, Captain?
MURDOCH
Nothing serious... just a few
stitches.
NEWS REPORTER
What about these so called "Freddy"
cultists? They seem like pretty
tough customers. Think you'll have
any trouble getting them out of
there?
MURDOCH
No. Now that the Governor has given
me complete authority to deal with
these punks I should be putting an
end to their situation pretty quick.
Unless of course their attorney is
able to get them to come out peace-
fully... but I don't hold out much
hope for that.
NEWS REPORTER
(to camera)
Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
criminals.
CUT TO:
Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
disfigured faces.
The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
neatly on his lap.
Then he lifts his head, wiping
his nose nervously as he speaks:
SLEAZY LAWYER
So, as I explained to you before,
the revenues between the TV movie
deal and the book sale should be
adequate to fund your joint-defense.
And I think with my mass media
hypnosis argument I could get each
of you a reduced sentence on appeal
-- say... twenty years each. Out
in fifteen with good behavior?
Hmmmmm?
HARD CUT TO:
WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
S.W.A.T. team move in.
The windows have been covered
with foil, the walls have been painted black with
cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
black as pitch.
The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
night vision goggles and starts moving through the
house.
P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
the computer game DOOM).
Then a blinding flash of
light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
face.
Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
team deeper into the house.
As one of the S.W.A.T.
guys follows his foot trips a wire.
A trap door
opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
a pit, waist deep in water.
Suddenly, the water
starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
a tank of piranhas!
Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
his arms and pull him out.
Too late -- his legs
have been shredded to the bone.
Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
steps in, FIRING his machine gun.
A large scythe
swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
gun.
The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
bolted over head.
They swing like monkeys across
the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
room behind them.
CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
covered with upturned nails.
Several nails puncture
both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
barrels into the room to see what is wrong.
He knocks
the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.
Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
cultists as they try to escape out a window.
As
the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:
MURDOCH
Freeze!
Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.
The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
cocktails.
Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.
The cultists
thunder down a back staircase to the...
The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
house and most escape through the underground tunnel
just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
the basement.
As the last of the remaining cultists
is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.
The
S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Hold your fire!
He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
flashlight into the basement.
Through the dense
smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
to a chair sitting on a crate.
Underneath the chair
-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...
LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
Help me, mister... please.
The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
down to look at the bomb.
Then he takes a Leatherman
tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
timer.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Hang on, honey... I'll have you
out of there in a second.
Murdoch comes down the stairs.
He goes to the secret
passageway and says:
MURDOCH
Looks like we'll have to hunt the
rest of them down. Let's go before
they get too far.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
We can't leave! Can't you see
we've got a situation here?
Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.
MURDOCH
Leave her.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
You're crazy! I can't just leave
her!
MURDOCH
Forget it. I've seen this before.
There's nothing you can do.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
I've got to try...
The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
to work on the bomb again.
CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
23... 22...
The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
team.
Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.
MURDOCH
You're wasting your time.
The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
13...
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Fuck it!
The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
and cuts the little girl loose.
He carries her out
in his arms as he shouts to his men:
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
(continuing; yelling)
CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!
The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
bringing up the rear.
CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
LIVES!
We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.
The
instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.
MISS KREPPS
(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)
It's hot.
Several of the kids fan themselves,
struggling to stay awake while others have already
passed out on their desks.
Meagan's eyes are heavy.
She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
in his book, fast asleep.
The antique oscillating
fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
on:
MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)
Meagan starts to drift off, when...
MISS KREPPS
(continuing; loud)
Meagan!?
MEAGAN
Yes, ma'am?
MISS KREPPS
I asked if you were ready to give
your oral report?
MEAGAN
Yes... I'm ready.
MISS KREPPS
Please come up here to the podium.
Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
snickers of some of her classmates.
Miss Krepps
snaps her fingers for quiet.
MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
You won't think it's funny when
you haven't learned the fundamentals
of a free market economy... oh,
why do I waste my breath? You're
all going to grow up to be gas
station attendants and waitresses
anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.
MEAGAN
My report is on Global Economic
Trends.
(clears throat;
begins reading)
Try and think of a world where there
is no poverty... no sickness... no
crime. A world where everyone is
happy to be alive and everyone lives
together in peace. This is my dream.
The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
BLOWING harder.
Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
with her report.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
This dream is becoming a reality
with ever-growing international
business...
CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
turning into a Freddy-fan.
BLOWING harder... CLICKING
louder.
MISS KREPPS
Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.
Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
voice to be heard over the fan.
Then pages of her
report start to blow away.
She grabs at them as the
WIND increases.
A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.
She bends over
to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.
She presses
it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
billows up, revealing her underwear.
The class roars
with laughter.
MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
Louder, Meagan... we still can't
hear you.
But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
the WIND blows her skirt off.
Her classmates fall
over themselves, laughing.
RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
blows away.
She tries to hide behind the podium when
that too is swept off.
Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
to drift away -- thread by thread.
She is almost
naked.
Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
face.
Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.
And up front,
in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:
FREDDY
Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
to blow!
Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
of cloth that cover her body.
She calls to Jesse,
pleading:
MEAGAN
Jesse... please, help me.
But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.
He reaches
up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
expressionless face.
FREDDY
Looks like a photo opportunity to
me!
Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
flashgun attached.
The flash bulb is the size of a
beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
front.
Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
sneers:
FREDDY
(continuing)
Say... cheesecake!
PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
light.
Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
against the blackboard -- vaporized!
HARD CUT TO:
Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.
The classroom
as normal.
Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:
MISS KREPPS
Meagan? Meagan?!
Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.
MISS KREPPS
(continuing)
I asked if you were ready to give
your report?
Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
herself together.
MEAGAN
Sure...
Meagan stands up and faints.
DISSOLVE TO:
MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
standing over her.
SCHOOL NURSE
Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
know where you are?
Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.
MEAGAN
I was day dreaming and then I woke
up but then it was like I was still
dreaming and then I woke up and
then I guess I fainted and now I'm
awake again...
SCHOOL NURSE
Are you sure?
Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.
SCHOOL NURSE
(continuing)
Meagan?
MEAGAN
I'm waiting to see if you're going
to turn into Freddy.
SCHOOL NURSE
Freddy... I see. You've been watching
too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
cult thing -- it's all over the TV
day and night -- you can't get away
from it. No wonder you kids are all
having nightmares.
MEAGAN
But this one was different... it
felt real.
SCHOOL NURSE
But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
aren't real. They're just broken
fragments of the subconscious mind.
MEAGAN
Fear is real though, isn't it? And
if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
that make them real?!
(gets excited)
And if the nightmares are real then
is reality like a dream?!
SCHOOL NURSE
(cutting her off)
Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
that's all.
The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.
Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
nurse's office, muttering under her breath:
MEAGAN
Old witch... what does she know?
She isn't even qualified to give a
shot and she's telling me that my
dreams aren't anything to worry
about.
JESSE
So she said you were okay?
MEAGAN
Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
says it's just a case of heat pro-
stration and an overdose of TV news.
Ruined my makeup, too.
JESSE
So you're going back to class?
MEAGAN
No. She gave me last period off.
JESSE
Well, what are you bitching about?
I could have a compound fracture of
the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
from P.E.
MEAGAN
Jesse! I've been having nightmares
for almost two weeks now and they
keep getting worse! Now I'm having
daymares! I want to know why!
JESSE
Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
it was heat probation?
Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.
MEAGAN
You don't understand... I want to
know more about dreams. What they
mean... why we have them.
JESSE
Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
got the rest of the day off, that's
all I'm saying.
MEAGAN
That's a good idea. Why don't you
cut last period and come with me?
JESSE
Sure. Where are we going?
MEAGAN
The library.
JESSE
You want me to cut school so we can
go to the library?
CUT TO:
Meagan pours through a big psychology book.
Across
the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.
MEAGAN
Find anything?
Jesse looks up suddenly.
JESSE
What? Oh, no... nothing yet.
Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.
MEAGAN
Did you know that our sub-conscious
retains everything that ever happened
to us? Everything. From the time
we're born until we die.
JESSE
Really?
MEAGAN
That's how Freddy gets at us...
by using our sub-conscious fears.
Fears our conscious minds have
repressed or forgotten.
JESSE
I've got a news flash for you...
Freddy's dead.
MEAGAN
I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
in our sub-conscious then he can
never be fully erased. Like a bad
memory... you may blot it out of
your mind but it will alway be
hiding someplace in your dreams.
(off Jesse's
disbelieving stare)
Weren't you scared as a child by
something so stupid that you're
ashamed to admit it?
JESSE
No.
MEAGAN
No?
JESSE
Well, yeah.
MEAGAN
Well, what? What is it?
JESSE
Well... when I was kid, my brother
took me to the carnival. And in the
penny arcade there was this robot
gunslinger...
MEAGAN
Black Bart.
JESSE
You know about Black Bart?
MEAGAN
Duh. You put your quarter in and he
says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
And then you pull your gun out and
shoot him.
JESSE
That's just it -- I never could!
I'd point the gun right at him and
shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
So I always got killed.
MEAGAN
No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.
JESSE
Scared the shit out of me.
Meagan tries to hide her smile.
JESSE
(continuing;
flustered)
Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
kid?
Meagan laughs.
Somebody shushes her.
JESSE
(continuing;
mad)
Okay, smartass... what about you?
What scared you the most as a kid?
A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.
MEAGAN
I remember... Lizzy wandered off
one day and we couldn't find her.
The police came and everything. I
wasn't really worried until I saw
her picture on TV... then I got
really scared.
(then)
Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
think something bad's going to
happen.
DISSOLVE TO:
COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
calling for her family.
Jesse enters behind her when
Meagan's dad comes up, asking:
MEAGAN'S DAD
Didn't you get my message?
MEAGAN
What message?
MEAGAN'S DAD
I called the school after lunch...
I had to stay late after work...
I...
Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
she is talking to a policeman taking notes.
She is
drunk and has been crying.
MEAGAN'S MOM
Don't you dare blame this on her,
you sorry bastard! It's all your
fault!
(to Meagan)
Where have you been anyway?
MEAGAN
The library.
MEAGAN'S MOM
A likely Goddamn story!
Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.
MEAGAN
Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
Where's Lizzy?
MEAGAN'S DAD
She didn't come home from school
today. The police got a report that
a girl fitting Lizzy's description
was forced into a car by some
crazies. They're pretty sure it was
this "Freddy" cult.
MEAGAN
(shocked)
Oh, my God...
Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
comfort her.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Now don't worry. The police are
doing everything they can.
Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
men when a voice from upstairs calls down:
TROOPER
(O.S.)
Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
up here!
As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
the small glass menagerie there.
Murdoch picks up
the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
attention to the floor next to the bed.
Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
the top.
Meagan enters and sees the drawings.
She gasps.
TROOPER
Looks like she was in the cult all
along.
MEAGAN
No... no, she wouldn't do that!
Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!
TROOPER
I know it's hard to believe, miss.
But a lot of good kids get caught
up in this kind of trouble.
Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
tightening.
He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
little unicorn.
MURDOCH
Punks...
Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.
Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:
MEAGAN'S DAD
Captain Murdoch... is there any-
thing we can do?
MURDOCH
You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
daughter before... well, before it's
too late. But rest assured, if I
can't persuade her to come back to
her loving home, then I'll do what's
best for her. I know you and your
wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
(to his men)
Come on... I want to go talk to
Erwin.
Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.
Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
blurting out at a mile-a-minute:
STORMIE
If I did know I would call the
police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
No telling what those freaks will
do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
are hard core.
JESSE
I thought you were in the cult?
STORMIE
I was in the cult for a week cause
my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
he was. But I just liked the music
and the clothes... when they were
clean, but not like the violence
and stuff. But that was just my
"cult" phase... but I got past that.
You know, just like my "gang" phase
when I was dating Ramon and then
before that was my "death rock"
phase when I was dating Stuart...
JESSE
Uh, excuse me... but what phase
are we in now?
STORMIE
Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
what's it fuckin' to ya?!
JESSE
(to Meagan)
Why don't you just let the cops find
her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
knows how to deal with these cultist
psychos. He was the man who got Jason
Voorhees.
MEAGAN
That guy in my dreams...
STORMIE
Jason kicked his ass.
QUICK CUT TO:
Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
medical contraptions.
STORMIE
(V.O.)
Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
worked at the hospital where they
took him. He said that Murdoch lost
more than half his brain and what
little that was left was all twisted
up inside. And they had to replace
his skull with a metal plate to
keep that from leaking out.
In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.
STORMIE
(V.O.,
continuing)
They say he hasn't been the same
since.
CUT BACK TO:
JESSE
So what's different about him?
STORMIE
One thing... he used to be a
Democrat. Now he votes straight
Republican.
MEAGAN
I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
cult or something.
STORMIE
Oh, my God... he'll kill her.
MEAGAN
I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
got to find her and save her from
Freddy before that crazy cop kills
her.
JESSE
Just where are you going to look?
I mean, these cult guys could be
holding her anywhere.
MEAGAN
Murdoch said something about going
to talk to somebody named Erwin.
STORMIE
Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
they took Lizzy!
JESSE
Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
that used to eat bugs?
STORMIE
(annoyed)
Who else?
(to Meagan; bright)
Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
back and the cops put him away for
his own safety. They say Freddy's
put a death hex on Erwin.
JESSE
A death hex?
STORMIE
Yes, a death hex. You know... where
someone wants you dead!
MEAGAN
Where is he?
CUT TO:
The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
row of cell doors.
He stops at one, tapping lightly
on the glass.
SECURITY GUARD
Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
of visitors. Now be a good boy...
(to Meagan & Stormie)
You've got five minutes. I'll be
right down the hall if you need me.
The guard exits.
Meagan and Stormie peer through the
thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
little closer to the glass.
MEAGAN
Erwin...?
SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
face to the glass as he screams:
ERWIN
SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!
Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.
Then they
quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
inspection.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Where do you shoot?
MEAGAN
Shoot?
STORMIE
He's talking about dream dope --
the stuff the cultists shoot up
with so they can talk to Freddy.
MEAGAN
I don't do drugs.
ERWIN
You're not in the cult?
MEAGAN
No.
ERWIN
Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?
MEAGAN/STORMIE
No.
ERWIN
I don't trust you... better take off
your clothes so I can check you for
tracks.
STORMIE
Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
hard data -- not a floppy disk.
Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
mattress.
ERWIN
Well, what do you want? Can't you
see I'm busy?
MEAGAN
Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.
STORMIE
I told her you might know where
they took her.
ERWIN
I already told the cops everything
I know.
MEAGAN
Tell me... please.
ERWIN
Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
but I've got my own problems with
Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.
MEAGAN
Then tell me why they took her...
ERWIN
To bear his child. Freddy wants to
be human again. In order to do that
he has to be "reborn".
MEAGAN
How can he do that?
ERWIN
He has to marry a virgin on holy
ground. Then the cult consumate
the marriage by impregnating her.
STORMIE
The whole cult? Yeech!
ERWIN
Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
It's sort of a tradition with him.
MEAGAN
So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?
ERWIN
And Freddy enters the soul of the
fetus through a dream state. Voila!
Rebirth.
There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:
STORMIE
That's the stupidest shit I ever
heard.
ERWIN
Hey, they're not my rules... some-
body else wrote 'em.
MEAGAN
Erwin... you've got to help me find
Lizzy. You're my only hope.
Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:
ERWIN
I'll help you find your sister, but
you've got to help me.
MEAGAN
Anything. Just name it.
ERWIN
You have to help me kill Freddy.
Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.
STORMIE
But Freddy's dead.
ERWIN
Freddy lives...
(looks at Meagan)
If only in our dreams.
Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
her away.
STORMIE
Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
is up. He's giving me the creeps.
But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:
MEAGAN
How can you kill a dream?
ERWIN
When it's not a dream.
(then)
Do we have a deal?
Erwin presses his palm against the glass.
Meagan
thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
over his.
MEAGAN
Deal.
CUT TO:
The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.
SECURITY GUARD
Springwood Mental Center... how
can I help you?
JESSE
(filtered; disguising
his voice)
There's a bomb planted in your
building.
SECURITY GUARD
Who is this?
JESSE
If I were you -- I'd get my ass
out of there.
In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
something to Jesse.
JESSE
(continuing; adding)
Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.
CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.
CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
close in around her.
They rip her sleeve off and
inject her with a syringe.
After a moment, Lizzy
starts to settle down... falling asleep...
The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
her towards the big boiler.
Inside -- a raging INFERNO.
LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
gate.
The two halves swing open wide to reveal...
A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
a tall, narrow mountain.
On either side of the ledge
is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.
Hundreds upon
hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
terrible chorus of the damned.
The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
the mausoleum.
The outside of this ancient structure
is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
mankind.
In the center -- a large iron gate that
swings open as the cultists near.
The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
her tight as they push her face forward into the
mirror.
The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
face disappearing into the mirror.
ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
face stares out into utter blackness.
Then, some-
thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
darkness.
Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
out.
The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
locking it's lips over hers.
Several slippery some-
things slither into her mouth.
Lizzy struggles, but
the big evil thing is way too strong.
Finally, it
releases her and the cultists pull her back out.
The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
the...
Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
conscious state.
Her eyes grow wide with fear again
as she opens her mouth to scream.
Suddenly, she
doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
cultist thrusts under her.
Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
mouth -- the Dream Demons.
Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
old, burnt out boiler room.
They work their way
towards the back, to a large table and a collection
of sofas and easy chair scattered about.
Erwin
starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
syringes laying scattered about the floor.
ERWIN
Damn! We must have just missed them!
Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.
MEAGAN
Oh, my God -- she was here! This
is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
torn!
(grabs Erwin)
Erwin... we've got to find her!
ERWIN
We're too late! There's no way...
except...
MEAGAN
Except what?!
ERWIN
We could go after Freddy.
MEAGAN
How?
Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
up underneath.
After fishing around for a moment,
he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
box.
Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
and several pairs of cult shades.
ERWIN
We'll inject ourselves with Dream
Dope.
It's a mild narcotic that
brings on a dreamlike state.
Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
approval.
MEAGAN
Okay... let's do it!
JESSE
Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
what if one of us gets hooked or
something?
(whispers)
We could turn out like him!
Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.
ERWIN
Don't worry about it. We need you
wide awake anyway.
JESSE
What for?
ERWIN
We're going to go under and try to
find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
him and bring him here. Then you
kill him with this...
Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.
JESSE
This rusty chunk of shit? What
good is this?
ERWIN
It's not the gun, it's what's in
it -- silver bullets blessed by a
priest.
JESSE
Will that work?
ERWIN
(shrugs)
Should. But then...
JESSE
(finishes for him)
You don't make the rules... yeah,
yeah.
MEAGAN
What should we do?
ERWIN
Have a seat over there and make
yourselves comfortable. Roll up
your sleeves and put these on...
Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:
STORMIE
Oh, cool!
MEAGAN
What are they for?
ERWIN
It's how the cult keeps in constant
contact with Freddy. The little
lights flashing are a sustained
occular input that causes your brain
to resonate at approximately the
same frequency at which the dream
state is most likely to occur.
All of this went over Meagan's head.
Stormie shrugs:
STORMIE
Whatever...
(to Meagan; excited)
Put 'em on -- they're really cool!
Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
up their sleeves.
Erwin comes over and reclines the
chairs, giving each girl an injection.
Then Erwin
takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.
He
lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
glasses.
ERWIN
It helps to hold hands if you want
to go together...
Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.
Jesse
watches with skepticism and concern.
Erwin ushers
a final warning:
ERWIN
(continuing)
And remember... Freddy knows what
scares you.
Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...
Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:
ERWIN
WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!
Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
asleep in their chairs.
Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.
As
they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:
LIZZY
(distant)
Meagan... help me... please...
Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.
Stormie
and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.
ERWIN
Freddy's trying to split us up...
Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.
He pulls it
and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
the muzzle as he says:
JESSE
Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
in Dreamland now.
Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
boiler room, calling for Meagan.
A strange shadow
stalks them -- it's Freddy.
He drops down in front
of Erwin and Stormie.
FREDDY
Looking for some-body?
Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
lost souls.
In the center -- Meagan.
Stormie charges
Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
to Erwin:
STORMIE
I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
us up!
But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.
STORMIE
(continuing)
Don't just stand there! Wake us up!
FREDDY
Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.
Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
claws.
She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
apron.
FREDDY
(continuing)
Stew on this, bitch!
Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.
She
falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!
HARD CUT TO:
Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:
STORMIE
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.
But nothing is there.
Freddy turns toward Erwin.
FREDDY
Well, well, well... if it isn't
my ol' pal, Erwin.
Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.
FREDDY
(continuing)
I've got something special in mind
for you...
Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
out a pin.
Freddy gawks -- surprised.
Erwin pricks
his finger.
HARD CUT TO:
Erwin wakes with a start.
Stormie smacks him.
STORMIE
You didn't help me, you pussy!
I could've had him!
(smacks him some more)
You gutless... spinless... jelly
fish!
Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.
Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
Lizzy's voice...
LIZZY
(V.O.)
Meagan... help me... Meagan...
It leads her to her house.
Meagan enters the front
door.
Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
table, reading his paper.
The headline reads:
FREDDY LIVES!
MEAGAN
Daddy?
He looks up and quietly shushes her.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...
And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.
Only the
newspaper remains.
Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
again... upstairs.
As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
her mother's room.
The door is open a crack.
Meagan
looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
to her lips.
The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.
Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
for help draws her to...
Meagan enters.
She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
covers.
LIZZY
Help me...
Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
her night gown.
Something inside is trying to push
it's way out.
LIZZY
(continuing)
Meagan...
Lizzy screams.
Meagan moves to help her sister when
Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
Meagan in the chest.
HARD CUT TO:
Meagan wakes up suddenly.
She looks up at Stormie,
Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.
STORMIE
Are you okay?
They help Meagan to her feet.
MEAGAN
(shaky)
He got away... I had him and he
got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
lost her...
ERWIN
Well, atleast you're not dead.
MEAGAN
No... I'm not dead...
(realizes)
No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!
STORMIE
He killed me, too. But look...
Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
unharmed.
Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
Meagan gets to her feet, asking:
MEAGAN
Now that I think about it -- he's
killed me in all my nightmares. But
I'm not dead... what does it mean?
ERWIN
It means we've still got some time
left. Until his remains are host to
the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
hurt us.
JESSE
Hello. The Dream Demons...?
ERWIN
Freddy made a pact with Satan when
he died... so Satan bestowed upon
him the Dream Demons. They're the
source of Freddy's power to manipulate
our physical reality. Without them...
he's powerless -- nothing more than
a bad dream.
(off Jesse's cynical
look)
Hey, like I said... I don't make
the rules.
MEAGAN
But we've still got a chance, right?
A chance to kill Freddy before he
gets back his power?
ERWIN
We already tried that. There's no
way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
clever. He knows how to get to us.
MEAGAN
Then let's get somebody else. Some-
body strong.
STORMIE
Yeah! We could hire somebody to
kill Freddy -- like a hit man!
ERWIN
You would have to hire a thousand
of them... or one really big guy
who isn't afraid of anything. No
fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.
JESSE
Where are you going to find a hit
man? The yellow pages? In your
dreams...
Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
bolt and she stammers out a name:
MEAGAN
Jason...
JESSE
Jason?
MEAGAN
Jason Voorhees...
ERWIN
(brightens)
Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
The perfect dream warrior... no fear.
STORMIE
Sounds like our man!
JESSE
Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
isn't Jason Voorhees dead?
ERWIN
Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
know how to bring him back to life.
JESSE
Somehow I just knew you would.
ERWIN
But that's not the problem. The
problem is control. Once we bring
Jason back from the dead... I'm not
one hundred percent sure he'll do
what we tell him.
STORMIE
Well, that's okay... as long as he
doesn't chop us all up.
Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.
MEAGAN
Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
so tell me the truth. Do you think
if we do this -- if we go and get
Jason and bring him back to life,
that he could kill Freddy?
ERWIN
No doubt about. Jason could wreck
Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
But if Freddy has home court advan-
tage... I don't know. Too close to
call. The trick would be to get Jason
to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
and drag him out to our reality.
MEAGAN
I haven't got a choice. I've got to
try something...
(turns to Stormie &
Jesse)
I can't ask either of you to help
me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
disgusting...
STORMIE
Hey, we sisters have to stand
together, right? Where you lead --
I'll follow. Count me in.
Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
He looks them over and sighs:
JESSE
Let me get this straight... we're
going to go dig one dead maniac up
to fight another dead maniac?
ERWIN
That's about the size of it... and
I'd be doing you a disservice if I
said there weren't a modicum of risk
involved.
JESSE
Meagan... I don't want to do this...
MEAGAN
You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
your fight. I understand.
JESSE
But I damn sure don't want you to
do it without me. Count me in.
Meagan hugs Jesse.
Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
she pushes him away.
ERWIN
Look out Freddy... here we come.
CUT TO:
The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
wrecking yard.
Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
charred bones.
Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
around.
She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
with droopy eyes.
LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
Freddy's broken jawbone.
Her vision gets blurry...
more surreal as another cult member steps forward
with the tupperware.
He pours the dream demons into
the funnel.
CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
around inside his skull.
His bones start to bleed...
blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...
There is a FLASH from the pit.
Then suddenly, Freddy
Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
leaps out of the pit and cries:
FREDDY
Smokin'!
Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.
The cultists
FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.
DISSOLVE TO:
Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
special tent.
Meagan and Stormie watch from the
doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.
As he
finishes, Meagan asks:
MEAGAN
Is he going to be okay?
DOCTOR
Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
His leg is broken in four places
and he has four broken ribs and a
concussion.
Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
Stormie turns to the doctor.
STORMIE
Hey doc, is there someplace I
could get us something to eat?
DOCTOR
I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
There are some vending machines in
the lobby.
(to Meagan)
I'll be back to check on him in a
couple of hours.
The doctor exits.
STORMIE
I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
score us some munchies.
Meagan nods weakly.
Stormie exits.
Meagan lays her
head on Jesse's hand.
Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
and Erwin.
Stormie dashes for the staircase.
Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.
Jesse's heart
monitor BEEPS...
On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.
Freddy
peeks out from behind the other side.
He snickers and
ducks back down.
Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.
Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
onto the curtain.
CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
the rings.
Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
away.
Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.
She rises up
again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
are pulled down after him.
Meagan grabs a handful
of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.
But
the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
mattress.
Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.
As
she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
along the floor and out the door.
Meagan follows
them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
out into...
The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
wakes Meagan with a start.
She tries to wake Jesse.
MEAGAN
Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!
Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
empty.
Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
gun you ever saw and says:
FREDDY
Go ahead... make my dream!
Freddy FIRES!
HARD CUT TO:
Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
Meagan.
Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
flat line.
Jesse is dead.
A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.
She sees
Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
and screams.
Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
gasps.
MEAGAN
Freddy killed Jesse...
Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
of the room.
Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.
STORMIE
Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
think a nurse in a hospital would
have seen a dead body before.
MEAGAN
Jesse...
Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
off the elevator.
They hear the nurse's screams and
come running towards Jesse's room.
Stormie pulls
Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
and company go thundering past.
Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:
VOICE
(filtered)
Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
please pick up the white paging
phone for a message?
Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.
The
announcement repeats itself again.
Then again.
Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
and picks up the white paging phone.
STORMIE
(into phone)
This is Stormie...
Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
station again.
Stormie turns her back to them but
Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:
MURDOCH
Did you see a couple of girls go
by here a moment ago?
Stormie gestures to the elevators.
STORMIE
Just missed 'em.
Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
men right behind.
Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:
HOSPITAL OPERATOR
(filtered)
The message is from Erwin... he
says to meet him at the side
entrance in two minutes.
Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
staircase.
Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
to the floor.
She shines her flashlight around the
dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
full of organs, etc.
Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
ug!
Wrong guy.
She opens the next drawer -- ick!
Even worse.
Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.
Her lip starts
to quiver as she caresses his face.
Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
gloves.
Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
knife.
Meagan stands over Jesse's body.
She pulls back the
sheet, exposing his chest.
Meagan raises the knife
far above her head.
MEAGAN
Forgive me, Jesse...
Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
sickening THWACK!
Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
fiber keeps pulling it back.
She jumps at the HORN,
then starts pulling harder.
In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
and stops.
He starts back for the front, when suddenly
the HORN stops.
Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
to Jesse's heart.
As the last strand goes, Meagan
tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.
The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
drawing his gun.
He tip-toes to the door and carefully
unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.
Taking a
two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
and kicks the door.
WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.
One
of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
cabinet...
Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
and cries:
GUARD
Stop right there!
Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.
The guard
curses and races for the...
Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.
Stormie
spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.
MEAGAN
Who are you calling?!
STORMIE
The cops! Who else?!
MEAGAN
Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
up and throw away the key!
STORMIE
Fine by me!
(clicks the receiver)
Damnit! It's dead!
Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
the door shut behind him.
ERWIN
He's right behind me!
Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.
STORMIE
(to Erwin)
You're the one who brought him
back to life!
ERWIN
And?!
STORMIE
Well, do something!
Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
Stormie clucks:
STORMIE
(continuing)
Oh, some hero!
Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
closet, closing themselves inside.
They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
breathing.
Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
closet door -- knocking it to the floor.
Erwin draws
out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.
Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
up in front of him and yells:
MEAGAN
STOP!
To everyone's shock... Jason does.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Now... just stop! We're the ones
that brought you back to life.
And you have no right to kill us
with that chainsaw! In fact... you
owe us...
STORMIE
That's right! She gave you her
boyfriend's heart, you know!
MEAGAN
That's right.
Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Look! Here's his picture...
Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
opens the locket.
She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
inside.
Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
Jesse with a meaty finger.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Now, I know that you've been through
a lot. And I know that you're pissed
off about being murdered and all.
STORMIE
(interjects)
I know I would be!
MEAGAN
But if you help us kill Freddy
Krueger... I promise to help you
find the little bastard that
killed you. What do you say? Have
we got a deal?
Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.
Jason stares at
it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...
Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
windows, freezing everyone to the spot.
Anxious to
get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
the floor and peeks out over the window sill.
ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
weapons.
In the middle of this impressive show of
force is Murdoch.
He raises a bullhorn to his lips.
MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
You in there! This is Captain Renton
Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
ordering you to come out with your
hands up! I'll give you until the
count of three...
(beat)
Three!
Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
closet.
MEAGAN
(whispering)
Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
here and don't come out until we
tell you. Stormie... help me!
Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
closing the door.
Then they quickly smooth down
their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.
A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.
Both girls are
behind bars, separated by a cement wall.
The hefty
female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
her desk.
Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
begins to devour three combo-burritos.
MEAGAN
We've got to try and stay awake.
STORMIE
Getting something to eat might help.
(calls to Deputy)
Yo, Butch!
DEPUTY MILLER
It's Deputy Miller.
STORMIE
Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
we have something to eat?
DEPUTY MILLER
I thought you psychos only ate
human hearts?
STORMIE
And I thought you pigs only ate
donuts.
DEPUTY MILLER
Don't make me come back there.
STORMIE
(low; to Meagan)
Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
combo-burrito cud!
Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
the floor in defeat.
MEAGAN
What am I going to do? I'll never
be able to find Lizzy now.
STORMIE
You should be worrying about your-
self... I know I am.
Stormie plops down on her cot.
MEAGAN
I bet you're sorry you came with
me now...
STORMIE
Nah... what are best friends for?
Afterall, you stuck by me through
all my crazy phases, I figure I
owe you one big crazy phase, right?
MEAGAN
That's for being my best friend,
Stormie.
Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
cell, unlocking it.
DEPUTY MILLER
Come on, Meagan.
MEAGAN
Where are we going?
DEPUTY MILLER
Your parents are here.
CUT TO:
Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.
MEAGAN'S MOM
Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
Let me look at you...
MEAGAN
I'm okay, mom.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Your mother's been worried sick,
Meagan. So have I.
Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
bloody and soiled.
MEAGAN
Sorry. Today has been a bitch.
The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
passes behind her.
The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
a slight SCRAPING.
Freddy's glove materializes,
raking the knives along the metal cross bars.
Freddy
stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.
Stormie is fast asleep.
Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
the bars.
Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
jumps to her feet and screams.
STORMIE
Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!
But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
licking her meaty fingers clean.
Freddy puts his
forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
pointing to her cot.
Stormie looks over and sees her-
self asleep.
STORMIE
(continuing)
Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!
She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:
FREDDY
You know what they say... when you
sleep -- you die!
Freddy flashes the glove of knives.
MEAGAN'S MOM
Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
you helped one of those cultists
escape from a hospital?
MEAGAN
A mental hospital.
MEAGAN'S MOM
And he said you desecrated a cemetery
and some other really terrible things.
Tell me you had nothing to do with
it. Tell me there's some mistake...?
MEAGAN
There's no mistake.
(to Murdoch)
What did you do with Erwin?
MURDOCH
Your boyfriend is headed back to the
looney bin where he belongs. But
don't worry, you'll be seeing him
soon enough... at the arraignment.
Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.
STORMIE
You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
to my various phases and many hours
of watching violent televison, I
have become immune to violence. Seen
it all and done it all! Nothing you
do can gross me out -- so why don't
you give it your best shot, bitch!
FREDDY
Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!
Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
defensive stance.
STORMIE
I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
is a drill sergeant in the Marine
Corps and he taught me just how to
defend myself against slimy bastards
like you.
FREDDY
Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
I dare you!
Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
take a punch.
Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
right in the nose.
FREDDY
(continuing;
surprised)
Owwwww!
Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.
Freddy takes in a
breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
She screams.
Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
Freddy smiles.
FREDDY
(continuing)
Now that's what I call getting a
buzz.
Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.
Stuck in
those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
boogers.
Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):
BOOGERMAN
Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
heh... get it?
Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
to put distance between herself and Boogerman.
BOOGERMAN
(continuing)
Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
I'll be Jabba the Hutt!
Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.
Stormie
screams again.
Meagan is getting more and more agitated.
MEAGAN
We're wasting time! We've got to
close down all the churches --
Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
ground!
Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
frightened looks.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Don't you understand?! He has to
come to our reality to do it! It's
our last chance to kill him!
MURDOCH
Okay, I think we've heard enough of
this crap. Take her back to the
lockup.
A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.
She throws them off
and they grab her again, roughly.
Meagan's parents
watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.
MEAGAN
Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
I have to save Lizzy!
MEAGAN'S MOM
Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
even realize what you've done.
MEAGAN
I did what I had to do to try and
save Lizzy!
MURDOCH
Yeah, including murdering your boy-
friend and cutting his heart out.
MEAGAN
Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
already dead when I cut his heart
out!
Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.
MEAGAN
(continuing; manic)
Goddamnit, you don't understand!
Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!
Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
the cellblock.
Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.
MURDOCH
I know how you must feel... I had
a dog once. I loved that dog. I
treated her like my own daughter.
We went camping, picnics in the
park... I even had a little stocking
for her nailed up on the mantle for
Christmas. Then one day, she bit
me... so I had to blow her brains
out.
(sighs)
God, I loved that dog.
Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
knife.
A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.
BOOGERMAN
Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
again -- gotta go!
Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
nostril cavern.
Stormie watches the massive knife
blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
ahead.
BOOGERMAN
(continuing)
Well, excuse me!
INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
his head.
The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
front.
Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
pulled out, kicking and screaming.
Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
man across the cell.
Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
his nasty head still alive in the center.
Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
the deputy's desk.
He feels around on the table until
he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
Stormie's cell.
Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
clings to life deep inside the nostril.
Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.
FREDDY
Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!
Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
with globules of snot.
She flies across the massive
cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
screaming her head off.
Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
screams too.
HARD CUT TO:
As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
hear a loud SPLAT!
MEAGAN
Stormie?!
The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.
Meagan
runs up and looks.
The wall to Stormie's cell is
splattered with blood and bits.
Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
come running into the cellblock, answering the
deputy's puke-choked scream.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Oh, God... what have I done? What
have I done?!
We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...
The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...
BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.
The CAMERA
OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.
The Reverend
Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.
ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
wife hostage.
Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.
The cultists break into the control room, killing the
DIRECTOR and STAFF.
One slips into the sound booth,
garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
All the feed monitors go snowy.
ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.
Just then,
the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.
MEAGAN
Something just happened at the TV
station.
DEPUTY
Don't worry about it -- get undressed.
MEAGAN
What for?
DEPUTY
Time to get you cleaned up for court.
Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
get undressed.
The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.
Inside,
a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
skin, and greasy hair.
They eye Meagan like the
dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
side, sneaking into a corner.
Meagan turns on the
shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
catcall.
Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
to the mercy of the bitches.
The head bitch slides
over to Meagan and says:
HEAD BITCH
What's the matter, honey... you
don't like our company?
MEAGAN
I like you... sure. It's just that
I usually shower alone, that's all.
HEAD BITCH
Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
they're shy...
The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.
But this
bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
as she tries to kiss her.
The other bitches laugh.
HEAD BITCH
(continuing)
Don't fight it, baby! You know you
want me...
Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.
She backs
off screaming, wiping blood from her face.
Then she
spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
produces a shiv.
HEAD BITCH
(continuing)
If you won't give me a piece then
I'll just cut one for myself...
The head bitch moves in.
Meagan takes a cautious
step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.
She
holds up her hands.
MEAGAN
Wait a second... I didn't mean to
do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
you come on a little strong, that's
all. Just give me a little time to
adjust to my new surroundings...
The head bitch stops, curious.
HEAD BITCH
Are you saying you want me now?
MEAGAN
Yes... I want you.
HEAD BITCH
Prove it.
Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.
In a
flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
-- a warning.
Meagan carefully puts her arm around
the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.
After a
long, uncomfortable moment, they break.
The head
bitch smiles.
HEAD BITCH
(continuing)
Now that's more like it!
(to the others)
Hey, this bitch is alright!
The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.
HEAD BITCH
(continuing)
You're okay, honey... what's your
name?
MEAGAN
Meagan.
HEAD BITCH
So... what're you in for, Meagan?
MEAGAN
(sniffles a little)
Oh, my friend...
HEAD BITCH
The bitch that died last night?
MEAGAN
(starts to cry)
Yeah... they said she had some
disease that made her... explode!
Oh, God! Please hold me!
The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
smoothing her hair.
The other bitches share a look
of concern as one asks:
BITCH #1
What's this bullshit about some
killer funk make you explode?
HEAD BITCH
(to Meagan)
Easy... honey. It's goin' be
alright. But what I asked you is
why you're in here?
MEAGAN
Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
think I gave it to her...
The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
were Satan himself.
She runs for the other bitches
but they aren't having anything to do with her.
All
the bitches race for the exit.
The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
shouts:
DEPUTY
What the hell is all the screaming
about?!
WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
from her belt.
They unlock the cellblock door and go
running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.
The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
through the station.
Several deputies chase after
them, tackle them and try to cuff them.
A brawl
ensues.
Chaos.
Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.
He looks
up at the madness and mutters:
MURDOCH
Punks...
A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
head with her baton and she falls to the side,
revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
uniform -- laying on the shower floor.
The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
her knees, screaming and clutching her face.
Meagan
leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.
On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
charging into the showers to restore order.
She
gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
to freedom.
The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
shakes his head, saying:
REVEREND LOVEJOY
I won't do it! It's a sin!
Blasphemy!
One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.
CULTIST
Wedding or funeral... your choice.
The reverend swallows and says:
REVEREND LOVEJOY
And who would be the bride?
Lizzy is brought forth.
The cultists take her arm
and inject her with the dream dope.
Lizzy's head
lulls around as she chants softly:
LIZZY
One... two... Freddy's coming for
you.
The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
needle from one to another.
LIZZY
(continuing)
Three... four... Better lock your
door.
The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
throat.
He shudders and asks:
REVEREND LOVEJOY
And the groom.
CULTIST
He's coming...
Lizzy is almost asleep.
LIZZY
Five... six... grab your crucifix...
The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
falls over, turning upside down.
It hangs there for
an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
the curtains on FIRE.
As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
appears -- a Dreamgate.
Freddy comes springing out,
leaping in front of the podium.
He laughs and turns
to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.
FREDDY
That's for the lift sister!
(to the cultists)
Hiya, kids!
CULTISTS
(in unison)
Hiya, Freddy!
FREDDY
Ready to get hitched?
CULTISTS
Ready, Freddy!
FREDDY
Then let's do it!
Lizzy looks up and smiles.
LIZZY
I love you, Freddy...
CUT TO:
A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:
DEPUTY
We found your patrol car, Captain.
It was abandoned near a local
religious station.
MURDOCH
Religious station? Is there a
padre there?
DEPUTY
Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
casts out of that location.
MURDOCH
So that's where they're hiding.
CUT TO:
Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.
REVEREND LOVEJOY
...and if there be anyone among you
who has any reason why these two
should not be joined in holy...
Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".
REVEREND LOVEJOY
(continuing)
...in matrimony. Let them speak
now...
(under his breath)
...please God...
(aloud)
...or forever hold their peace.
WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.
MEAGAN
Stop!
Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.
MEAGAN
(continuing;
to Freddy)
Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.
FREDDY
You're a virgin?!
MEAGAN
Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!
Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.
FREDDY
Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
than your retard sister... okay,
you've got the job.
(to cultists)
Get her ready.
The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
dream dope.
She takes her place at the threshold
beside Freddy.
The wedding proceeds...
REVEREND LOVEJOY
Once again... if there be anyone
among you who does not want these
two people to be joined... let him
speak now or forever hold his peace.
Meagan looks around... no one says anything.
The
reverend clears his throat to continue when...
WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.
FREDDY
Uh, oh...
The cultists attack Jason.
Jason grabs the first
one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
a rag doll.
Another attacks with a machete... bad
idea.
One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
machete.
Jason finishes off the last two cultists
as Erwin barricades the studio door.
The cultists
on the other side start POUNDING.
Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
slicing through a camera cable.
CLOSE ON CABLE as
it falls to the floor.
Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
behind him.
Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.
He tries to
wake them but can't.
As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
looks up and says:
ERWIN
I can't wake them up. Freddy's
got them trapped!
Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
couple of dead cultists.
He takes their syringes.
Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
of dream dope.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Go get him, boy!
Jason staggers forward, falling into...
Jason falls into a boxing arena.
The ropes are
entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
head.
The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
the LIVING DEAD.
Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.
Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
boxing gloves.
TED BUNDY steps into the ring.
TED BUNDY
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
to the fight of the century! I'm
your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!
BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
BLOWING his brains out the back.
He falls over DEAD
and the crowd cheers.
Ted sits up and pulls the wig
back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
calls into the balcony:
TED BUNDY
(continuing)
Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!
ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
smoking.
OSWALD
(angry; defensive)
It wasn't me!
Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:
TED BUNDY
In my left corner, weighing in at
only ninety seven pounds... the
nightmare master himself! The one!
The only... Freddddddddy
Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!
Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.
TED BUNDY
(continuing)
And on my right... weighing in at
a whopping four hundred and thir-
teen pounds... that killer of
countless teenagers... the big
guy...
(gestures to Jason)
Jason Voorhees!
CHEERS and BOOS.
TED BUNDY
(continuing)
And the prize tonight... not one but
TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
ripe for the picking.
Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.
TED BUNDY
(continuing)
Hey, have one now and save the other
for the ride home. That's what I did.
LAUGHTER from the crowd.
MEAGAN
Kick his ass, Jason!
DING! -- the bell sounds.
The first round begins...
Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
glove.
He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.
Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
axe in her head.
This is BLOODY MARY.
Jason reaches
over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
her head.
Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:
BLOODY MARY
HEY!
Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
OFF Freddy's arm.
The crowd ROARS.
Freddy looks
down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
and shrugs:
FREDDY
Oh, well... I just axed for that!
Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.
The
axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
between the eyes.
He falls back to the floor.
HITLER
turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:
HITLER
Peasants...
DING!
The bell sounds.
Freddy and Jason break, going
into their respective corners.
As Jason sits down in
his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
starts in:
HUMAN HEAD
That's it, kiddo! You're really
giving it to him out there! Use the
left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
That's the ticket to a knockout!
Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.
Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
the studio door.
DING!
The bell sounds again and round two begins.
Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
each other.
Jason swings wide.
Freddy ducks under
Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
a close look.
WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.
The crowd
CHEERS.
Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
opening.
Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.
Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
disgust.
Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
high above his head.
Then Jason body slams Freddy
to the mat.
The crowd CHEERS.
Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
can of spinach.
In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
and gulps it down.
Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
chest and arms.
At the end of his right hand -- a
heavy metal boxing glove.
Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
massive glove for a blow.
CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
glove.
Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
He bounces off and falls to the mat.
The fans go nuts.
As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
into a giant mallet.
Jason looks up just in time to
see the mallet coming down.
WHAM! -- Freddy drives
Jason into the mat.
The crowd goes wild.
>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:
MEAGAN
Jason! Get up! Get up!
ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
water) abyss.
Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
up.
Something slithers up from out of the deep...
wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.
Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
Jason struggles but keeps slipping.
This looks like
the end of Jason.
Freddy laughs.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Jason! You've got to get up!
JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
him down... drowning him...
FLASH CUT TO:
Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.
With a burst
of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
mat.
Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
him up with him.
Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
ceiling, where they CRASH through to...
Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
the studio.
A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
real world.
FREDDY
Oh, shit!
Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
tomato.
The Dream Demons squirt out.
Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
suddenly IMPLODE.
They fall screaming to the floor
-- dead.
Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
and embrace.
Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.
MEAGAN
What took you so long?!
Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.
ERWIN
What ever you do... don't let this
guy drive.
Meagan smiles at Jason.
MEAGAN
I knew you would come...
Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.
The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
disappear.
In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
monitor, laughing.
ERWIN
Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!
Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
from the control room via a long thick cable running
overhead.
ERWIN
(continuing)
He's going for the satellite dish!
If he uplinks with a communications
satellite he can beam himself any-
where in the world! We'll never be
rid of him!
Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
past them, going through the ceiling to the...
Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
hard.
The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.
A ton of
dust billows up.
Just then, Murdoch bursts in.
He sees Lizzy and
Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.
Erwin sees
this and jumps in-between them, yelling:
ERWIN
No! Wait!
Murdoch FIRES.
The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
the room, where he lands in a heap.
Meagan and Lizzy
run to his side.
Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
chest.
With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
out and pricks himself.
Erwin smiles and dies.
MEAGAN
Erwin? Erwin?!
MURDOCH
He's dead... and so are you if you
don't put your hands up right now!
Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.
He knocks her to
the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
as he says:
MURDOCH
(continuing)
It's time I taught you girls some
respect for the law!
In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.
PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
large open wound with a metal plate underneath.
He
turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.
MURDOCH
(continuing)
So... you wanna be a punk?
Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.
MURDOCH
(continuing)
Then die like a punk!
Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.
Jason
jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.
We
see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.
As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
of his pants.
Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.
Jason cocks
the shotgun and...
BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
of shirt.
Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
spinning to a stop like a hubcap.
Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
come charging in.
They see Jason and raise their
guns in panic.
MEAGAN
NO!
Too late.
The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
FIRE.
BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.
Meagan
grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
past.
More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.
They
start SHOOTING too.
Soon the doorway to the studio
is crowded with muzzle flash.
More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.
A bullet
hole outline appears on the wall behind him.
The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
up, "More ammo! More ammo!".
VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
cops in the studio.
Jason keeps getting SHOT.
Pieces of his are flying
off.
Fingers shot off of a hand.
A knee shot away
to reveal the bone.
Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
of his chest and head.
Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.
The
SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
gunsmoke in the room.
As it clears, Jason still stands.
He teeters a little,
then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.
Jason lays dying.
Meagan rushes to his side.
Jason
reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.
Jason hands the heart to Meagan.
Then Jason's head
rolls back -- he's dead.
Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.
DISSOLVE TO:
Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.
She gives her the
Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.
As Meagan
turns out the light, Lizzy asks:
LIZZY
You forgot to check under the bed.
Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
-- nada.
MEAGAN
No monsters here.
LIZZY
But what if they come back?
MEAGAN
Then we'll just have to kick their
ass again.
Lizzy giggles.
LIZZY
I love you, Meagan.
MEAGAN
I love you too. Go to sleep.
As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
to her from the bottom of the staircase.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Meagan?
Meagan looks down at her parents.
MEAGAN
Yes, dad?
MEAGAN'S DAD
Your mom and I... well, we want to
thank you for saving your sister's
life... we know you went through
a lot.
MEAGAN'S MOM
We're going to be there for you
from now on... for both of you!
And that nice lawyer we hired for
you said he thinks he can get all
the charges dropped... except maybe
for the grave robbing and human
desecration ones.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Everything is going to be fine.
MEAGAN
I know...
MEAGAN'S MOM
And I'm going to get sober...
MEAGAN'S DAD
We're going to be a normal, happy
family again.
MEAGAN
I know...
MEAGAN'S MOM
Goodnight, sweetheart.
MEAGAN
Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.
MEAGAN'S DAD
Goodnight, Meagan.
Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
when the phone RINGS.
She picks it up.
MEAGAN
Hello?
FREDDY
(filtered)
I'll be seeing you in your dreams...
Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
licks Meagan in the face.
She yelps and slams the
phone down.
MEAGAN
(sighs)
I know...
Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.
She
climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.
She smiles
and puts the pistol back under the pillow.
BLACKNESS:
The phone RINGS.
ROLL END CREDITS:
Then... at the very end...
CUT TO:
Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
when they went back to reality... waiting.
Finally, somebody says:
MONSTER
I don't think they're coming back.
TED BUNDY
Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
body can go home now.
All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.
CUT TO:
BLACK... now it's over.
THE END
