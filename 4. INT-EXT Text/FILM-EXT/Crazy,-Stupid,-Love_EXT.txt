Tracy runs to him. He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay.
TRACY
Are you out of your mind!?
He looks up at her, pleading.
CAL
I'll leave tonight, I'll sign
whatever you want me to sign, if
you'll just stop talking about it.
She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's
still something here.
TRACY
Okay.
CAL
Okay.
He stands, limps back to the car.
You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical
housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads.
A WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour.
WOMAN
So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2
is a lot like unit 1 except you're
downstairs so... the ground is
closer. Which is nice.
A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A
long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized
U-HAUL is parked in the driveway.
Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX. He loads it
into the U-haul and takes a last look back at:
HIS BACKYARD
A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can
tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball
equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son
catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.
You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this
backyard. You like this family a lot from seeing this
backyard.

TRACY (O.S.)
Cal?
Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats.
It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward
silence. Neither knows what to say.
TRACY
I just wanted to say that...
Her voice cracks. She turns away.
TRACY
Shit.
She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells
him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops
himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and
complicated about the reality of it all.
Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to
lighten things.
TRACY
Do you want me to back that thing
out of the driveway for you?
CAL
I'll be fine.
TRACY
You have trouble in reverse is
all.
CAL
It was two times --
TRACY
Three if you count my father's
foot.
CAL
I did that on purpose.
TRACY
I knew it.
They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize,
stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.
CAL
Once I'm settled, I'll get the
kids so they can see the place.
He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.
(CONTINUED)

19 CONTINUED: (2) 19
TRACY
I think I'm have a mid-life crisis
maybe. Can women have mid-life
crisis?
CAL
(AVOIDING ENGAGEMENT)
Make sure the lawn gets enough
water.
TRACY
In the movies it's always men
having them and buying ridiculous
yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man
and I really don't want a yellow
PORSCHE --
CAL
You have to fertilize once a
month. Not twice a month, not
once every two months.
She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
TRACY
We got married so young, Cal. And
I'm forty-one. And that's so much
older than I thought I'd be.
CAL
The sprinklers turn off behind
you.
TRACY
And I got really upset with an
umpire at Molly's t-ball game last
month -- like really upset, like I
screamed at him and wished he
would die -- and I started feeling
like the person I promised I
wouldn't turn into, you know?
CAL
If it rains a lot, you need to
shut off the automatic setting.
TRACY
And we haven't been us, not for a
long time. And I don't know when
you and I stopped being `us'
but... I mean, do you?
Cal finally turns and looks at her.
(CONTINUED)
25.
19 CONTINUED: (3) 19
CAL
I think it was when you screwed
David Jacobowitz.
Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods:
she also understands it.
CAL
Make sure my azaleas get enough
sun.
Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out...
And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.
Cal pulls into the parking lot, grabs a space.
CAL
What am I doing?
Cal runs outside. Jacob is already halfway to the car.
CAL
I'm sorry! Don't leave!
(CONTINUED)
34.
28 CONTINUED: 28
Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers:
JACOB
No, Cal. We can't just go to the
Gap.
CAL
What's wrong with the Gap?
JACOB
In Hell, every store is the Gap,
that's what's wrong with the Gap,
Cal. It's lowest common
denominator. Be better than the
fucking Gap, Cal.
29 IN A NEW STORE 29
Jacob holds up a pair of beige slacks.
JACOB (V.O.)
One pair of chinos.
CHING. A cash register DINGS.
JACOB (V.O.)
Four dress shirts.
CHING. CHING. CHING. CHING. Cal's arms are filling.
JACOB (V.O.)
Three casual button-downs.
CHING. CHING. CHING. In a dressing room shirts come
flying over the wall at Cal.
30 A NEW STORE 30
Cal struggles to get a sweater over his neck.
JACOB (V.O.)
Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and
finally, a long overcoat.
Cal stands there in an overcoat and sweater.
CAL
I'm very warm.
31 IN A BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE 31
Jacob leads Cal through the store. He tosses him a TUBE.
(CONTINUED)
35.
31 CONTINUED: 31
JACOB
You rub this in around your eyes
every night and every morning.
CAL
What does it do?
JACOB
(SARCASTIC)
It gives you x-ray vision, Cal.
(THEN)
It tightens things up. The skin
around your eyes looks like Milton
Berle's ballsack.
Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror.
CAL
Oh my God, it does.
32 IN A SALON 32
Cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon. The
HAIRDRESSER is young, hip, and beautiful.
CAL
I like to use a number four on the
sides and the back, go longer on
the top.
JACOB
Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal
Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor
cut, tight on sides, get him some
texture up top, take off about...
He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
CAL
Eww.
JACOB
... inch off the top.
TIFFANY
Yes, sir.
CAL
BUT --
Tiffany starts chopping.
36.
Cal sits next to Jacob. Cal is wearing his new "outfit."
He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new
"gear."
Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a
men's magazine. And he knows it. Cal looks at Jacob.
CAL
I notice you only button your
shirts up, like, halfway. I can't
pull that off, right?
JACOB
No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be
calling women over to our table
shortly.
Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
CAL
We should have some background on
each other, no? I'm in insurance,
more on the corporate side. My
kids are --
JACOB
Cal, the only thing I care less
about than corporate insurance are
your kids. Here's the only thing
I need to know: how many women
have you been with?
CAL
Sexually?
JACOB
Yes.
CAL
In my entire life?
JACOB
No, synchronized swimming. Yes,
Cal. Sexually.
Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on
one hand.
(CONTINUED)
39.
34 CONTINUED: 34
He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count
to a second hand. Then:
CAL
One.
Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.
JACOB
Wow, okay... wow.
(then, checking)
Not at a time? Total?
CAL
What? I married young. We met in
high school.
He smiles, remembering.
CAL
Tracy was so damn beautiful. You
know those women, the ones who can
be wildly sexy and unbelievably
cute all at once? I never knew
how she did that. I still don't
know how she does it.
(THEN)
Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup
our senior year but we made it --
JACOB
Cal, I literally stopped listening
at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
CAL
(a bit emotional)
I miss my wife.
JACOB
Shut up, Cal.
A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.
YOUNG WOMAN
Hi.
JACOB
Hi. Jacob Palmer.
YOUNG WOMAN
Amy Johnson.
Cal extends his hand.

CAL
CAL --
JACOB
(QUICKLY)
Don't.
He pulls it back.
CAL
(TO HIMSELF)
-- Weaver.
JACOB
Can I get you a drink, Amy?
CUT TO:
35 A DRINK 35
gets handed over to: a NEW GIRL, on a NEW NIGHT.
JACOB
Tell me about yourself. What do
you do?
NEW GIRL
Does it really matter?
JACOB
It does to me.
She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats:
JACOB
It does to me.
She smiles.
PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.
36 BACK TO JACOB 36
Now with NEWER GIRL.
NEWER GIRL
And that's when I started writing
the column for LA Weekly. God,
how long have I been talking?
Jacob takes her hand.
(CONTINUED)
41.
36 CONTINUED: 36
JACOB
Listen, I'm going to be honest:
it's getting late and I think
you're interesting. I also think
you're one of those rare women who
manages to be both wildly sexy and
incredibly cute all at once.
ON CAL
Mouth agape. That was his line!
ON JACOB
JACOB
Let's get out of here. I know
it's forward of me but just... I
think we should get out of here.
She thinks, then NODS.
NEWER GIRL
Okay.
FLASH CUT TO:
37 THE SECOND GIRL 37
JACOB
I think we should get out of here.
NEW GIRL
Okay.
FLASH CUT TO:
38 THE FIRST GIRL 38
JACOB
I think we should get out of here.
FIRST GIRL
Okay.
38A BACK TO CAL 38A
waving goodbye awkwardly as Jacob leaves with each of the
girls (IN QUICK CUTS). Finally:
(CONTINUED)
42.
38A CONTINUED: 38A
Cal just sits there, completely alone. But then A PRETTY
GIRL arrives at his table. Cal looks up, smiles. She
smiles back, then:
She drops THE BILL on the table. She's a waitress. And
he's been left with the tab.
CUT TO:
Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking
into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the
house. All is quiet. He gets to work.
-- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass.
-- Trims some bushes.
-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers.
It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen.
Finally, he finishes.
ON CAL
Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back
in order. As he takes it all in...
A LIGHT pops on.
Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.
Jessica waits at her LOCKER. She spots a TALL BLONDE
GIRL moving down the hallway, texting as she walks.
JESSICA
Madison! Madison, wait!
Madison stops walking, but not texting.
JESSICA
Hey, I had a question --
Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues
texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles.
MADISON
Hey, Jessica, whassup?
JESSICA
I had a question for you, Madison.
It's kind of on the personal side
so...
MADISON
My lips are...
Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making
WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.
MADISON
(EXPLAINING)
Seals.
(THEN)
My lips are seals.
JESSICA
Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the
thing... I don't mean to be blunt
or insulting but, let's call it
what it is: you're always
sleeping with older guys, right?
(CONTINUED)
61.
54 CONTINUED: 54
MADISON
(NODDING)
Always.
JESSICA
Lots of college guys, I've heard.
MADISON
Lots of them.
JESSICA
Even rumors about a few teachers.
MADISON
Totally.
JESSICA
So my question is: how do you do
that? I mean, how do you get them
not to see you as... well, a kid
in high school?
MADISON
Oh, well first off, I have a huge
rack.
JESSICA
You do, yes.
MADISON
So that helps.
JESSICA
Yes, I'm sure it does.
MADISON
You don't have a huge rack.
JESSICA
No, I don't unfortunately.
MADISON
So that's not gonna work.
JESSICA
Nope.
Madison SIGHS.
MADISON
Okay, here's what you do. Wait,
how old is he?
JESSICA
Old.
(CONTINUED)
62.
54 CONTINUED: (2) 54
MADISON
Like really old?
JESSICA
Like parent old.
MADISON
Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.
JESSICA
Thank you, Madison.
MADISON
Alright, you have to hook him.
Force his hand. Make him unable
to stop himself from doing what he
knows to be wrong.
JESSICA
How?
MADISON
Do what I do. Send him a postcard
from downtown.
JESSICA
Huh?
MADISON
Go TMZ on his ass.
JESSICA
I'm not following you, Madis--
MADISON
The full gyno.
Off Jessica's blank look.
MADISON
A crotch shot? A nip slip?
(THEN)
A dirty picture! You can even
Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but
with nipple. Yeah, that's what
you should do: make it artistic.
Black and white. Make this face.
She makes a raw sexual face.
JESSICA
Jesus, Madison!
(CONTINUED)
63.
54 CONTINUED: (3) 54
MADISON
Well, you came to me for advice,
that's my advice. You put those
across his radar, he won't see you
as a little girl anymore, that's
for sure.
Madison walks off, calls back.
MADISON
Don't send it to him as a jpeg,
though. He'll put it up on his
fantasy football web-site. And
then your brother sees it, tells
your mom, and suddenly you're not
allowed to use Facebook for a
month. Thanks, Kevin!
She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice.
Jessica EXITS the school, lost in thought. There's a bit
of commotion outside. TEENAGERS are pointing and
LAUGHING at something.
Jessica pushes through and sees:
ROBBIE, standing atop a man-made, tall, wooden
platform/scaffold in front of the school.
ROBBIE
(DRAMATICALLY)
There she is!
ON JESSICA
Oh shit.
BACK TO ROBBIE
as he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET
J taped to his pale, hairless chest. He has recreated
the famous Scarlet Letter tableau. He pulls out a piece
of paper, reads it.
(CONTINUED)
64.
55 CONTINUED: 55
ROBBIE
Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The
Scarlet Letter: `No man for any
considerable period can wear one
face to himself and another to the
multitude, without finally getting
bewildered as to which may be the
true.'
Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.
ROBBIE
I am not bewildered! Jessica
Riley is my soulmate. She's the
one! I know it to be true, and so
now do the multitude.
(CORRECTING HIMSELF)
Multitudes?
(then, deciding)
No, multitude.
JESSICA
Robbie, get down!
ROBBIE
I have marked myself with this
Scarlet J, Jessica! For you.
Because your name starts with a J.
It's just tape and construction
paper but one day I will get a
permanent tattoo when I'm old
enough that my parents won't freak
out on me.
JESSICA
Robbie Weaver! I am your baby-
sitter and I'm telling you to GET
YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW!
That does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE.
Jessica pulls him off to the side.
JESSICA
(HEATED WHISPER)
What the hell are you thinking?
ROBBIE
You like the scaffold? It has
wheels. Took four weeks to build
it.
(THEN)
Oh, those are my friends, they
helped me wheel it down. Wave
hello.
(CONTINUED)
65.
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE
and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie. Jessica waves, confused,
turns back to Robbie.
JESSICA
This has to stop, Robbie.
Seriously.
ROBBIE
You'll learn to love me. I
promise.
JESSICA
I won't.
ROBBIE
Just because I'm four years
younger than you?
JESSICA
BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!!
This stops Robbie dead in his tracks.
JESSICA
I've been spending time with him
for a while.
Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
ROBBIE
No. You can't. I've checked. No
boyfriend since ninth grade. No
date for Spring Formal last
MONTH --
JESSICA
He's older. I don't want my
parents to know.
And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the
ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the
cutest thing you've ever seen.
ROBBIE
Who is he?
JESSICA
It doesn't matter.
ROBBIE
Do I know him? Is he from town?
JESSICA
I don't know. Yes, kind of.
(CONTINUED)
66.
55 CONTINUED: (3) 55
ROBBIE
I'll kill him if he hurts you.
Jessica tries not to smile.
JESSICA
I know. But this all has to stop
now, Robbie. The speeches, the
texts, all of it. It's very
sweet, but it has to stop.
He just sits there, lost.
JESSICA
I'll see you around, okay?
She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass.
Devastated. His three friends approach.
ROBBIE'S FRIEND
We should probably get the
scaffold back on the road before
dark.
ROBBIE
Yeah.
Robbie's on the couch, dejected. His little sister sits
next to him, watching High School Musical as always.
In the adjoining kitchen, Cal is on the phone.
CAL
(INTO PHONE)
Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been
forever. Have you been getting
out at all? I'll bring you some
of that deli you like one night,
okay? The kids? They're fine.
(to other room)
Kids, say hi to Nanna.
ROBBIE AND MOLLY
Hi, Nanna!
CAL
Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made
a new buddy, I've been spending
time with him. Yeah, I'm going to
see her tomorrow night. Of course
I miss her. You don't know how
much I miss...
(CONTINUED)

56 CONTINUED: 56
His voice cracks. He turns, sees Robbie staring. He
heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door.
Robbie SIGHS, turns back to the TV.
CUT TO:
Cal and Robbie are having a catch. Robbie is listless.
ROBBIE
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow,
huh? At my parent-teacher thing?
CAL
Yeah.
ROBBIE
First time in a while.
CAL
Yeah, but no biggie.
Cal tosses him back the ball.
CAL
Hey, what's with the moping?
ROBBIE
Nothing. It's just... there's
this girl.
Cal smiles.
CAL
Oh yeah? You like her?
ROBBIE
I like Pringles. This girl's my
soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid,
in love with her. And she wants
someone else.
CAL
But she's your soulmate?
ROBBIE
Yeah.
CAL
Well you can't just give up.
(CONTINUED)
68.
57 CONTINUED: 57
ROBBIE
Why not?
(then, quietly)
You did.
Cal freezes.
ROBBIE
Mom was yours, right?
CAL
I didn't give up.
ROBBIE
Listen, Dad. I love you. I have
your back, always. But let's be
honest here: the woman told you
she wanted a divorce and you
jumped out of a car.
CAL
It was slightly more complicated
than that. And I'm a different
guy now.
ROBBIE
You're the same guy. You just
have different clothes. Do you
still love her?
CAL
How old ARE you?
ROBBIE
(STRONGLY)
Do you still love Mom?
Cal doesn't say anything. His silence speaks volumes.
CAL
Weren't we talking about you?
ROBBIE
We are. Your son is in desperate
need of some romantic inspiration.
So set an example for your boy.
Don't give up. It's complicated?
Uncomplicate it. She says no?
Change her mind. Look at you,
you're the man right now, Dad.
Get her back.
(DRAMATICALLY)
Get back my mom.
(CONTINUED)
69.
57 CONTINUED: (2) 57
Robbie punctuates his pep talk by tossing Cal the ball,
hard.
Cal is lost in thought. The ball sails past him and
THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby car.
PARENTS walk hand-in-hand, into the school. It's Parent-
Teacher conference night.
Cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom. Tracy
approaches.
TRACY (O.S.)
Wow.
Cal looks up. Tracy stands there. She's dressed down,
but looks amazing. Vulnerable and nervous.
TRACY
(FLOORED)
You look great, Cal.
CAL
Oh, well turns out I've been
buying the wrong size suit for
twenty years so...
TRACY
Well you look great. Really.
Cal smiles.
CAL
Thank you.
(THEN)
You always look great, so...
Awkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the
seat next to him.
CAL
I talked to Nanna yesterday.
TRACY
Me, too. She sound okay to you?
CAL
She sounded like... Nanna. She
worries about us.

Tracy NODS. A long beat, then:
CAL
I feel like I'm about to get
detention.
Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.
CAL
Which teacher is this?
TRACY
Mrs. Thompson. This is the one
he pulled The Scarlet Letter
Asshole routine on.
Cal smiles.
CAL
He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
TRACY
Yeah.
(THEN)
I kind of like him, though.
CAL
I do, too. I'm so glad we
switched the babies at the
hospital.
TRACY
Me, too.
They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when
they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away.
An awkward beat, then:
CAL
So, how are things with...
(a beat, then)
How's it going with David?
She looks down.
TRACY
Oh... it's not.
(THEN)
It wasn't about him, if that means
anything.
CAL
No, I know.

Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture.
TRACY
You seeing anyone?
CAL
Who, me? No. You know me. No,
not really.
TRACY
Oh. Because you hear things, you
know.
CAL
Yeah, well...
Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes
a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL
I miss you, T.
Tracy looks up surprised.
CAL
I got complacent, I think. You
find your soulmate in high
school... you've got the game
sewed up in the first quarter, you
know?
She smiles.
CAL
I put in an effort when we were
younger, didn't I? I'd do
anything to make you happy: take
you miniature golfing, dancing --
you were such a good dancer.
TRACY
I had to be. You were such a good
miniature golfer.
He smiles, emboldened.
CAL
All I ever wanted to do was make
you love me. And then you did,
really early on. And we got
married so young. And I guess...
I got lazy. I got boring. And
I'm furious at you for what you
did. But I don't totally blame
you, if that makes any sense?

CAL (CONT'D)

I shouldn't have jumped out of the
car. I should have fought for
you. You fight for your soulmate.
At least that's what our thirteen-
year-old tells me.
Tracy's eyes well up with tears.
TRACY
He's a very strange boy, isn't he?
CAL
I'll be honest: he scares the
shit out of me.
She LAUGHS through her tears.
TRACY
I missed you, too.
Cal takes her hand, kisses it.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. and Mrs. Weaver?
They turn around.
AT DOORWAY
It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson... better
known to us as:
KATE (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with).
Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.
CAL
Oh God.
KATE
Cal? What are you doing here?
CAL

Really?
TRACY
You two know each other?
CAL
Um, yes... we've met before.

Tracy.
KATE
Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
HOW CONVENIENT!
Kate's getting louder now.
CAL
Why don't we head inside?
KATE
YES, WHY DON'T WE!?
She STORMS INSIDE. Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in.
Tracy races to her car.
CAL
Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.
TRACY
(fumbling for keys)
I know, and I cheated, so it
doesn't make any sense for me to
be mad at you.
CAL
Okay, so --
TRACY
I can't do this now, Cal.
CAL
Tracy, I love you.
KATE
Tell her she's the perfect
combination of sexy and cute,
ASSHOLE!
Tracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing.

It's a funny story, actually --
TRACY
I'm going home.
She opens the car door.
CAL
Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with
her! I slept with our son's
eighth grade teacher!
GASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a
picture with her cell phone.
CAL
But all it did was confirm what I
already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
I LOVE YOU!!!
Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment.
CAL
Before, you were the only woman
I'd ever been with or wanted to be
with. And now, even after I've
been with eleven women, you're
STILL...
He instantly trails off, realizing. MORE GASPS.
CAL
(MEEKLY COMPLETING)
... the only woman I want to be
with.
TRACY
I don't even know who you are.
Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.
CAL
(weakly, to himself)
I'm your soulmate.
Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met...
By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF.
CAL
HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK
REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT!

Meanwhile, the rain pours down as DINERS scurry into the
restaurant.
The awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to
the front door. She's carrying those same flowers.
Awkward beat.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I
was wondering if --
TRACY
David, stop. Look, I had a nice
time, which is a substantial
upgrade from the rest of the...
times I've been having lately.
So, I don't think I'm ready to
start dating but my ex clearly is
and there's a yogurt shop where
they make this eight calorie ice
cream that tastes like a laxative,
so if you'd like to take me there
sometime I guess I wouldn't say
no.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
Wow. You know, that's exactly
what I was thinking. It's almost
uncanny.
They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry.
Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then...
THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.
JESSICA
Hello.
TRACY
Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry.
Jessica, this is my work-friend.

TRACY (CONT'D)
He's an accountant named David.
David, this is my baby-sitter,
Jessica. Okay, David, well
everything sounds great.
Spreadsheets.
David smiles knowingly.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
I'll see you at work.
He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward.
INSIDE THE DOOR
Robbie sneaks down the stairs. From a kneeling position,
he can hear and see everything.
JESSICA
So... How was dinner?
TRACY
It was just for work.
JESSICA
(POINTEDLY)
It's a pretty dress.
TRACY
Oh, thanks.
Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.
TRACY
So how much do I owe yo--
JESSICA
Did you know your kids are the
only ones I baby-sit for who
always want to stay awake so they
can see their dad when he gets
home. I mean, they fight with
everything they have to keep their
eyes open so they can hear what
Dad had for dinner, or how he
liked the movie. Lot of kids want
to stay awake for Mom -- and your
kids always want to see you, don't
get me wrong -- but not a lot wait
up for Dad. Maybe it's because
he's good, and he's kind, and he's
decent.
(CONTINUED)

74 CONTINUED: (2) 74
TRACY
What are you talking abo--
JESSICA
Batshit crazy.
She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.
TRACY
Jessica?
Jessica turns, explodes?
JESSICA
I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY!
She storms off.
TRACY
Jessica!
But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that")
and CLOSES the door.
CUE MUSIC. Robbie rides his bike down the street. He's
got Tracy's FLOWERS nestled in his handlebars.
MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their
windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly
watching her show in hers. Tracy in the kitchen.
We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover:
Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He
fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night.
TRACY (O.S.)
Kids! Ice cream!
Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out
ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race
down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing.
We take in the real-time TABLEAU:
Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal:
watching them from the outside, looking in.
It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful.
INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something.
She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS
her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious.
OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.
(CONTINUED)
92.
79 CONTINUED: 79
CAL
Hello?
TRACY
Hi, Cal.
Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea.
TRACY
So... I'm in the basement. I'm
trying to get the water heater
working `cause the pilot's out and
I don't know how to relight it.
Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.
TRACY
I'm sorry to bother you, I just...
what do I do?
Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then:
CAL
It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad
you called. Here: I'll walk you
through it.
(THEN)
Do you see the little grey door?
TRACY
Yeah.
CAL
Pull it down.
She pantomimes this in the kitchen.
TRACY
Okay, it's down.
CAL
Now, you see the red button? I
wrote `push' on it?
TRACY
I got it.
CAL
Push. Now turn that to the right
and stick the match in.
TRACY
Oh, there it goes!
(CONTINUED)
93.
79 CONTINUED: (2) 79
CAL
Good. Now just close the door and
you're good to go.
Silence. The charade is over. Now what?
TRACY
Well, thanks, Cal. I...
appreciate your help.
CAL
No, anytime. Call anytime with
stuff like that.
(AWKWARD BEAT)
Talk to you later?
TRACY
Yeah. And... thanks again.
Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife
as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him.
Cal rents a TRUCK.
Molly points out her three favorite DAY LABORERS, Cal
hires them.
96.
Tracy pulls up to her house. As she pulls in she notices
Robbie. He's standing outside the front door in a
tuxedo... a shit-eating grin on his face.
She SIGHS ("what now?") and parks the car.
Jessica runs into a second car. Races after her father.
Meanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he
wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES.
Tracy LAUGHS.
TRACY
Baby! What are you wearing!?
ROBBIE
Dad's here.
Tracy's face drops.
ROBBIE
I have to blindfold you.
TRACY
(WEARY)
What is this? What is he doing?
(CONTINUED)
99.
91 CONTINUED: 91
ROBBIE
Relax, Mom. He's your husband,
not Al Queda. You'll make it out
alive.
She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing
Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind.
He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a
different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER!
ROBBIE
Okay, we're good, let's do this.
Robbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard. She
looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face.
We see what she is not yet privy to.
ON THE BACKYARD
Cal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a
FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all.
Cal stands behind it all, in a tux.
CAL
Hi, T.
TRACY
Can I take these off, please?
CAL
Almost. Kids?
(CONTINUED)
100.
94 CONTINUED: 94
Robbie CUES music (which will play throughout this
scene). Molly, in a PARTY DRESS, carries a glass of
champagne to Tracy and puts it in her hand.
CAL
(LAUNCHING IN)
Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver
saw Tracy Boyle for the first
time, walking the halls of
Woodside Middle School --
TRACY
Cal: are you seriously doing this
in front of the kids?
ROBBIE
(QUICKLY)
If it goes bad I'm supposed to
take Molly upstairs and put the TV
on loud.
Tracy SIGHS, giving up.
TRACY
Well, might as well wait for your
daughter.
CAL
She's right next to you, T.
TRACY
No, your other daughter.
Huh? Just then:
VOICE (O.S.)
Hello?
From inside the house steps out...
HANNAH.
CAL
Nanna!
HANNAH
Hi, Daddy.
WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of
wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.
JACOB
Cal?

Hi, Nanna.
CAL
Wait, what's going on?
ROBBIE
Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH
Hey, Robbie.
MOLLY
Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH
Hey, cutie.
JACOB
WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?
HANNAH
It's me, I couldn't pronounce
Hannah when I was little -- wait,
so how do you know my dad?
JACOB
(REALIZING)
Oh, God.
CAL
(FREAKING)
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE!
HANNAH
Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.
CAL
No. No. No. No.

94 CONTINUED: (3) 94
TRACY
I want to see the boyfriend!
(STRUGGLING WITH
SCARVES)
Can someone please take this off?
JACOB
HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR-
OLD DAUGHTER!?
CAL
I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR
SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE
GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG!
JACOB
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?
CAL
YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY
CHILDREN!
HANNAH
So you two, like, really know each
other?
CAL
No way -- you and her... no way.
End it, now.
HANNAH
Daddy!!!
JACOB
Well, that's not going to happen.
CAL
Well, then I'm going to murder
you.
HANNAH
DAD!
TRACY
(down to two scarves)
Will someone please take this
goddamn thing off me!
CAL
Robbie, take the goddamn thing off
your mother!
(then, looking up)
Bernie?
(CONTINUED)

94 CONTINUED: (4) 94
SLAM! A body flies into Cal and knocks him OUT OF FRAME.
It's Bernie! Behind him...
JESSICA runs after her father, SCREAMING:
JESSICA
Daddy, no!
ROBBIE
Is that Jessica?
BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw.
HANNAH
Daddy!
JESSICA
Daddy!
TRACY
(YANKING ON
BLINDFOLD)
What's happening?
Bernie is pummeling Cal.
BERNIE
I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU
SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S
SEVENTEEN!
Jacob dives in. Tries to pull Bernie off. Bernie NAILS
Jacob with an UPPERCUT!
HANNAH
Jacob!
CAL
(GETTING PUMMELLED)
Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT!
Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF
COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head. Jessica
throws herself on Cal.
JESSICA
Daddy, stop!
This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates.
JESSICA
He didn't do anything. He doesn't
even know.
(CONTINUED)

ROBBIE

CAL
Know what?
TRACY
(STILL BLINDFOLDED)
Robbie, please get this off me!
ROBBIE
(struggling with it)
I'm TRYING!
JESSICA
He doesn't even know that I'm in
love with him!
Robbie stops, turns.
ROBBIE
With who?
JESSICA
(pointing at Cal)
With him.
CAL
Are you pointing at me?
ROBBIE
Are you pointing at him?
TRACY
Who is she pointing at!?
ROBBIE
(PROCESSING)
Wait: my dad is the older guy
you've been seeing?
BERNIE
I knew it.
He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him.
JESSICA
(TO BERNIE)
He doesn't even know about the
dirty pictures I made for him.
ROBBIE
You made him dirty pictures? Oh
God.

Robbie looks to Cal. He's angry, jealous, and broken-
hearted all at once.
ROBBIE
(TO CAL)
You're the one? You're the one
she...
(then, furious)
You stole my soulmate.
CAL
Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
VOICE (O.S.)
I'm sorry, is Tracy home?
Everyone turns: DAVID JACOBOWITZ stands in the doorway.
He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
You left your sweater in my car
the other night.
HANNAH
Who are you?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
David Jacobowitz.
JACOB
David Jacobowitz!
CAL
David Jacobowitz!?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ
Is this a bad time --
WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right
hook.
HANNAH
Jacob!
JACOB
You know how much misery you've
put this poor bastard through!?
Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob.
CAL
Stay the hell away from my
daughter.

94 CONTINUED: (7) 94
Jacob JUMPS on Cal. David jumps on Jacob. Bernie tries
to pull them apart.
Jessica finally gets the blindfold off Tracy. The women
and children watch the battle in horror.
CUT TO:
CUE: John Mayer's "Who Says."
1) ROBBIE, at school. His spirit is crushed. He looks
at his CONTACT LIST, thinks, and DELETES JESSICA.
99 JESSICA 99
2) at home, grounded and sad.
100 JACOB 100
3) trying to get HANNAH to make a phone call to her
father... she won't.
101 TRACY 101
4) at her office, finally taking down the picture of her
and Cal. And speaking of Cal...
110.
A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER. About 150 people
fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation.
Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica
sits with her family a few rows away. All look nice.
MANY ROWS BACK --
Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS. Cal is
now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable.
His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices...
AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans
forward, are they saving it for him? But just then...
Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat.
Cal looks nauseous.
ON STAGE
We WATCH the ceremony for a moment. The PRINCIPAL labors
through her introduction...
VOICE (V.O.)
... and now, to introduce the
first student speaker: our very
own English teacher Kate Thompson!
Cal's former conquest steps onto stage.
(CONTINUED)
114.
103 CONTINUED: 103
AHEAD OF CAL
Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's
presence. She accidentally catches Cal's eye. Awkward.
KATE
Our next speaker is not only the
class salutatorian, but he's also
one of the most...
(SEARCHING)
Spirited... young men, I've ever
had the pleasure of teaching.
Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie
Weaver.
Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same
kid we've come to love. There's something different in
his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA.
ROBBIE
(a bit monotone)
Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.
Welcome, Class of 2011.
(A BEAT)
I wasn't really sure what I wanted
to talk about today. Mrs.
Thompson said it might be good to
talk about growing up and getting
older and stuff. So I guess I'll
talk about that.
Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son?
ROBBIE
I grew up a lot this year, I
think. I used to think that
growing up meant really growing.
Like getting taller and bigger.
But now I think that growing up
just makes you smaller. Your
dreams get smaller, and what you
want gets smaller...
(beat, then)
I grew an inch and a half this
year, but I feel a lot smaller.
Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.
ROBBIE
I was in love. And I know that
makes parents laugh because I'm
only thirteen but whatever, I was.

(CONTINUED)
115.
103 CONTINUED: (2) 103
ROBBIE (CONT'D)
I believed that there was one true
love for everyone, and if you
fought for that person, your one
true love would always work out.
But that's not how it works. It
sounded good when I was younger,
but... it's just not how it works.
There's no such thing as one true
love for everyo--
CAL (O.S.)
Stop!
Robbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the
crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.
ROBBIE
Dad?
CAL
Hi.
(awkward, to crowd)
Hi, everyone.
Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly
really uncomfortable.
CAL
May I have a word with my son?
It'll just take a second.
Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps
over people, squeezes by people, almost trips.
Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his
dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.
Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.
ROBBIE
(HEATED WHISPER)
What are you doing?
CAL
I don't know. What are you doing?
Robbie's eyes well up with tears.
ROBBIE
I was wrong, Dad. There's no such
thing as --
Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:

103 CONTINUED: (3) 103
CAL
My son's graduation speech sucks.
GASPS from the crowd.
ON CAL
Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an
entire eighth grade graduation ceremony.
He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS.
THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.
CAL
In fairness, I don't know where he
was going but I think we can all
agree it was heading in a pretty
depressing direction. And I
basically wrote it for him. I
mean, I didn't literally write it
but I sure as hell influenced it,
and the kid's already a spitting
image of his mother and I'll be
damned if this is what he's going
to get from me.
People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck.
CAL
My son -- not him, my actual son --
he believes in grand romantic
gestures. He believes that people
have soulmates. And we always
want to tell our thirteen-year-
olds that they're wrong, that `one
day you'll understand, young man.'
But maybe it should be the other
way around.
He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.
CAL
I met my soulmate when I was
fifteen years old. Our first
date, we went for ice cream.
After, my dad started teasing me
about my `first date' the way dads
do. And I told him: `stop making
a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go
on lots of dates with plenty of
girls.' That was the first time I
ever lied to my father.
(THEN)

CAL (CONT'D)
I met my soulmate when I was
fifteen years old. And I have
loved her with everything I have
for every minute, of every day,
ever since she let me buy her that
first mint chip ice cream. I have
loved her through the birth of our
three perfect children, and I have
loved her even as I've hated her --
only married couples can truly
understand that one. And I don't
know what will wind up happening
with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm
sorry I can't give you that -- but
I promise you this: I will never
stop trying. When you find `the
one' you never give up trying...
and I love you, my amazing boy,
for reminding me of that.
Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses
his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.
Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:
ROBBIE
I still love you, Jessica! I've
loved you since the first time you
changed my sister's diaper! I've
loved you since...
The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie
continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back.
The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.
They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob.
CAL
Hi, Nanna.
HANNAH
Daddy.
He smiles at her, adoring.
CAL
My perfect girl.
He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.
(CONTINUED)
118.
104 CONTINUED: 104
CAL
I already ordered a gun. I'm not
kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on
a shady internet site, I can show
you the receipt. If you hurt her,
I am prepared to shoot you in the
face.
JACOB
Cal, I'm not going to --
CAL
Shut up, Jacob.
Jacob shuts up.
CAL
Wow. I like that.
Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:
CAL
Is that a new shirt?
JACOB
Hannah took me to the Gap. It's
actually not as bad as I thought.
CAL
Seriously?
JACOB
Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.
I got this at Nordstrom's.
And like that... order is restored in the universe.
OVER TO ROBBIE
Who approaches Jessica.
ROBBIE
It was nice of you to come.
JESSICA
I wouldn't have missed it.
Awkward.
ROBBIE
So, how are things with your dad?
(CONTINUED)
119.
104 CONTINUED: (2) 104
JESSICA
Strained. I took a summer
internship up at Stanford, gonna
head up there early. Figure it
can't hurt to get out of his line
of sight for a while.
ROBBIE
Yeah, probably a good idea.
(THEN)
You were a good baby-sitter,
Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you
uncomfortable.
He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
JESSICA
Wait: I thought you weren't
giving up.
ROBBIE
I'm not. But I figure: you like
my dad, and one day I'll look like
my dad, so I'll just come for you
then.
Jessica smiles.
JESSICA
It's a good plan.
She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.
JESSICA
Until then: a little graduation
gift. To help get you through
high school.
She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of
envelope she once used for...
Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses
him, sweetly, on the cheek.
JESSICA
You take care, Robbie.
Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps
up next to his son.
CAL
You okay, buddy?

ROBBIE
(RE: ENVELOPE)
I am now, Dad. I am now.
Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles.
TRACY (O.S.)
I'm terrified of what's going to
become of him once he hits
puberty.
Cal turns, Tracy has been watching.
CAL
We might have to lock him up.
Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.
TRACY
You gave a good eighth grade
graduation speech.
CAL
I've been working on it for thirty
years, so...
She LAUGHS, then... quiet.
TRACY
Do you think we can ever come back
from all this, Cal?
CAL
I don't know. I'd like to try
though. I know I'd like to try.
She nods, thinking.
TRACY
Things are just so messed up. And
it's been such a strange year.
I've been in such a strange place.
And we have all these problems, so
many problems I've lost count, but
at the end of the day, I mean, the
only thing I know --
She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:
TRACY
I am just so glad you took me for
that ice cream.
Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:

TRACY
It was rocky road by the way.
CAL
No!
As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream
was, we PULL BACK.
Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and
watches them enjoy one another's company.
He smiles.
FADE OUT.
