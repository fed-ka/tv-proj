                                  RYAN
                    Please.  Sign my sheet.  I need to 
                    get back to work.

                                  LAUREN
                    I see your needs differently.   You 
                    must get it out.  Grief must be 
                    witnessed to be healed.   Elizabeth 
                      Kubler-Ross.  

                                  RYAN
                    Here s a quote:  Sign my thing. 

                                  LAUREN
                    There is something growing inside 
                    you, Ryan.  If you don t handle it, 
                    it will come out.  Probably 
                      violently, and at the worst time.  
                    You will, quite simply, explode.  
                       Suppressed grief suffocates, it 
                    rages within the breast, and is 
                    forced to multiply its strength.   
                    Ovid.  Sorry, that s two quotes 
                    right on top of each other, but 
                    they re really good quotes!

                                  RYAN
                    Look, I m sure you know your stuff.  
                    You re, what, a licensed therapist?  
                    Even so --

                                  LAUREN
                    I m not, actually.

                                  RYAN
                          (thrown)
                    Oh.  Okay, fine.  But you re 
                    qualified for the work.  You ve 
                    suffered through some big life 
                    change yourself...

                                  LAUREN
                    My personal experience is really 
                    not the issue.

                                  RYAN
                          (beat)
                    Huh.  So, no?

      Lauren reaches her car.  GO ON "PILOT" 27.

                                  LAUREN
                    I have places to be.  I ll see you 
                    next week.


      We start TIGHT ON car wheels, then TILT UP to reveal the odd 
      vehicle to which they re attached: it s colorfully painted 
      and covered in CAMERAS.  It s THE GOOGLE MAPS CAR.    

      WIDEN TO REVEAL two men giving chase on foot.  It s Ryan and 
      Owen, running close behind the car, waving their arms, 
      outfitted in the CRAZY MEDIEVAL GARB we d seen in the room 
      Ryan first entered.  They look ridiculous: draped in weird 
      skins, waving ODD WEAPONS.  They laugh, enjoying their bid 
      for weird internet immortality.

      They re not alone.  Following close behind is the REST OF THE 
      GROUP, similarly adorned, all looking very  Game of Thrones -
      y.  Except for Mr. K.  He s just shirtless.  They all run and 
      wave as well.  It s cathartic.  Joyous even.

      Finally, we WIDEN FURTHER to reveal a last group pursuing our 
      bunch.  The sorry souls who made up that DORKY Medieval role-
      play group in the first place, dressed in their street 
      clothes.  Their run is less of a bonding catharsis.  They d 
      just like their stuff back, please.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
