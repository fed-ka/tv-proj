          A serene glassy lake stretches out before us, surrounded
          by trees and mountains.  Peaceful sounds of nature; birds,
            crickets, frogs, etc. are slowly replaced by a MYSTERIOUS
          GROANING HUM, almost like the sound whales make, except
          bigger, lower, more ominous.  The sound builds, the nature
          sounds building with it, as if something is about to
          happen, then CRACK! -- and complete silence -- as a tiny
            vibration ripples across the surface of the lake.



            A tree-lined country road which probably doesn't see much
          traffic.  Nature sounds slowly return as the VIEW REVEALS:

          A small TRUCK with a CAMPER SHELL, its front end SMASHED
          by contact with a large TREE.

          Walt's cruiser is parked haphazardly on the side of the
          road, driver's door open, as if he's just seen the wreck
          and pulled off in a hurry.  WALT moves towards the car,
          radio in hand, calling in for help.

                                        WALT
                                (into radio)
                        Yeah, the Worden road, about two
                        miles north of the bridge.  Send
                        an ambulance.

          Walt steps closer to the car and looks inside.  After a
          moment, he clicks the radio and speaks again.

                                        WALT
                        You'd better send out the coroner
                          instead.

          WE MOVE IN to see the BODY in the front seat of the car. 
          It's a WOMAN, her hands still clutching the steering wheel,
          her mouth open as if she's screaming in fright. 

                                        WALT
                        What the hell --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/5/04 - GREEN          2.

          He leans in, scrutinizing the woman's face.  The camera
          moves closer to see TINY RED SLASHES, crusted over with
          blood, crisscrossing the woman's face and neck.  Even her
          clothes have been shredded.

          Off Walt's look...



          Purdy, having just collected his books and papers, hurries
          out to find Johnny leaning against the wall, waiting for
          him.

                                        PURDY
                        What was that about the two
                          prophets?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just a question.  Actually, I
                        came on more earthly matters.

                                        PURDY
                        How can I help you?

          Johnny levels his gaze at Purdy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The strangest thing happened the
                        other day.  I got a property tax
                        bill in the mail.

                                        PURDY
                        Nothing strange about that... 
                        You own a house.

          Johnny shows Purdy a property tax statement --

                                        JOHNNY
                        But this was for a piece of land
                        out in North County.  I've never
                        even been there.  Bellevue Estates. 
                        Ever heard of it?

          Purdy is momentarily startled, then regains his composure.

                                        PURDY
                        Must be some kind of mistake.
                          Probably a forgotten piece of
                        land held by the trust your mother
                        set up for you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I thought.  I mean,
                        you're the trustee, you'd know if
                          somebody was buying land in my
                        name...

                                        PURDY
                        Let me take care of that.

          Purdy tries to take the statement; Johnny holds on to it.

                                to this)

                        I just thought you might know
                        what it was.

          Johnny starts to move his hand near Purdy; before he can,
          Johnny's CELL PHONE rings.  Purdy gets off lucky --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?  Hey, Walt... What?  Sure,
                        I'll be right there...

          Johnny lowers the phone and looks at Purdy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like we'll have to continue
                        this another time.

          Johnny turns and walks away, leaving behind a shaken Purdy.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/3/04 - YELLOW         6.

          down on a bench to watch.  Johnny shoves his hands in

                        Stop the game!  The kids are in
                        danger!
                                (then yelling)
                        J.J. -- Get off the field!  J.J.!!

          J.J. turns to see what the fuss is about.  Johnny starts
          running onto the field.

                                        COACH
                        Hey, what are you doing?

          Johnny is starting to grab kids, ushering them off the
          field, making his way toward J.J.

          The coach and TWO DADS grab him.  Bruce tries to intervene.

                                        COACH
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                        These kids are in danger...

                                        COACH
                        Yeah from you...

          The five men start to tussle as the game comes to a stop,
          everyone's attention on Johnny at the eye of the storm. 
          But then...

          A SCREAM

          Turns everyone around to see:


          FOUR ANGRY HORSES

          Running four abreast at a full gallop, scattering terrified
          kids in every direction.



          A more literal view of Johnny's vision...

          - Kids running for their lives

          - The horses splitting up, angry, pursuing terrified kids

            - Parents risking their lives to pull kids out of the way
          of the out of control horses.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/1/04 - PINK         13.

          - Bruce, a kid under each arm, barely escapes being
            trampled.

          - One of the Dads who tussled with Johnny is trampled.


  1313JOHNNY

          fights his way to J.J., frozen with fear in the middle of
          the field.  Just as he reaches him, the white stallion
          singles them out, charging.  Johnny pulls J.J. to the
          ground and covers him with his body.  The horse rears up,
            seemingly ready to stomp Johnny to death.


          IN SLOW MOTION

          Johnny looks up at the horse, prepared to be crushed. 
          The horse comes down, his front paws missing Johnny by
          inches.  The horse tosses his angry head back and forth,
          their eyes meeting.  It's almost as if the horse came
          here to deliver a message to Johnny.  Then...

          The horse lifts it's head and turns away, suddenly running
          off, the other horses following his lead.


  13A13AWHOOP - WHOOP

          A Sheriff's cruiser pulls right onto the field.  The horses
          now gone, disappearing as suddenly as they appeared.

          Johnny looks up, his life spared.  He lets J.J. up and
          gives him a protective hug.  Off Johnny's look after the
            horses...



          Johnny, WALT, Bruce and J.J. at the cruiser.  The horses,
          now calmed, are tied up nearby eating grass.  Two ANIMAL
          CONTROL OFFICERS are loading them into horse trailers.

                                        WALT
                        They sure don't seem crazy now.

                                        J.J.
                        You should have seen them Dad. 
                        Johnny saved my life.

                        young man.

                        Look at 'em now, just eating grass,
                        not a care in the world.  Never
                        know anything was wrong ...except
                        for the blood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Any idea where they came from?

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, a boarding farm over in
                        Worden.  Ran all the way through
                        town to get here.

          Johnny steps over to the white stallion.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Worden?  Where the bats were?

                                        WALT
                                (ahead of Johnny)
                        Yeah...

          Johnny touches the now friendly stallion's face,
          triggering:


          FIELD - DAY

          What the horse saw as Johnny covered J.J. on the ground. 
          The screams of the kids are nearly drowned out by the
          STRANGE GROANING SOUND heard over the opening shot.



          The horse nuzzles Johnny before the Animal Control officer
          leads him away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to go out to that farm
                        with you.

                                        WALT
                        I was counting on it.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD         15.



          A road leads up to a quiet farmyard containing the usual
          farm buildings: a small white house, a henhouse, a barn. 
          A sign on the fence out front reads "CARTER FARM.  HORSE
          RENTALS AND TRAIL RIDES."



          A car, its driver's side door open, sits in front of the
          house.  There are no people in sight.  Walt's cruiser
          pulls into the yard, followed by the animal control van. 
          Walt and Johnny get out of the car and look around.  The
          farm is quiet.  Too quiet.  The only sound is the PING,
          PING, PING of the abandoned car, door open, keys inside. 
          Walt indicates a shattered fence railing.

                                        WALT
                        Looks like that's where the horses
                        got out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They went right through the fence. 
                          Something must have really scared
                        them...

          The two of them look around.  Walt nods towards the car.

                                        WALT
                        It looks like somebody else was
                        trying to get out of here fast...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And didn't make it ...

          Johnny touches the car door.



          Chaos.  The sound of farm animals in terror.  A MAN runs
          for the open car door, a shotgun in one hand.  He turns
          back and forth, not sure which direction the danger is
          coming from.  Suddenly, his eyes widen as he raises the
          shotgun.  BOOM.



          Johnny looks around.  No sign of anyone, no dead body. 
          Nothing.  He kneels down.  The Animal Control Officer
          gets out of the van.  Inside the van, the sound of horses
          kicking at the walls, suddenly frantic again.

                        There was a man with a shotgun...
                        trying to get to the car... he
                        was scared... didn't see what
                        of... he took a shot at
                          something...

          Johnny indicates a spot on the ground.  There's a small
          pool of BLOOD in the dirt, with a TRAIL of BLOOD DROPS
          heading off toward the house. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's check the house.

          The man runs across the farmyard.  A WOMAN and LITTLE
          GIRL are frozen in fear, out in the open.  A SNARLING
          DOG, head lowered, stands between them and the car, ready
          to attack.

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        Daddy, something's wrong with
                        Cody --

                        They've all gone crazy!  Get back
                        in the house!  Run!  

          The man gets between his family and the dog--



          An ambulance stands in the yard.  The man's body has been
          covered with a sheet.  The woman is on a stretcher, being
          loaded into the ambulance.  Walt helps the little girl,
          into the back of the ambulance.  He leans over the woman,
          trying one more time to get a coherent story out of her.

                                        WALT
                        Ma'am.  The animals.  Did something
                        scare the animals?  Did they come
                        after you and your family?

          The woman just stares at him.  Walt gives up.  The doors
          close.  Johnny turns to Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In the vision, he said, "they've
                        all gone crazy" -- like it was  
                        all the animals, they just went
                          berserk.

                        Could you tell why?

          Johnny just shakes his head no.  They glance over to where
          the Animal Control Officer is still waiting, clearly
          freaked out.

          His call goes unanswered.  Puzzled, he steps into the

          lands on his hand.  Then another, landing on his cheek. 
          Hearing another LOW GROWL he looks UP to see...


          A COUGAR

          In the tree above him, eyes locked on Purdy, blood dripping
          from his mouth and paws.


          RESUME PURDY

          Gulp.  He realizes he's standing there looking like dinner
          and a snack.  Without taking his eyes off the Cougar,
          Purdy begins gingerly backing up, then freezes when the
          GROWLING STOPS.


          THE COUGAR

          watches, poised.


          PURDY

          Keeps backing up... back... back...


          THE COUGAR

          drops from the tree, now stalking him.


          PURDY

          Turns and runs the last ten yards.

          THE COUGAR

          springs from it's crouching position, bounding toward
          Purdy.


          PURDY

          Fumbles with the door knob...


          COUGAR'S POV

          Racing across the yard toward Purdy, accelerating as it's
          predator instinct kicks in.  Time to thin the herd.  The
          VIEW CRASHES IN ON HIS VICTIM just as...


          PURDY

          Gets through the door, slamming it behind him.  He turns
          to look back out the glass paneled door -- the Cougar is
          gone.  Vanished.



            Establishing shot.  A large hospital, big enough to boast
            a psychiatric observation ward.



          Bruce's S.U.V. slows down, and turns from the two-lane
          highway onto a dirt road.



          Johnny and Bruce stand looking at the trailer.  It looks
          as if it's been through a war.  The sides are dented in,
          and the paint is scraped off as if by claws.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd say this is the place.

          But Bruce is looking back at his car, examining it, buffing
          out some imagined scrapes with his sleeve.  As Johnny
          pushes open the trailer door, Bruce locks his car, the
          WHOOP-WHOOP sounding weird in the woods.



            A BEARCAM POV rushes towards the trailer, impossibly fast.



          A huge bear rocks the trailer like it was a toy, howling
          with rage.



          Now on the opposite side from the door, he bear rips away
          a piece of the trailer, like he was opening a bee hive
          for honey.



          Johnny can hear the bear scramble around the side of the
          trailer.  He throws himself at the back wall, pounding on
          it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Yogi!  Back over here!

          The bear ROARS and throws itself at the trailer, nearly
          knocking Johnny to the floor.  It swipes at the trailer,
          pulling it apart like a can opener.  But Johnny's got it
            occupied.  He hears Bruce's car screech up and THROWS
          open the door just as --


          BRUCE'S SUV

          SLAMS into the trailer.  Johnny throws open the back door
          and hurls himself inside. 

          And Bruce hits the gas, screeching away from the trailer...


          THE BEAR

          Rears up on his hind legs, howling with rage as his prey
          escapes.



          From the dog's P.O.V. -- his jaws clamped down on his
          FRIGHTENED OWNERS ARM -- as the owner tries to shake him
          off.  The owner's screams are drowned out by THE STRANGE
          SOUND again.



          The Cleaves Mills Community Center as a meeting gets
          underway inside.  A letterboard reads: "EMERGENCY MEETING
          9:00 P.M."



          Keane leads Johnny, Walt and Bruce deeper into the woods. 
          They aren't really following a trail, instead crashing
          through thick vegetation.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)

                        he's going?

                        No.

                        I hope you're right about this,
                        Johnny.  I really don't have time
                        for this.
                                (then to Keane)
                        Hey, Keane, we've been hiking for
                        two hours, how much further?

                                        KEANE
                        Are you feeling it?

                                        BRUCE
                        Feeling what?

                        An edginess.  A sense of
                          anticipation.  Like the animal
                          instinct inside all of us is being
                          awakened by something... We're
                        getting close.

          Walt and Bruce exchange a look -- this dude is nuts. 


          JOHNNY

            Meanwhile is feeling it.  Or something... He holds his
          hands out in front of him, almost like they were antennas
          picking up a distant radio signal.  The view RAMPS INTO
          HIM, crashing tight into his ear as HE HEARS THE MYSTERIOUS*
          SOUND.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        That sound... what is that?*


          RESUME WIDER*

          Suddenly a GUNSHOT snaps Johnny out of his vision as it
          echoes through the forest from nearby.  Followed by another
          and another.  Then the BOOM of a shotgun.

                        That gunshot came from just up
                        ahead.  Watch yourselves.

          They move off, following Walt, who pulls his gun.*

          The four men run through the silent woods.  Another CRACK-
          BOOM ahead of them.  Walt switches direction, running
          towards the sound.

          The others tear off after Walt, and round a bend.

          Walt is kneeling down next to a moaning Doug.  Beside him
          hover an anxious Doug and another HUNTER.  Johnny comes
          over.  Doug has been SHOT in the leg.  Walt looks up.

                                        WALT
                        What the hell happened?

          Stan looks at him, eyes wide.

                        I shot him.  I didn't mean to...

          Bruce breaks a first aid kit out of his pack.

                        He's okay, just a couple of pellets
                        grazed him.

                        We got separated.  Something was

          he raises his gun and listens.  WE HEAR THE STRANGE OMINOUS*

                                        KEANE
                        A new dam cut off the river that
                        fed all these streams.  They
                        started filling the reservoir a
                        while back.  Since then this whole
                          watershed has dried up.

          Johnny leans down and touches the trickle of water.


7070A VISION

          As Johnny's POV moves down into the murky water, rocketing
          faster and faster... snaking through the algae choked
          remnants of the river until the view suddenly shifts
          UPWARDS, breaking the surface to reveal a smooth cement
          WALL -- THE DAM. 

          VISION JOHNNY stands knee deep in a small pool at the
          base of the dam, looking up at the wall of cement in front
          of him.  Suddenly, he HEARS THE GROANING SOUND from his
          earlier visions.  This time LOUDER.  He looks for the
          animal making the strange sound -- but then a realization
          dawns on him --  it becomes clear the sound is not an
          animal, but the sound of concrete and steel being stressed
          beyond the breaking point.

    70CONTINUED:70

          The whale-song like groan is suddenly punctuated by a
          THUNDEROUS CRACK as the damn suffers a catastrophic
          failure, the concrete wall exploding outward as millions
          of gallons of water consume Vision-Johnny in a heartbeat.


  7171RESUME DRY RIVERBED - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny comes out of the vision, gasping for air, reacting
          as if he's just been crushed by a million acre-feet of
          water.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, what is it?  What did you
                        see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The sound... the one from my
                        visions... the one that's been
                        terrifying the animals... it's
                        not another animal... it's the
                        dam... the sound of the dam
                        failing... and it's going to flood
                        Cleaves Mills.

          Off everyone's stunned reactions...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          With Johnny leading the way, he, Walt, Bruce and Keane
          emerge into a clearing, and look up, where --


          THE CLEAVELAND DAM

          looms above them; its spillway dry.


          ON THE FOUR MEN

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can see the offices.  On the
                        right side of the dam.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let's go.



          Johnny, Walt, Bruce and Keane walk across the top of the
          dam, stopping to look at the serene lake forming behind
          the dam as it fills.

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks solid enough.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That doesn't mean anything.

          The four men double their pace, finding their way to a
          door marked "DAM CONTROL ROOM - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY." 
          They burst through the door to find SCOTT (thirties,
          engineer).

                                        SCOTT
                        Hey!  You can't come in here.

                                        WALT
                          Sheriff's department.  We'd like
                        to talk to you.



          As Scott and the others run, behind them the dam crumbles. 
          A wall of water approaches, then overtakes the camera.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT FOUR - 3/3/04 - YELLOW      54.



          A billboard stands above a swampy bog, it reads "FUTURE
          HOME OF BELLEVUE ESTATES - If you lived here, you'd be
          home by now."



          Scott's vehicle pulls up, Walt slowing down just long
          enough for Johnny to jump out.

                                        BRUCE
                        You need some help?





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT FOUR - 3/5/04 - GREEN      55A.


    80CONTINUED:80

                                        JOHNNY
                        You guys go ahead.  I need to
                        talk to him alone.  Just be ready
                        to evacuate if we don't get through
                        to the governor in time.



          Johnny bangs on the front door.  No answer. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?  Are you in there?  Gene! 
                        It's Johnny Smith.  Open up.

          Bangs harder.  Still no answer.  He touches the doorknob
          triggering:

    80C80CVISION: PURDY

          A tight flash of him defending himself from an unseen
            attacker, his arms lacerated and bloody.


    80D80DRESUME JOHNNY

          He comes out of the vision, worried.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene!

          He heads off, looking for a way into the house.



          Water roaring out of the spillway as the reservoir is
          drained.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Watching the cascade of water.  Purdy is cleaned up, but
          that's not the only difference.  He's been stripped of
          his arrogance as well.

                                        PURDY
                          I started out with a tiny
                          congregation in an abandoned movie
                          theater.  But God had bigger plans
                        for me, or so I thought.  He
                          rewarded my ambitions, led me
                        here to Cleaves Mills.

                                        PURDY (CONT'D)
                        Called on me to do great things
                        for him.  Faith Heritage was the
                        answer to that call.  But somehow,
                        maybe I was too busy building a
                          monument to him to hear his
                          warnings, let my pride get in the
                        way.  Before I knew it, everything
                        I had built was in danger of being
                        lost... I took risks... Risks
                        that God chose not to reward...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And Bellevue Estates was your
                        plan to make it all back?

                                        PURDY
                        The marina was going to be over
                        there.  The hotel there.  Hundreds
                        of homes and condos.  Thousands
                        of jobs.  Even a lakeside chapel. 
                        All of it, washed away... along
                        with millions of dollars of Faith
                        Heritage's money...
                              (a beat, then to
                                  himself)
                        Why has he done this to me...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked me if I thought the
                          animal's behavior was a sign from
                        God... I'm not a believer like
                        you... but I think you got your
                        answer.

          Purdy, watches the water, lost in thought.

                                        PURDY
                        They'll crucify me...

          Off Johnny watching Purdy, wondering what lies ahead for
          them.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
