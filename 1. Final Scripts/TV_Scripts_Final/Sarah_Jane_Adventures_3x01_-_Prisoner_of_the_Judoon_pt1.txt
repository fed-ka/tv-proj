11EXT. SPACE -- NIGHT

      FX SHOT: SPACE.  Vast, glorious and beautiful.

                                      SARAH JANE (V.O.)
                    My name is Sarah Jane Smith and
                    once I travelled among the stars.

      And now the CAMERA is moving through space...

      Giant, radiant gas clouds.  Wonderful twin stars.  Worlds
      of all colours.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    I saw worlds beyond imagination. 
                    I went to places beyond my wildest
                    dreams and met creatures beyond my
                    darkest nightmares.  And all of it
                    was amazing.

      As she speaks the CAMERA's journey increases in speed,
      cutting across dark space, the stars becoming streaks of
      light...  now approaching a small sun orbited by nine
      planets - our solar system...

                    Then one day, when I wasn't
                    expecting it, I came home.

22EXT. BANNERMAN ROAD -- DAY

      Blue sky.  Sun shining.  You just know that it's a Sunday.

      SARAH JANE comes out of the house.  Smiles at the day.

                                      SARAH JANE (V.O.)
                    Life changed.

      Across the road she can see HARESH washing his car.  GITA's 
      Bloomin' Lovely van is parked there, too.  She is watering*
      the hedge.  As Haresh turns away from her, mischievous*
      Gita aims the hose and splashes Haresh.  *

      Sarah Jane grins broadly.

                                      SARAH JANE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    More than I could ever have believed
                    possible.

      As LUKE follows her out of the house.  Kisses her goodbye.

                                      SARAH JANE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Now I have a son.

      She gets into her car.  As CLYDE and RANI show up, and
      Luke joins them.

                    Even a family, of sorts.

      The kids wave to her as she pulls away in the car.

                    Life is good on Bannerman Road,

                    odd hours.*

      White paint, steel and glass.  Modern, minimalist and cold. 
      SARAH JANE is walking alongside a young power-dressed*
      American businessman, MADISON YORKE.  Confident, arrogant.
 

                                      YORKE
                    No problem, Miss Smith.  Who wants*
                    to go home for the day when you're*
                    on the edge of something bigger
                    than the discovery of fire or
                    splitting the atom.

                                      SARAH JANE

                    many nightmares as they did

      Yorke smiles easily.  He's practiced that smile.

                                      YORKE
                    I know there are people worried
                    about nano-technology, Miss Smith. 
                    But people were scared of
                      electricity, of trains, of
                      telephones.  Science has always
                    scared people.*

      YORKE is leading SARAH JANE through a sparkling hi-tech*
      lab.  Large glass tubes that seem to be filled with a smoky*
      liquid dominate the centre of the room.  Sarah Jane is*
      glancing at a glossy Genetec brochure.

                                      YORKE (CONT'D)
                      Nano-technology is the science of
                    molecular engineering.

      Yorke indicates the tubes.*

                                      YORKE (CONT'D)*
                    This is where we grow the nanoforms. *
                    Our microscopic engineers.*

      He invites her to look down a microscope...

                                      YORKE (CONT'D)
                    Please. *

      Sarah Jane looks through the microscope.

                    heart.  Who knows - even construct*
                    a whole new planet.

      Sarah Jane looks up from the microscope.

                    according to some environmental
                      scientists.

      Yorke laughs and approaches the tubes.  Regards them as he
      speaks - this is where the nanoforms are grown.

                    That might depend on your point of
                    view.  From what I've heard, their
                    methods aren't exactly softly-
                    softly. 

                                    MR SMITH
                    UNIT have isolated the spacecraft

      Mr Smith's graphic indicates something parting from the

                    My calculations suggest that it

      Sarah Jane has the car door open - as GITA hurries across,
      she's carrying a huge bunch of flowers that almost hides
      her.

                    approach.

      Androvax reaches out to Tybo.

      Then the sound of someone coming!

      He stops smiling just as fast, pulls back from Tybo - and
      makes off among the houses -

      As SARAH JANE, LUKE, CLYDE and RANI reach the spot...

                                    RANI
                    Look!

      Luke and Rani swoop, concerned, on the prone Tybo.  There's 
      yellow blood over one of his eyes.

                                    LUKE
                    He's been knocked cold.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Be careful!

      As Tybo begins to stir.  Quickly, Sarah Jane grabs his
      fallen weapon and throws it aside.

      Tybo is suddenly alert - and angry.

      Tybo leaps to his feet, now furious...

                    What did I say?

      But Tybo staggers a little, nearly falls - Luke and Rani
      move to help him.  Tybo shakes them off.

                                    TYBO
                    Ko fro mo!

                    It was weird.  It was like he just
                    stepped inside her body.

                    Androvax is Veil life form.  Can

                    You've had some barmy ideas, but*

                    I still think sending them a letter -
                      a brochure - would be a more
                      conventional approach.

                                    GITA
                    You see, conventional.  That's
                    your problem, my darling.  If you're
                    going to grow in corporate floristry
                    you have to learn to think outside
                    the seed box.  It's a plant eat
                    plant world, Haresh.  Believe me. 
                    Now come on, and careful with that
                    cheese plant!

      And Gita, carrying other plants, heads into Genetec,

      And Yorke looks up.  SARAH JANE is standing in his office,
      the sonic lipstick in her hand.

                    Hello again, Mr Yorke.

      Sarah Jane blows on the sonic like a gun.
