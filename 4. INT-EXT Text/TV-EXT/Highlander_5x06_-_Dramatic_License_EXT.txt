      In a dreamy haze of summer light, an ornate FOUNTAIN stands
      twined with idyllic blooms.  From the far side of the
      fountain, a soft Scottish BURR recites a sonnet:

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    When I am gone, dreame me some
                      happinesse, Nor let thy lookes our
                    long hid love confesse...

      CAMERA TRUCKS AROUND FOUNTAIN where we find --

      MACLEOD

      in a Beau Brummel flouncy shirt, wind gently blowing his
      long, flowing, backlit locks.  He shuts a sheaf of sonnets,
      declaiming from memory, with great sensitivity --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Nor praise, nor dispraise 
                    me... ...nor blesse nor curse 
                    Openly love's force...

      Suddenly a blood-curdling SCREAM shatters this idyll.  MacLeod
      quickly puts the book aside, to see --

      ROXANNE

      young, beautiful, and bodice-ripped: a delicate-mannered
      innocent of noble breeding who looks like she's been ravished
      against her will.  She dashes into the garden, stumbles as
      she looks over her shoulder in tear-streaked fear.  MacLeod
      catches her up in his arms.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    What is wrong, fair lass?

                                      ROXANNE
                    Save me!  Save me, kind sir, for
                    pity's sake!

      She claws at his shirt in desperation, tearing MacLeod's
      blouse open, exposing his powerful chest.

501CONTINUED:501

                                      MACLEOD
                    What miserable villain would take
                    liberties with one so fair?

                                      ROXANNE
                      A monster... a depraved, unspeakable
                    beast... Coventry!

      MacLeod pulls her protectively close.  Between ripped bodice
      and ripped shirt there's a lot of exposed skin in contact.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fear not.  None shall harm you, save
                    he first defeat me.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                          (shout)
                    There you are!

      She gasps in fear.  MacLeod moves her aside, to face --

      TERENCE COVENTRY

      storming into view.  Scowling, unshaven, a barbarian with
      huge black boots and a large, ugly, hairy mole on his cheek. 
      He glares at Roxanne, cowering behind MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                    Damned wench!  I warned you what
                    would happen if you ever tried to
                    leave me.
                          (beat)
                    Now get back to my bedchambers!

                                      ROXANNE
                          (repulsed)
                    I would rather die.

                                      TERENCE
                    You'll wish it so... once I've had
                    my way with you.

      He leers and reaches for her, but MacLeod grabs his arm in a
      grip of steel, holds him fast.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The lady does not want you.
                          (beat)
                    And any fool can see why.

      He pushes Terence away.

                                      TERENCE
                    I've flayed men alive for less than
                    that!

                                      MACLEOD
                    And I have heard frogs with a louder
                    croak.

                                      TERENCE
                    You dare to insult me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe I do.

                                      TERENCE
                    Then you are a fool and you are soon
                    to be a dead fool.
                          (beat; proudly)
                    You must not know to whom you are
                    speaking.

      MacLeod sizes up Terence, strolls around him with a studied,
      casual air.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think I do.
                          (beat)
                    Let me see.  Now, don't coach me, I
                    want to get this right.
                          (beat; eyeing Terence)
                    A bully, a wart hog... and from what
                    I see, one who must make up in sheer
                    ugliness for what he lacks in...
                          (beat)
                    Other areas.

      Terence goes white with rage, draws his sword.

                                      TERENCE
                    You'll need more than fine manners
                    and a sharp tongue to save you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (confident)
                    I have a sharp sword.

      Without warning, Terence lunges -- but MacLeod dodges the
      thrust, pulls his own sword.  The fight is old-time Hollywood:
      parry, thrust, dramatic leaps on the fountain -- nasty LOW
      BLOWS that MacLeod agilely LEAPS to avoid.  MacLeod is
      polished, classy -- Terence a graceless, backstabbing cur. 
      It's Errol Flynn vs. Conan.

      ROXANNE

      watches through wringing hands, each near-miss bringing
      adlibbed GASPS and CRIES.

      As MacLeod gains the upper hand --

501CONTINUED: (3)501

      Terence pulls a DAGGER, slashes MacLeod's shoulder.  MacLeod
      falls back, blood marking his pure white blouse.  Roxanne
      screams, but MacLeod only shrugs off the pain, and goes for
      Terence with more force.

      Terence falls back, looking like a trapped rat.  He lunges,
      grabs Roxanne, and puts his sword to her throat.

                                      TERENCE
                    Drop your blade, or she dies!
                          (beat)
                    I swear, I will kill her where she
                    stands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You coward.

                                      TERENCE
                    Drop it.
                          (beat)
                    Drop it, I say.

      MacLeod has no choice.  He reluctantly lowers his arm, lets
      the sword fall to his feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Harm one hair and you'll answer to
                    Duncan MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                    Fie upon you, MacLeod!  Here's my
                    answer.

      Keeping an eye on MacLeod, his blade at her throat, he RIPS
      her dress, exposing her shoulder, runs his unshaven mouth
      over her skin.  She shudders in disgust as Terence ravishes
      her, and turns pleading eyes on MacLeod.

                                      CAROLYN (V.O.)
                    Roxanne hoped, deep in her heaving
                    breast, that this stranger, this
                    Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod,
                    would somehow save her... but with
                    the brutish Coventry's blade at her
                    throat, all seemed lost.

      ECU - MACLEOD

      there's a twinkle (OPTICAL - SFX: TRIANGLE) in his eye.

      ANGLE - MACLEOD S BOOT

      The sword lies across it.  Suddenly MacLeod flips it UP --

      WIDER

      as he deftly catches the sword, brings it back in a god-
      almighty swing, and we:

                                                                          FREEZE FRAME.

                    And?  And?!


      The FOUNTAIN from the teaser, but it's grungy, covered with
      pond scum.  A MAN bends over it, slurps noisily.  He
      straightens -- it's MACLEOD, unshaven and travel-worn,
      stopping to water himself and his horse in the fountain.  He
      slaps clouds of ROAD-DUST off his breeches, examines a couple
      RIPS in his pants -- real life.  He looks up at --

                                      ROXANNE
                    'Elp!  'elp, 'ee's after me!

      An over-painted, busty hussy, ROXANNE, ducks through the
      trees.  The same woman in the Teaser -- but she has a coarse
      ACCENT, heavily-rouged cheeks, cheap but sexy.

                                      ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                    Sir! Sir!  'Elp me, I beg you!

      She throws herself into MacLeod's surprised arms -- and from
      his reaction, we note that she's not a fan of soap.  Still,
      chivalry and all that...

                    What seems to be the problem?

                          (pointing off)

                    advantage 'o my maidenly honor!

                          (eyeing her)
                    Isn't it a little late for that?

      MACLEOD

      gets the BUZZ.  He pushes Roxanne aside, and she almost falls. 
      MacLeod turns to face --

      TERENCE COVENTRY

      riding up on his hunter.  He gets the BUZZ.  He's now
      elegantly dressed, smooth shaven and mole-less.  He has a
      civilized, couth air, and his anger is all civil indignation.

                                      TERENCE
                    So!  Thought you could take advantage
                    of a gentleman?

      He's off his horse and moving towards the cowering Roxanne,
      who grabs MacLeod.

                                      ROXANNE
                    Save me, kind sir, from a fate worse
                    than death!

                    Oh, please.
                          (to MacLeod, politely)
                    I beg your pardon, sir, but this is
                    none of your affair.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm afraid it is, sir.  It seems you
                    are distressing this... this...
                          (for lack of a better
                            word)
                    lady.

                    Oh, spare me.

      Terence pulls a sword out.  MacLeod draws his own sword,
      handing the reins of his horse to Roxanne.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am Duncan MacLeod, of the Clan

      Terence makes the first move, but this time, he is a fighter
      of accomplished skill.  The pair show great elan as they
      fight around the fountain, then break --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Harsh words, sir.  Where is your
                    proof?

      Terence points with his sword.  MacLeod turns to see --

      ROXANNE

      on MacLeod's horse, spurring it to gallop.

      RESUME MACLEOD

      stunned.  He takes a few futile steps after her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    My horse!  Come back with my horse!

      She doesn't.

                                      TERENCE
                    See?  You see how chivalry is
                    rewarded?  There's no justice.

      They look at each other, then both sheath their swords.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    I'd buy you an ale to drown your
                      sorrows... but she stole every penny
                    I had.

      MacLeod hefts his coin purse, the coins chinking.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At least you have a horse.  If you'll
                    give me a ride to the next tavern,
                    I'll buy the ale.
                          (beat)
                    We can discuss the death of chivalry.

                                      TERENCE
                          (a smile)
                    Done.

      He swings up into his saddle.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    Gentlemen of our caliber must stick
                    together.  Especially when we're
                    taken advantage of...

                    By a hussy of that sort.

      He swings up behind Terence.

                                      TERENCE
                    Actually, I had a better word in
                    mind...

      And as they RIDE OFF, we hear the pre-lapped voice of

                                      TERENCE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          (furious)

                    Gerald!

      A lavish manse, stretch limos in the drive, as we hear the
      CLINK of champagne glasses and swirling MUSIC.


      They step warily onto the empty balcony -- TERENCE COVENTRY
      steps from the shadows, elegant and glowering.

                                      TERENCE
                          (snide)
                    If it isn't the superhero himself...
                    Duncan MacLeod.

      MacLeod recognizes him, steps forward to meet him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Terence Coventry.  Are you here for
                    me?

                                      TERENCE
                    Don't flatter yourself.
                          (looking past him)
                    I'm here for her.

      His eyes stare through the patio doors, into the party where
      we see --

      CAROLYN

      framed in the French doors, signing books, oblivious to the
      danger.

      RESUME TERENCE

      staring at her, seething with hate.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Terence starts for Carolyn, but MacLeod blocks him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If anyone had a reason to kill her,
                    it should be me.  I'm the one with
                    my name on the cover.

                                      TERENCE
                    And I'm the pig with a mole on my
                    face!  A hairy mole!
                          (points to his face)
                    Do you see a mole?!  Do I dress like
                    a pig?!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's a book, Terence -- it'll be
                    forgotten in a few months.

                                      TERENCE
                    Fine for you, she made you the damn
                    hero!
                          (seething)
                    I'm a spineless coward who tries to
                    kill unarmed women!

                                      AMANDA
                    You think that's bad?  She called me
                    a cheap whore and a thief.

      A LONG BEAT as the two men fall silent.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (indignant)
                    I was never cheap!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Terence, I don't like it either, but
                    it's just a book.  You can't kill a
                      defenseless mortal.

                                      AMANDA
                    Says who?

      MacLeod's reply is forestalled as he notices, over Terence's
      shoulder, Carolyn making her way toward them.  He hastily
      shifts so that Terence and Amanda are looking the other way,
      don't see Carolyn.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96505    "Dramatic License"    25.    Final Shooting Script 8/12/96

      They look back at him accusingly, arms crossed.  A beat, he
      considers his options, then:

                                      MACLEOD
                          (warning)
                    We haven't finished talking.

      He strides past them to meet Carolyn.  Amanda and Terence
      watch him go, both looking pissed.

                                      TERENCE
                    She needs to have an accident.  Break
                    her writing arm, get her jaw wired.

                                      AMANDA
                    I'd use poison.  A big rock...
                          (beat)
                    Maybe a stake through the heart.

      Terence manages a smile.

                                      TERENCE
                    I do like the way you think.

      He offers his arm.  Amanda takes it, and they head into the
      party.


      There's a high-octane argument going on between Carolyn and
      Terence.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's my book, Terence... what I do
                    in it is my business.

                                      TERENCE
                    Not when you use my name, it isn't.
                          (beat)
                    And how could you make me such a
                    tasteless bastard?

                                      CAROLYN
                    I suppose you think I should have
                    made you the hero.

                                      TERENCE
                          (exploding)
                    You should never have written any of
                    it!

                                      CAROLYN
                    Are you finished?

                                      TERENCE
                          (softer)
                    Carolyn, why are you doing this?

                                      CAROLYN
                          (hesitates; without
                            rancor)
                    Look, Terence, let's just forget it.
                    You go your way, I'll go mine.

                                      TERENCE
                    What about the book?

      Not exactly what she wanted to hear.  The hard edge returns.

                                      CAROLYN
                    That's all you're interested in,
                    isn't it?
                          (off no response)
                    Wait 'til you see the sequel.

      She turns away.  Terence stops her.

                                      TERENCE
                    Carolyn, you know that's not all I'm
                      interested in.
                          (beat)
                    Come to the house tonight.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Why?  So the staff can hold me down
                    while you put a knife through my
                    heart?

                                      TERENCE
                    It'll just be you and me... I'll
                    even make dinner.

                                      CAROLYN
                    All by yourself?
                          (sarcastic)
                    Then what?  I sit around for five
                    hours while you tell me what a hero
                    you've been and about all the women
                    you've had?

                                      TERENCE
                    You talk.  I'll listen.

                                      CAROLYN
                    That'll be a change.

                                      TERENCE
                    Just say yes.

      He's earnest, beseeching.  She hesitates, waffling.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Maybe.

      She stalks off.  And OFF Terence's look --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                                      AMANDA
                    So tell me all about it.

                                      CAROLYN
                    No.

                            look)

                    I hate him.

      Amanda sees through the reaction.

                                      AMANDA
                    No you don't.  Take it from me.

                    You were right.  I'm out of my league.

                                      AMANDA
                    He said that?

                    Classy...  elegant.

                    A little.
                          (beat)
                    A lot.

                                      AMANDA
                    Oh, boy.  And the book?  All this
                    stuff about the Blade of the MacLeods?

                                      CAROLYN
                    It was a great story.
                          (beat)
                    And it was a way to get back at
                    Terence.

                                      AMANDA
                    Terence?  You're in love with Terence
                      Coventry?!

                    I was.
                          (beat)
                    We met at a Charity Ball six years
                    ago.  Everyone was in costume.  He
                    looked so good in a waistcoat.  He
                    started telling me these stories
                    about an ancestor who'd been a
                    wandering bard and a hired swordsman. 
                    I said he should write a book.  He
                    just laughed.
                          (beat)
                    I fell in love.

                                      AMANDA
                    So... why not happily ever after?

                                      CAROLYN
                          (beat)
                    He told me about being Immortal. 
                    That the stories were true -- that
                    they were about him.
                          (beat)
                    All the worlds I'd dreamed of, read
                    about, my whole life -- he was there. 
                    He's had princesses, queens...
                          (beat)
                    He's going to live forever.  And
                    me... I'm just going to get fat, get
                    old.  And always be from Newark.
                          (beat)
                    It was only a matter of time.

                                      AMANDA
                    So you left him first.
                          (off Carolyn's
                            miserable nod)
                    Changed all his stories.  And decided
                    to come on to MacLeod.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (beat)
                    I wanted to hurt him... To make him
                    mad.

                                      AMANDA
                      Congratulations, it worked.  If he
                    doesn't kill you, he's sure gonna
                    kill --
                          (beat)
                    Oh, God.  MacLeod.

      MacLeod and Amanda walk arm and arm by the lake.

                                      AMANDA
                    God, I'm a sucker for romantic
                    stories.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I couldn't tell.

                                      AMANDA
                          (beat)
                    So, do you think they'll live happily
                    ever after?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know.

      They stop walking.

                                      AMANDA
                    Of course you don't know.  What I'm
                    asking you to do is guess.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why?

                                      AMANDA
                    Because it's part of the conversation.
                          (beat)
                    I ask you a question. You answer the
                    question.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Okay, my guess is maybe.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're no fun at all.

      She starts to walk off by herself.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a wry smile)
                    That's not what you said last night.

      That stops her in her tracks.

                                      AMANDA
                    Bragging now, are we?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (smug)
                    As a matter of fact
                          (beat)
                    Yes.

                                      AMANDA
                    Okay... okay... I've got no problems
                    with you in that department, but...
                          (listing them)
                    You are vain.  You are willful.  You
                    are proud.  And you are and always
                    will be a boy scout.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (in fun)
                    One of the reasons you love me.

      Amanda reacts to MacLeod's last statement.

                                      AMANDA
                    Do we love each other, MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    In our own way.

                                      AMANDA
                    And what way is that?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, you know this never turns
                    out well.

                                      AMANDA
                    What?  What never turns out well?

                                      MACLEOD
                    When we try to dissect what we are.

                                      AMANDA
                    You know what you sounded like just
                    then?

                                      MACLEOD
                    What?

                                      AMANDA
                    A man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda... I am a man.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's beside the point.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What we have is incredibly special. 
                    But it's not mortal love.

                                      AMANDA
                    So?

                                      MACLEOD
                    So I want you to be honest with me. 
                    How many years... no, decades...
                    maybe centuries could you see us
                    spending together?  I don't mean
                    every now and then.  I mean every
                    day... every hour.

                                      AMANDA
                    You mean until one of us killed the
                    other?

                                      MACLEOD
                    My point exactly.

      Amanda turns and starts to walk off.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's not fair.  All a girl wants is
                    a little romance.  To be swept off
                    her feet every now and then.

      MacLeod comes up behind her and sweeps her off her feet.  He
      lifts her in his arms as if she was as light as a feather. 
      He kisses her.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Now that's more like it.

      He looks at her, lovingly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I do love you, Amanda.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know.

      As MacLeod carries her off --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
