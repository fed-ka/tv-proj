      KALINDA waits.  The slightest impatience.  Pacing on a 
      skyscraper loading dock, looking out at the night.  A black 
      SEDAN pulls up, headlights slashing across her.  A woman gets 
      out.  LANA THE FED.  A smile on her face.  Calm.  

                                  LANA
                    Is this the place?

      Kalinda just turns inside.  Lana smiles, follows. 


      Where the power Democratic crowd goes to let their hair down. 


      Skidddddd.  We speed through traffic, racing up to a crime 
      scene.  A mass of patrol cars.  A clapboard two-story.  Near 
      a college campus.  Kalinda driving.  She jumps out, sees...

      ...a cop sitting on the sidewalk, head in hands, upset.  
      FOLEY.  From the task force.  A wrestler s body.  Kalinda 
      eyes him as she rushes past, starts into...

                                  HUNTER
                    It s a meth finisher.  They 
                      manufacture it out of town, dry and 
                    package it here.  We d been working 
                    on the bust for a week.  

      Kalinda stares at an emotional Hunter, then eyes Foley and 
      BRAD on the curb, a skinny Task Force member.     

                                  HUNTER (CONT D)
                    Jack was the first one through the 
                    door.  Cleared.  We came in-- shot came 
                    out of nowhere.  Top of the stairs.  
                    Meth dealer named Gorman.  We d been 
                    following him for six months.  Trade of 
                    fire-- we took him down.     

                                  KALINDA
                    Why was Jack through the door 
                    alone?

                                  HUNTER
                    He wasn t through the door alone.  
                    We were there.

                                  KALINDA
                    Not fast enough.

      Hunter stares at her.  Fuck you.  Looks past her toward a 
      detective getting out of his car.  Not polite:

                                  HUNTER
                    Would you excuse me a second?

    And Hunter brushes past Kalinda, heads toward the arriving 
      detective.  The two men hug each other, and Kalinda sees the 
      other man is...

      ...Burton.

       Bang -- the distant sound of a gunshot.  Inside...


      Jackie.  She doesn t look happy as she eyes several homeless 
        African-American men waiting at a kitchen door.  The door is 
      opened by PASTOR ISAIAH.  Calm, direct, splendid as always.   

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    Apologies, gentlemen, for my 
                    lateness.  Please head in and--

    He sees Jackie waiting.  

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH (CONT D)
                    --find yourselves a seat.  
                          (goes to Jackie)
                    Mrs. Florrick?  Hello.

                                  JACKIE
                    Hello,  Pastor. 

      Isaiah studies her.  Can read everything in her body language.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    What can I do for you?

                                  JACKIE
                    You can leave my son alone.

      Isaiah smiles.    

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    Won t you come in?  

                                  JACKIE

                    You say you re a man of god; then 
                    stop making him feel this way.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    And what way is that, ma am?

                                  JACKIE
                    Like he s a bad man.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    He isa bad man.

                                  JACKIE
                    How dare you?

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    I m a bad man.  Even you, Mrs. 
                    Florrick--

                                  JACKIE
                    Who do you think you are?!  You 
                    think you know people?  You just use 
                    the same words with everyone!  You 
                    just say  god  and you think you can 
                    make people feel bad about 
                      themselves.   

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    Mrs. Florrick, your son approached 
                    me.  He wanted advice from me.  And 
                    I will continue to offer advice--

                                  JACKIE
                    And I will do everything in my power 
                    to stop you.  You don t know my son.  
                    This is a phase.  Youare a phase.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    Then we ll... see.

                                  JACKIE
                    No, you llsee.  He s running.  
                    This year.  He s my blood; and I 
                    don t know what your god does, but 
                    it doesn t match that.

    The two stare at each other.   


    The farm again.  Diane s car pulls up.  When-- booom-booom-
      boom!  Inside...


      McVeigh opens his door.  Looks at Diane standing there.  She 
      doesn t say a word, just stares at him.  He takes a second, 
      opens the door wider.  She smiles, starts in.  He follows her 
    in, closes the door behind her.
