      A big old house with extensive grounds behind high walls and 
      ornate iron gates.  Police vehicles are parked every which 
      way.  A mobile command center is set up.  Cops hustle to and 
      fro.  A SWAT TEAM enters the house.


      PATRICK JANE stands still, gazing into space, waiting. 

      A door opens, and he moves forward, makes his way through 
      security gates and metal detectors into the prison.

      Jane stands opposite Jared Renfrew, separated by a fence.  
      Jane s anxious, suspicious, watchful.  Jared is a well-spoken 
      clever sexy rich bad boy who took one too many wrong turns in 
      life.  

                                  JARED 
                    Thank you for coming.

                                  JANE
                    You said you have information about 
                    Red John.

                                  JARED
                    Yes I do.  He killed your wife and 
                    daughter eh?  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                                  JARED
                    I've heard a lot about you.  I 
                    heard that you can tell when people 
                    are lying.  

                                  JANE
                    Do you have information about Red 
                    John?

                                  JARED
                    I have dynamite information about 
                    Red John.  Enough to catch him.

                                  JANE
                    How do you come by this 
                      information?

                                  JARED
                    Red John is a friend of a friend of 
                    mine.

                                  JANE
                    Is this friend in prison too?

                                  JARED
                    I have friends from all walks of 
                    life.

                                  JANE 
                    Okay.  Tell me.

                    I'm serving twenty-five to life for 
                    a crime I didn't commit.  My last 
                    appeal just failed.  Get me out of 
                    here and I will give you Red John.

                                  JANE
                    You raped and murdered your family 
                      housekeeper's daughter.  If you 
                    have heard a lot about me, you'd 
                    know I m not a real magician.  

                                  JARED
                    I didn't do it.

                                  JANE
                    I read the case file.  The physical 
                    evidence and the testimony of all 
                    the witnesses, including your own 
                    family, says you did. 

                                  JARED
                    I didn't kill her.  I loved Undine.  
                    I was going to marry her.  Thought 
                    about it anyhow.  I didn't kill 
                    her. 

                                  JANE
                    What happened?

                                  JARED
                    I don't know.  We were partying.  
                    I did some blow, a little meth.  We 
                    had sex, I fell asleep.  Next thing 
                    I know, it's morning, Undine's dead 
                    and the cops are busting in.  Good 
                    morning to you too.

                                  JANE
                    The door was locked from the 
                    inside.  

                                  JARED
                    Yes.  I locked it when we got 
                    there. For privacy.

                                  JANE
                    So how is it even physically 
                    possible that anyone else could 
                    have done the murder?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    4.

                    I don't know.  But I didn't.  Ergo, 
                    someone else did.  Someone that you 
                    can find.  You see me.  Am I lying 
                    to you?  

                                  JANE 
                    You seem to be telling the truth.  
                    But you're a clever and 
                      unprincipled narcissist in a 
                    desperate corner.  Even if you are 
                    innocent, it doesn't mean you know 
                    anything about Red John.  It's a 
                    close call.  I have to say no.  

      Jane turns to go.

                                  JARED
                    Your wife, Red John painted her 
                    toenails, didn't he?

      Hooked, Jane stops, does a slow turn.

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    Yes.  Painted them with her blood.  
                    Creepy.  The cops never made that 
                    public, did they?  

      Jane stares, transfixed.  

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    She's the only instance he did that 
                    huh?  A little touch of elegance 
                    for you alone.  

      Beat.  Jane looks stern, almost menacing.

                                  JANE
                    How do you know that?

                                  JARED
                    I told you, Red John is a friend of 
                    a friend of mine.  

                                  JANE 
                    What's the name of your friend?

                                  JARED
                    His name is get me out of here, 
                    then I will tell you.  That and 
                    much more.  I will sing like a

      Jane strolls up to the closed iron gates, presses a button on 
      an up to date intercom system. 

                                    HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)
                    Hello.

                                  JANE
                    My name is Patrick Jane.  I'd like 
                    to speak to Gardner Renfrew about

      Beat.  Jane waits. 

                                    HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Mr. Renfrew says no thank you.

                    Tell Mr. Renfrew that I can prove 
                    his brother is innocent.  And I 
                    know who really committed the 
                    murder. 

      A beat.  Jane waves his arms in a wizard's open sesame 
      gesture, and as if prompted by him, the GATES GLIDE OPEN 
        electronically.  Jane ambles through the gates toward the 
      house.


      Jane emerges from the main house and heads for the little 
      guesthouse. 

      When Gardner hurries to catch him, Jane breaks into a trot. 

      MURIEL RENFREW (60's) -- high class and knows it -- is 
      gardening or rather, supervising a GARDENER when she sees 
      Jane and her son come hurrying across the lawn toward her.

                                    GARDNER 
                    Go inside, Mother!  Go inside!

                    What are you blathering about?

                                    GARDNER
                    He's some kind of crazy person. 

      Jane smiles winningly.

                                  JANE
                    I assure you I'm not ma'am.  
                    I'm perfectly harmless.  My name's 
                    Patrick Jane.  I want to speak to 
                    you about your son, Jared.  

                                    GARDNER
                    I'll deal with him Mother.  The 
                    police are on their way.  Just go 
                    inside.

                                  MURIEL
                    Don't order me about.  And don't be 
                    so hysterical.  What's your 
                    interest in Jared?

                    prove his innocence.

                                  MURIEL
                    Come and sit down.

      She leads Jane toward a patio and a table and chairs...

                                    GARDNER
                    Mother.  You're being childish. 

                                  MURIEL
                    Go away, Gardner.

                    Go away.

      He goes away.  Muriel and Jane sit down on the patio.  
      There's a tea serving tray and a PAPERBACK MYSTERY NOVEL on 
      the table (Agatha Christie).  Muriel studies Jane.  He looks 
      back without guile.

                                  MURIEL (CONT'D)
                    Jane.  Like the girl or the Indian

                                  JANE
                    Like the girl.

                    Now tell me Mr. Jane, why do you 
                    wish to prove my son's innocence?

                                  JANE
                      Friendship.  Justice. 

      Muriel's polite smile and silent gaze manages to convey that 
      she doesn't believe a word and won't cooperate until she's 
      satisfied.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I have reasons of my own.  You 
                    don't need to know about them. 

                                  MURIEL
                    Of course.  As usual with Jared. 
                    Some sinister intrigue.

                    My motives are pure.  Well, I try 
                    anyway.  It's difficult, isn't it?     
                    To have pure motives.  Things get

                    Tell me about Jared.

                                  MURIEL 
                    I love him dearly, but I'm not 
                    surprised he is where he is.  He 
                    was a troubled child.  Charming and 
                    bright, but a bully and a liar. 
                    Something of a sadist.

                                  JANE
                    Which were qualities you rather 
                    liked in him I expect.  At first.

      Muriel is quietly impressed by the insight.

                    Yes.  I did.  I found him rather 
                    amusing.  At first.  One doesn't 
                    want a wimp for a son.  But there 
                    must be a sense of proportion and 
                      moderation.  As he got older, he 
                    got worse.  Fell in with bad 
                    people.  It was one scandal after 
                    another.  In and out of prison.    
                    A common criminal.

                                  JANE
                    But he turned himself around, 
                    didn't he?

                                  MURIEL
                    He claimed he had.  He gave up the 
                    drink and drugs and the 
                      gallivanting.  Made peace with his 
                    brother, and came home to help run 
                    the family businesses. 

                                  JANE
                    The prodigal son.

                    Yes.  George, his father, was 
                      overjoyed.  I was skeptical.  
                    Pleased of course.  But skeptical.  
                    As my mother used to say, y'are 
                    what y'are. 

                                  JANE
                    I guess she was right.

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes.  Poor George dropped dead a 
                    week after the murder.  Broke his 
                    heart, people said.  George didn't 
                    really have a heart in that sense.  
                    He died of embarrassment.  A 
                    Renfrew in the pokey for murder. 
                    Quelle horreur. 

                                  JANE 
                    What happened the night of the

                    You saw it in the news like 
                    everyone else no doubt.  Jared went 
                    on a drug binge and raped and 
                    killed Undine.

                                  JANE
                    You're sure it was him.

                                  MURIEL
                    How can I doubt it?  I wish I 
                    could.  

                                  JANE
                    Will you show me where it happened?


      Jane exits, Wesley comes after him.

      Gardner hastens after Jane, who waits for him.  Gardner takes 
        a controlled rational tack now.

                    I am asking you, man to man, as a 
                    fellow human being, don't make us 
                    relive the horror of what my

                    Were you here?  

      Gardner swings at Jane amateurishly enough for Jane to avoid 
      the blow. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I'll take that as a yes.  You 
                    always hated your brother, didn't 
                    you?     

                                    GARDNER
                    Get out of here!

      Jane raises a hand in farewell and walks away.


      Jane, walking down one of those surreal Bay area streets 
      where a vista of sea, sky and graceful bridges are the 
      gorgeous backdrop to heavy-duty urban funk.  Battered little 
      shotgun bungalows with dirt yards.  

      Jane checks the slip of paper and goes to the door of one of 
      the bungalows.  It's abandoned, padlocked and shuttered like 
      several others on the block.  A HIGH-END BUT N.D. BLACK SEDAN  
      rolls up across the street.

      Jane looks around for someone to ask.  A scruffy woman four 
      doors down peers at him warily.

                                  JANE
                    Hi.  I'm looking for Mariska 
                    Kopecki?

      The woman slinks out of sight silently.  On Jane, stymied. 


      Jane outside the old Kopecki address, at a dead-end.         
      He notices the black sedan across the street, engine idling.  
      Fancy car for this neighborhood.  After a beat, Jane walks 
      toward the sedan.  Halfway across the street, the sedan 
      drives off.  On Jane watching it go...


      Jane stymied, leaning on his car.  Nowhere to go. 

      FLASHBACK


      Jane gazing into space.  His PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

                    Your late husband was a handsome

                      Domineering though.  Had to have 
                    things his way.  He died how long 
                    after the murder?

                                  MURIEL
                    A month.  Aortic aneurysm.

                    And when did Mariska leave your 
                    employ?

      Jane sees the guilty look that flashes across her face, and 
      knows he has found the truth.  Muriel tries to be casual.

                                  MURIEL
                    Around the same time.

                    You got rid of her as soon as you 
                    could after he died.  Because

                                  JANE
                    Did you ever confront him?  Or 
                    Mariska? 

                                  MURIEL
                    No.  I decided that I liked my life 
                    as it was.  I didn't want a drama, 
                    and I didn't want to be lied to.  
                    They never knew that I suspected.

                                  JANE
                    Eighteen years of secret anger.  
                    How did you stand it?

                                  MURIEL
                    Nobody's life is perfect.

                                  JANE
                    But then when you found out about 
                    Undine's affair with Jared, you 
                    must have been enraged. It's 
                    incest, practically.

                                  MURIEL 
                    It is.  It is incest.  When I found 
                    out, I told Jared that he was not to 
                    continue the affair.  He refused.  
                    Said he was in love with her.  
                    Refused to stop seeing her.  

                                  JANE
                    Didn't you tell him why you 
                    objected?

                                  MURIEL
                    Certainly not.  I couldn't tell 
                    him.  It was too sordid.  Too 
                      humiliating.  

                                  JANE 
                    So instead you killed Undine, paid 
                    off her mother, and sent your son 
                    to jail for life.   

                                  MURIEL
                    No.  I wouldn't do that. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    49.

                                  JANE
                    But, you did.

      Muriel takes up her handbag, opens an inner compartment, and 
      comes up with a small transparent vial of something dark and 
      congealed.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Is that...?

                                  MURIEL
                    Undine's blood.  

      FLASHBACK


      Muriel hands Jane the vial.

                                  MURIEL
                    It's proof that I did it.  I took 
                    it so that I could confess and have 
                    Jared freed when I chose. Just as 
                    soon as he learned his lesson. 

                                  JANE 
                    What lesson is that?

                                  MURIEL
                      Everything in moderation.  
                    And listen to your mother.

                                  JANE
                    Can't argue with that.


      The CBI vehicle arrives at the outer gates.


      Jane, Cho and Rigsby waiting for the gates to open.  When 
      they do, Jared Renfrew emerges.  A free man.  Overjoyed to be 
      out.  Cho and Rigsby scan all around for trouble, hands on 
      their guns.

                                  JARED
                    Thank you.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    51.

      He and Jane share a somewhat awkward handshake.  Jared pulls 
      him into an embrace.

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.

                                  JANE
                          (cold)
                    I've kept my side of the bargain.  
                    Now it's your turn.  Tell what you 
                    know.

                                  JARED
                      Absolutely.  All will be revealed.  
                    But right here?  Give me a chance 
                    to breathe fresh air a while and 
                    then we'll sit and talk as long as 
                    you like.  I got a lot to tell and 
                    I owe you big time, man.  I owe you 
                    my life.  In the meantime, I would 
                    kill for a a cheeseburger and 
                    fries.    

                                  JANE
                    Fair enough.

        Rigsby hands him a bulletproof vest. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Put this on.

                                  JARED
                    You can't say please?  I'm a free 
                    man, aren't I?  

      Jane gives Rigsby a nod -- humor him.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Put this on, please.

                                  JARED
                    Sure.

      Jared straps on the bulletproof vest.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Sorry about your mother.

                                  JARED
                          (looks sorrowful)
                    Thanks. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    52.

      Jared, Jane, Cho and Rigsby get into the CBI vehicle.


      Speeding toward Sacramento...


      Rigsby at the wheel.  Jane and Jared and Cho handling burgers 
      and fries and sodas in back. 

      A STREET PROTEST halts traffic.  A mob of young unruly 
      demonstrators carrying SIGNS -- MEAT IS MURDER, SAVE THE 
      EARTH, FUR IS EVIL -- surge toward the CBI vehicle.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    The hell is this?

      Cho and Rigsby look nervous.  The protesters eddy around the 
      CBI vehicle.  Using the mob as a distraction, Jared tosses 
      his soda all over Cho.  In the momentary confusion that 
      follows, Jared JUMPS OUT OF THE VAN AND RUNS through the mob.


      Cho and Rigsby and Jane give chase -- but the streets are 
      packed and Jared quickly gets lost in the crowd.
