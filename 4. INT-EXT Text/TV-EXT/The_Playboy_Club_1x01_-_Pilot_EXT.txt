    In the distance, the flickering city lights dazzle and tease.  
    The icy waves of Lake Michigan lap closer, closer.  Like you, 
    they want in.  Somewhere, an EL TRAIN SCREECHES around a 
    bend.  A TRUMPET WHINES.  THREE GUNSHOTS go BAM BAM BAM.  

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Chicago.  1963.

    CAMERA FLIES with A SHARP GUST OF WIND toward the city.  The 
    MAN S VOICE continues... swaggering, confident.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                The steaming, corrupt, crime-filled Windy 
                City may be all of those things, but 
                there s one place in the toddling town 
                where everything is perfect.

    FLY past this door and that door.  Is it here?  There?  THREE 
    SNARE DRUM RIMSHOTS go BAM BAM BAM.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Where life is magic.

    Around corners, through alleys, heading toward it.  FLASH-CUT 
    with COCKTAILS, HIGH-HEELS, SMOKE, and the LIPS on the BLONDE 
    BOMBSHELL singing a sexy, horny cover of  CHICAGO  --  

                                BLONDE BOMBSHELL (O.S.)
                Chicago, Chicago
                That toddlin  town...

    The song gets LOUDER, CLOSER.  WHIP up a sidewalk, CATCH UP 
    to a well-heeled pair of SHOES -- A MAN S -- as they walk, 
    coming from somewhere great and going somewhere better.  
    FLASH-CUT with BUNNY EARS, TAILS, and the FISHNET CALVES of a 
    BRUNETTE carrying a CIGARETTE TRAY.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Where you can be anyone you want to be.

    His fingers light a cigarette, his last.  Throws away the 
    pack.  Steps over a subway grate.  Arrives at 163 E. Walton 
    Street.  The Gold Coast District.  Pulls a SINGLE KEY from 
    his Pierre Cardin jacket -- gold, with a certain logo -- 
    hands it to a beautifully-manicured hand that belongs to:

                                DOOR BUNNY
                Good evening, Mr. Dalton.                                                                                      2.


    THE DOOR BUNNY at the entrance to the Playboy Club.  The 
    ears.  The tail.  The satin.  The breasts.  Pretty, friendly, 
    even chews her gum perfectly.  She checks the number on the 
    back of his key, writes it on her clipboard, hands it back.

    He s NICK DALTON (35, a man, a jaw, confident, sharp, genial 
    yet private, the ultimate playboy).  He pockets his key.

                                NICK
                How are you tonight, Kate?

                                DOOR BUNNY
                I m good.  I m always good.
                        (laughs, re her costume)
                A little cold.

                                NICK
                It s worth it.

    QUICK SHOTS: Nick steps in.  Checks his coat and hat with the 
    COAT CHECK BUNNY.  Takes three steps.  Is met by a TRAY, a 
    COCKTAIL and a Bunny whose face we don t yet see.

                                BUNNY (O.S.)
                  Extra-dry, extra-cold, rocks glass, no 
                rocks, three olives.

                                NICK
                I don t know, Brenda.  My mother always 
                told me no dessert before dinner.

                                BUNNY (O.S.)
                A little chocolate never hurts.

    REVEAL Bunny BRENDA (24, stunning, dry, Black).

                                BRENDA
                Just don t tell your mother.  

    Nick smiles.  He s friendly and familiar with all of these 
    Bunnies, but he s only sleeping with one of them...

                                BRENDA (CONT D)
                  Carol-Lynne s on upstairs.

    force.  The ROOM S ATTENTION SHIFTS from Carol-Lynne on stage 
    to Maureen on the floor, and Carol-Lynne notices.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the 
                blues in Chicago...

    Carol-Lynne s POV: MORE MEN join on the floor, and new girl 
    Maureen dances with each, shining, a star. 

    Another POV: From the opposite end of the room, the entrance, 
    someone else watches Maureen.  REVEAL: Nick Dalton, who has 
    made his way up from downstairs.  He watches Maureen, 
    intrigued.  General Manager BILLY MORTON (35, all business, 
    ZBT president, young Albert Brooks) walks up, slaps him on 
    the shoulder, has become a friend over time.

                                BILLY
                Saw the afternoon Trib.  Nice work.  Who 
                knew a goy could be such a good lawyer?

                                NICK
                Is she new?

    Billy follows Nick s eyeline to Maureen on the dance floor.  
    Billy sighs, annoyed, starts toward her.

    Maureen spins and twirls on the floor until Billy gently 
    takes her elbow, pulls her off the floor.

                                BILLY
                I m glad you re having fun, Phyllis --

                                MAUREEN
                Oh, shoot, I m sorry.

                                BILLY
                Just get back to work, please?

                                MAUREEN
                Right.  Okay.                                                                                        5.


    Maureen grabs her cigarette tray, starts off.  Spins back, 
    taps Billy on the shoulder.  He turns.

                                MAUREEN (CONT D)
                It s Maureen.
                        (don t forget)
                Maureen.

    She smiles, goes.  Billy shakes his head.  Bunnies.  

                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Maureen.

    Maureen turns to see Nick, and his smile.

                                NICK
                Can t imagine how anyone would mistake 
                you for a Phyllis.  

    She smiles, blushes.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                I m Nick Dalton.  Lovely to meet you.

                                MAUREEN
                You, too, Mr. Dalton.  Can I get you --

                                NICK
                Reds.

                        (looks)
                Reds, Reds.  Shoot, I m out of Reds.  
                I ll get more from the back if you don t 
                mind waiting a few minutes.

                                NICK
                I don t mind.

    Maureen goes, smiles to herself, he s gorgeous.  Nick watches 
    her walk off, but for no more than a beat.  Steps into the 
    light of the club.  Carol-Lynne sees him, smiles.  He winks 
    back.  The ultimate Playboy, the ultimate Bunny.  Nick drifts 
    toward the stage as Carol-Lynne s number comes to a close.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
                That's my home town...!

    Crowd APPLAUDS.  Nick helps her off the stage.  They kiss.

                You look great.                                                                                      6.

                I ll look better in a few minutes.  I m

                My favorite.  With the diamonds?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                If that s what you want to call them.  
                Did you win the case?

                                NICK
                $20,000 for each of the victims.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                  Congratulations.  Where do I sign up to 
                be a victim?

                                NICK
                You couldn t be a victim if you tried.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I could be anything for real diamonds.  
                Be right back.  Grab table three.

                What do you mean?

    He s good.  Carol-Lynne walks off.


    Fifteen minutes south, the Chicago River barely moves behind 
    the stenchy Union Stock Yards.  Pitch black, empty, except 
    for the headlights of BILLY S BUICK.


    Nick, steady, and Maureen, not so steady, drag the rolled-up 
    carpet, which now holds Clyde s body, toward the water.  

                                NICK
                Almost there.

                How many bodies have you buried?

                                MAUREEN
                None.  I go to the movies every Saturday.  
                How many have you buried, mister  Don t 
                worry, I know a place ?

                                NICK
                Wait here.

    Nick starts back up the dock.

                                MAUREEN
                Wait here?!  What am I supposed to --

    Maureen catches herself screaming, looks around.  Be quiet.

    STOCK YARDS: Among heaps of old machinery, junk, Nick finds 
    an old rusty CATTLE HOOK.                                                                                    12.


    BACK TO THE DOCK: QUICK SHOTS: Nick checks Clyde s pockets, 
    pulls a WAD OF CASH, a LIGHTER and his PLAYBOY CLUB KEY.  
    Nick and Maureen tie the hook to the rug/body.  They roll 
    Clyde Hill into the water.  SPLASH.  The body sinks DOWN DOWN 
    DOWN.  Nick and Maureen stare at the water.  A silence.

                                MAUREEN (CONT D)
                For the rest of my life, I killed a man.

                                NICK
                You killed a bad man.

    Maureen looks over at Nick.  His stare is still on the water.

                                MAUREEN
                        (senses)
                You knew him well.  Didn t you?  That s 
                how you knew who he was right away. 

    Nick looks at her.  She s smart.  And beautiful enough to 
    make him stupid.

                                NICK
                Come on.  Let s get you cleaned up.

    As he leads her up the dock, Nick hands her Clyde s WAD OF 
    CASH. 

                                MAUREEN
                What?  No, I can t --

                                NICK
                It s the least he can do.


    Gleaming glass-and-metal, Nick s 50-story building overlooks 
    the shimmering Chicago River.


      Carol-Lynne walks up the sidewalk, wipes a half-tear from her 
    eye.  Her face changes, takes on a fierce determination.  She 
    won t be trodden upon.  She whistles for a TAXI.


    Small houses sit only feet apart in this leafy district on 
    the North end of the city.  A TAXI pulls up to a small house.  
    A Bunny gets out.  Not Carol-Lynne.  Alice.


    A third TAXI drops Maureen off in a residential area of the 
    Gold Coast.  She uses her key to unlock the front door at her 
    own home on North State Parkway.  REVEAL... the gargantuan 
    PLAYBOY MANSION.  A man sings from somewhere inside... 

                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                ... The best is yet to come, come the day 
                you re mine...


    It s still dark outside The Playboy Mansion, which sits on a 
    wealthy residential street one block from the lake, with 
    neighbors just like anybody else.  From inside, we hear a 
    faint scratchy record playing  GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL ...


    Nick waits while Billy s car is washed within an inch of its 
    life.  Thumbs through today s Tribune.  On Page 2, HIS 
    PICTURE next to the headline DALTON WINS HEFTY SETTLEMENT FOR 
    SEWAGE VICTIMS.  Yesterday was very good.  And very bad.


    Nick parks Billy s Buick out front.  MUSIC OUT.                                                                                    28.



    Nick steps out a side-door, runs into Carol-Lynne on her way 
    in.  Both didn t expect to see the other.  Both play it cool.

                                NICK
                Hi.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                No time to stop for a silly coat when 
                you re chasing Bunny tail.

                                NICK
                Cute.  It was nothing.  Take tonight off, 
                let s have dinner.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I m not hungry.

    She walks past him into the club.  Off Nick, staggered, 
    surprisingly stung.


      Carol-Lynne walks out, seething, jumps into a TAXI.

    Nick rounds the corner into the black, shimmering, wind-
    whipped alley behind the club.  Waits.  Paces.  His breath 
    visible in the cold night.  A DOOR SLAMS.  He turns.  It s 
    Maureen, slipping out the back door of the club, dried tears 
    on her cheeks, lighting a cigarette, walking off.

    Maureen turns, sees him.  Turns back, flustered, keeps 
    walking.  He catches up to her.

                crazy and alone anymore.  A bad thing 
                  happened.  Nobody wants me here.  That s 
                the story of my life, so don t worry, 
                I ll be fine on my own as I always --

    Nick steps in front of her, cuts her off --

                                NICK
                I want you here.

    She looks up at him.  The connection between them rages.  She 
    doesn t want to acknowledge it. 

                                MAUREEN
                  Everybody s told me I can t trust you.

                                NICK
                Do you trust everybody?

                                MAUREEN
                I don t trust anybody.  I never have.

                                NICK
                No wonder you feel crazy and alone.

    Her eyes get wet.  She sighs, mad at herself for even 
    starting to cry.                                                                                    54.


                                NICK (CONT D)
                You can trust me, Maureen.  We made a 
                deal, remember?  Comitto.

    She reacts.  He holds her gaze, won t let her look away.  Her 
    heart wants to trust him, but her walls are strong.

                                MAUREEN
                How do I know you don t just want me here 
                because I know your secret? 

                                NICK
                I didn t have to tell it to you.

    She reacts.  He steps closer.  Closer.  Goes to kiss her.  
    Their lips almost touching.  Breath visible between them.

                                MAUREEN
                        (a whisper, reminds him)
                Bunnies can t date Keyholders.

                                NICK
                        (a whisper back)
                I don t recall asking you on a date.

    She smiles.  His lips go in to kiss her when GUS S CADILLAC 
    LIMO pulls up.  Idles.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                That s my ride.

                                MAUREEN
                Where are you going?

                                NICK
                Don t worry about it.  The better 
                question is, where are you going?

    Maureen is silent.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                        (the club)
                That could be your family in there.

                                MAUREEN
                Yeah, complete with a bat-nuts mother.

                                NICK
                All mothers are.  You d be lucky to have 
                one.  I never did.

    Maureen reacts.  He was an orphan, too.  Nick turns, walks to  
    the limo.  Off Maureen, a small smile.                                                                                    55.



    A stone church at the corner of Lincoln and Kinsey. 


    A party rages inside.  Gus s limo pulls up.  Nick gets out.


    On the dark surface of the water, not far from where Nick and 
    Maureen dumped the body, something has risen to the surface. 
    PUSH IN... a HANDKERCHIEF, monogrammed... B.B.

    Across town at the Playboy Mansion, the SONG ENDS with a POW.
