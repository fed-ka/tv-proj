    Would-be STARLETS, touring MUSICIANS, a transient mix of 
    Hollywood hopefuls mingle at a pool party in the complex 
    courtyard. They are drinking, smoking weed, dancing. 

    Among the crowd, A MAN carries an unconscious YOUNG BLONDE 
    over his shoulder. Noticeable but not noteworthy.

    TIME LAPSE - NIGHT DISSOLVES TO DAY.


    The morning light reveals the tawdriness of the scene - broken 
    bottles; a few partiers sleeping it off on deck chairs. 

    Welcome to Hollywood - no glitter, no tinsel. In the glaring 
    California sun we spot a SIGN:  Oakwood Apartments. Short 
    term/Long term Furnished Suites'. 

    CAMERA DRIFTS across the courtyard to focus on an apartment.


    A 1994 Mercedes SL500 that has seen better days starts out of 
    the garage and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES as a CITY BUS suddenly 
    appears directly in front of his car, and pulls to a stop.

    On the side of the bus is a MASSIVE AD for  THE FAMILY  
    COMPLETE SERIES BOX SET DVD - Starring MICHAEL KASS.

     NOTHING is more important than The Family. 

    The IMAGE of Michael as Vince pointing a gun is aimed directly 
    at Michael. An unsettling sight.

    One of the BUS RIDERS, looks out the window at Michael and 
    recognizes him. Waves tentatively.

    Michael slinks down in his seat as the car screeches away.  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  6.



    A strip mall in the San Fernando Valley. 


    Michael comes to the front door, only to find it locked.

    He looks inside and locks eyes with HARRISON POTTER. 

    Though a bit older than the photo in Ali's office, he is still 
    an imposing figure, hard muscled and yet clearly graced with 
    an innate sweetness - like a somewhat intimidating Labrador.

    Michael bangs on the door and Harrison approaches. 

                                  HARRISON
                Hey! Michael Kass!

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah. Open the door!

                                  HARRISON
                Do you remember me? Harrison Potter? I 
                used to work with Allison in Homicide?

                                    MICHAEL
                Sure. Whatever. Open the door!

                                  HARRISON
                Yeah, in about 15 minutes, Mike.

                                    MICHAEL
                What? No. Open the door.

                                  HARRISON

                What are you, the secretary?

                                  HARRISON
                No, partner. I ve been working with 
                Allison about 3 months now. God, this 
                is amazing. I m such a big fan, Mike.

                                    MICHAEL
                You re a fan? Great, listen to me. Go 
                to your heart. I m asking you to go to 
                your heart.

                AND OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!


    Harrison s car turns onto the property where several POLICE 
    CRUISERS have already parked alongside a NEWS VAN.


    Ali and Harrison stand beside a bank of mailboxes and a tenant 
    directory. 

    LAPD and CSI are working the outside of Michael s apartment. 
    Several officers are interviewing tenants.

                                  ALI
                What are the chances we ll be greeted 
                with open arms?

                                  HARRISON
                Well, let s see - you re the ex-wife 
                of the prime suspect and I m despised 
                by at least half the LAPD. 

                                  ALI
                That s not true. You re despised by 
                more than that.

    They share a knowing smile. Harrison registers the directory 
    beside him.

                What did Michael say the victim s name 
                is?

    The door opens, still chain locked. AMANDA RUIZ (26) no doubt 
    quite pretty when you put on the paint. Right now, she looks 
    wary, wan and frail.

    Amanda reels a bit.

                We d like to ask you some questions.

    Amanda SLAMS the door closed and yells from inside.

                                  AMANDA (O.S.)
                Leave me alone.

                Well, that was some top-notch 
                  detective work right there. Ready?

    Harrison nods  yes  and they reluctantly head toward Michael s 
    apartment.


    A line of POLICE TAPE isn t all that keeps Ali and Harry from 
    crossing into the apartment. PHIL ROSEN, a squirrelish, 
    unpleasant looking Homicide Detective blocks the entrance.

    Michael hangs up.


    Establish.


    An LAPD CRUISER is parked out front. A battered PICK-UP TRUCK 
    pulls up and parks.  

    A MEXICAN GARDENER removes some tools and walks towards the 
    back yard. Only we can tell this is an unrecognizable Michael.


    Michael walks along the house glancing into windows until he 
    spots DAN BLAKE, being interviewed by 2 LAPD COPS.

    Blake(40) is a hefty man, barely hanging onto what must have 
    been real good looks just a few years ago.

    The window is slightly open. Michael moves to hear the 
    conversation inside, all the while trimming hedges without 
    paying attention.


    Blake sits, clearly shaken by the news of his wife s death.

                                  COP#1
                When was the last time you spoke with

                                  BLAKE
                I m not sure. Uh, we spoke often. At 
                least once a week. Maybe more.

    The Cop makes a note. Blake feels he needs to explain.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                We were working it out. Vanessa just 
                felt like she needed to get away...

    Blake, seemingly devastated turns to the window. He locks eyes 
    with this unknown gardener.

    Michael, caught unexpectedly, over-compensates by clipping 
    away like a madman. In his zeal, he manages to CUT HIS FINGER. 
    He moves off from the window.

    Michael continues pruning while eyeing the officers and Blake 
    in the house. As their conversation ends, Blake leads them to 
    the front door. 

    Michael tracks them, moving toward the front door to catch the 
    final snippet of conversation.

    Michael watches the Officers move off. He turns back as Blake 
    hurries to shut the door.

    Michael trails him from outside. Blake hurries past windows on 
    his way back to his office.

    Once there, Blake closes the drapes. But he is unaware of the 
    gap at the split of the curtains.

    Michael steals up to the window and works to look inside. He 
    gets only glimpses.

    Michael s POV: BLAKE AT HIS DESK. He rifles through a drawer.

    BLAKE stuffs his laptop in a bag. HE CROSSES to a closet door. 
    Has to unlock it with a key. A light goes on inside. There are 
    SOUNDS of file cabinets, papers rifling, etc.

    Blake emerges from the closet with several FILE FOLDERS and a 
    large trash bag stuffed with something. He leaves the office.

    Michael races to intercept him at the front path.

    He reaches the front path and starts randomly clipping as 
    Blake comes pounding out the door with his bundles.

    As Blake tries to hurry past, Michael surreptitiously jams his 
    clippers into the trash bag, splitting it open and spilling 
    it s contents to the ground.

    A quick glance reveals them to be INSURANCE RECORDS. 

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                God damn it. You idiot, what the hell 
                are you doing?

    Michael now adopts a thick, Mexican accent - the finishing 
    touch on his transformation to the character of  ERNESTO .

                                   ERNESTO 
                Lo siento. Lo siento. Sorry.

    Ernesto bends to help Blake gather his papers. Blake shoves 
    him back, hard.

                                  BLAKE
                Don t touch that. Who are you?

    Blake looks at the butchered hedges for the first time.

                Finish? You ve destroyed the goddamn 
                place. I should call those cops back 
                and have them lock you the hell up.

    ** As Blake fumes, he gesticulates wildly with his hands. 
    Michael, being a keen observer and mimic, notes that Blake 
    holds both his ring fingers in a peculiar way when he 
    gestures. The audience is unlikely to note it now, but they 
    will later.

                Jorge tell me... como esta. He say to

                                  BLAKE
                This is not good! Comprende? Not good!

    He gathers his fallen items.

                You get your tools and get the hell 
                off my property. You hear me? 

    Blake is moving quickly to his car, tossing the items in.

                I see you again, I m calling the

    Police have left, but the door is sealed with crime scene 
    tape. 

    AMANDA, Vanessa s roommate, stands peering through a window 
    into the apartment. She moves to the door, stands for a moment 
    with her hand on the knob, then tries to open it.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  39.

                  Tampering with evidence... that s a 
                big ole felony. I was hoping to find 
                you, Ms. Ruiz. I thought this might be 
                a better time to talk.

                                  AMANDA
                How did she die?

                                  ALI
                I was hoping you would tell me.

    Amanda moves to rush past her, but Ali grabs her arm.

                                  AMANDA
                I didn t do anything.

                                  ALI
                Then stop acting like you did. Do you 
                know something, Amanda? Did you see 
                  something?

                                  AMANDA
                I told her to go. She walked away 
                once. She just didn t stay away.

                From who? Her husband?

                                  AMANDA
                I don t have to talk to you! Leave me 
                alone!

    Amanda pulls away and runs off. Ali just stands there, she 
    knows better than to pursue at this moment.

    As Amanda disappears, Ali surveys the area. For the first 
    time, she notices several SECURITY CAMERAS around this common 
    area. The OLD ASIAN MAN from the opening scene sidles past 
    with his oxygen tank in tow.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN
                Next time you come when I call.

                I m sorry? I think you have me 
                confused with someone else.

    Ali turns to go.

                No, you cop. I see you with other 
                cops.

    This stops Ali in her tracks.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN (CONT D)
                You all come today. But nobody come 
                last night. Music too loud. Everybody 
                making too much noise. I see. I call. 
                But nobody come. You come next time.

    Ali regards this man, then the cameras. Interesting.


    Michael is awkwardly climbing through the open window.


    Michael stands outside the front door, repeatedly ringing the 
    bell and banging at the door.

                                  BLAKE (O.S.)
                I don t care who you are, I am going 
                to rip your head...

                            (dead serious)
                Off?

    Blake goes to slam the door shut but Michael kicks it back 
    inward. He pushes into the entryway and slams the door.


    Harrison looks thru the window. Amanda is hurriedly throwing 
    things into a suitcase and a duffle bag.

    Harrison moves back toward the door and knocks. From inside, a 
    voice...

                                  AMANDA
                Who is it?

                talk to you.

    Amanda opens the door, still chained.

                I told the woman, I can t talk to you.

    Harrison holds up his cell with a photo of Vanessa s corpse.

                                  HARRISON
                You wanted to know how she died. This 
                is how. Strangled to death while she 
                was unconscious. She never had a 
                chance. There s no way you did this, 
                so why are you acting like a killer?

    She starts to close the door but he blocks it.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                Amanda, the person you re running from 
                is the person I want to get. Help me.

    We can almost see the surrender in her eyes.


    An LAPD Mobile command vehicle is parked. 


    Michael reaches into his jacket pocket and removes his cell 
    phone. He had been using it to record what he hoped would be a 
      confession. He turns it off, switches the phone on and dials.  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  55.



    SEVERAL OFFICERS are making arrests and taking statements. 

    A LARGE CROWD AND REPORTERS are held back from the scene.

    Harrison nods. He begins to walk away and turns back.

                                  HARRISON
                  Michael... I hope it s okay if I keep 
                your number in my cell. I never know 
                when I might need a really crappy 
                  gardener.

    The men smile at each other - message received.

    The paparazzi are calling to Michael. 

    He walks over and the flashbulbs start blazing. Everyone is 
    calling his name, trying to get his attention. 

                                    MICHAEL
                             (to himself)
                I m back, baby.

                                                              FADE OUT.
