A horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits
on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN.
RICK
Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie
Lee? One day I'm a hot young
movie star, and the next day I'm a
hideous mutant freak, covered with
festering lesions.
Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette.
REGIS
Sounds like my wife when she misses
a mudpack!
The audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis.
KATHIE LEE
Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha-
ha!
(to Rick, she turns
EARNEST)
Ricky, once you were the all-
American boy next door, star of the
beloved Hey Dude films. Now the
very mention of your name makes
children scream in terror. We've
all read about your disturbing
story. But the people want to hear
it from you, Ricky Coogan.
(SFX: children scream)
Won't you tell us your story?
RICK
Well, it's kinda long, but okay.
It all started when I signed a deal
to be spokesman for the E.E.S.
conglomerate...
DISSOLVE TO:
The E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it,
with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen to
reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to
camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff
movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES
photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind
Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his
entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT
GUIDE.
2.
Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD
CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
expressions.
RICK
(through a clenched smile)
So, what kind of crap do you
scumbags want me to peddle?
HERTZ
Everything. Everything except
shoes, of course. Hah hah...
He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to
a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS.
HERTZ
Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.
Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles.
Flash.
HERTZ
Helmet Head hair spray.
He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash.
The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
Hertz gives it to Rick.
HERTZ
Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
fertilizer.
Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.
RICK
Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not
do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a
star, got it, Hertz?
(to his aide)
Rico, give these misguided clowns
Tony Danza's phone number, and
let's get the hell out of here.
He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.
HERTZ
Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up
to the radicals trying to keep
Noxon from the struggling farmers
whose very future depends on it.
3.
RICK
(HESITATES)
Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?
HERTZ
Only in the U.S....and Europe.
RICK
But I heard that shit's lethal.
Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick.
HERTZ
Rick, Rick, Rick... You want
proof? Fine. Just take a seat.
Please.
Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
aide, who scurries off.
HERTZ
(TO RICK)
Meet the head of our South American
research facility, Juan Valdez.
The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a
natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.
GEORGE
My name is George Ramirez.
HERTZ
Whatever. He's worked with Noxon
24 every day for five years, and
he's in fine shape. Aren't you,
Juan?
George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.
GEORGE
Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in
Santa Flan have--
RICK
Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty
name for a country is that?
GEORGE
It is named for the patron saint of
creamy desserts... As I was
saying, we've worked very closely
with Noxon...
4.
Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I personally supervised its
development...
Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
transformation, but just a little.
Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
actor.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I performed rigorous scientific
tests. No potential danger was
left uninvestigated...
Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
feigns total innocence.
George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
over his face.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
The environmentalists are
crackpots, all of them.
Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in
astonishment.
George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!
GEORGE
It's ridiculous, I tell you.
Totally ridiculous!
Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.
HERTZ
Thank you, Valdez. That will be
all.
George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
making a face.
RICK
Wait a second--
5.
HERTZ
Ricky, this is important. We're
talking about a major threat to the
EES image. How does 2 million
dollars plus expenses sound?
The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads "$2
MILLION."
RICK
Look, it sounds great, but--
HERTZ
I hear you. Make it five million--
(a new placard: 5 MILLION)
that is, if the board agrees ...
Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.
HERTZ
Good, it's unanimous. Well, what
do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's
"Man in Santa Flan?"
Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
sign.
CUT TO:
Rick stands in line at the luggage X-ray machine. He
impatiently checks his watch as the X-RAY CHECKER chats him
up. A CRAZED ANARCHIST holding a large bomb passes through
the security check unquestioned.
X-RAY CHECKER
My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude
Three: The Final Countdown." We
need more wholesome role models
like you.
RICK
Uh-huh.
(TO HIMSELF)
Where the fuck is Ernie?
6.
We hear WOMEN'S SCREAMS. They turn towards the noise and see
a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. This is ERNIE,
Rick's buddy and resident court jester.
ERNIE
Ladies! All I wanted was a
manicure! Yah-ha-ha!
(he sees Rick)
IT'S THE COOG!
RICK
IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF!
WOOF!
Rick pumps Ernie's third "hand." The miffed X-ray checker
points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the X-
ray machine.
X-RAY CHECKER
(TO RICK)
Mister Coogan, is this your bag?
RICK
Yeah, why?
X-RAY CHECKER
Is this your kid?
He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton
outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled
up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at
each other in horror.
RICK/ERNIE
Stuey Gluck!
The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive
young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
memorabilia.
STUEY
Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare
still from your high school
production of The Glass Menagerie!
Could you sign it for me?
Please?!
RICK
NO!
(TO ERNIE)
Let's get the hell out of here!
7.
Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
by 10 photo.
STUEY
Rick! Wait up!
FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit.
STUEY
Rick! Remember the speech you gave
at the Actors Forum for Social
Justice!?
He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old
speech.
RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)
If all the world is a stage, then
let us shine the spotlight on
truth, integrity, and a deep
compassion for all life.
RICK
Leave me alone, troll!
(TO ERNIE)
That was before I got an
entertainment lawyer.
ERNIE
Quick, down here.
Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway.
IN THE HALLWAY
It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.
STUEY
Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's
dangerous. Why are you lending
your name to it? What's happened
to you, Rick? You used to be
good! And now... I just don't
know...
Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty.
RICK
Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.
8.
BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody
murder.
RICK
ALRIGHT!
Rick and Ernie high five.
CUT TO:
A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
confidence.
RICK
In the bag.
The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.
CAPTAIN (V.0.)
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
captain speaking. To the right of
the aircraft, you can see a great
view of the Grand Canyon.
All the passengers crane their necks to the right.
CAPTAIN (V.0.)
And to the left you can see a panic-
stricken little troll.
Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to
reveal...
STUEY
on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's
holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something
we can't hear.
RICK
AHHHHHHH!
Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing. Rick
watches him fall into oblivion.
9.
Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other
horrified passengers.
RICK
You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie?
ERNIE
Nah, you can have 'em.
CUT TO:
Ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the
proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car. There's a Pepsi
billboard in the background. Julie massages Rick in the back
seat.
RICK
(faking terrible pain)
Ooooh, my pelvis.
JULIE
(SYMPATHETIC)
Is this better?
ERNIE'S POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages.
Ernie tries to get in on the conversation.
ERNIE
Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an
idea man myself. Like, let's say
there's a nuclear war, and the only
two people left are you and the
Pope... Would you pork him?
Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging
Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach.
ERNIE
But one thing's for sure. That
Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?
JULIE
I'll say! What a total piece of
shit. Don't you think so, Josh?
Rick grits his teeth.
RICK
(MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY)
Well, he's got a few problems.
JULIE
And what a lousy actor! I mean can
you believe that "Hey Dude" crap?
14.
RICK
Well, with a script that bad,
Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming
off as good as he did!
(CATCHES HIMSELF)
I mean, that's what I read.
JULIE
Well, he's no Christian Slater.
RICK
(EXPLODES)
SLATER!? I could act circles
around that one-note hack! He was
shittin' his diapers when I was the
toast of Broadway! I made grown
men cry! I made crippled children
laugh! Now all I ever hear is
Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL
SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR
ME?
Enraged, Rick rips the bandages off his face.
RICK
You think Slater could improv like
this? Make you believe he was an
invalid!? Huh!?
Julie stares at him in shock. Rick catches his breath,
realizes what he's just done, and smiles weakly. Ernie tries
to break the awkward silence.
ERNIE
(TO JULIE)
So, do you like Swedish films?
Julie gives him a murderous look.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE UP ON:
It's dark and spooky. Elijah stands in a pool of light,
reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages.
ELIJAH
HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family
Circus! How do they do it day
after day? It's amazing.
He turns to...
RICK, JULIE, AND.ERNIE
20.
as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein-
style operating tables. They struggle desperately against
THE STRAPS
RICK
(TO ELIJAH)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
ELIJAH
Well, I guess they do use the same
joke over and over. I'm just a
sucker for that little moffet's
shenanigans, that's all.
(he tosses the funnies
ASIDE)
But perhaps I should tell you a
little more about what I do. You
see, I not only exhibit freaks, I
make them. Just like Michelangelo
saw the angel in the stone, I look
at a guy like Kevin Costner and see
a giant peach grub who can fart the
Blue Danube!
(mops brow, asks
OFFHANDEDLY)
Am I crazy or is it hot in here?
Rick, Julie, and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well
answers his question. Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
spiel.
ELIJAH
Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine. Several
drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been
changed to "Tasty Freekz"). The biggest vat reads "NOXON
24."
JULIE
My God! He's using Noxon Twenty-
Four!
RICK
Hey! You're not supposed to have
that stuff!
ELIJAH
Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed
to have these either!
21.
He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
the "Ramada Inn" logo. Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp. He
tosses the towels.
As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the
room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced
by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a
raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the
floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and
grabs a quarter...
ELIJAH
I need only punch a few buttons on
this magnificent device, and it
gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
that will mutate a perfect young
body, bubble its skin, warp its
bones and twist its guts into AN
UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-
TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!
Elijah's hair is now standing on end. He's foaming at the
mouth. A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
monologue.
JULIE
Wait a minute. Does this mean
we're not going to see a show?
ELIJAH
(IGNORES HER)
Toad, fire up that machine, and
let's turn these hapless asswipes
into monstrosities!
RICK, JULIE, ERNIE
(TOGETHER)
AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
ELIJAH
Now let's see. Who wants to get
freaked first?
ERNIE
(points at Julie)
Ladies first!
JULIE
Go screw yourself!
ERNIE
If I were you, I would!
ELIJAH
Hmmmm.
22.
Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine. Elijah steps
past him to a jerry-rigged computer console. He punches some
keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor.
ELIJAH
(mumbling to himself)
It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...
two birds with one stone... Yeah,
it's pretty darn good, really...
He presses "enter" and the computer beeps. He smiles.
ELIJAH
Let 'er rip, Toad!
Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life.
Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes,
exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.
ERNIE
Wait a second. You're really gonna
smear that stuff on us and mutate
our body parts!?
ELIJAH
Correct.
ERNIE
Well... then could you give me a
really big rodney?
ELIJAH
I'm a mad scientist pal, not a
miracle worker.
Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their
skin begins to bubble and undulate.
JULIE/ERNIE
Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
(ETC)
A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another
on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized
dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and
melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin
continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under
THE SKIN:
Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore...
The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"...
Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which
then takes the form of...
23.
Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's
got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and
flipping everyone off.
ELIJAH
Gumby! Put that thing away!
Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into...
JULIE/ERNIE
joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which
is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah
wheels a large mirror in front of them.
ELIJAH
Feast your eyes!
JULIE
NOOOOO!
ERNIE
Well, at least I'll never have to
go far for a piece of tail.
JULIE
Pig!
She SMACKS him.
ERNIE
Ouch! I was just trying to keep
things light. Oh God! Why me!?
He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards
the door.
JULIE
Mother always said there'd be days
like this. And I thought she was
nuts!
They exit. Elijah turns to Rick.
ELIJAH
(gestures to Julie/Ernie)
A mere party trick. But you,
you're gonna be special.
Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching
keys.
RICK
(GETS TOUGH)
Let me go, Skuggs, or else!
(MORE)
24.
I got some RICK(cont'd)
friends that'll come
down here and mess you up bad,
homey!
(Elijah chuckles. Rick
tries a different
APPROACH)
I got some other friends who can
score you box seats at the
Superbowl, no problem.
(ANOTHER FAILURE)
YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF,
YOU FUCKIN' APE?!
(switches gears again)
You ever had a hot fudge bath with
Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna]
ELIJAH
(LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)
You know her?
Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then
frowns.
ELIJAH
Ah, screw it. I'd never get
anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP
THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!
Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and
dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it
towards Rick, leering maniacally.
ELIJAH
For years I've strived to create
the ultimate monster. The first of
a whole new generation of
superfreaks! Now I've finally got
you, the perfect subject--a real
asshole! HA-HA-
(he pauses and looks
closer at Rick)
Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy
from "Hey Dude Three-The
Beguiling?"
RICK
Yeah, that's me!
ELIJAH
You were great in that picture! Oh
well, I guess for the next one
they'll have to get Christian
Slater! HA-HA-HA!
25.
Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face.
CUT TO:
Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the
room frantically. Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand--
straining at the bonds.
RICK's POV groggily searches the lab, and picks up the
blurred image of Elijah in the distance. He's on the phone,
speaking in hushed tones.
ELIJAH
This is Red Swan. May I speak to
the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll
hold.
For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune
of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the
other end of the line. It laughs throughout the
"conversation".
ELIJAH
Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done
it! I found the perfect subject--
huge ego, shallow personality,
almost no moral values... A
lawyer? No, better. An actor.
Yeah, the guy from those hilarious
"Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--
Laughing man has stopped laughing. Elijah dummies up.
26.
ELIJAH
(SHEEPISHLY)
Well, I liked 'em.
Laughing man resumes laughing. Elijah listens intently.
ELIJAH (CONT'D)
Right... Yes... Yes, I see...
But that's just it. He's not
quite, uh, finished. I need more
Noxon so I can--
Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone
away.
ELIJAH
(ASIDE)
Geez, what a grouch.
Over on the slab, Rick groans. He's waking up. Elijah
notices.
ELIJAH
(to Laughing man)
Laughing Man? I have to go. What
about the Noxon? Two days? Great,
you can see everything then...
Yeah, you take it easy too.
Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick.
ELIJAH
Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and
greet the new you.
RICK
Huh?
He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror.
Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous,
bug-eyed monster!
RICK
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
CUT TO:
Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and
thirty feet high. Rick looks around.
RICK
(IMPRESSED)
Great use of the space.
ELIJAH
I learned it all from Bob Vila.
BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah.
BOB
You know you could expose those
rustic beams and put in a skylight
over one weekend, Elijah.
ELIJAH
Give it a rest, Bob!
He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye
wink and walks out the door.
It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim
light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with
dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like
prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way
forward.
RICK
Ernie? Julie?
ERNIE
Over here, Coog.
JULIE
Are you alright?
Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away.
RICK
I know that voice. That's the
voice that said,
(MIMICS)
"Cool, a freak show. Let's check
it out!"
JULIE
What!? Oh sure, blame the woman.
Typical.
RICK
(MIMICS)
"It's so real." Is this real
enough for you? I'm friggin'
Quasimodo!
ERNIE
Chill out, Coog. You're talking to
the original tag team of ugly
pukes. Step into the light.
RICK
Okay, here I come.
29.
Rick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are
caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure.
Ernie's repulsed.
ERNIE
ULP!
Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on.
JULIE
Oh geez... It's not so (GULP)
revolting. After all, physical
beauty is just a socially-enforced
myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
Julie turns away and pukes on the floor.
RICK
(OFFENDED)
Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas
yourself. You're lucky I've got a
strong stomach!
VOICE (O.C.)
And you're lucky I don't BITE you!
Heh heh heh heh ...
Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind
him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears,
and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude.
Rick assumes a threatening pose.
RICK
Get away from me you, you...
JUAN
Freak? Ha ha hahahaha!
(he stares hard at Rick)
I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of
the freaks.
JULIE
(walks up to them)
Kind of the "top dog."
Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg.
JUAN
Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?
He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a
slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and
turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House.
30.
RICK
No thanks. I don't plan on staying
long. How many of you are there in
here anyway?
Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Rick's
face.
JUAN
First, I have a question for you,
Ricardo. Who starred in the film
"International Velvet?"
RICK
Huh?
JUAN
Well, perhaps we should ask the
Worm!
The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the WORM. He is a
man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a
worm. His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small
goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.
JUAN
Tell us, Worm, who starred in
"International Velvet?"
He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second.
THE WORM
Yes, yes ... very interesting...
International Velvet... The
perfectly appalling sequel to
National Velvet, I believe. No
dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.
JUAN
Yes, Worm. But who was the star?
The worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe...
WORM
Olivia DeHavilland.
JUAN
Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you
agree or disagree?
RICK
This is nuts. This is crazy...
Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.
31.
JUAN
Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill,
now married to tennis star John
McEnroe. Circle gets the square.
The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles, silhouetting
9 freaks in a full size HOLLYWOOD SQUARES 3 x 3 layout. The
FREAKS applaud Rick's success. He's incredulous.
OTHER FREAKS
Yayyy!
Worm nudges an "0" into place in his cubicle, with some
difficulty. He's not happy about being proved wrong.
WORM
Blast. O'Neill ... No talent
ragamuffin...
JUAN
okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's
it going to be?
As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is
highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily.
JUAN (CONT'D)
Nosey the Nose Man!
NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head. He
blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick.
JUAN (CONTD)
Cowboy!
COWBOY is a young boy with cow-like features, a cowboy hat,
cowboy clothes, and a full set of udders.
JUAN (CONT-D)
The Bearded Lady!
The BEARDED LADY is a big, tough, bearded man--in a blouse.
He has lipstick, earrings, and tattoos on his muscular arms.
BEARDED LADY
(gruff and masculine)
How ya' doin.
JUAN
Sockhead!
SOCKHEAD is a freak with a large button-eyed sock puppet for
a head. He's munching cookies which ,spill uselessly out of
his throatless sock mouth...
32.
JUAN
The Human Torch!
The HUMAN TORCH is a man engulfed in flames. He waves
apathetically.
JUAN
Rosie the Pinhead!
ROSIE is a pinhead in dark sunglasses. She has a great bod
jammed into a sexy dress. She smokes a cigarette demurely,
and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave.
JUAN
The hideous Frog Man!
Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit. He strikes a
threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.
JUAN
And of course, in the center
square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
with plenty of dark shadows. There's a horrific MUSIC STING
and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
cubicle. Its eyeball drips out of the socket.
JUAN
Well JulieErnie, who will it be?
ERNIE
Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go
with Paul Lynde.
JULIE
Don't be an idiot.
They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3
Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick.
JUAN
You see, Rick? Just because we're
freaks doesn't mean we can't have
some fun, huh?
Rick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away.
RICK
Get away from me. Get away! I'm
not like you. You hear me? I'm
Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!
33.
The Freaks laugh in Rick's face. He storms off.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER
Rick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a
shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak
House. JulieErnie approach him.
ERNIE
Okay Coog, so I get twenty four
hour access to T `n' A, and you
look like a plate of rancid
giblets. We're still pals, right?
Rick shoots him a look.
JULIE
All the freaks have gone through
this anguish, Rick. At first, I
was blinded by my anger. I admit
it. I wanted to break your neck
for getting me into this. But I
got over it. Juan taught me to
channel my anger for the common
good.
RICK
It was your fault, anyway. You
wanted to see the freak show.
JULIE
(FURIOUS)
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
She tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at
Ernie.
RICK
Ernie!
ERNIE
Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second
there, I was a total man-hater.
Weird.
Julie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles
something on it, and hands it to Rick.
JULIE
Here. Take it.
Rick examines the cover. He reads it aloud.
34.
RICK
"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--
Now What?"
There's an "8" scribbled on the pamphlet.
JULIE
we're in cubicle eight. Maybe
later you'll be ready to talk.
RICK
Forget it. Not me. I'm not like
those other god-forsaken animals.
He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm,
Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a
circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
WORM
You're mistaken, Rick. You are
exactly like us. We were all
normal healthy folk before we made
the fateful mistake of visiting
this hell hole at an off hour.
Why, when I first came here...
WAVY FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO:
Sockhead shrugs apologetically.
SOCKHEAD
Sorry. I'm not much for stories.
The camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY.
BEARDED LADY
When I arrived here, I was nothing
like I am now.
FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO:
He finishes his story.
BEARDED LADY/MAN
Now I know who I am. I can say,
"Hey world. This is me. I'm a
woman. And I like me."
The others look at the bearded man uneasily. The camera pans
past the Bearded Lady, and moves in on an ordinary HAMMER
lying on the ground.
FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO:
Happy music. The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly
STOCKBOY. The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans
the shelf. He makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles.
He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag.
Darkness.
Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically. Rick turns
away to wipe a tear from his eye.
WORM
You are one of us now, Rick.
Whether you admit it or not. It's
irrefutable.
RICK
Yeah. Says you.
The worm shakes his head. The freaks turn and head back to
their cubicles. Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she
and Ernie turn and head off.
37.
Rick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer.
TIME DISSOLVE
TO:
Hours later, Rick is still staring at the hammer. He picks
it up and stares at it more closely.
TIME DISSOLVE
TO:
Hours later. Rick is still staring at the damn hammer. He
nods with resolve.
RICK
(TO HAMMER)
You're right.
He spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it
off. He opens it and begins to read, under the heading "1.
It's Fun Being Ugly!"...
Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie
scribbled, and nods with a sense of purpose. Standing up, he
throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks
towards the cubicles.
CUT TO:
Rick walks past the cubicles. In one, the Bearded Lady knits
a sweater... He reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak
when he hears Julie giggling. There is a man's voice, but
not Ernie's. It's Juan.
Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He
licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie
is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of
this.
Rick watches, disgusted. He tears up the pamphlet, throws it
to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle.
Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay.
Juan stops abruptly.
JUAN
Hey. Mind your business.
ERNIE
Sorry.
38.
Ernie returns to his book. The camera PANS up to Rick's
cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a
log with his knife-like talon. He talks to himself, making
sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear.
RICK
Well that EES guy should rescue me
any minute. Then it's straight to
the plastic surgeon and back to
sunny old L.A. I wonder how many
of my beautiful, anatomically
correct girlfriends will be waiting
for me.
STUEY GLUCK (V.O.)
I'll be waiting for you, Rick!
RICK
Thanks, Stuey.
Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck
floating in the air above him.
RICK
AHH! A phantom troll!
He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps
darting around, dodging the blows. Cowboy leans around the
cubicle wall. He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle.
COWBOY
(NEIGHBORLY)
Seeing phantom trolls, Rick?
RICK
(INNOCENTLY)
No.
Rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and
ignores Stuey, who hovers around him.
COWBOY
Sounds to me like you've developed
a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer
nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey,
why he can smell the future. Lots
of us freaks got E.S.P. And
Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N.
He points at Sockhead, who's watching pro wrestling on a
portable TV.
SOCKHEAD
Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try
the skull cracker!
39.
COWBOY
Shucks, Rick, you're lucky.
Telepathy like yours only occurs
between real soulmates. A bond
like that should be cherished.
Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle.
STUEY
Wow! I'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate!
RICK
In your dreams! Now get lost,
troll!
He swings wildly at the hologram, which starts to break up
and fade away.
STUEY
(FADING AWAY)
Wait'll I tell the kids at school!
Stuey disappears. Cowboy leans into Rick's cubicle again.
COWBOY
Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense
to spurn your soulmate. I reckon
that troll could help you if you
just let him into your heart.
Rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again.
CUT TO:
It's a cramped room filled with Ricky Coogan memorabilia.
Stuey is drawing a crude sketch of Rick on a pad. This
sequence is set to brassy "man on a mission" music.
STUEY
Once America sees what happened to
Ricky, they'll probably send the
whole FBI down to save him!
CUT TO:
Stuey marches towards a frosted glass door that reads "THE
LOS ANGELES TIMES".
40.
STUEY
I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize
for this scoop. And I'll dedicate
it to Rick!
He walks through the door. Beat. SMASH! He comes flying
out through the glass and lands on his butt.
THE "TIME MAGAZINE" DOOR--SMASH! Stuey flies out through it.
THE "U.S.A. TODAY" DOOR--SMASH! Stuey flies out through it.
THE "WEEKLY WORLD NEWS" DOOR--We see Stuey and an EDITOR
silhouetted against the glass.
EDITOR (V.0.)
Of course I'll print it! America
needs to know! Burt! Give mister
Gluck his fee and show him out.
STUEY (V.0.)
That's okay. I know the way.
SMASH! Stuey dives through the glass door.
CUT TO:
The Goons hold Stuey in between them.'He's terrified. we
hear the low, menacing chuckle of the Laughing Man, who's off
screen. The camera is his POV.
LAUGHING MAN
Heh heh heh heh hehh heh.
41.
STUEY
Sure I wrote the article. But--
LAUGHING MAN
Ha-ha-ha!
STUEY
No. You've got it all wrong. I
don't know anything about that.
You gotta believe me.
LAUGHING MAN
Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa!
THE LIMO
cruises off down the street. We hear a POWER DRILL, Stuey's
SCREAMS, and Laughing Man's hearty CACKLE from inside.
CUT TO:
Rick has whittled his log down to a toothpick. He admires
it, then leans over and fits it into an intricate three-foot
scale model of the Eiffel Tower, made entirely out of
toothpicks. The Human Torch walks by.
HUMAN TORCH
Wow, what a great model!
(he points at a toothpick)
But look, this one's crooked.
He reaches out to fix it and--WOOF! The whole model burns to
a cinder. Rick looks at him hatefully.
HUMAN TORCH
(STUPIDLY)
Sorry.
Elijah steps into the freakhouse.
ELIJAH
Alright, freaks! Get ready for the
glamour! Get ready for the glitz!
Get ready to be pelted with rotten
vegetables, 'cause it's showtime!
CUT TO:
42.
Rick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches
JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly
playing a game of "Wheel of Fortune." The cubicles contain
large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. So
far, there's a "D", two "S"s, and a "K" revealed. Rosie the
Pinhead plays Vanna White's role.
NOSEY
I'd like to buy a vowel.
The Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them.
RICK
Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.
JUAN
So. Now you don't mind mixing with
us--how did you say it--sorry
mutants?
RICK
Look! I'm sorry for what happened
at the show. Can't you just forget
it?
He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a
human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,
embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the
silence.
ERNIE
Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about
your big escape plan?
Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look. He growls at him.
ERNIE
Well, excuse me for living.
RICK
You have an escape plan?
JUAN
Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a
simple diversion.
(MORE)
51.
JUAN(CONT'D)
Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks
cry out for freedom!
Aooooooorrraaaagh!
Juan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're
a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it.
FREAKS
Aoo...
Beat.
JULIE
Juan's plan is really ingenious
Rick. See, he figured out that--
JUAN
I figured out that our escape does
not include the Beast Boy. No one
may discuss the plan with him,
understand?
Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble
agreement.
RICK
What's the matter with all of you?
You trust your lives to a guy just
'cause he can lick his own
privates?
The freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes".
ERNIE
You gotta admit, Coog, it's a
helluva trick.
RICK
(RESENTFUL)
Fine! I'll just come up with an
escape plan of my own then.
JUAN
Haha! I have spent a year studying
this hellhole, devising the perfect
escape. You think you'll just
tango right out the door!? Ha!
Just try it, amigo.
RICK
I will!
Rick turns to go. JulieErnie rush over and try to reason
with him quietly.
52.
JULIE
Rick, wait.
ERNIE
Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked.
Believe me, it ain't all it's
cracked up to be.
JULIE
This isn't one of your dumb movies,
Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a
smart dog. I'll talk to him.
Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't
do it without us.
RICK
Forget it! I don't need you, EES,
or anybody else! I'll get out of
here all by myself, you... you.,.
crud sucking pus monkeys!
DING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board
light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking
Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite
themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.
Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes
deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is
watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her
attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg
instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.
ERNIE
I'm getting a bad feeling here.
CUT TO:
Out of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door
and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside.
RICK
Damn.
He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN
getting out of his truck in the driveway.
RICK
(TO MILKMAN)
Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!
53.
OUTSIDE
The milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious.
MILKMAN
Yeah... ?
RICK (V.0.)
Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a
pal, and give me a hand will ya?
MILKMAN
Oooh no! I know you freaks.
You'll try anything just to get
someone to open that door. Well
not me! Ha!
He's about to walk away.
RICK
Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk
the world's biggest breasted woman
all by myself. Sorry to bother
you.
The milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back
door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into
his "act."
RICK
(in a lusty womanish
VOICE)
Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now!
Milk me hard!
(Normal Rick voice)
I've only got two hands, all right?
Geez. I don't care if Elijah did
give you skim milk on the right
side, chocolate on the left, and
eggnog in the middle.
The milkman is salivating at the door.
MILKMAN
(TO HIMSELF)
Gee, I love eggnog!
The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside. Beat.
MILKMAN
Hey, what the--
BONK. We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his
soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit
complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.
54.
He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling
casually. He notices something. It's ...
THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD
Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter
plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing
"YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI") Rick gets to the truck
and tries the door. It's locked.
RICK
Shit.
He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring
at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and
looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked
too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.
Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and
runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked
too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something
else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning
against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.
RICK
Damn! This guy doesn't trust
anybody!
He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only
empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE
behind him, spins around and faces ...
TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS
with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and
aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at
Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big
spliff.
RICK
AHHHH!
A T.V. MONITOR in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us,
the Eye's POV.
ELIJAH
seen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor.
He speaks into a microphone. We don't see what the room
looks like.
ELIJAH
Good work, Eye and Eye.
55.
THE EYES
bob in response to Elijah. They have no mouths, but their
pupils open and close when they speak.
EYE AND EYE
(JAMAICAN ACCENTS)
Rastafari.
ELIJAH (V.0.)
(over the walkie-talkie)
Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh,
den. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking
house.
It's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of
magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review"
and "Freaks Illustrated". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger,
smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a
tray of soft drinks.
ELIJAH
(TO RICK)
Diet soda?
RICK
No thanks.
Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside
Rick.
ELIJAH
Fiddle Faddle?
(Rick shakes his head)
You sure?
RICK
Well, okay.
(he scoops some into his
MOUTH)
Well, are you gonna torture me or
kill me or something?
ELIJAH
Torture my greatest creation ever!?
Kill the final piece of the puzzle
that I've been putting together for
years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but
I've got a bigger plan, my boy.
(MORE)
56.
ELIJAH(CONT'D)
And when you ripped off that guy's
head, I knew it was working like
gangbusters!
RICK
But I thought I scared everyone
away.
ELIJAH
Uh-huh. And then they told two
friends, and they told two friends,
and so on, and so on. Look at
this.
Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on
the table. Elijah opens one and reads it.
ELIJAH
(READING)
Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked
and disgusted when my grandson told
me about the head-popping beast at
your show. Please send me six
tickets.
(he reads another)
Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New
Kids on The Block, but you're way
cuter. My favorite ice cream is
chocolate. Is it fun ripping
people's heads off? I love you.
(ANOTHER LETTER)
The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting
spree, and Oscar is along for the
ride!
(he looks up at Rick)
That one's from Pat Collins!
RICK
Yeah, but she loves everything.
Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty.
Toad BURPS.
ELIJAH
Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for
guests only! You've had enough!
Toad is blankfaced. Elijah walks over and refills the bowl.
Rick scoops some into his mouth. Elijah walks to the
fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker.
RICK
Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in
show business all my life. The
public does not want to see
disgusting, depraved violent filth.
57.
ELIJAH
Oh, and I suppose Jake and the
Fatman is just a fluke?
The phone rings. Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick.
ELIJAH (CONT'D)
I'll get it.
He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver.
ELIJAH
`Yello?
On the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane
chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to-
Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice.
Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone.
ELIJAH
Yes... Right... Tomorrow...
Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay.
You got it... Hasta la vista to
you too. Hahaahahaahaha--
Laughing Man hangs up on Elijah. He looks a little pissed-
off as he turns to face Rick again. Grumbling, he takes the
poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily.
ELIJAH
Okay, Coogan. I'm finished with
you for now.
Ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before Elijah spins
to face him.
ELIJAH (CONT'D)
But listen. I may not be "Mr.
Tinseltown", but I damn well know
what I like. You're gonna be a
hideous killing machine, and that's
final! Tomorrow night I'll finish
the job onstage! And then, to
demonstrate your horrible power,
you'll slaughter all the old
obsolete freaks in cold bl--HEY!
Elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and ZAP! He
catches Toad's ten foot tongue--curled around the searing
poker inches from the Fiddle Faddle.
TOAD
AAAGGGGHH!
58.
ELIJAH
I told you enough!
CUT TO:
We're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely
corporate looking hallway.
INSIDE THE ROOM
We're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair.
We hear his CACKLE, as well as STUEY GLUCK'S TORTURED SCREAMS
and a horrible POWER TOOL NOISE. We can see the usual bright
interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra GOONS watching
the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden
by Laughing Man's chair.
STUEY (O.S.)
AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW!
We move past Mr. Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down
on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his
butt. Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons.
61.
BOB
Notice the way I use an elliptical
motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks.
(the Goons nod
ATTENTIVELY)
It's all here in my new book:
Pipes, Fixtures, and Torturing
TROLLS--
LAUGHING MAN(O.S.)
(Loud, sharp laugh)
A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA!
Bob obediently shuts up. Laughing Man directs a sinister low
chuckle to Stuey.
STUEY
No way. I'll never talk! I'm made
of stone!
Bob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer.
STUEY
HELP! RICK! RIIIIIIIIIICCKKK!
CUT TO:
We hear LONESOME HARMONICA MUSIC as we pan past the cubicles.
Cowboy is playing the harmonica... The Bearded Lady unties
the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside...
Suddenly, we switch to HORRIFIC PSYCHO STINGS as the camera
picks up PAUL LYNDE'S CORPSE with flashing red lights. His
eyeball drips out of the socket again...
Then it's back to the SAD HARMONICA MUSIC. In the next
cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling
a large eclair. She looks longingly up towards Rick's
cubicle as we...
DREAM DISSOLVE
TO:
DREAMLAND
Rick (his face is normal) and Julie kiss passionately in a
billowy white bed amidst puffy clouds.
62.
RICK
(SINCERE)
Julie, compared to this, sex with
Julia Roberts was a thankless
chore.
QUICK DISSOLVE
BACK TO:
JULIE'
We follow her gaze, panning up to Rick. He's lying on his
bed, dreamily fondling a donut. He looks down towards
Julie's cabin...
DREAM DISSOLVE
TO:
DREAMLAND
Rick and Julie kiss passionately. We're tight on them.
JULIE
Oh Rick, you've touched a place in
me no one has ever touched before.
ERNIE(O.S.)
I'll say! Almost punctured a
kidney!
WIDEN to show Ernie, still attached to Julie, leering at
Rick. Rick is mortified.
QUICK DREAM
DISSOLVE TO:
Rick sits in his cubicle, visibly sickened by his daydream.
Stuey's echoey voice drifts in.
STUEY(V.0.)
Rick! Riiiicccck!
A holographic image of Stuey lying on the torture table
appears over Rick. We can see the jackhammer looming over
Stuey's face. Rick looks alarmed.
STUEY HOLOGRAM
Rick! Do something! It's up to
you, Rick! Pleeeeeeease!
LAUGHING MAN (O.S)
Aha-hee-hee-ho-ho-har-har-har!
63.
RICK
The Laughing Man!
Rick watches the hologram break up and disappear. Wheels
spinning in his head, he takes the crumpled piece of paper
out of his pocket and reads it.
RICK
(under his breath)
Holy shit!
JULIE/ERNIE'S CUBICLE
Julie and Ernie are struggling over a bottle of deodorant.
ERNIE
It says it's strong enough for a
man!
JULIE
But it's made for a woman!
She grabs it away and shoves it in Ernie's mouth. Rick walks
in.
JULIE
Hey Rick. What's up?
RICK
Read this. I grabbed it from
Skuggs' office.
He hands her the notepaper. She reads it, with some
difficulty. Ernie is still gagging on deodorant.
JULIE
"Tape Donahue... Renew
Subscription to Beaver World..."
Eeuw!
She gives Rick a disgusted look. Ernie mumbles with the
deodorant in his mouth.
ERNIE
(interested, muffled)
Beaver World!?
Julie smacks him--he swallows the deodorant.
RICK
(TO JULIE)
After that.
64.
JULIE
"Prepare demonstration for Laughing
Man, receive five thousand barrels
of Noxon." Five thousand barrels!?
RICK
Elijah's up to something big, and
we have to stop him.
Ernie BELCHES. Rick sniffs the air.
RICK
Mmmm. Jasmine.
SWISH PAN TO:
Rick takes a deep breath, and begins his presentation to the
freaks assembled before him.
RICK
Alright guys, listen up--
Sockhead suddenly freaks out.
SOCKHEAD
We're done for! We're done for! I
don't want to die! It's the end of
the world! The apocalypse! Aahh!
He stops. Everyone is staring at him.
RICK
I haven't said anything yet.
SOCKHEAD
Sorry. I'm not much for timing.
He takes his seat again.
RICK
(TO EVERYONE)
Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll
be turned into a homicidal monster
and forced to kill you all. But we
might have a chance if we act fast.
And I'm prepared to be your new
leader.
A THRILLING CHORD.
65.
NOSEY
(TO SOCKHEAD)
I say we kill him.
Sockhead nods.
RICK
And I've got a plan.
ANOTHER THRILLING CHORD.
NOSEY
I still say we kill him.
Sockhead nods again.
RICK
If we can get into Elijah's lab,
maybe we can--
WORM
Of course! Design a super freak of
our own and manipulate the genetic
code to make him destroy Elijah
instead of us! Brilliant!
RICK
Oh. Well--
BEARDED LADY
But how do we get to the lab?
RICK
Um, maybe--
COWBOY
Right! The worm could dig a
tunnel!
WORM
By God, it's so crazy it might just
work!
ERNIE
But you need Noxon 24 to make the
freaking sludge, and Elijah told us
himself he's run out of it.
RICK
Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I
was going to say was--
66.
JULIE
Yes! Exactly! If they've been
using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer
here, the entire ecosystem must be
soaked with it! All we need is a
way to extract it from the
vegetation, ideally into a liquid
form.
RICK
Right. Well, what about--
COWBOY
Golly! So that's why my milk comes
out that funny green color! I
thought the grass tasted funny!
Wow, Rick, you're a genius!
JULIE
(SMILES WARMLY)
Good thinking, Rick.
The freaks all nod in agreement.
NOSEY
Way to go, Rick! How did you ever
think of such a plan?
Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea
Monkeys.
RICK
Well, actually, I was going to
suggest we send away for sea
monkeys, train them to fire guns,
and make a break for it. But if
you want to go with this other
thing, I guess that's okay.
The freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not.
CUT TO:
FREAKS ON A MISSION MONTAGE, SET TO A POUNDING "EYE OF THE
TIGER"-TYPE SONG
-Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel
which feeds into a crude still. The Torch heats the boiler.
-The Worm digs the tunnel. JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of
wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports. They hand
him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well.
67.
-Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat. Nosey
wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in
a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot... The other freaks
follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who
struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler.
Everything's going great and the song is really pumping
when...
ELIJAH
runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams
down at the outhouse.
ELIJAH
WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN
RACKET!?
IN THE FREAK HOUSE
Nosey turns off a boom box and the music cuts short. The
freaks exchange tense looks. Nosey calls out apologetically
to Elijah.
NOSEY
SOR-RY.
(to the freaks)
What a jerk!
The Worm burrows along, leaving a tunnel wide enough for Rick
and JulieErnie to crawl after him. Rick notices a ray of
light coming through a rock formation.
RICK
Hey, look at this!
They all stop and look. Rick fingers the hole, and the rocks
cave in, revealing
A VAST UNDERGROUND CITY
It's obviously a matte painting.
WORM
Good Lord! It's the Lost City of
Nodd!
JULIE
Wow!
68.
KER-CHUNK! We hear the sound of a slide projector switching
slides and the underground city is replaced by a still image
of some tourists standing around a geyser. [foriegn version:
the Blarney Stone].
RICK
It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take:
"It's the Blarney Stone!"]
They "Ooh" and "Ahh". The image switches to a snapshot of a
FAT MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
ERNIE
It's my Aunt Gladys!
The other freaks nod politely. The image switches to a BAR
MITZVAH PHOTO.
ERNIE
And that's me at my bar mitzvah!
RICK
C'mon Ernie, let's go.
ERNIE
Wait, you gotta see the ones from
sleep-away camp! They're
hilarious!
Julie smacks him.
JULIE
Stooge!
Nosey looks at the nearly full container of distilled Noxon.
NOSEY
Almost there.
(he sniffs the air)
But wait, I'm getting a whiff of
things to come!
69.
BEARDED LADY
What do you smell?
NOSEY
(GRIM)
Blood.
Bearded Lady looks grave..Nosey sniffs again.
NOSEY
(CHEERFUL)
And hot buttered popcorn!
BEARDED LADY
Awwright!
They're burrowing along. Ernie loudly clears his throat.
Julie spits out a loogie. She grimaces.
JULIE
I hate when you do that.
We hear muffled BARKING.
ERNIE
Hey! Do you hear that?
JULIE
It's a dog!
RICK
(TO WORM)
Hurry!
The Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several
exposed sewer pipes. A lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and
drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick. He starts licking
Rick's face.
RICK
Scrappy!
SAPPY MUSIC wells up.
RICK
It's been ten years since you
chased this ball into the sewer! I
thought you were gone for good!
SCRAPPY
Yap!
70.
RICK
Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help.
Understand?
SCRAPPY
Yap!
RICK
Good boy! Now go!
Scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe. Rick shrugs.
RICK
You never know.
Julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling.
JULIE
Look, a wood floor.
WORM
It must be the lab! we've done it!
They all look at each other excitedly. Suddenly Elijah's
voice rings out behind them.
ELIJAH'S VOICE
Not so fast, you scabrous freaks!
They spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon
24. He grins.
NOSEY
Didn't know I did impressions, did
ya?
The freaks are waiting around the hole. Nosey pops out.
NOSEY
Mission accomplished. They've got
the Noxon, and they'll be in the
lab within minutes.
FROGMAN
Boy, this is going like clockwork!
Everyone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc. Except
Sockhead, who finally snaps.
SOCKHEAD
No! Can't you see we're digging
our own graves!?
(MORE)
71.
It's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd)
that's what it is!
Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a
deathwish, but you can count me
out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF
HERE!
He runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs
around screaming. The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye
step in to check out the noise. One of them has a spliff
sticking out of its pupil. Sockhead charges at them like a
mad dog. They aim their Uzis.
SOCKHEAD
(at the Eyes)
OUT OF MY WAY!
RATTA-RATTA-RATTA! They spray an ungodly amount of bullets
into Sockhead. He falls to the ground. The Eyes leave.
The freaks gather around Sockhead. Nosey pulls the sock off
his hand head, which is making a little "Senor Pepe" face
with its fist. It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to
speak.
SOCKHEAD
(WEAK)
I... I... just... wanna...say...
NOSEY
What is it, kid?
SOCKHEAD
Ah, forget it. I'm not much for
dying.
He goes limp.
CUT TO:
JulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the
hole. It's really dark in the lab.
ERNIE
Shit. I can't see a damn thing.
RICK
Keep your voice down, Ernie.
ERNIE
Don't push me, Coog. I got a real
short fuse today. I'm cranky,
bloated, got a wicked case of
cramps. Don't ask why.
72.
JULIE
(whispers to Rick)
PMS...
RICK
(has to think about this)
Oh.... Right.
Rick pats Ernie on the shoulder reassuringly. He moves over
to Elijah's computer terminal.
RICK
(CONT'D)
Well, here it is--the control panel
for Elijah's Freaking process.
WORM
Good work, my boy. Now step aside.
This is scientist's work.
Worm muscles Rick out of the way and sits at the console.
Using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches
and punches a fast series of computer keys.
The light on top of the Tasty Freekz machine starts to
revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of GOOEY
LIGHT BROWN GLOP oozes out of the spigot.
ERNIE
Hey! It's working!
RICK
You did it, Worm! Way to go!
JULIE
But how? You didn't even use the
Noxon.
The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the
spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it!
Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and
smacks his lips in delight.
WORM
Ah! You don't need Noxon to make
Butterscotch pudding. I just
wanted to test the machine's
capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So
creamy! Yum!
The Worm is lost in his pudding-induced reverie. They ignore
him. Julie turns to Rick.
73.
JULIE
Hang on, Rick. Do you really think
we should put this toxic glop on
you? What if it doesn't work?
What if something goes wrong? What
IF--
ERNIE
If it does work, do you think
there'll be enough left over to
give me a monster size rodney?
Julie goes to doink Ernie in the eyes, but he uses the
classic "Three Stooges" handblock.
RICK
(TO ERNIE)
Here, hold this.
Rick hands the container of Noxon to Ernie. Julie gives him
the eyepoke. Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back
the Noxon.
RICK
(TO ERNIE)
Thanks.
(to Julie, heroically)
Look, I've been a freak all my
life.' I realize that now. Up
there on that screen, humiliating
myself for every fool with six
bucks in his pocket--
ERNIE
Seven bucks.
JULIE
Sometimes seven fifty.
RICK
Alright. It doesn't matter.
ERNIE
Sure it does. They don't let you
into the theater if you don't pay
the price of the ticket.
RICK
Look, I'm talking about the
ultimate human sacrifice.
JULIE
No kidding. When you consider
money for parking, popcorn,
drinks...
74.
The worm chimes in, still gorging himself on pudding...
WORM
Don't forget a sitter for the
children!
Rick's had enough.
RICK
Hey! In case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to commit a noble and
selfless act here.
Rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying. It
smashes through the window, setting off a loud SIREN.
Elijah's in his robe, watching the opening of "Crooked Cops"
on TV. On screen is a revolving police beacon on a beat-up
car, with a loud SIREN. Elijah munches his popcorn happily.
Julie manages to silence the alarm by yanking the cord out of
its socket. She shoots Rick a hard look, he shrugs
innocently.
RICK
Oops.
(BEAT)
Okay. Let's do what we came to do,
and this time, no more screw ups.
Rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one
of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony.
Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running
across a battlefield with a bayonet, SCREAMING. He doesn't
hear Rick.
Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream.
He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand,
grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The
coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a
styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground.
75.
The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns
blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works.
Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around
towards the window.
ELIJAH
Styrofoam cup?
He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and
heads out the door.
Julie is pouring the distilled Noxon into the top of the
Tasty Freekz machine.
WORM
Don't you think we should make some
more pudding first, as a test?
RICK
No. Here goes.
He presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz
machine starts humming. Ernie is looking out the window.
ERNIE
Somebody's comin'! Hurry.
RICK
We have to wait. There's no way to
speed up the machine.
Rick's starting to sweat. He looks over at Julie, who holds
an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot. A drop of
ointment drips out and into the container.
JULIE
Here it comes.
THE LAB DOORKNOB
begins to turn slowly.
76.
Everybody freezes. The flow of ooze slows to a stop.
RICK
It's plugged up!
They look over at the doorknob--it's still turning.
ERNIE
(TO WORM)
If it's your damn pudding, I'll
ring your wormy neck.
WORM
(under his breath)
Preposterous... I have no neck.
I'm a worm, imbecile.
THE DOOR KNOB
is still turning, agonizingly slowly...
OUTSIDE THE LAB
Elijah is trying to turn the knob,, His grip keeps slipping
because of the butter on his fingers.
ELIJAH
Aaargh! Damn buttered popcorn!
IN THE LAB
The spigot has started to discharge more,reliably. The Pepsi
cup is filling up now.
OUTSIDE
Elijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails. He tries
the door knob again.
IN THE LAB
We hear a low rumbling and the floor starts to shake.
WORM
The tunnel walls are about to
collapse!
RICK
You go ahead. I'll catch up.
JULIE
BUT--
RICK
Go!
77.
The door knob is turning more vigorously, but still not
opening. Julie and Ernie get in the hole with Worm, while
Rick attends to the almost-full Pepsi cup of sludge.
OUTSIDE
Elijah is still having trouble with his grip.
IN THE LAB
Rick pops the plastic lid onto the Pepsi cup, and climbs into
the hole. He rests the cup on the floor and lifts the floor
board over his head. The RUMBLING gets louder as the tunnel
walls start to crumble.
JULIE
Rick! Come on!
Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him.
He sways, and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling. He
watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to
a stop across the room. For a second, he contemplates making
a dash.
OUTSIDE
Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and
finally has a good grip. He twists the knob...
INSIDE
Rick sees the door opening. He dives down into the hole.
The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in.
Elijah scans the room. He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz
machine and finds the styrofoam cup.
ELIJAH
Bad for the environment.
He crumples it in his hand.
The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel. We hear the
rumble approach. The worm, JulieErnie, and finally Rick
scramble out of the opening. The dirt avalanche is stopped
short by Paul Lynde's corpse, just as Rick scrambles to
safety.
WORM
Just made it!
RICK
Paul saved our lives!
NOSEY
Way to go, Paul!
Nosey claps Paul on what's left of his back--his skeleton
shatters and the tunnel collapses, burying him instantly.
The freaks are horrified.
NOSEY
turns to them guiltily in SLOW-MOTION. His voice is slowed
down and distorted like John Lennon at the end of "Strawberry
FIELDS":
NOSEY
I... buried... Paul.
Back to normal speed.
RICK
This is no time to lament over a
cadaver! We've got to get moving,
or we're history! Now c'mon!
Nosey is still morose. He speaks backwards and sounds a lot
like "Revolution #9".
NOSEY
Daed si luap.
SUBTITLE: "Paul is dead."
RICK
I said enough! Okay, listen up,
everybody. We cracked the code and
made the ointment we need to bring
Skuggs down for good.
The freaks applaud and cheer.
79.
RICK
But we left it in the lab.
The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables. He
desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket.
RICK
But wait! I found some macaroons!
And there's plenty for all of us!
The freaks burst into applause again.
FREAKS
Yaayyy!
TIME DISSOLVE
TO:
The Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on
their faces. There's a lot of snoring. Rick awakens with a
start. He hears something in the distance. Something like a
helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall.
Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his
audience. Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security
men and various executives. Workmen are busy installing the
old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system.
ELIJAH
Nice to see you in the flesh,
Laughing Man.
HERTZ
No need to use codenames, Elijah.
We're all friends here. And just
to prove it, I brought you a little
present.
Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy, who
produces a wriggling canvas sack. He dumps its contents onto
the lab table--it's Stuey Gluck! His glasses come tumbling
out after him. He squints at the security guy.
STUEY
Rick? Is that you?
ELIJAH
Who's the troll?
HERTZ
He was asking questions about
Coogan, causing trouble. We
figured he was one of yours.
Stuey puts on his glasses. Elijah looks him up and down.
ELIJAH
I make freaks alright, but come on,
fellas--this thing's pathetic.
82.
STUEY
Well you're no Julio Iglesias
yourself, mister.
(CALLS OUT)
Rick! Riiiick! Riii--
Rick hears Stuey's voice in his head, all echoey.
STUEY(V.0.)
--iiiiiick!
RICK
Oh no, not now, Stuey!
The ghostly image of STUEY gradually takes shape in front of
Rick. Rick can make out the lab table Stuey's on, and some
shadowy figures in the background.
RICK
(TO HIMSELF)
Hey. That's Elijah's lab!
(TO STUEY)
Stuey! Are you really in the lab?
Stuey is still wailing, and everybody else is getting pretty
damn annoyed.
STUEY
Yes! I'm in the lab! I'm in the
lab!
ELIJAH
Not only ugly, he's crazy too.
Toad grabs Stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth.
He throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far
wall. A two-headed chicken starts to peck at him.
HERTZ
So, where were we?
ELIJAH
Gentlemen, I'm not going to
bullshit you. I know my setup here
at Freakland looks like small
potatoes.
83.
He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland,
about ten inches high. It shows the stage, lab, outhouse,
the head, everything.
ELIJAH
But thanks to your Noxon and my
genius, tonight I will turn Ricky
Coogan into a freak so hideous,
it'll be enough to turn your
stomach inside out, boil your brain
in its own juice, and cause cold
sores you thought had healed up to
start buggin' you again.
(the EES men shift
UNCOMFORTABLY)
It's the dawning of a new age for
us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak
World!
He whisks the cover off another scale model--it's exactly the
same as the little model except it's a lot bigger.
ELIJAH (CONT'D)
It's really somethin', huh?
HERTZ
(FEIGNS APPROVAL)
Very impressive.
ELIJAH
We'll kick Disney's dead ass!
Rick is watching all of this in a ghostly image.
RICK
Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?
Stuey's image, still with his mouth taped shut and the
chicken pecking at him, nods yes.
STUEY
Mmm hmmm!
RICK
I want you to try and escape. Get
the cup from underneath the
instrument table and bring it to
me, okay?
STUEY
(NODS)
Mmmm mmmmm!
84.
He gives Rick the old trademark Coogan thumbs up. Rick
halfheartedly returns the gesture.
RICK
Yeah, right. Get movin'.
Stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him. They're
not. He removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the
lock. Stuey searches the floor, and spots the Pepsi cup.
He'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach
it.
HERTZ
At EES, our plans for your Gene
Machine include everything, except
shoes that is. Ha-ha-ha.
ELIJAH
Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your
plans.
HERTZ
We'd love to show you.
(to his assistant)
Bill, if you'd be so kind.
BILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive,
strides confidently up to the podium.
Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over
him, not even noticing he's there.
Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a
little hurt.
BILL
What does today's businessman want?
How about a receptionist with six
arms, five mouths, and a knockout
figure? That'd sure speed things
up, wouldn't it?
With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-
limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different
phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once.
Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,
who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe
there's a few things we don't know about him.
85.
BILL
In the factory, how 'bout a worker
with twelve busy hands, no mouth to
talk back, and no genitalia or
digestive system to distract him
from his work?
(HE CHUCKLES)
Sure! It's what we all dream of!
The EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who
exchange worried looks. Elijah's still not sure what to make
of it all.
Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and
he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes
up against the back of Elijah's legs.
Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again.
Elijah looks away quickly, panicky.
BILL (CONT'D)
Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon
technology, it's not only possible,
it's just the beginning! Of
course, what happened to our
expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan
was an unfortunate coincidence, but
profits from these new markets
could total in the billions.
All the executives turn to Hertz. He cracks a smile.
HERTZ
Ricky who?
The executives laugh heartily. Stuey glances across the room
to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does.
ELIJAH
Hey! Hold on!
Stuey freezes. He's right out in the open, in plain view.
Still, nobody seems to see him. They're still watching-
Bill's presentation.
ELIJAH
Secretaries? Worker drones?
Where's the fun? Where's the
spark? Where's the unspeakable
evil?
Bill laughs pleasantly.
BILL
Ha-ha. I was just getting to that.
86.
Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than
even the best infomercials. Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards
the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible.
BILL
We'll impact every field.
COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT
creams, nosejobs in a bottle.
Military--human death machines that
make Schwarzenegger look like a
pansy! And why stop at consumer
products? Hell, we can design a
whole new consumer! A few well
placed drops in the water supply,
and bingo! It's a new master race,
and we own the copyright! An
entire planet of freaks owned and
operated by us! Every part of
their bodies comes from an EES
supplier, every thought they think
is EES policy! From now on
gentlemen, it's EES uber alles!
EES uber alles!
The EES guys clap and shout approval. Elijah's impressed
too. He leans over to Hertz.
ELIJAH
This guy's good.
HERTZ
We lured him away from A.T.&T.;
Stuey is finally out the door. Of course, now they spot him.
SECURITY GUY
Look! The troll!
HERTZ
After him!
Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab.
87.
RICK
Take the tape off your mouth,
idiot! They didn't tie your hands!
Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his
mouth.
STUEY
I got the cup, Rick!
RICK
Great! There's no time to waste.
Are you being followed?
STUEY
Yeah. But if I don't move, they
won't see me.
Two big EES security guys are standing watching Stuey's odd
behavior. They pick him up and carry him away.
STUEY
Riiiick!
Rick sees this all in his holographic image. It fades.
RICK
What a geek.
He turns to the other freaks, who've woken up and are
gathered around on the floor. Rick shakes his head.
RICK
Stuey got caught. There's no way
to get the ointment before the
show.
WORM
So, that's it then? We're all to
die... And by your hand no less.
RICK
No. It won't be me. It's some
inhuman monster Elijah used me to
create. As for me, the real me,
I'll always be your friend. Before
I have to rip your heads off, I'd
like to say goodbye to each of you.
(He turns to Worm.)
Worm... I'll miss your brains, the
smell of your pipe, and the funny
way you always go on talking until
everyone wants to strangle you.
He pats the Worm on the head tenderly, and turns to Cowboy.
88.
COWBOY
Hi, Rick.
RICK
Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor,
your down-home wisdom, and of
course, the frothy milkshakes were
udderly delicious, heh-heh...
He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboy's udder. He turns to the
Bearded Lady.
RICK
Bearded... Lady... I dunno.
We'll always have Paris...
Bearded lady is kind of confused, Rick shrugs.
RICK
Nosey, I never really liked you.
He moves on to Frog Man.
RICK
Frog Man, I think death is probably
the best thing for you now.
Frog Man nods in agreement. Rick rpaches JulieErnie.
RICK
Ernie... Julie... I have mixed
feelings.
(He turns to Ernie)
On one hand, I'll remember you as
the best friend a jerk like me ever
had, and a low down repulsive
slimeball.
He turns to Julie. ROMANTIC MUSIC swells up.
RICK (CONT'D)
On the other hand, I really respect
you, and more than that, I, uh,
well, I wish we'd had the chance to
boink.
JULIE
Oh, Rick...
They embrace. Rick calls out to the assembled group.
RICK
Today I make the proudest boast a
man can utter: "Ich bien ein
Freak!"
89.
They're all ready to cheer, but they're confused by his bad
German. Rick has to explain himself.
RICK
Uh, I'm a freak.
Oh. They all get it. Beat. Then they cheer.
CUT TO:
Elijah calls out to Toad.
ELIJAH
TOAD!
Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly.
THE TENT ROOF
Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye
across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the
neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck
on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed
caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into...
THE ELECTRIC FENCE
ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets,
and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's
mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever!
ELIJAH
looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment".
ELIJAH
Looks like it's time to roll out
the big gun.
(TO RICK)
Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?
Rick considers it. He can't think of anything.
RICK
Nahh.
92.
ELIJAH
Suit yourself.
He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a
last word.
RICK
Wait! Wait!
(Elijah pauses. Rick
RECONSIDERS)
Nahh.
Elijah glops Rick. His skin starts to smoke.
RICK
AHHHHRRRGGG!
Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage. Rick is smoking and
shaking violently on the table.
HERTZ
turns to his EES cronies in the audience. He looks bored.
HERTZ
What a waste of twelve bucks.
Let's get the machine and go.
The other executives nod.
RICK
starts to transform. FWOOP! His ears spring out into huge
monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio. FWAAP! His mouth
grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth.
FWEEP! His upper head does the same.
His body follows suit. He bursts' out of the straps and
grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER. He snarls
at Stuey Monster.
RICK MONSTER
TIME TO DIE, TROLL!
The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense. Stuey Monster
instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a
pen.
STUEY MONSTER
Rick! Rick! Could you sign
this!?
Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face.
Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back.
93.
THE CROWD
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Even Julie is screaming "Fight! Fight," beside herself with
bloodthirsty glee. Ernie smacks her.
The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche
pro-wrestling moves. Stuey bashes Rick. Rick bashes Stuey,
etc.
ELIJAH
Give him the skull cracker, ya big
goon!
ERNIE
No way! The skull cracker is an
illegal move!
Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage.
The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming
at their mouths.
ELIJAH
Let's get this over with. Hey
Hertz, tell your goons to
(he turns to Hertz and is
STUNNED)
What the hell-!?
HERTZ
stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using
forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit.
He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT.
ASSISTANT
(TO ELIJAH)
Ahem. At this point in time we at
EES regret that we must leave this
performance prematurely.
ELIJAH
What are you saying!?
HERTZ
What we're saying is... get
stuffed, yokel.
ELIJAH
I figured I couldn't trust you
corporate greaseballs!
Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK
GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He
breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside.
94.
A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises
out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group.
ELIJAH
Let me proudly introduce the latest
in our product line, Noxon 25--now
available in a convenient pump!
HERTZ
Bullshit! The Everything Except
Shoes corporation releases no new
products unless I give the order!
ELIJAH
I think it's time EES branched out
a little.
He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of
yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their
bodies melt together into one big mutating blob.
Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head
bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show.
ALISTAIR COOKE
Ahhh! Head for the hills before he
gets all of us!
The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor
Cooke like a roach.
RICK MONSTER
flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him.
Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and
stalks the freak cage murderously.
RICK MONSTER
NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!
JIMIE
No! We're your friends!
RICK MONSTER
Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining
energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from
slaughtering the freaks.
Meanwhile, Elijah is watching as
THE EES BLOB
95.
solidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's
got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the
tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile.
Elijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan
IMPRESSION:
ELIJAH
Now that's a really, really big
shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think
I'd like a pair of those!
He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks
and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey,
blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises
the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through
his chest.
ELIJAH
(to Rick monster)
Would you hurry up and waste the
troll, please!? I got a lonely
shoe over here!
Rick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we...
CUT TO:
Rick's silhouette (which matches his ten foot monster
incarnation) is immersed in the story.
RICK
And then...
KATHIE LEE
Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've
been talking for almost ninety
minutes, and we've just got to go
to a commercial.
RICK
Sorry.
REGIS
We'll be right back after this,
folks.
CUT TO:
96.
PRODUCT SHOT
A fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping
block.
TOUGH VOICED ANNCR
You like cheese. You like being a
man. That's why you like..
A BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams
down an aluminum can labeled "MACHEESMO."
TOUGH VOICED ANNCR
Macheesemo. Real cheese for real
men. Now in a handy aluminum
dispenser.
The hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out
the top.
CUT TO:
We hear a music bite from "Le Freak."
KATHIE LEE
And now back to the exciting
conclusion of Ricky Coogan's
incredible story.
RICK
Well, let's see, the other freaks
were lined up in Elijah's sights,
and I was about to shove a pipe
through Stuey's skull, when all of
a sudden, I heard a voice...
DISSOLVE TO:
Rick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes
meet.
ELIJAH
Kill him! Kill him!
Elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice
reverberates in Rick's head.
97.
COWBOY (V.O.)
I reckon that troll could help you
if you just let him into your
heart... your heart... your
heart...
The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's
eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to
him from the cage.
COWBOY
Your heart... your heart... your
heart...
Rick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a
warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up.
They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly.
ERNIE
Atta' boy Coog!
(NUDGES WORM)
Hey, ain't that somethin'?
The Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his
tears.
WORM
Tosh. (Sniff) Sentimental claptrap
(Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!
He can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby.
Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad.
ELIJAH
Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and
start mutilating each other!
He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The
Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the
tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to
face Elijah.
RICK
Raarrrrrrgh!
Elijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow
Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK
TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the
tent.
The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly.
Elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off
against Rick Monster.
98.
Meanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from
the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance.
Elijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances
slowly.
ELIJAH
You think I made you strong? HA!
I've cranked my DNA up so high, you
won't know what hit you. I'm a
wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!
He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid
section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one
heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold.
ELIJAH
(WEAKLY)
Ow! I think you crushed my spinal
cord. I can't feel anything in my
fingers.
RICK
Maybe you'll feel this ...
Rick rears back to kick him.
ELIJAH
Qait--if you kill me, you'll never
find the antidote.
The freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical.
RICK
What antidote?
ELIJAH
A time release serum--I baked it
into a delicious batch of
macaroons.
A slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's.
RICK
If you ask me, you skimped on the
coconut!
THWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him
flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye
target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of
bravado, Elijah makes a last stand.
99.
ELIJAH
Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You
haven't got the guts to kill me!
Go on! I dare ya'!
Rick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then...
SCRAPPY
Yap! Yap!
RICK
Scrappy!
Scrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the
bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture.
ELIJAH
AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!
Elijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in
the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the
gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good.
Scrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face.
SCRAPPY
Yap!
RICK
Atta boy, Scrap!
BLAM! BLAM! The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen FBI
AGENTS rush in with guns drawn.
FBI CHIEF
Freeze, FBI!
Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat
floating on top of the bubbling ooze.
ANOTHER FBI GUY
Looks like they took care of
Skuggs, chief.
The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick
and the rest of the jubilant freaks.
CHIEF
Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a
medal from the Vice President for
this.
RICK
Great. But how did you--
100.
CHIEF
We've been following Skuggs for
years. Scrappy just filled in some
of the details.
SCRAPPY
Yap!
FBI CHIEF
Thank heavens you brought him to
justice, Rick. God only knows how
far his sick plans would've gone.
ANOTHER FBI GUY
Hey chief, look at this!
The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine,
revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is
sickened to the core.
FBI CHIEF
Is nothing sacred?
Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream.
They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see.
FBI CHIEF
Oh, my Lord!
RICK
No! It can't be!
We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of
the dunk tank. The blob separates into two distinct entities
with their backs to us. They turn around and...my God
it's... it's....
REGIS AND KATHIE LEE!
Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. Call
him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red
demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice.
ELIJUS
Thought you killed me, huh?
ELLY LEE
What the hell are you looking at?
FBI CHIEF
Two pieces of deadmeat!
101.
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The FBI guys open fire. We show only
the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on.
CUT TO:
Rick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette.
RICKY
And that's my story.
KATHIE LEE
(YAWN)
It was so exciting!
REGIS
And long! My God! It makes War
and Peace sound like a warm up act!
CREW GUY(O.S.)
Okay! We got light!
REGIS
It's fixed? Well, it's about time!
The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
behind him.
RICKY
That's better.
REGIS
I'll say.
(TO AUDIENCE)
How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it
for Ricky Coogan!
The audience applauds and hoots wildly.
KATHIE LEE
Can we bring out the other freaks
now?
The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".
102.
WORM
Ridiculous... Just because a man
doesn't like macaroons...
Nonsense.
Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
pounces and catches the furry little bugger.
JUAN
Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!
ALL THE EX-FREAKS
(happy to see him)
JUAN!
JUAN
Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!
They all hug.
REGIS
That's just great. What a story.
And what an ending! Elijah
transformed by the goop!
KATHIE LEE
And he really looked like--?
RICK
Exactly like you two, I swear.
Same faces, same outfits, except
they had these really big, hideous
feet...
He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.
ELIJUS
Show's over, Ricky!
ELLY LEE
I'm gonna drink your blood!
Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
Rick's throat when...
BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
They embrace.
JULIE
Rick! It's finally over!
103.
RICK
Yes... Yes it is.
STUEY(O.C.)
Rick! Rick!
Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
dripping blood.
RICK
Stuey!
STUEY
Look! I found the real Regis and
Kathie Lee!
Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles.
STUEY (CONT'D)
No, this is just my lunch!
Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
leaking bag and holds it up.
STUEY
(matter of fact)
This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh."
AUDIENCE
Awwww!
Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
Julie when...
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
and they fall dead--again.
Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.
ERNIE
Oh, like that wasn't totally
predictable.
JULIE
Well, now it really is over.
Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up.
RICK
Thank God. You know, this
adventure has taught me something.
(MORE)
104.
RICK(CONT'D)
When man starts impinging on the
subtle perfection of the earth's
natural order, the only thing he'll
create is havoc.
ERNIE
Right, Coog. I learned somethin'
too. That men and women truly are
equals. That the human spirit
transcends gender and physical
appearance, and thus it is immune
to the petty degradations men may
devise. I believe it was Moliere
WHO SAID--
Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw.
JULIE
Oh, shut up.
(She turns to Rick)
Let's go fuck.
Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience.
RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER
Good night, everybody!
The audience cheers. The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
album kicks in as we...
ROLL CREDITS
As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
charging everyone five bucks per blow.
As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
morning show hosts.
THE END?!
