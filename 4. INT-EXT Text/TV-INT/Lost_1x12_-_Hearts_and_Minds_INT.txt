      Boone KNOCKS on the door of a modest and funky rental.  There  *
      is even a rental sign in the window.

      The door swings open to reveal a guy named BRYAN, Australian, 
      around 40, handsome, but with a dangerous edge.  He gives 
      Boone the once over.

                                  BRYAN
                    Yeah?

                                  BOONE
                    I m looking for Shannon...

                                  BRYAN
                    And you are?

                                  BOONE
                    Her brother.

      Bryan doesn t get any friendlier.  But he does swing the door 
      open.  Boone steps inside.  And then Shannon appears from the 
      other room getting ready to go out.

                                    SHANNON
                    Boone...?

      Shannon seems totally surprised to see him.  It s weird.  No 
      hugs.  No greetings.  Just a startled stare.

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon?  What s going on...?

                                    SHANNON
                    What do you mean?

      It s like she forgot that she ever called him.

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    What are you doing here?

      Boone isn t sure what to make of his sister s cautious, not 
      too friendly behavior.

                                  BOONE
                    Fifteen hours.  I was on a plane 
                    for fifteen hours.   Good to see

                    you ,  happy you re here .  How 
                    about something like that?

                      SHANNONBOONE
      I m just surprised --
                                                  You re surprised?  How are 
                                                  you -- You told me to --

      Shannon looks from Boone, to Bryan -- who stays fucking 
      inscrutable -- then back to Boone.

                                  SHANNON
                    Listen, this isn t the best time.  
                    Bryan and I, we re on our way out 
                    to meet some friends, and we re *
                    already like forty-five minutes 
                    late...

      It s clear from Shannon s eyes that something is wrong, and 
      her eyes plead this is neither the time nor the place to 
      address it, not with Bryan standing here in front of them.

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    Why don t you call me tomorrow?

      She brushes her hair away to REVEAL a slight BRUISE on her 
      forehead.  Her hair falls back over it.

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    Please.

      OFF BOONE -- realizing that something is rotten here, but he 
      is not going to be able to save his sister just yet.

                                  BOONE
                    ... kay.
                          (beat... then:)
                    Enjoy your dinner.


                                  MALCOLM*
                    Sorry, Mr. Carlyle... but I m *
                    afraid I can t help you.*

    A Bullpen.  Typical Saturday night crowd -- drunk-and-
      disorderlies.  Boone is GETTING ANGRY at an Australian POLICE 
      DETECTIVE named MALCOLM, 30s, who regards Boone with curious 
        detachment.*

                                  BOONE
                    What do you mean, you can t help 
                    me?!

                      MALCOLMBOONE
      Unfortunately, sir, we need a 
      little more to go on.--I don t understand!  I m 
                                                    reporting a crime here.

      Malcolm hovers, like all the best bureaucrats, right on the 
      edge of being patronizing.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                          (deep breath, centering)
                    Look, this is a cycle with her.  My 
                    sister is attracted to the wrong 
                    kind of guy.

      Right then -- the doors to the bullpen CRASH OPEN and in come 
      four UNIFORMED COPS wrestling with a drunken and fighting, 
      belligerent AMERICAN.

      And since this is a cop station we might not think much of it 
      -- until we notice that the DRUNK IS SAWYER!

                                  SAWYER
                    It was his bottle -- I just gave it 
                    back to  im!

      Yes, Sawyer.  Sauced and STRUGGLING and YELLING.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Yo, Croc Hunter -- how come nobody 
                    wants to hear my side of the 
                    story?!

      Of course Boone doesn t know Sawyer yet so it means nothing 
      to him.  But we wonder, holy shit!  What does this weird 
      coincidence mean?  Why is Sawyer here?  Why is he under 
      arrest by the Sydney P.D.?  But those, my friends, are 
      questions to be answered in another episode.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     24.

      Sawyer is rushed right on through and out another set of 
      doors -- into the HOLDING CELL AREA.

                                  MALCOLM
                    Now if that was her mate, see then 
                    I could help you.
                          (off Boone s exasperation)
                    All right, let me finish taking 
                    down your information.
                          (writing)
                    You were saying she s your 
                    sister... Then why is her name 
                      Rutherford and yours Carlyle, is 
                    she married?

      Boone is getting progressively more and more annoyed.

                                  BOONE
                    She was...
                          (holy shit!)
                    ...but she s not married anymore -- 
                    and that has nothing to do with 
                    this.

      And that s true because Shannon s former marriage is a STORY 
      for a different episode of LOST.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                      Rutherford was her dad s name.   
                    Our parents got married when I was 
                    ten and she was eight.

                                    MALCOLM
                    So she s your step sister.

                                  BOONE
                    That s right.*
                          (trying to drop names)*
                    Maybe you ve heard of my mother,  *
                    Sabrina Carlyle?*
                          (no)*
                    She s got the largest wedding *
                    business in the US -- and I m *
                    C.O.O. of the wedding clothing *
                      subsidiary.*

      In other words, pal, I m not a schmuck.  But Malcolm is not  *
      impressed.*

                                  MALCOLM
                    Would you like to buy my wife s 
                    wedding dress?  Cost two thousand 
                    dollars new and was only worn once.

      Boone looks over at him.

                                  BOONE
                    I just want somebody to pay this 
                    guy a visit, that s all.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of 
                    physical evidence or a direct 
                    complaint from --

      Malcolm looks at his papers --

                                  BOONE
                      --Shannon--

                                    MALCOLM
                      --Shannon-- we can t just go 
                    barging into people s apartments.  
                    Sadly, we re the police but not the 
                    dating police.

      And Off Boone s frustration...


      They huddle together.  Boone doing whatever he can to obscure 
      himself and his sister from view.

      And now the MONSTER is RIGHT THERE.

      Shannon looks very vulnerable.  Boone calms her -- fingers to 
      her lips.  JUST AS the massive shadow of the beast passes 
      over them, cuts the shafts of light coming down into the 
      jungle.

      Is it past them?

      They get their answer.  No -- because -- SLAM!!  SLAM!!!   
      The tree BUCKS.  The Monster ROARS -- and is SLAMMING ITSELF 
      AGAINST THE FUCKING TREE!! 


      Shannon lets Boone inside.  He enters quickly, pissed, having 
      had enough -- she seems genuinely startled --

                                                                    BOONE
                      SHANNON
    I thought you were coming -- d you have any bags?  Are 
      later--you taking anything--?

                                    SHANNON
                    -- you should come back --

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon.  We re getting out of this 
                    country: are you taking anything 
                    with you?

      But Shannon seems awkward -- as if something s not going 
      according to plan -- and doesn t quite know how to react.  
      And Boone stares at her, trying to figure this out.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    -- what the hell s going on?

                                  SHANNON
                    You were supposed to come later.

                                  BOONE
                    I m not gonna sit in my hotel room 
                    all day, let s do this, let s go.

      Just then, a SOUND -- Boone looks up -- and BRYAN enters -- 
      either from outside or a distant door or a staircase -- the 
      important thing is that he was far enough away not to have 
      heard any of the preceding.

      Suddenly Boone and Shannon are especially awkward.  Bryan, 
      however, seems calm and confident.

                                  BRYAN
                    Oh... look at this.

                          (firm, quiet, to Shannon)
                    Let s go.

      But she doesn t move.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    ...it s okay.  We can go.

      But there s another odd, motionless silence.  Boone moves to 
      Shannon -- takes her by the arm to usher her out -- but she 
      resists -- and he stops, looking at her, puzzled -- then:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (BLUE)        11/5/04         32.A

                                  BRYAN*
                    Hey, mate, you don t get this yet?  
                    What s what?

      Boone stops -- no, he doesn t... Boone looks at Shannon for a 
      long, long beat.  She tries to remain firm -- but her look










































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     33.

      has such a trace of guilt that it begins to dawn on Boone 
      (though it takes a while) just what the hell s happening 
      here: Shannon and Bryan are in on this together.

      Boone stares in silence.  It s a horrible betrayal.  Shannon 
      knew he would do whatever it took to rescue her.  Shannon 
      played him for the money.

                                  BOONE
                    This whole thing...?  This was a 
                      set-up...?

                                  BRYAN
                    Don t get all bent, brother.  She s 
                    just getting what she s owed.

      Boone turns to Bryan -- a volcano about to explode -- Boone 
      is still in shock, really -- but where the fuck does this guy 
      get off?

                                  BOONE
                    -- what d you say?!

                                  BRYAN
                    She told me your mum cut her off 
                    after her daddy died.  Kept all of 
                    her father s money for herself.  *
                    Screwed over Shannon and used it to *
                    start her business.  Sweet mum you  *
                    got there.
                          (then)
                    I reckon this is just fair 
                      recompense.  Wouldn t you agree? *

      But Boone just looks at Shannon -- suddenly replaying past 
      events in his mind -- a fucking tumble of now-revised 
      memories:

                                  BOONE
                    -- this isn t the first time, is 
                    it?  You ve done this to me before, 
                    you little bitch--

      Bryan puts his hands on Boone --

                                  BRYAN
                    That s enough.

      Boone makes his gamest effort to shove Bryan aside --

                                  BOONE
                    -- don t touch me, you lowlife 
                    piece of--



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"    (GOLDENROD)     12/9/04         34.

      BAM!  Bryan s PUNCHED BOONE -- and does it again and then 
      again and it s swift and brutal.  Bryan knows a thing or two 
      about fighting and Boone is getting the shit kicked out of 
      him.  Boone doesn t even get a swing in.

                                    SHANNON
                    Stop it!  BRYAN!  GET OFF HIM!!!

      Boone falls to the floor -- but Bryan s on bar-fight 
      autopilot now -- Shannon throws herself on Bryan -- SCREAMING 
      and PULLING --

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    STOP!

      -- Shannon finally pulls Bryan off him.

      And all that s left is an ugly silence as the three catch 
      their breath and look at each other.

      The thoroughly beaten Boone picks himself up -- looks at his 
      sister -- wipes his bloody lip --

      -- and leaves.

      OFF Shannon -- trading looks with Bryan -- then looking at 
      the closing door with remorse for what she has done.


      CLOSE ON the dirty faces of Boone and Shannon peering out, 
      listening intently to the now ordinary JUNGLE SOUNDS.  Not 
      wanting to MOVE A MUSCLE until they are fucking sure that the 
      monster is gone.

                                  SHANNON
                          (barely a whisper)
                    Can we please get out of here?

                                  BOONE
                          (peers out, beat, quietly)
                    ...I think so...

      Shannon gives a look out herself as Boone slowly works his 
    way out of the tree.  She follows him.

                                    SHANNON
                    What did you do to him?

                                  BOONE
                    What did I do to who?

                                  SHANNON*
                    Locke.  What did you do to that *
                    psycho to piss him off?*

      And Boone KNOWS why.  But --*

                                  BOONE*
                    I didn t do anything.

                                  SHANNON
                    Oh -- so he did it because he was *
                    bored?  Why us?  Why me?  I know  *
                    you and him are --*

                                  BOONE
                          (enough)*
                    Let s just get back to camp.

      Boone looks around trying to figure out which way to go.

                                    SHANNON
                    Uh, scoutmaster?  The path s over *
                    here.

                                  BOONE
                    What path?!  There is no path.

      And so he goes after her to see what she s talking about -- *

      CLOSE ON SHANNON S face -- as she stops dead in her tracks --  *
      SEEING SOMETHING scary -- but we don t know what it is yet.

                                    SHANNON
                    Oh my God...

      Boone approaches alongside her.  His mouth drops open as he 
      sees it.  CRANE UP BEHIND THEM to finally REVEAL --

    A HUGE SWATH OF FLATTENED JUNGLE.

      The path of destruction left behind by the monster.

      And it s a very scary sight.  OFF the two of them.*


      MICHAEL unzips his bag -- looks inside -- and as he does --

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    Found your bag?  That s pretty 
                      awesome...

      REVEAL Hurley -- miserably munching on a papaya.  He s still 
      in pain from the urchin.  He watches Michael life something 
      up from his bag.

      It s a WOOD BOX.  And it brings back melancholy memories for 
      Michael (more to come on this next week.)  Michael looks over 
      at -- WALT playing with Vincent a few meters away.

      Then, he puts the BOX back in the bag --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    ...must be nice using your own 
                      toothbrush again.

                                  MICHAEL
                    You got some papaya there?

                                  HURLEY
                    Yeah.  Yippee.

                                  MICHAEL
                    Mind if I --

      Hurley throws Michael a papaya with no hesitation, rubs his 
      sore foot.

                                  HURLEY
                    Knock yourself out, dude.  Hey, you 
                    want to wish something on your 
                    worst enemy?  Hope they step on a 
                    sea urchin.

      And as Michael eats, Hurley looks up to see Jin approaching --

      -- Hurley looks down -- not wanting to face him, but Jin now 
      stands over him... and hands him a WHOLE FISH.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  Hey.  Thanks...*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (GREEN)       12/1/04         48.

      Jin shakes his head, then walks off.  Hurley examines the 
      fish.  It s sliced along the bottom.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Dude, this has already been 
                    cleaned?  You re kidding me...

      But Jin is already out of there, on his way to meet up with --

      SUN

      at the middle of the valley.  The two talk together softly in 
      KOREAN -- the gentle, normal discourse of a couple doing 
      their best to cope.

      KATE

      Drifts INTO FRAME, watching them talk intimately.  She 
      wonders how two people have so little communication on one 
      level yet obviously share love and loyalty on another.

      And off this --


                                  JACK (O.S.)*
                    They look happy.*

      And speaking of complicated couples... Kate turns around.   *
      It s Jack, who has walked up behind her. *

                                  KATE*
                    Happy?*

                                  JACK*
                    Yeah, you remember happy, right?*

      Kate chuckles.  But Jack didn t come here to talk about Sun  *
      and Jin --*

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    Put out your hand.*

                                  KATE*
                          (playful)*
                    My hand?*

                                  JACK*
                          (simply)*
                    You ll like it.  I swear.*

      Kate looks at Jack, trying to figure out what he s doing. *



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (GREEN)       12/1/04         48A.

      And we play up her indecision here: Is she going to give Jack  *
      her hand or not?  Until she tentatively holds out her hand...  *
      slowly opens her palm.*

      Jack puts his hand on top of hers, their hands touching  *
      softly as he carefully puts something inside... Something too  *
      tiny for us to see.  Kate looks at whatever it is -- *

                                  KATE*
                          (recalling what Jack *
                          called her passion fruit *
                          seeds earlier)*
                    Gross little greyish yellow *

                    Excuse me -- these are slimy little *

                                  KATE*
                    Guava seeds?*

                                  JACK*
                    What s a garden without guava?*

                                  KATE*

                          (then)*
                    Thanks.*

      Jack smiles at Kate.  And as always, there s so much going on  *
      between these two.  But we ll leave the audience wanting more  *
      and go to --*


      Boone holds an ice pack to his head.  Thoroughly morose and 
      humiliated, he stuffs his clothes into his bag.  He s getting 
      the hell out of Dodge, having failed here in the most 
      miserable of ways.

      Then a SOFT KNOCK on the door sounds.  Boone goes and opens 
      it, revealing...

      Shannon.






































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     49.

      She enters -- without a word.  Eyes red from crying.  Drunk.  
      Pretty seriously drunk.  Boone breaks the silence.

                                  BOONE
                    What do you want?

      It s hard for her to admit it, but finally she does.

                                    SHANNON
                    Bryan took the money.

                                  BOONE
                    What? --

                                    SHANNON
                    He s gone.

      Boone sees the utter sincerity and vulnerability on her face.  
      Despite that, he s still pissed --

                                  BOONE
                    So the player got played.  That s 
                    poetic, don t you think?

      Shannon looks stricken.  She stumbles toward him and lashes 
      out -- drunk and angry.

                                    SHANNON
                    It s all your fault.

      Boone looks at her incredulously.

                                  BOONE
                    Well that s perfect.

                                    SHANNON
                    I knew you d bring the money.  I 
                    knew you would.

                                  BOONE
                    You re drunk, Shannon...

                                  SHANNON
                    And you wanna know why?

                                  BOONE
                    Does it matter?  Because I m sure 
                    you re gonna tell me.

      Boone can t wait to hear THIS ONE.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     50.

                                  SHANNON
                    Because you re in love with me.

      Boone is stunned by this.  It really takes a beat.  And 
      yet... he may be blushing, the slightest bit...

                                  BOONE
                    What?

      She says it again, simply.

                                  SHANNON
                    You brought the money because 
                    you re in love with me.

      Boone FIRES BACK -- cutting, bitter and angry.

                        BOONESHANNON
      You show up here plastered -- 
      you ve always been a self--- I know you re in love with 
      centered bitch -- but now me.
      you re delusional --

      Shannon looks at him -- with honesty -- but also some edge.

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    I ve always known it.

      She s daring him, challenging him to deny it.

                                  BOONE
                    You re sick.

      Even as she s moving closer -- and closer --

                                  SHANNON
                    No...

                                  BOONE
                    Stay away from me...

                                  SHANNON
                    It s all right...

                                  BOONE
                    -- the hell are you doing?  Get 
                    away from me --

      -- but the truth is?  He s not moving.  And now she s right 
      there --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     51.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    -- Shannon...
                          (beat)
                    ... stop it.

      -- but slowly -- she keeps coming... and their lips finally 
      meet.

      They KISS.  A tender and tentative exploration, after which 
      they pause -- their hearts pounding --

      And now they give themselves over to it -- abandoning 
      themselves to the moment -- in FULL ON PASSION -- stumbling 
      back -- and falling in a tangle onto Boone s hotel room bed.


      Boone in his boxers sits on the edge of the bed.  Shannon 
      sits across from him in a chair, fully dressed.

      They don t say anything for a long moment.  Her shame and 
      regret hang heavy in the air.  Finally:

                                    SHANNON
                    When we get back to LA... you 
                    should just tell your mom that... 
                    that you rescued me.  Again.  Just 
                    like you always do -- and we just 
                    go back --

                                  BOONE
                    -- to what?

                                    SHANNON
                    To what it was.

                        BOONESHANNON
      How could you --
                                                  Like this.

      And there is nothing he can do about it.

                                  BOONE
                    Like it s all up to you?

      But her veneer is fully back up in place -- and she gives him 
      nothing.  Boone s expression turns as he realizes that 
      tonight never happened.

                                  SHANNON
                    Get dressed.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     52.

      Off Boone, the sadness, anger, and resigned disappointment 
      play across his face.


      Boone (dirty but no longer bloody) strides into the valley --  *
      his eyes burning -- looking something like Martin Sheen in 
       Apocalypse Now .

      Only his Colonel Kurtz is Locke, sitting alone at a campfire.  
      There are some survivors at a distant campfire.  Another 
      campfire burns not far away, but no one sits at that one.  In  *
      other words, Locke is here virtually alone.*

      Boone breaks into a run -- Locke s knife in his hand -- and 
      launches himself at Locke.

      Locke is ready for him.  Dodges.  Boone and Locke tumble over 
      and over.  They grapple.  Locke ends up on the bottom -- 
      almost strangely passive.  Not fighting back -- but CONTROLS 
      THE SITUATION by holding Boone s knife hand at bay off his 
      throat.

                    And now she s dead.  It... it *
                    mangled her.  She died in my arms. *

      Locke stares into Boone s blazing eyes.  A beat.  Then -- *

                                  LOCKE*
                          (beat)*
                    Then why isn t there blood on you?*

      Boone looks down at his hands, the rest of him.  Holy shit!  
      Locke s right.  No blood anywhere.  Only dirt.*

      Boone knows it was there before.  He looks up at Locke, 
      confused, swirling with anger and bewilderment, waiting for 
      an explanation.

                                  BOONE*
                    What happened to me out there?

                                  LOCKE
                    I don t know.  You tell me.*
                          (beat)*
                    But your sister?  Shannon?*

      And now Locke, still holding Boone s knife hand, pushes 
      himself up.  THE WAY HE LOOKS AT BOONE -- Boone lets him do 
      it.  And then Locke turns his head... and Boone follows his  *
      gaze to --*

      THE NEARBY CAMPFIRE further back in the caves, where he sees-- *

      Sayid and Shannon come into view!  They sit together at the 
      fire.  She s laughing, smiling, joking around with Sayid --  *
      AND VERY MUCH ALIVE.  It s like she doesn t have a CARE IN  *
      THE WORLD.  And with obviously no knowledge of what Boone 
      just went through.

      WHAT.  THE.  FUCK?*

                                  BOONE
                    She was dead...*

                                  LOCKE
                    Is that what it made you see?*

                                  BOONE
                    What what made me see?*
                          (then; realizing)*
                    That stuff you put on my head?*
                          (shock)*
                    -- You drugged me?

                                  LOCKE
                    I gave you an experience.

                    One I believe vital to your 
                    survival on the island.

                                  BOONE*
                    None of it was real?  That... *
                    thing...*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Was only as real as you made it.*

                                  BOONE*
                          (at a whisper)*
                    I saw her die...*
                          (beat; eyes welling)*
                    She was gone.  She was dead. *

      Locke looks at Boone -- who is clearly having a lot of 
      trouble figuring out what it all meant.

                                  LOCKE
                    How did you feel -- when she died?

      Boone doesn t answer that question for a long moment.  
      Everything Locke did was meant to bring him to this place.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    ... how did you feel...?

      And it finally DAWNS on Boone.  Accepting it --*

                                  BOONE
                    ...I felt... relieved.

      Locke nods.

                                  LOCKE
                    Yes.

      Boone looks at Shannon for a moment.  She s gorgeous -- full  *
      of life -- she looks like a piece of candy...*

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Time to let go.*

      And we notice something very important.  Boone s look to 
      Shannon is no longer obsessive.  Now Boone looks to Locke.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Follow me.

      And Locke walks off.  We LINGER on Boone as he looks off at  *
      his sister.  And then --*

      Boone turns away, following Locke out of the caves into the *
      jungle.  And as they disappear into the darkness. *
