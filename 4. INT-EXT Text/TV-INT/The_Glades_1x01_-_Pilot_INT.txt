    Inside, a man and a girl, asleep.  Not cuddling, hardly even 
    touching.  Oh, and the girl - she s not wearing pants.  Just a 
    throwback Buccaneer's jersey riding up high enough to see a pair 
    of pink and blue striped panties.  From GAP, if I had to guess.

    The man, KERRY, is a good looking kid of 22, with an athletic 
    build.  You d fuck him if you were her, which it appears as if 
    she did, last night.  The girl, ERIN, is 16.  Without a doubt 
    you d fuck her - soft blonde hair, a hard and tight body.  Two 
    kids from middle-class families, exploring the nature of things.  
    Both dead asleep ...

    Until one of those heron leap off the bank with a shrieking 
    whoop, and glides, whooping, out over the swamp.

    Waking Kerry.  His eyes open and we know immediately this kid 
    did some drinking last night.  Red, bleary eyes.  Head pounding.  
    He struggles for short term memory, looks over at Erin, dead 
    asleep, vintage tee and panties - jogging some of last night 
    back to him.  He fishes around a dash board cluttered with beer 
    cans for his smokes.  She stirs but does not wake.

    Kerry studies her body.  More of the night returns to him in a 
    flood of drunken memories, driving his need for fresh air.                                                                                      2.





    Erin wakes to the sound of his RETCHING.  She sits up, sees 
    Kerry at the edge of the creek.  She fumbles along the dash, 
    finds a watch and checks the time.

                                  ERIN
                    Shit.

    She stands on the horn.

                                  ERIN
                    Kerry!  Shit.

    The HORN sends Kerry into a second wave of retching. 

    Off which, the camera CRANES up and over the mangrove to FIND 
    the tri-bay area of Tampa/St. Pete/Clearwater, a mile and a half 
    west, buffeting the azure waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



    Ogletree steps to the counter, nodding  morning  to a few of the 
    locals.  The owner, ROBBIE RENNER, 35, sun-kissed, swimmer s bod 
    and nobody s fool, busy shucking oysters.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Robbie.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Mike.

    Ogletree watches her lightening-quick shucking as she fills a 
    tray of goobers.

                                  OGLETREE
                      Management shucking oysters.  You 
                    got employees who can do that.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Not as fast as I can.  Besides.  I 
                    like to get my hands dirty.

    They share a brief smile.  He watches her a beat, then --

                                  OGLETREE
                    You mind if I --

    Help himself to a to-go cup of coffee.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Yeah, no, go ahead.

    Ogletree moves behind the counter, pours himself coffee.

                                  ROBBIE
                    You see what some jackass did to my 
                    wall out there?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I did.  Not quite sure I take its 
                    meaning.                                                                                      4.



                                  ROBBIE
                    Means after I close up tonight, I 
                    get to do some painting.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Any idea who might have done it?

                                  ROBBIE
                    Hell, you know me.  I m sure I 
                    pissed off someone, I usually do.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Same thing was painted on the 
                    Marriott off Interlake.  Another on 
                    the airport overpass.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Then I won t take it personally.

    She smiles, wipes her hands on her apron to help bag his coffee 
    as he pulls out his cell, thumbing in a text.

                                  ROBBIE
                    That why you re working on a 
                    Sunday?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Nope.  We got a floater.
                          (off her look)
                    -- someone dumped a body into 
                      Fisheating creek.

                                  ROBBIE
                    That s a nice thing.  Dope dealing?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Naw.  She didn t look like she was 
                    into that.

                                  ROBBIE
                    A  she , huh?  Good-looking?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I don t know.  She didn t have a 
                    head.

    Ogletree hits the button to send his text, then hangs up.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    Erin sits alone in a small office.  She looks tired but not 
    particularly anxious over events of the morning.  Buoyed, 
    perhaps, by events of the night.



    Longworth waits for a burrito to re-heat in the microwave.  
    Ogletree stirs a packet of sugar into his coffee from Robbie s 
    as he teases out details from a work in progress protocol.

                                  OGLETREE
                    No scar tissue, no water in her 
                    lungs - nothing in her stomach ...

    The microwave DINGS.  Longworth goes for his burrito.

                                  OGLETREE
                    ... identity and Cause of Death 
                      inconclusive without the head -- 
                    you might wanna give that a --

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ah!  Shit.

    Longworth burns his hand grabbing the hot burrito.

                                  OGLETREE
                    You wanna go look at the body?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She s dead.  I wanna talk to the 
                    girl.  Any word from her folks?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Her mom is M.I.A.  Apparently not 
                    unusual for a Saturday night, 
                      especially with her husband on a 
                    poker run in the Keys.                                                                                      9.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Any o  these geniuses have a 
                    record?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Law abiding, far as we know.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about the boy?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Local kid.  Kerry Brussard.  Twenty-
                    two ...
                          (beat)
                    I sent him home.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why?

                                  OGLETREE
                    He threw up on my keyboard giving 
                    his statement.
                          (beat)
                    Got a call into the girl s folks.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Okay.

                                  OGLETREE
                    She s sixteen.  Can t talk to her 
                    without a parent or guardian ...

    But Longworth is already on the move ...



    Longworth enters, sits across from Erin as he eats his burrito.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You get anything to eat?
                          (silence)
                    You want something?  Burrito or 
                      something?  Something to drink?

    She shakes her head no.  Longworth looks at her a beat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Would you be more comfortable if we 
                    waited till we located one of your 
                    parents?

                                  ERIN
                    My parents?  Good luck with that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re okay talking to me, then?                                                                                    10.



    She shrugs sure, whatever.  Longworth sits across from her.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We sent your whatever he is - 
                    boyfriend or whatever, home.  He 
                    puked on my partner s keyboard.

                                  ERIN
                    He drinks too much.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s also older than you.  Did you 
                    guys have relations?

                                  ERIN
                    What do you mean?  Did I screw him?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, did you screw him.

                                  ERIN
                    Is that important?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe.

    She looks at him a beat.  Not sure where he s going.

                                  ERIN
                    I m old enough to give consent. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You re sixteen.  That s not old 
                    enough.  Legally.

                                  ERIN
                    Are you going to arrest him?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Did he have sex with you?

                                  ERIN
                    No.
                          (off his look)
                    And what s this got to do with the 
                    woman without the head?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t know yet.

    Erin looks at him.  Digesting that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He says you guys got out there a 
                    little after ten o clock and slept 
                    out there all night?  Did you see 
                    or hear anything?                                                                                    11.



                                  ERIN
                    You mean, related to the woman?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah.  Did you see or hear anything 
                    that might help us identify who she 
                    was.  Like the person or persons 
                    who dumped her there.

                                  ERIN
                    Maybe she died there.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe.  But we don t think so.

                                  ERIN
                    What do you think happened?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I think she was killed somewhere 
                    else and dumped there so an 
                    alligator could destroy the 
                    evidence.

    Erin takes a beat with that. Shakes her head no.

                                  ERIN
                    I didn t hear anything.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about this spot?  Anything 
                    about it special for you two?

                                  ERIN
                    No. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No special meaning?

                                  ERIN
                    No.  Just a place to go.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    A place other people go to maybe?
                    Young people.  To party, get drunk.  
                    Try sex?

    She doesn t respond, but yeah, basically.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So it s kind of a dumb place to 
                    dump a body.  If someone knew that.

                                  ERIN
                    Maybe it s a good place, if you re 
                    tryin  to mess with the cops.                                                                                    12.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Is that something you think about?  
                    Messing with us for trying to keep 
                    things safe and orderly?

                                  ERIN
                    I m just saying.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So was this your first time trying 
                    sex? 

                                  ERIN
                    Trying?  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey, I m still trying.  Don t ever 
                    wanna get too good at a thing, it 
                    becomes routine. 

                                  ERIN
                    How do you know she didn t float 
                    there from upriver?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Doesn t figure that way, 
                      forensically.

                                  ERIN
                    Are you an expert in forensics?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m an expert in all things 
                      homicidal, Erin.  There isn t much 
                    about murder I don t know.  Or 
                    can t find out.  If I just keep 
                    asking the right questions.

    They stare at each other.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    Longworth in a hospital gown, a bandage over his right hand, is 
    bent over an exam table as a health care worker draws antibiotic 
    into a syringe behind him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Is this absolutely necessary?

    The health care worker, CALLIE, a pretty thirty-two year old 
    with a tough veneer, rubs an alcohol cotton ball on his ass.

                                  CALLIE
                    You want to die of infection?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He looked pretty hygienic to me.

                                  CALLIE
                    Everyone looks hygienic till the 
                    blood work comes back.

    She looks for a spot on his ass to administer the shot, stops to 
    run a finger over scar tissue in the middle of his back.

                                  CALLIE
                    Either that s an exit wound or the 
                    surgeons in Chicago are all drunks.

    He looks back at her, impressed she knew what it was.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    My captain shot me.

                                  CALLIE
                    On purpose?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He thought I was sleeping with his 
                    wife ...

    She sticks him with the needle, he blanches slightly.                                                                                    14.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    -- I wasn t.  But I was the only 
                    one in the department that wasn t.

    She drops the gown to re-cover his ass.  He holds up his 
    bandaged hand, testing it, squeezing it open and closed.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It feels like it s gonna hurt like 
                    hell later on.

                                  CALLIE
                    I can give you something for the 
                    pain, but a six pack of Heineken 
                    will do just as good.  And if I do 
                    give you something and later on you 
                    want that Heineken ...

    Meaning, not on antibiotics, as he mimics a golf grip and swing, 
    annoyed with the clunky bandage and winching for the effort.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    How long you think I m gonna have 
                    to wear this thing?

                                  CALLIE
                    You in some kind of hurry?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I ve got a Titleist with a perfect 
                    lie sitting on the fourteenth 
                    fairway at Palm Harbor, waiting for 
                    me to break eighty for the first 
                    time in my life.

                                  CALLIE
                    With that swing, I m not surprised.

    She hands him a clipboard for his signature.

                                  CALLIE
                    Sign, date and initial where 
                      indicated.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What am I signing?

                                  CALLIE
                    You re releasing the medical center 
                    from liability should you lose that 
                    hand or die from infection due to 
                    my incompetence.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m not signing that.                                                                                    15.



                                  CALLIE
                    You will if you want your clothes 
                    back.

    She leaves.  He smiles, signs the forms.



    Longworth pours a Heineken, smiling a little as he recalls the 
    advice, and more importantly, the woman who gave it.  He cups a 
    couple of Advil into his mouth, washing them down with the beer.

    He tucks a police file under his arm, and we FOLLOW him through 
    the sliding glass doors, to his pool and screened-in deck area.



    Longworth has a roll of surgical tape, a length of which he is 
    tearing using his teeth.  He wraps the length of tape around his 
    freshly bandaged wound, securing it tight.  He holds the wounded 
    hand with his good hand - it really is starting to throb and 
    hurt.  Despite the pain, he manages a slight grin at his injury.


    CLOSE ON A BLOTCH

    Revealed to be a very close, microscopic view of human flesh, 
    viewed through a high powered microscope.  The focus pulls 
    tighter around a cluster of bright red circles, what is commonly 
    referred to as a blood grouping.



    Carlos over a microscope, Longworth at his side.

                                  CARLOS
                    The club manager called.  He wants 
                    you to come pick up your ball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      I consulted the USGA handbook and 
                      technically, I have seventy-two 
                    hours to resume play following an 
                    injury.

                                  CARLOS
                    What are you talking about?  
                    There s no rule like that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No, but doesn t that sound like 
                    something those Nazi bastard s 
                    would have a rule about.  And what 
                    crawled up Buddy s ass?

                                  CARLOS
                    He s getting complaints from 
                    members that you ve cordoned off an 
                    area around your ball on the 
                      fourteenth fairway.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I want to finish the round.                                                                                    19.



                                  CARLOS
                    It s gonna be weeks before you can 
                    swing a club, go pick up your ball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m getting medical treatment, I ll 
                    be fine by the end of the week.  
                    The most heinous crime in this 
                    County s history and I can t get 
                    one professional courtesy? 

    Longworth exits, Carlos shakes his head, returns to his 
    eyepiece.



    Ogletree, sitting uncomfortably at his desk over a file.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That thing helping?

    He turns as Longworth steps up, nodding to the back support 
    thing strapped to the back of Ogletree s chair.

                                  OGLETREE
                    No.  Lose your uniform again?

    Ogletree in department khakis, Longworth in street clothes.  An 
    on-going source of aggravation for Ogletree ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m just saying, hit the gym once 
                    in a while, every little thing 
                    wouldn t throw your back out.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Yeah, we can be workout partners.  
                    Spend even more time together.
                          (re the files)
                    I got Missing Person files from 
                    Orlando, Ocala, Tampa, Miami.  
                    Nothing promising.  I m waiting for 
                      Jacksonville and Naples.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Naples?  That s like old people.  
                    She wasn t that old.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Maybe she was visiting a relative.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Dressed like that, I don t think 
                    so.                                                                                    20.



                                  OGLETREE
                    What s wrong with the way she was 
                    dressed?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Someone she was visiting would ve 
                    called it in if she went missing, 
                    don t you think?

    Ogletree looks at him blankly.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We may not have her head, compadre, 
                    but we still have ours.

    Longworth heads off.  Ogletree watches him head out.



    CLOSE on a TRAFFIC LIGHT, burning green in a moonless night.  

    ECU of the instrument, the screen filled with green.  Emitting 
    an electronic BUZZ.  The light shifts from green to yellow, 
    angle widening now to include it.  Then on again to red.  

    The light glows, instrument swinging in a light ocean breeze.

    WIDER

    A vehicle, a sedan, comes to a full stop at the intersection.



    Longworth at the wheel, annoyed he caught the light.  He looks 
    left and right, even more annoyed to realize there s no traffic 
    in either direction. 

    He waits, checking his bandaged hand, squeezing and unsqueezing 
    his grip, wincing slightly from discomfort.

    He looks at the light, still red.  When something at the curb of 
    the intersection catches his eye.

    A  shrine  at the base of the traffic light.  Beer cans and 
    liquor bottles, candles, notes, flowers, relatively fresh.

    Longworth gets out of the car and steps to the shrine.

    He kneels to read a few notes and cards, all a loving tribute to 
     Lane , live fast and die hard, etc.

    Longworth looks up at the street signs at the intersection.

    U.S. 75 and Interlake Boulevard.  

    A car HORN blasts -- some idiot behind his idling car, pissed to 
    be waiting behind a light that s turned green.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The place busy with a night time crowd.  The MUSIC jazz-infused, 
    the vibe, half drunk and sexy.  Longworth enters, carrying a 
    file.  He looks around the bar, sees someone through the crowd, 
    in the distance by the pinball machines.

    He starts over, then stops when he sees Ogletree sitting alone 
    at the bar, staring into a highball.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Oh.  Hey. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What are you drinking?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Bourbon.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You don t drink bourbon.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Sometimes I do.  Have a seat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m looking for Carlos.  His wife 
                    said he likes to come here for the 
                    old school pinballs.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Haven t seen him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s right there.

    Ogletree looks to where Longworth is pointing.

                                  OGLETREE
                    I didn t even see him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What was the name of that kid s 
                    brother?

                                  OGLETREE
                    What kid?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Kerry.  Was it Lane?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Lane?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Why?                                                                                    33.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    There s a shrine for him at the 
                    light at Interlake and 75.  When 
                    was that accident that killed him?

                                  OGLETREE
                    I don t know.  A year ago, maybe.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    To the day?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Maybe.  About that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Are you okay?

                                  OGLETREE
                    Yeah.  Just fighting with my wife, 
                    is all.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You guys don t fight.

                                  OGLETREE
                    We don t very often.  She went to 
                    her sisters - whatever.  Big drama 
                    queen, right?  You want a drink?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Let me take care of this first.

                                  OGLETREE
                    Sure, sure.  I ll be here.

    ANGLE ON CARLOS

    Slamming into a pinball machine as Longworth approaches.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why didn t you tell me there was a 
                    tooth?

                                  CARLOS
                    What are you talking about?

    Longworth pulls out the Medical Exam protocol.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It says you pulled a tooth from the 
                    vic.

                                  CARLOS
                    A cuspid.  From the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why didn t you tell me?                                                                                    34.



                                  CARLOS
                    What difference does it make?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Carlos, a tooth can tell us all 
                    kinds of things.

                                  CARLOS
                    About the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Size, sex, migration ... 

                                  CARLOS
                    Of the alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Digestive system, is it fast, slow, 
                    one week, two weeks?

                                  CARLOS
                    Okay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It s been three days, maybe the 
                    head is still intact. 

                                  CARLOS
                    Are you out of your mind?  How are 
                    you gonna find the one alligator in 
                    a swamp of goddamn alligators who 
                    fed on our Jane Doe?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    With the tooth.

                                  CARLOS
                    No wonder your partner hates you.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Don t be so lazy, Carlos.

                                  CARLOS
                    Did you just call me lazy?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    When s the tox screen scheduled?

                                  CARLOS
                    Tomorrow.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I want to go with you.

                                  CARLOS
                    I m not taking you to the lab with 
                    me.                                                                                    35.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why not?

                                  CARLOS
                    The last time I did that they had a 
                    problem with you.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So.  Professional courtesy.

                                  CARLOS
                      Professional courtesy?  You told 
                    them they had their head up their 
                    ass.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They do.  Or they did.  I have no 
                    idea if it s a recurring problem or 
                    not.  I ll keep an open mind.

    Longworth heads off before Carlos can object.  Carlos slugs more 
    coins in, cajoling the pinball machine back to life.

    Longworth returns to where Ogletree was sitting, his empty 
    bourbon and a beer sit there.  Money on the bar to pay for both.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Excuse me?  What happened to the 
                    guy who was sitting here?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Said he was tired.  Beer s for you.



    Longworth with DANIEL KIM, 23, grad student in Herpetology, who 
    looks at the alligator tooth in a plastic baggie --

                                  KIM
                      Melanosuchus, would be my guess.  
                    Genus, phylum, can t be certain 
                    without more research.  But all 
                    members of the chordata family are 
                      territorial.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    And digestion is what, long, short?

                                  KIM
                    Very slow, like ten days.  Let me 
                    hang on to this, do some blood 
                    work, I can probably give you size, 
                    sex, coloring.  Will that help?

    Longworth hands the kid his business card.                                                                                    36.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Call me.



    Longworth with COLLIER MANUS, 42, old school Florida Deputy 
    Sheriff with a tight crew cut and fit torso tucked into a peat 
    brown uniform which he wears like a second skin.

    They move down a hall, stopping as a guard opens a locked door, 
    allowing them to move deeper for a room at the end of the hall.

                                  MANUS
                    Steppin  on some big toes lettin  
                    you in here.  You will eventually 
                    tell me how this miscreant is 
                    related to your missing Jane Doe?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Just a hunch at this point.

                                  MANUS
                    None of these bad men mind an 
                      interruption in their day, but 
                    their lawyers take exception.  If 
                    your visit doesn t advance your 
                    stated intention, I gotta deal with 
                    that.

    They enter --



    Where FRANK CARGILL, 36, jump suit, sits in the dimly lit room.

                                  MANUS
                    He s a true piece of shit and God 
                    don t like him much for his part in 
                    taking another man s life, but he 
                    has rights.  So tell me something 
                    good and save your lying for Mister 
                    Cargill.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I m trying to get into his wife s 
                    pants.

                                  MANUS
                    Lucky for you tinnitus spared me 
                    that revelation.                                                                                      37.



    Manus nods and the light in the room comes on.



    Longworth sits across from Frank Cargill.  Frank looking over 
    photos of three men, holding one out he recognizes.

                                    CARGILL
                    This guy, maybe.  Wayne or Dwayne 
                      something.  These other two ...

    Cargill shrugs he doesn t know them.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    This creek sound like a place Wayne 
                    or Dwayne might find himself?

                                    CARGILL
                    Doesn t fish to my knowledge.  
                    Straight up law breaker.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Pretty big piece of violence.

                                    CARGILL
                    Yeah, I m not seeing it.

    Cargill hands the photo back to end the conversation.  Getting 
    the sense he s being fucked with, just not sure why.  

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What about you?  

                                    CARGILL
                    I don t fish.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You ve never been out there?

                                    CARGILL
                    Have to be clueless or desperate to 
                    go fishing where they aren t any 
                    fish to catch.

    Cargill objecting to the fishing expedition.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No fish in Fisheating creek?

                                    CARGILL
                    Cane fields leached out all the 
                    niacin.  Nothing but gators, 
                      crackheads and assholes lookin  for 
                    trouble.

    The two men hold each others eyes.                                                                                    38.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    How s your time going, Frank?
                    Got a hearing coming up?  

                                    CARGILL
                    My attorney has all that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Any calls I can make on your 
                    behalf?  Information maybe I can 
                    help bring to light in appreciation 
                    for your thoughts this afternoon --

                                    CARGILL
                    I didn t tell you anything.  But 
                    thank you.

    Cargill clearly doesn t want any help from the lawman.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You sure?  It wouldn t be any 
                    trouble.  Maybe run by, check on 
                    the family, make sure they don t 
                    need anything ...

                                    CARGILL
                    If you could maybe stay the hell 
                    away from my family, that would be 
                    greatly appreciated.



    We follow Callie up the hall, then slows when she sees Longworth 
    enter through the sliding doors.  She seems happy to see him.

                                  CALLIE
                    Hey.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.  Got something for you ...

    He hands her some money.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Seventeen-fifty.  That s the 
                    original fifteen dollars plus a 
                    little something on top for taking 
                    so long.

                                  CALLIE
                    Okay.

    A beat.  She looks confused. 

                                  CALLIE
                    Is something wrong?                                                                                    39.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    I just feel bad I haven t paid you, 
                    is all.

    She figures out what he s done.

                                  CALLIE
                    You went and saw Frank.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Why would you say that?

                                  CALLIE
                    You re paying me.  Not paying me 
                    was how you were keeping this thing 
                    alive.

    She looks at him.  He doesn t deny it.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I was curious.

                                  CALLIE
                    Curious about what?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Whether or not your husband was 
                    someone I could respect.

                                  CALLIE
                    And?



    They slam inside, ripping at each others clothes, clawing and 
    kissing as they fall into a bed used by staff between shifts.

    They have tremendous first time sex.  Fight to keep quiet but 
    fail miserably.



    Longworth putting his shoes and socks on as she comes out of the 
    bathroom, straightening her uniform which she just put back on.

                                  CALLIE
                    You know, it wouldn t come as a 
                    huge surprise to Frank to learn I 
                    was seeing someone.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    That would be between you and 
                    Frank.  And Jeff.                                                                                    40.



                                  CALLIE
                    No, it wouldn t.  Because if we do 
                    this?  We re gonna tell Frank or 
                    we re no better.

    She walks out of the room.   His cell phone rings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah?



    A ten-foot CAIMAN lies on top of a surgical table.  Daniel Kim 
    over it, marking an area near the stomach with a red marker.

    Carlos and Longworth, off to the side, Carlos pissed there s an 
    alligator on his table.  

                                  CARLOS
                      Unorthodoxed?  Try nuts.

                                  LONGWORTH
                      Unorthodox.  There s no  ed  at the 
                    end ...

                                  CARLOS
                    I m not autopsying an alligator.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Caiman.  Then let the kid do it.

                                  CARLOS
                    Right, and Chain of Command goes 
                    out the window.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    See, you think I m right.

                                  CARLOS
                    I think you re nuts but we ve been 
                    over that already.


    ANGLE ON AUTOPSY TABLE

    Daniel Kim is over the caiman, gestures along a section of the 
    reptile s belly marked with red, as they step up.

                                  KIM
                    Tubal absorption runs along the 
                    length of the thorax.  Anything 
                    this guy s eaten in the last ten 
                    days will be right along here.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Look at that?  All marked up for 
                    you and everything.

                                  KIM
                    Thanks for letting me observe, Dr. 
                    Sanchez.  I really appreciate it.                                                                                    43.



                                  CARLOS
                    Yeah.  No problem.

    Carlos shoots Longworth a look, takes a scalpel, inserts it 
    along the marking.  A tough hide requiring a great deal of 
    effort as he saws along the cut line.

                                  KIM
                    The caiman latirostris is pretty 
                    efficient as a predator.  Eats 
                    fish, turtles ... small land 
                    creatures like raccoon, possum ... 
                    pretty much anything that ventures 
                    into it s waters, especially if 
                    it s nesting or just gave birth ...

    The cut finished, Carlos inserts a gloved hand into the opening.  

                                  KIM
                    Their enzyme production is really 
                    low cause they have like no immune 
                    system - basically they never get 
                    sick, so it gets pretty backed up 
                    in there ...

    He begins removing fleshy debris, which Kim identifies as Carlos 
    pulls out, dropping it into a blue container --

                                  KIM
                    -- catfish ... I d say brim or 
                    perch maybe ... box turtle ...

    Which Carlos drops it in, feels briefly around inside, then --

                                  CARLOS
                    Okay.  That s it.

                                  KIM
                    No, there s more.
                          (off Carlos  look)
                    I can feel it.
                          (he feels, confirming)
                    Yeah, definitely.

    Beat.  Carlos looks at Longworth, runs his hand back inside.

    When he feels something and stops.  Adjusts his slippery grip 
    and pulls it out.  Covered in blood and partially digested.

    But clearly a human jaw bone.

                                  KIM
                    Oh man.  Sweet ...

    Carlos, half amazed, half annoyed.  Longworth piles on.                                                                                    44.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey, Carlos.  Guess who else is 
                    named Carlos?  

    Carlos ignores him, snapping off his gloves.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Chuck Norris.

                                  CARLOS
                    What?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, Chuck Norris  real name is 
                    Carlos.  Daniel taught me that.

                                  KIM
                    I love Chuck Norris.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    And his brother s name is Aaron.  
                    Did you ever think Chuck Norris 
                    would have a brother named Aaron?  
                    How gay is that?

                                  CARLOS
                    You did not just call me gay.



    Ogletree at his desk, annoyed and groaning over his keyboard.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Anything popping with that?

                                  OGLETREE
                    It keeps asking me if I want to 
                    download a new version.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Ignore it.  Most departments work 
                    off Adobe three-point-nine years 
                    ago anyway.  

                                  OGLETREE
                    Tourists, transients, illegals - 
                    this is Florida.  Thousands of 
                    visitors from all over the world 
                    pass through this time of year ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Just focus on the one s who ve been 
                    reported missing.

                                  OGLETREE
                    What if they haven t?                                                                                    45.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Family, co-workers, friends, 
                      eventually someone calls it in.

                                  OGLETREE
                    And then there s HIPPA rules ...

                                  LONGWORTH
                    We have some leg work to do before 
                    we start asking for dental records.  
                    Pace yourself.  It ll come 
                    together.

                                  OGLETREE
                    You could help.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I found the jaw bone.

    Not what he wanted to hear.  Longworth throws him a bone.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I saved you a trip to the high 
                    school ...

    Longworth fans open a high school yearbook showing him a page of 
    graduating seniors.  One in particular --

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Lane Brussard, class of  02, and I 
                    quote:  Okeechobee Southerner s Are 
                      Sub-Human .  A quote that s been 
                    popping up all over the high school 
                    this past week.

    Ogletree refusing to give it up.

                                  OGLETREE
                    We still don t know what it means.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    It means the one-year anniversary 
                    of his brother being killed by a 
                    tourist had not gone forgotten.



    Kerry daytime drinking and having lunch.  Looks up as Longworth 
    sits down across from him, without an invitation.                                                                                    46.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    So I figured out who s been 
                    painting on the sides of buildings 
                    around here.

    Kerry looks at him beat, then goes back to eating.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Your brother.

                                  KERRY
                    That s not funny.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t mean your brother per se.  
                    I mean someone who loved your 
                    brother.  Who thought he was a hero 
                    worth remembering.  Someone who 
                    looked up to him.  That s who did 
                    it.

                                  KERRY
                    He had a lot of people like that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Yeah, I m not hearing that.  I m 
                    hearing he was kind of a moody 
                    little dipshit.  It s all about 
                    him.  That guy.

                                  KERRY
                    He could be that.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Which can put some people off.

    Kerry glances up at that, but right back down to eat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    So here s what I think is going on.  
                    And you tell me where I ve got it 
                    wrong.
                          (beat)
                    You hate tourists.  I mean, who 
                    doesn t, right?  But unlike the 
                    rest of us, you have a really good 
                    reason.  And knowing that, I d be 
                    kind of an idiot not to pursue the 
                      possibility that you lured one of 
                    those annoying assholes into a 
                      situation, killed her, dumped her 
                    body in the swamp, then dragged 
                    poor Erin into it after the fact so 
                    she could witness you  finding  her 
                    headless body, how s that?

    Kerry head down, pushing his food around, listening.                                                                                    47.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Only that s not what happened.  I 
                    mean, you might have done it, I ve 
                    been wrong before.  But I just 
                    don t see it.  See the thing about 
                    murder?  Is you really have to be 
                    able to keep it together to get 
                    away with it, and I don t know, 
                    something about the way a kid like 
                    you with no balls is able to sit 
                    here sawing away at Robbie s 
                    chicken fried steak just doesn t 
                    say to me that three nights ago you 
                    killed a woman and fed her to an 
                      alligator.  And for my deal, if I 
                    have lose ends or something doesn t 
                    fit or add up?  Then I really 
                    haven t eliminated anything.  And 
                    murder is all about elimination.  
                    So while I could be wrong, I just 
                    don t see it.  Now what I do see 
                    you doing is spray painting 
                      Okeechobee whatever the hell on the 
                    side of a few buildings so no one 
                    will forget your brother.  Will you 
                    give me that?

    Kerry looks up.  Stares a beat.

                                  KERRY
                    Okay.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Okay.  Good.  And was it your idea 
                    or your girlfriend s to plaster it 
                    all over the high school?

                                  KERRY
                    She s not my girlfriend.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Not your girlfriend.

                                  KERRY
                    We re just hanging out.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hanging out with a sixteen year 
                    old.

                                  KERRY
                    I mean.  We just.  We were both ... 
                    thinking about him.  I was drunk.  
                    I don t know.  We just wanted to 
                    remember him ...

    Kerry stops, not sure where he stands here.                                                                                    48.



                                  KERRY
                    She told me she checked.  I thought 
                    she was telling me the truth. 

    Longworth lets that worry sit on his head for a beat.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    She was, son.  It s sixteen.

    Implied in his look: someone too lazy to check, he would have 
    caught by now, as Longworth gets up and leaves.  Off Kerry



    Longworth with Callie, at her desk.  Callie applies iodine 
    tincture to his wound, distracted by work, studies ...

                                  CALLIE
                    She bought lotto tickets?

    She redresses his wound as he contemplates their meaning.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He was drunk and passed out - she

                                  CALLIE
                    No.  Do you?  

    Said busy and impatient.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    They make you pee like a race 
                    horse.  Two of  em, she d be up all 
                    night.   

                                  CALLIE
                    I haven t noticed Jeff doing an 
                      inordinate amount of peeing.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Am I bothering you?

                                  CALLIE
                    Yes.  I m busy.  Don t take it 
                      personally.  I have a test on 
                    Monday.

    Finished with his bandage, she returns to her text book.                                                                                    50.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    You clearing me for all activities?

                                  CALLIE
                    That s up to you.

    Longworth testing his grip, taking practice swings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I don t know.  A sixteen year old 
                    killer?  Statistical long shot.  
                    But she did lie about leaving.  
                    Maybe lied to Kerry - still don t 
                      understand why you guys do that.

                                  CALLIE
                    Because we can.  It s special.  Or 
                    you think so. 

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You don t think it s special?

                                  CALLIE
                    I did at the time.  Don t you 
                    remember your first?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You were my first.

    She smirks, back to her studies.  Back to his practice swings.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I saw Jeff.  Hanging with some 
                    older boys.

                                  CALLIE
                    I know his friends, they re okay.  
                    Bored maybe.  I m glad he s got 
                    friends close in age at all.  Was 
                    he smoking?

                                  LONGWORTH
                    No.

                                  CALLIE
                    You wouldn t tell me if he was.  
                    You can t talk Jeff into doing 
                    something he doesn t want to do.  
                    If he s into something wrong, he 
                    got there by himself.  That s the 
                    best you can hope for.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You ve got to read this whole book?

                                  CALLIE
                      Eventually.                                                                                    51.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Maybe I ll take him to a movie.

    She looks up from her reading.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    You barely have time for yourself.
                    I m sure he s bored.

                                  CALLIE
                    Look.  Don t police my son.  
                    Neither one of us are huge fans of 
                    your line of work.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    I guess I understand that.

    She looks at him, goes back to her book.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    What did you decide about Frank? 

                                  CALLIE
                    It s probably worse not to tell 
                    him.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He can t hurt you.

                                  CALLIE
                    My husband is not a guy to clown 
                    around with.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    He s not that tough.

                                  CALLIE
                    Yeah he is.

    Callie buried in her studies.  His cell rings, his partner s 
    number and he moves off to answer it.

                                  LONGWORTH
                    Hey.  You come up with a name?



    Erin stands over the shrine.  Stares at it.  When her shadow is 
    joined by another.

                                  LONGWORTH (O.C.)
                    Sucks.

    She turns to see Longworth there.                                                                                    52.



                                  LONGWORTH
                    Letting someone go.



    Ogletree grabs an onion and a chopping board.  Opens a drawer, 
    fishes around for a knife, then stops.  

    He moves to another drawer.  Opens it slowly and looks inside.                                                                                      60.
