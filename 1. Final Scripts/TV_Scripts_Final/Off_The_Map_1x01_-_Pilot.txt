                                  "Pilot Episode"

                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. SOUTH AMERICAN AIRPORT - DAY

      EXTREME CLOSE UP ON LILY, twenties, pretty, a bit of an
      underdog but fights against it.  Her outlook is positive,
      determined, but there's something haunted behind her eyes. 
      She surveys the scene, then breaks into a smile. 

                                    LILY
                    Perfect. 

      And then we SEE what she sees - this outdoor "airport" is an
      overgrown field where a few LOCALS wait for charter flights
      into the jungle.  In front of Lily is a SMALL, RICKETY PLANE. 
      It's third world and foreign - not the locale that would
      excite most girls, but Lily's not most girls. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE  (O.S.)
                    Going to the clinic? 

      Lily turns to find MEENA dragging her bags over.  Twenties,
      sexy, Indian-American, grew up extremely poor but you'd never
      know it.  She's unapologetically arrogant, talks a really
      good game - her only sign of weakness is an asthma inhaler.

                                      MEENA
                    Figured with the whole...'George of
                    the Jungle' look you're rocking there.

      We SEE that Lily's indeed decked out in jungle safari gear
      one buys at a mall.  Lily nods, proud of the ensemble.   

                                    LILY
                    I like to be prepared.

                                      MEENA
                    Clearly, fashion be damned.  You a
                    doctor?

                                    LILY
                    Internal medicine, first year. 

                                      MEENA
                    And you're already leaving residency
                    for field work?   





                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        2.

                                    LILY
                    The world needs more doctors in global
                    health and I...needed a change.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. MIDWEST GRAVEYARD - QUICK FLASHBACK

      Snow.  Cold.  We're CLOSE ON LILY'S FACE again.  We HEAR --

                                      MINISTER  (O.S.)
                    God giveth and He taketh away, but
                    when He takes a young person, a life
                    so promising...it changes us forever.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're at a funeral.  Mourners in black,
      a lot of YOUNG ONES.  Lily stares straight ahead, emotionally
      drained, just...numb.  Clearly changed forever.  And we...

                                                                          CUT BACK TO:

      EXT. SOUTH AMERICAN AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

                                      MEENA
                    I'm Meena.  Mital. 

                                    LILY
                    Lily Brenner.  

      Meena takes a HIT OFF HER INHALER as A GUY with new Tumi
      luggage approaches.  Thirties, good looking, slick.  This is
      MANNY SILVA.  He's caught sight of the plane and isn't happy.

                                      MANNY
                    This is our ride?  Uh-uh.  Not okay.

                                    LILY
                    We're gonna be fine.  Planes are
                    much safer than cars -

                                      MANNY
                    Except that's not a plane, it's an
                    aluminum can with wings!

                                      MEENA
                    Have we met?  You look familiar.

                                      MANNY
                    Manny Silva, M.D.  Did I do your
                    boobs?
                          (Off Meena's look)
                    Nah, I don't mess with perfection. 
                    We probably just knocked it.



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        3.

                                      MEENA
                    The thought of that is even more
                    revolting than the boob job.

                                      MANNY
                    Give it time.  Out in the jungle,
                    it's all hot and sticky -

                                    LILY
                    Hey, guess that's not our plane after
                    all.

      Meena and Manny turn to see the rickety plane moving off to
      the field for take off.  Manny breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                      MANNY
                    Oh thank you, jesus.   

                                      MEENA
                    So which one's ours? 

      There's one plane left on the field - an even smaller, FOUR-
      SEATER death trap.  Makes the first plane look like a 747. 
      As they all realize what they're in for...

                                      MANNY  (PRE-LAP)
                    Oh man, I think I'm gonna --

      INT. PROP PLANE - IN THE AIR - DAY

      BLEGH!  Lily and Meena sit on either side of Manny, who's
      down out of frame, puking his guts out.  If it weren't for
      the vomiting, they'd all be enjoying the spectacular view -
      mountains, jungle, ocean, paradise.  A miserable Manny rises
      into frame for a moment, wipes his brow, then drops out of
      frame again.  Lily turns to Meena, trying to ignore Manny. 

                                    LILY
                    So what kind of doctor did you say
                    you were? 

                                      MEENA
                      Infectious disease.  I was at St.
                    Mary's in Manhattan.

                                    LILY
                    Was?   

                                      MEENA
                    How many cases of ebola have you
                    seen in New York City?  
                                      (MORE)

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Whatever, I'm over the whole hospital
                    hierarchy thing.  Too many rules.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. NY HOSPITAL - FLASHBACK

      Meena comes out of the locker room, her belongings in a box. 
      A SECURITY GUARD waits to escort her.

                                      MEENA
                    A little dramatic, don't you think?

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    I'm sorry, M.  Hospital protocol.

      They begin the long walk of shame down the hall. Around her,
      various RESIDENTS and NURSES stare and whisper.  They pass
      the CHIEF OF THE HOSPITAL at a Nurses' Station.  

                                      MEENA
                    Sir... 

                                      CHIEF 
                          (doesn't look up)
                    Leave your badge.

      Meena looks at him, stung.  Then rips it off her lab coat,
      drops it in front of him.  And keeps walking.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. EXT. TRUCK/BUMPY ROAD - NIGHT

      Hours later, middle of the night.  Our three doctors ride in
      the back of a pick-up truck driven by A LOCAL KID THAT CAN'T
      BE OLDER THAN 13, wise beyond his years, much of that wisdom
      gleaned from American t.v.  Torrential rain beats down.  

                                      MANNY
                    Hey, what's the driving age here? 

                                    KID
                    Don't worry, I work for the clinic. 

                                      MANNY
                    That's not what I asked.  
                          (beat, then)
                    I think there's vomit in my sock.

                                      MEENA
                    At least you don't have bug bites
                    between your ass cheeks.  How do
                    they even get up there?

                                    LILY
                    What did you expect?  We're in the
                    rain forest.  Being a little tired
                    and itchy...there are worse things.

      Manny and Meena stare at her for a beat with dull eyes, then - 

                                      MEENA
                    I need a nap. 

                                      MANNY
                    This doesn't look like the website. 
                    Didn't they promise us beaches?  

                                    LILY
                    Did you come for a vacation? 

                                      MANNY
                    Of course not.  I...came to make a
                      difference.  For the children.

      It's stopped raining and we're SEEING A GLORIOUS SUNRISE
      over the breathtaking jungle.  Huge orchids grow at the edge
      of the foliage, brightly colored birds chirp.

      We REALIZE the bumpy ROAD has taken us into THE TOWN OF "CRUZ
      DEL SUR".  It's quaint - colorful stucco restaurants, bars,
      a couple small hotels, women selling crafts on the street. 
      It's also the town that all tourists going on jungle tours
      have to PASS THROUGH, evidenced by the billboards and signs
      all offering different "Jungle Adventures."

      At the end of the town's main drag, bordering the jungle is
      our small brick hospital, easily the nicest building in town. 
      Lily, Manny and Meena spot a LONG LINE of PEOPLE - a mix of

                    You stay still when there's a FISH
                    INSIDE YOUR BODY!  I NEED DRUGS!

      Lily recognizes Ben, grins.  She nudges Meena and Manny.

                                    LILY
                    That's him.  That's Ben Hanley. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    What kind of crazy ass witch-doctor
                    doesn't have drugs!? 

                                    OTIS
                    The kind that survives on donations. 
                    There's a box on your way out.

                                    BEN
                    We're just gonna have to do this the
                    old fashioned way, okay? 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    Fine.  Just get it out!

      Ben takes hold of the stinger.  The Surfer freaks from pain. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER (CONT'D)
                    NO NO NO LEAVE IT IN LEAVE IT IN!  

      Otis sighs in annoyance, spots The Kid with the new doctors. 

                                    OTIS
                    Charlie, do I look like I have time?   

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'll bring 'em back later, Dr. Abbot.

                                    OTIS
                    Nah, they'll just mildew. 
                          (to the Doctors)
                    Don't just stand there.  Get in here.

      Lily, Manny and Meena drop their bags and move in.

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    Hold his shoulders, brace the leg.

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    NO!  Get off me, you assho - hey,
                    get the hell away from me -

      The Surfer struggles as Lily and Meena each grab an arm,
      Manny crouches down next to Ben, braces the leg.  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        8.

                                    BEN
                    Okay.  On one, on two --

      Suddenly, the Aussie Surfer flails an arm, KNOCKING LILY
      violently BACK against the wall.  BEN AND OTIS EXCHANGE A
      LOOK, THEN - Otis taps the Surfer's shoulder, POINTS AT BEN.

                                    OTIS
                    Hey, look at that.

      The set up works perfectly - AUSSIE SURFER TURNS DIRECTLY TO
      BEN AT THE EXACT MOMENT BEN PUNCHES HIM SQUARE IN THE FACE,
      STUNNING HIM SILENT, MAKING HIM FORGET ALL ABOUT HIS LEG.

                                    BEN
                    Sorry, mate.  

      AND THEN BEN USES THE SURFER'S SHOCK TO DEFTLY TWIST AND
      PULL THE STINGER OUT.  Blood sprays everywhere. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                        Aaaauuuuugghhhhh!!!!

      Ben rises, unfazed, holding the stingray, smiles charmingly. 

                                    BEN
                    Welcome, doctors.  You can start by
                    stitching him up.  And you...

      Ben tosses the WRIGGLING STINGRAY to the Surfer --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Put this back where you found it. 

      Off Lily, taking it all in, ready for the challenge, we...

                                                                  FADE TO TITLE CARD.

      INT. CLINIC - DAY

      Our blood-splattered newbies follow Ben through the clinic.  

                                    BEN
                    We're the only medical center within
                    three hundred miles which means we're
                    slammed all the time.  We've got
                    eight procedure rooms, two surgical
                    suites - 

                                      MEENA
                    There's no scrub room.  How do you
                    keep it sterile?  




                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        9.

                                    BEN
                    When you got a guy bitten by a ten
                    foot fer-de-lance, you get the venom
                    out - you worry about infection later. 
                          (laughs at their faces)
                    Welcome to the jungle, doctors.  We
                    got fun and games and "clean enough".
                    We don't got sterile.

      Ben keeps walking, they follow, trying to digest this.

      INT.  CLINIC - MED SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

      They enter.  MEDICAL SUPPLIES and VIALS OF DRUGS, SOME
        RECOGNIZABLY WESTERN, SOME IN WEIRD LOOKING PURE RAINFOREST
      FORM, line the shelves.  Our doctors begin exploring.  

                                    BEN
                    Our technologies are limited, but
                    that doesn't mean our options are. 
                    We're in the middle of the greatest
                    medical resource on earth - the
                    tropical rainforest.  Almost every
                    medicine they use in modern hospitals
                    comes from our backyard.  

                                      MANNY
                          (stunned, re: a vial)
                      Lidocaine?

                                    BEN
                    Local anesthetic.  Comes from the
                    coca plant.  Where'd you go to med
                    school again? 

                                      MANNY
                    I know what it is, I just stitched
                    up an eight inch puncture wound, the
                    guy was in excruciating pain and you --

                                    BEN
                    Said there's no drugs - and there's
                    not - not for puncture wounds.  We
                    have anesthesia for one out of ten
                    patients - we don't use it for
                    anything less than major surgery. 

      As they try to grasp all of this...

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Forget what you saw in med school,
                    residency - practicing tropical
                    medicine in a third world country is

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                      a different game.  The diseases they
                    told you were "cured"?  TB, malaria,
                      leprosy...they're not.  The diagnoses
                    they told you have to be made by
                    million dollar machines, the diseases
                    they told you have to be treated
                    with big pharma drugs, they don't. 
                    You guys just got out of a time
                    machine - it's 1952.  You don't have
                    high tech, you have your brain and
                    your instincts.  You're gonna have
                    to get creative, innovate.  Do that,
                    and I think you'll find practicing
                    medicine here very rewarding.  

      They all look inspired by this, especially Lily.  Ben turns
      to leave, passing Otis, who's chuckling in the doorway.  

                                    OTIS
                    A time machine?  Now you went and
                    got 'em all gooney-eyed. 

                                    BEN
                    Hey, this is our third rotation of
                    doctors in eight months.  I'm pulling
                    out all the stops.  We don't have
                    great surf like Costa Rica. 

      Ben shakes his head, leaves.  Otis approaches our doctors.

                                    OTIS
                    You all speak Spanish? 

                                      MEENA/LILY
                    French.  / French. 

                                      MANNY
                      German...and a little French. 

                                    OTIS
                    When in doubt, hand out ibuprofen.   

      Otis turns to leave.  Meena, Lily and Manny exchange a look,
      like, that's all the instruction we get?

                                      MANNY
                    Uh - Dr. Abbot, you can't expect us
                    to just jump in and work now.  We've
                    been traveling for over thirty hours. 

                                    OTIS
                    You're my plastics guy, right?

      EXT.  CLINIC - DAY

      Manny exits, sees Charlie waiting for him in the truck.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    Getting stuck with a house call on
                    your first day.  What'd you do to
                    piss off Abbot?  

                                      MANNY
                    Charlie, right?  Could you just tell
                    me how I get to the village of...um...  

      Manny tries to read something off a PIECE OF PAPER.  Then
      gives up and just shows it to Charlie.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Climb in.  I'll take you.   

                                      MANNY
                    Abbot said his patient has virulent
                    TB, I'm not gonna expose you.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    How are you going to talk to the
                    patient?  I'm a translator.   

                                      MANNY
                    How old are you?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Trece.
                          (off Manny's stare)
                    If you don't know what that means,
                    you need me. 

      Manny relents.  As he climbs into the passenger seat...

      INT. CLINIC - BREAKROOM - DAY

      A makeshift breakroom/locker room. Meena and Lily are changing
      out of their blood splattered clothes into clean ones. 
      THROUGH a WINDOW, they can see BEN'S SMALL OFFICE where Ben's
      ALSO CHANGING OUT OF HIS BLOODY CLOTHES.  Meena's openly
      staring.  Lily notices, gives her a look.

                                      MEENA
                    I'm technically a tourist here. 
                    Just taking a mental picture.  

      Lily joins Meena at the glass window, where Ben's now pulling
      off his shirt.  Lily too, gapes for a moment. 




                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        12.

                                    LILY
                    He does have quite a... career.

      Meena snorts, Lily rips her eyes away, embarrassed.

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
                    I'm serious.  He was the youngest
                    chief of surgery ever at UCLA, 
                    pioneered the fusion spine technique -
                    he was a star and then he gave it
                    all up to build this place from
                    nothing.  To help people.

                                      MEENA
                    Does he also enjoy walks on the beach
                    in the rain? 

                                    LILY
                    I'm not stalking him.  I've just
                    always wanted to meet him.

                                      MEENA
                    Most doctors I know hate the guy. 
                    They all wanted to be him, and then
                    out of nowhere he dumps his wife,
                    craps all over the American medical
                    field and takes off for the jungle
                    to drink cerveza, give a few malaria
                    shots and feel like Mother Theresa. 

                                    LILY
                    What?  That is not -- no!

      Meena shrugs, exits.  Lily follows her to - 

      INT. CLINIC - WAITING/INTAKE AREA - DAY

      Where it's still FULL OF PATIENTS waiting.  

                                    LILY
                    He's a humanitarian.  There aren't
                    many left.

                                      MEENA
                    Because there's no point.  You got a
                    cure for poverty?  Besides, if I
                    wanted to help poor people, I grew
                    up with enough of them, I didn't
                    have to go halfway around the world.

      Lily stares at her, shocked by her harshness.

                                    LILY
                    Then why are you here?

                                      MEENA
                    It's places like these where all the
                    big diseases start - hantavirus,
                    parasites that eat your brain...you
                    discover one of those, that's how
                    you help people.  Ten thousand lives
                    saved, boom.  
                          (snaps her fingers)
                    Hanley can spend the next thirty
                    years handing out aspirin to village
                    hicks, he'll never get that number.

                                    LILY
                    Wow.  You're kind of a...

                                      MEENA
                    Bitch?  Descended from a long line.

                    I was gonna say toughie, but...

      ZITA (ZEE), a LOCAL nurse in her twenties who's seen it all
      and is already over it, approaches with INTAKE FILES.  

                                    ZEE
                    You the new ones?

                    We're the Americans.

                    Oh goody, saved by the great white

                          (then)
                    I have forty intakes in the lobby
                    waiting to be seen, twenty more
                    standing in line outside and another
                    twenty waiting in a bus.  Better get
                    started before it gets busy. 

                                    LILY
                    Before? 

      Zee reads from the file at the top of the pile.

                                    ZEE
                      Forty-five year old male, stiffness,

      Meena grabs the chart and takes off.  Zee starts to hand
      Lily another chart when suddenly A LOCAL MAN bursts in, upset --

                                      LOCAL MAN 
                          (accented English)
                    There's been a car accident. 

      EXT.  CLINIC - DAY

      The Local Man, Lily and Zee rush out to find a YOUNG AMERICAN
      WOMAN, twenties, hippie type, getting out of the Man's car. 
      She's knocked up, arm bleeding, a little bruised.

                                    LILY
                    Can you tell me your name?

                                      ANNIE
                    Annie Fisher.  Don't worry about me,
                    our taxi driver got the worst of it. 

      And we SUDDENLY NOTICE that Annie's not the only one hurt -
      there's a TAXI DRIVER in the back of the car, looking CUT UP
      AND BLOODY, moaning a little.  Ben and Otis rush out.

                                    BEN
                    What happened? 

                                    ZEE
                    Car accident.  Two injured -

                                      ANNIE
                    My husband - he's still in the car,
                    we couldn't move him.  His leg looked
                    like it was broken.

                                    ZEE
                     - One still at the scene.

      As Ben rushes to get the Taxi Driver out of the car... 

                                      LOCAL MAN
                    I'll go back for him now, it's at
                    least a six hour drive, the roads
                    are flooded, driving's impossible -- 

                                    OTIS
                    You're taking a rescue team with

                    Ribcage is cracked, lung could be
                      punctured.

                                    BEN
                    Let's get him inside.

       Lily suddenly NOTICES ANNIE IS PREGNANT.

                                    LILY
                    How far along are you?  

                                      ANNIE
                    Seven months. 

                                    LILY
                          (to Zee)
                    I'm gonna need a gurney. 

                                    ZEE
                          (rolls up her sleeves)
                    You're looking at it. 

      So Lily rolls up her sleeves too and they start practically
      carrying Annie into the clinic.  Off Lily, determined to
      succeed here...

      EXT. BUMPY ROAD - DAY

      Manny and Charlie have been driving for a few hours now, the
      mid-morning sun beating down on them.  Manny wipes his brow.

                                      MANNY
                    So what kind of nightlife do you
                    guys have around here?  Where do you
                    go to...y'know, meet the ladies? 
                          (off Charlie's look)
                    Yeah, you're probably too young for
                    that. We've been driving for hours. 
                    How much further is this village?

                                      CHARLIE
                    We're done driving.  

                                      MANNY
                    Oh.  Great.

      Charlie suddenly stops the truck.  The road has BEEN WASHED
      AWAY - there's only tall grass and thick jungle foliage ahead. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Now we start walking.

      Off a less than thrilled Manny as Charlie hops out...

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Meena examines a local, middle-aged FARMER complaining of
      limb stiffness.  The Farmer's holding his right arm, speaking
      lightning fast Spanish and Meena can't understand a word. 



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        16.

                                      MEENA
                    Uh-uh, uh-uh.  Have you been in close
                    contact with sand flies?  Drunk from
                    a fresh water lake?   

      The Farmer stares blankly at her.  Meena pulls on gloves.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Sir, I want to rule out a few
                      communicable diseases so I have to
                    do a full work-up.  I'll need you to
                    take off all your clothes.  Y'know,
                    strip.  Naked.  Drop trou. 

      The Farmer looks alarmed, as Meena pantomimes stripping...

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

      Charlie leads Manny through a jungle path, dodging thick
      foliage.  A frustrated Manny struggles to keep up while not
      ruining his expensive boots in the deep puddles of mud.  

                                      MANNY
                    But you only know the stereotype. 
                    Good plastic surgery, it's an art.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    You're an artist.

                                      MANNY
                    Well, yeah. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Like Picasso.  He did many nose jobs.

                                      MANNY
                    Funny.  You're funny.  Look, it's
                    not just boobs and butts.  Plastic
                    surgery is beautiful, transformative. 
                    Makes people feel better. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Why do people have to feel better if
                    they're not sick in the first place? 

      Beat.  Manny doesn't have an answer for this one.

                                      MANNY
                    Could you slow down?  These are Armani
                    hiking boots!  

      Charlie turns around, sees Manny gingerly trying to step
      around a MUD PUDDLE.  Charlie REACHES DOWN, SCOOPS UP A BIG
      HANDFUL OF GUNKY WET MUD, DROPS IT SMACK DAB ON THE SHOES. 


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        17.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Now you can keep up.  

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Lily finishes STITCHING THE LACERATIONS ON Annie's ARM.  

                                    LILY
                    Just a few stitches, not bad at all. 
                    When was your last pre-natal exam? 

                                      ANNIE
                    Maybe five months ago?  My husband
                    tried to ship me home, he wants me
                    to have the baby in the States but I
                    hate the whole hospital scene.  I'd
                    rather pop a squat in the jungle...

      Lily smiles, moves to give Annie a gyno exam.

                                    LILY
                    What do you guys do out here?

                    spend years online dating, being
                    matched up with men "like you" -
                    same upbringing, same nationality,
                    nothing.  Then you go halfway around
                    the world...he even sings Brazilian
                    lullabyes when I can't sleep.  It's
                    so gross.  You married?

                    Sorry, I'm nosy.  But it's a great
                    place to start over.  Start fresh.

                    I'll have Dr. Hanley take a look to
                    be safe, but everything looks okay.

                    Good.  'Cause being beat up and
                    pregnant with my man stranded on the
                    side of the road... I'm trying really
                    hard not to freak out.

                    both in really good hands here.  

      Annie smiles gratefully and Lily exits.

      EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - DAY

      Charlie and a dusty Manny arrive at a village, made of
      rudimentary SHACKS with corrugated aluminum roofs.

                                      CHARLIE
                    The patient Dr. Abbot was treating
                    lives here. 

      Charlie pulls out a MASK and GLOVES.  They mask up.

      INT. SMALL VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

      They enter the one room house.  Minimally furnished, handmade
      appliances, etc.  Around the room are clearly marked separate
      'living areas' - beds, living room, with two WEAK, SICK
      CHILDREN and their FATHER listlessly resting. 

                                      MANNY
                    Oh crap. 

      Manny rushes to the children, starts examining them.  Charlie
      TRANSLATES the following to the Father while Manny speaks.  

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    They're all sick...which one was
                    Abbot treating? 

      Charlie translates, points to a cot.  A SHEET covers a body.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    That one over there.  His wife.

      Manny pulls down a corner of the sheet to reveal - a YOUNG
      WOMAN, DEAD.  And been that way for awhile.  Off Manny, we...

                                  END OF ACT ONE

      medicalling one of the kids while he has a heated argument
      (through Charlie) with the Father.  Manny is angry and so is
      the Father.  Everybody's talking over one another in a
      cacophony of English and Spanish.

                                      CHARLIE
                    He's saying he doesn't want drugs -  

                                      MANNY
                    Tell him his entire family has late-
                    stage tuberculosis, it's a bacterial
                      infection, it needs to be treated --

                                      CHARLIE
                    He's saying he doesn't want drugs. 
                    Not for him, not for the children --

      The CHILD Manny is medicalling COUGHS SOME BLOOD on the
      pillow.  Manny wipes it away, puts a damp cloth on the poor
      kid's forehead.  It's hard to look at and Manny's enraged.

                                      MANNY
                    These kids are dying!  Of a highly
                    treatable disease!  And the only way
                    to reverse the disease, the only way
                    to save his children's lives --

                                      CHARLIE
                    He's saying the medicine from Dr.
                    Abbott is what killed his wife.  

                                      MANNY
                    That doesn't make sense!

                                      CHARLIE
                    He's saying it, not me. 

                                      MANNY
                    Okay, just -- tell him antibiotics,
                    these drugs, they take time to work --

                                      CHARLIE
                    He says they made his wife worse. 
                    So he made her stop the medicine,
                    and start taking a medicinal tea ---

                                      MANNY
                    THEN IT'S HIS DAMN FAULT SHE'S DEAD!  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        20.

      And it just sits there.  Awful.  Ugly.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm not gonna say that. 

      Beat.  Manny stares at the shivering child for a long moment,
      then pulls up the thin sheet covering her and stands up.

                                      MANNY
                    Then I've done everything I can do. 

      Manny starts angrily packing up.  Charlie speaks quietly. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    What about the body?  

                                      MANNY
                    What about it?

                                      CHARLIE
                    We can't just leave it here.  It's a
                    health hazard.

                                      MANNY
                    So is treating TB with jungle tea. 
                          (off Charlie's look)
                    Where's the nearest morgue type place? 

                                      CHARLIE
                    300 kilometers. 

                                      MANNY
                    What about some kind of funeral home? 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Right next to the morgue. 

      Off Manny, realizing it's all on him...

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Otis, Ben and Zee expertly medical the Taxi Driver.  

                                    OTIS
                    Breath sounds are steady, I don't
                    see signs of internal bleeding - 

                                    BEN
                    We get tagaderm in yet? 
                          (Zee shakes her head)
                    Throw me the duct tape then. 

      As Ben begins to dress the Taxi Driver's wounds with duct -



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        21.

                                    OTIS
                    What's your take on the new shipment? 

                                    BEN
                    Little soon to tell, don't you think?

                                    OTIS
                    I got good instincts about people. 

                                    BEN
                    No, you just don't like people. 
                    There's a difference. 

                                    OTIS
                    Know what I don't like?  These kids
                    come here for a few months, green as
                    grass, they could give a crap about
                    the work, they're just padding their
                    resume with a little third world do-
                    gooding so they can go back to their
                    big careers and sleep soundly for
                    the next thirty years.  

                                    BEN
                    So let 'em.  All I need is one.  If
                    this work becomes a passion for even
                    one doctor, I can live with that.

      They work in silence for a beat, then -

                                    ZEE
                    Hundred pesos says they're all gone
                    by the end of the week. 

                                    OTIS
                    I'll get on that. 

      They laugh, Ben shakes his head, smiling.

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    We done here?  I think I saw one of
                    the rookies trying to cavity search
                      a patient. 

      The Taxi Driver moans, slipping in and out of consciousness. 

                                    BEN
                    Don't worry, your cavities are safe.

      Ben and Zee finish up as Otis exits to...

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

       - Where he interrupts Meena now doing a medical on the same
      Farmer from earlier.  He's in a gown, traumatized.  

                                    OTIS
                    Dr. Mital.  What are you doing? 

                                      MEENA
                    He presented with limb stiffness and
                    numbness.  I did a full body check
                    for lesions - I don't want to alarm
                    you but I haven't been able to rule
                    out worm induced lymphatic filariasis
                    or worst case, hemorrhagic fever.

      Otis takes this in for a moment, then turns to the Farmer
      and says something rapidfire fast in Spanish.  The Farmer
      says something back.  Otis nods, then pulls out a packet of
      IBUPROFEN from a drawer, hands them to the Farmer.  He nods
      gratefully, begins hurriedly pulling his clothes back on,
      eager to escape.  Otis turns back to Meena. 

                                    OTIS
                    Very thorough, doctor.  But sometimes
                    it's not hemorrhagic fever, it's
                    just good old-fashioned tennis elbow.

                                      MEENA
                    That's highly unlikely.  We're in
                    one of the biggest hot zones for
                      infectious disease.  How would someone
                    get tennis elbow?  From using a
                    machete or something?

                                    OTIS
                    Or from playing tennis.

      Otis heads out, amused.  Off Meena, irritated...

      Lily hovers in the doorway, working up the courage to
      interrupt Ben, who's pulling off gloves, washing his hands.

                    Do you have a second to check on my
                    patient?  The baby's stable, but
                    she's pretty worried.

                    be working for you, I've read all
                    your papers and your book on poverty
                    and global health twice -

                                    BEN
                    I don't know how you got through it
                    once, it's boring as hell. 

                                    LILY
                    Are you kidding - how you sold your
                    house for medical supplies...you
                    gave up your whole life to do this. 
                    It's such an inspiration.

      Ben shakes his head, he hates the hero-worship stuff.

                                    BEN
                    That's one way to look at it. 

                                    LILY
                    ...What's the other one?

                                    BEN
                    Just don't be so quick to model
                    yourself after me --
                          (changing the subject)
                    You always wear your hair like that?

                                    LILY
                    ...What?

                                    BEN
                    Your hair.  You always keep it up? 

                                    LILY
                    No...I mean, I don't always...why?  

      Ben suddenly reaches over and PULLS OUT LILY'S LOOSE BUN. 
      HER HAIR FALLS TO HER SHOULDERS.  It's a sexy, intimate
      gesture and Lily is a little transfixed -- UNTIL SHE SEES A
      LARGE BUG SKITTERING DOWN HER SHOULDER TO HER ARM.  

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
                    AAH!

                                    BEN
                    Wearing it up is like hanging a 'for
                    rent' sign for every nesting insect
                    in the jungle.  Over a thousand
                    species.  I'd keep it down.

                    Oh, cool, yeah.  Thanks for the tip.

      Ben goes.  Lily shakes off her revulsion, follows him.

      EXT. SMALL VILLAGE HILLSIDE - DAY

      ON THE BODY, WRAPPED IN A SHEET, NOW PLACED IN A SHALLOW
      GRAVE on a dirt-filled hillside.  REVEAL Manny standing over
      it, sweating bullets from the heat and the sheer exertion of
      lugging around a dead body.  Manny turns to Charlie.  

                                      MANNY
                    Maybe you should say something.

                    Like what? 

                                      MANNY
                    I don't know.  Something in Spanish. 
                    Like a...tribal prayer or something. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm not in a tribe. 

                                      MANNY
                    Look, I'm... I'm asking for a little
                    help here.  Okay?  I don't...I'm a
                    doctor, not an undertaker. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm a translator. 

      Beat. Manny takes a deep breath, takes one expensive Italian
      shoe, shoe-shovels a clump of dirt onto the dead body, mutters -

                                      MANNY
                    Our father who art in heaven...

      It's dark and grim.  As another clump of dirt goes flying...  

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Meena now examines the lymph nodes of an OLD LOCAL WOMAN,
      90s, who doesn't speak a lick of English. 

                                      MEENA
                    You don't have lymph node involvement,
                    so I'm gonna guess trypanosomiasis
                    is out...I don't see signs of
                    parasitic activity...  
                          (beat, then)
                    Don't tell me you play tennis.

      The Old Woman stares back at her blankly.  Meena sighs.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    It's just a cold.  A common, boring,
                      easily-treatable cold.

      INT. CLINIC - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Meena walks the Old Woman out, trying to talk to her with

                          (in terrible Spanglish)
                    Make certain...watch.  If make...fever
                    return to...here for visitation.  

      As Meena hands the Old Woman a BOTTLE OF IBUPROFEN, she
      catches Otis passing by, amused by her terrible Spanish.  

                                    OTIS
                    Look alive, doc.  Around noon we get
                    our "ebola rush." 

                                      MEENA
                    Oh, ha ha.  Hilarious.

      Meena glares at Otis as he enters a nearby exam room.  She
      turns to go, passes Otis' exam room, sees --

      INT.  CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      OTIS PREPPING A NEEDLE, THEN GIVING IT TO A DISHEVELED LOOKING
      EX-PAT GUY.  THE EX-PAT'S GOT A TUBE TIED AROUND HIS ARM,
      SHOOTS HIMSELF UP WITH THE NEEDLE.  The Ex-Pat leans back,
      takes a deep breath and closes his eyes in relief.  Meena
      stares - it looks like Otis just gave the guy a drug fix.  

                                      EX-PAT
                    Thanks, buddy.  You're a lifesaver. 

                                    OTIS
                    Anytime you need it, I'm here. 

      Off Meena, not knowing what to make of this...

      INT. CLINIC - ANNIE'S EXAM ROOM - DAY

      Ben and Lily enter to find Zee medicalling Annie, who's
        HEMORRHAGING badly.  Ben and Lily rush over.

                                    ZEE
                    She just started hemorrhaging, I
                    heard her down the hall.  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        26.

                                      ANNIE
                    Oh god, it hurts...what happening!?  

                                    BEN
                    It could be delayed trauma from the
                    accident, we're gonna do an ultrasound
                    and find out.

      Ben pulls Lily aside, as he pulls on gloves.  

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    When you gave her an exam, did you
                    use a curved speculum?
                          (off Lily's nod)
                    You might have detached her placenta. 
                    I need you to run and get gauze and
                      vicryl...as much as you can carry. 

      Lily's stunned, wants to ask questions, but Ben's already
      turned back to Annie.  So Lily runs. 

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

      Manny follows Charlie as he leads the way back to the truck
      through thick brush.  They walk in silence for a long beat.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I was just giving you a hard time
                    before.  I get it.  Plastic surgery. 

                                      MANNY
                    Yeah? 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Makes people feel good.  That's
                      something. 

      Off Manny, angry at that father, angry at himself...

      INT. CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Meena walks in, is about to pick up another CHART, when she
      SPOTS - the OLD WOMAN.  Sitting in a chair, just...waiting. 

                                      MEENA
                    You're still here?  We're all done.   

      Silence. 

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Look, you're perfectly fine.  It's
                    just a little chest congestion.  You
                    can go home now.



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        27.

      But the Old Woman doesn't move.  Meena sighs, frustrated.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Or don't.  But I have other patients. 
                    With other... pedestrian ailments.

      Meena heads back towards the Intake charts - where she almost
      bangs into Lily who is racing to the cupboard for supplies.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Geez!  Watch it! 

                                    LILY
                    Gauze!  Where's the gauze?

      As Meena helps her dig through the front cupboards... 

                                      MEENA
                    Guess what my epic discovery was
                    today that will surely change the
                    face of tropical medicine as we know
                    it?  Finding a piece of mango in a
                    kid's nose.  Or papaya, one of those. 
                    Digging fruit out of kid's orifices
                    isn't exactly what I had in mind -  

                                    LILY
                      I punctured the placenta.

                                      MEENA
                    What? 

                                    LILY
                    Of a pregnant woman!  Whose husband
                    is stranded somewhere in the jungle -
                    like she didn't have enough to worry
                      about...it's a rookie mistake, I
                    should've known better. 

                                      MEENA
                    Well, yeah.  But it's not always
                    fatal.   

      Meena finds gauze, hands it to her.  Lily stops, the
      realization hitting her.  

                                    LILY
                    Oh god, she's gonna die.  She's gonna
                    die and it's my fault... 

      Off Meena, as Lily grabs the gauze and rushes away...

                                  END OF ACT TWO

                                      ACT THREE

      INT. CLINIC - ANNIE'S EXAM ROOM - EVENING

      Ben's ultrasounding a panicked Annie, Lily's assisting.  The
        hemorrhaging has stopped - for now.

                                      ANNIE
                    Can you see anything?  Is the baby --

                                    BEN
                    Annie, you've got a placental
                    abruption - the placenta has partially
                    detached from your uterus, we need
                    to deliver as soon as possible by c-
                    section.

                                      ANNIE
                    But my husband...if we can just wait
                    for him to get here...

                                    BEN
                    Annie -

                                      ANNIE
                    I know I'm like this hardcore nature
                    chick, but I'm...not super excited
                    about being flayed open like a
                    fish...I don't wanna do it alone...

                                    BEN
                    If we wait too long there's a chance
                    the baby could start losing oxygen.  

      Annie takes this in, scared, a few tears escape.  Ben sighs.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    We can wait until dawn.  If he's not
                    here by then...  

      Annie nods, grateful.  Ben leaves --

      INT. CLINIC - OUTSIDE ANNIE'S ROOM - EVENING

      A panicked Lily close on his heels.

                                    LILY
                    Can't we airlift her out?  If she
                    could just get to a city hospital,
                    they have the equipment --




                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        29.

                                    BEN
                    The airlift's called in.  There's
                    bad weather in San Helena, they can't
                    get here until tomorrow. 

      Lily nods, trying to hide how freaked she is.  Ben sees it.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You made a mistake.  Have feelings
                    about it later.

      Lily nods again, turns to leave, passes Meena, who's got her
      bags, ready to go home for the night.

                                      MEENA
                    So I guess there's some apartment
                    upstairs we're sleeping in, probably
                      a craphole, but I've got the key so -

      But Lily doesn't answer, just keeps walking.  Meena reacts,
      then runs after Ben, who's heading to his office.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Um, Dr. Hanley, I'm Meena Mital. 

                                    BEN
                    I know who you are.  I hired you.

                                      MEENA
                    Well, maybe you don't recall my resume -
                    I'm an infectious disease specialist. 

                                    BEN
                    You're a resident, Dr. Mital.  

                                      MEENA
                    If you wanna be technical...look,
                    I'm not hating on all the sick, poor
                    people you got in here...but I've
                    been dealing with that stuff all day
                    and what I'm more interested in
                    working with is pathogens, parasites,
                    real communicable threats - 

                                    BEN
                    Most doctors who come down here find
                    that simply connecting with people
                    can be rewarding in itself.

                                      MEENA
                          (mutters)
                    Shooting up junkies I could do at
                    home.

                                    BEN
                    What did you say?

                                      MEENA
                    Nothing. 

      Meena turns to leave.  Off Ben, suddenly disturbed...

      EXT. CLINIC - NIGHT

      Otis has a smoke outside, taking in the quiet beauty of the
      nighttime jungle, the symphony of sounds... Charlie and Manny
      pull up.  Grimy and exhausted.  Otis smiles.  

                                    OTIS
                    How was your field trip, Plastics? 

                                      MANNY
                    Your patient's dead.  

      Otis takes in this news, clearly stunned.

                                    OTIS
                    I've had her on clavulanate for two
                    weeks.  Her counts were improving -

                                      MANNY
                    And then her husband stopped the
                    meds.  The whole family's got TB
                    now, he doesn't want anyone treated.

      Manny pulls a SCRAP of PAPER out of his pocket - it's like a
      wrapper from the plane or something.  Some writing on it. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know the exact procedure
                    here, in terms of AMA's and stuff,
                    so I just had the guy sign this.

      Manny hands Otis the paper.  He reads it aloud.

                                    OTIS
                    "I am refusing treatment against
                    medical advice."

                                      MANNY
                    So at least you're covered legally.

                                    OTIS
                    This is a joke, right? 

                                      MANNY
                    It's a little makeshift but I think
                    it'll do. 


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        31.

                                    OTIS
                    I mean you.  Being a doctor.  It's
                    gotta be a joke. 

                                      MANNY
                    Hey - you don't even know me -- 

                                    OTIS
                    Really?  I don't?  You drive a BMW,
                    maybe a Lexus.  You screw all your
                    patients, the pretty ones between
                    the sheets, the rest on procedures
                    that don't make 'em look a minute
                    younger, just less human.  Your
                    practice is what, eighty percent
                    covering your own ass and twenty
                    percent medicine?  Ninety, ten? 
                    That's not how it works here.  It's
                    not about how much cash you can score
                    off a quick tit job, it's about
                    helping people survive.  Some of who
                    got dealt a hell of a bad hand --

                                      MANNY
                    This isn't my fault, she was your
                    patient, she died on your watch -

      Otis flinches, but won't let Manny see it affects him.

                                    OTIS
                    I screwed up, that's on me.  But
                    today, all those children you left
                    there, that's on you -

                                      MANNY
                    So I should've forced drugs on them? 
                    What was I supposed to do?

                                    OTIS
                    YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT LIKE A DOCTOR. 
                    You're supposed to treat people.  

      Otis puts out his cigarette and gets close into Manny's face.

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    At first light tomorrow, you haul
                    your ass back there.  You save those
                    people's lives.  Every last one of
                    them.  Or don't bother coming back. 

      Off Manny, trying to resist the urge to punch him...

      INT. CANTINA - LATE NIGHT

      Right next to the clinic is a cute little hole in the wall
      cafe, which caters to tourists by day and locals at night. 
      It's a great place to hang out - there's music, a TV always
      playing int'l soccer games and it's the only place in town
      with a working AIR CONDITIONER.  Which is what Lily's sitting
      in front of when Meena enters.   

                                      MEENA
                    Some kids got a cage match going
                    outside - scorpion vs. tarantula.  I
                    put money on the spider, more legs.

      Meena pulls up a chair, sits.  Looks at Lily's watch.  

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    No wonder I can't sleep.  It's like
                    eight a.m. in New York.  Hey, share
                    the air. 

      Meena scootches her chair over so that the cool air is blowing
      on her too.  

                                    LILY
                    I read an article on this place a
                    year ago - I was so excited to come
                    here.  I studied the latest on
                    tropical diseases, I took a cultural
                      sensitivity course, I even did an
                    outward bound weekend so I could
                    survive if I got lost in the jungle. 
                    I went camping with delinquent teens! 
                    And some of those girls were scary...

                                      MEENA
                    Well, that was just stupid.

                                    LILY
                    I wanted this to work.  I thought...
                    I could be different here.  

      Just then, Manny enters, pulls up a chair, pissed.

                                      MANNY
                    I just lost a hundred pesos!  Someone
                    paid that scorpion to take a dive. 

                                      MEENA
                    Spider won?  Sweet.

                                      MANNY
                          (re: air conditioner)
                    Let me get some of that, it's hot as
                    hell.  Y'know what'd be nice right
                    now?  The BEACH they promised us.  I
                    bet it was Abbot.  Guy's a douche. 
                    Calls me a bad doctor.

                                    LILY
                    I was a bad doctor.  That's why I
                    left residency - I stopped caring. 
                    I was dragging myself through the
                    day, forgetting patients, who they
                    were, how to help them...I thought -
                    I better stop before I kill somebody. 

      Lily laughs at the irony.  Manny looks to Meena, confused.

                                      MEENA
                    She maybe killed a pregnant woman
                    today.

      Lily's laughing harder, getting a little hysterical.

                                    LILY
                    And her baby!  Don't forget the
                      baby...c'mon, it's a little funny -
                    I travel 4000 miles to murder someone
                    on the first day?  I'm not a doctor,
                    I'm an assassin! 

      Manny and Meena quietly wait for Lily to stop laughing. 
      Slowly, she does.  And then just looks so devastated.  Beat.

                                      MEENA
                    At St. Mary's, if you didn't graduate
                    from Harvard or Hopkins they didn't
                    give a crap about you.  You never
                    got on cases, I guess they figured
                    you'd weed out eventually.  So this
                    resident in my class - she started
                      moonlighting at Queens, picking up
                    E.R. shifts.  She was doing eight
                    hours in Queens, twelve hours at St.
                      Mary's...it was brutal but by the
                    end of our first year, she was killing
                    those Harvard kids in rounds.  
                          (beat, then)
                    One day after a night of moonlighting,
                    72 hours without sleep, she was on
                    the peds floor, dosing out morning
                    meds.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    She gave twelve kids the wrong
                    medicine, three went into cardiac
                    arrest, one died.  Girl got herself
                    kicked right out of residency.

      A long beat as we (not Lily or Manny yet) realize why Meena
      was fired.  

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Killing someone doesn't make you a
                    bad doctor.  It just makes you a
                    doctor.

      As the three sit in silence, taking this in...

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN - ESTABLISHING (DAY 2)

      The sun rises over the jungle.  Another gorgeous day in
      paradise.

      EXT. CLINIC - DAWN (DAY 2)

      Yawning, Manny stumbles outside, finds Charlie again waiting
      for him.  He stops, suddenly awake.

                                      MANNY
                    You knew we'd be going back.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I just --

                                      MANNY
                      Translate.  I know.  

      And they take off.

      INT. CLINIC - BEN'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Ben and Otis talk quietly but heatedly.  

                                    BEN
                    I want to know what she meant. 

                                    OTIS
                    How long is it gonna take for you to
                    trust me?  Another year, another
                    five?  
                          (shakes his head)
                    You don't get it, you've never done
                    anything wrong in your life, you're
                    goddamn Ghandi -

                          (darkly)
                    You know that's not true.

                                    OTIS
                    I screwed up.  I let you down.  But
                    you never let me forget it. 

      Otis suddenly notices Lily standing in the doorway, her arms
      full of extra blood bags.   

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    I'll prep the O.R. 

      Otis pushes past Lily out the door.  Ben looks at Lily.

                                    BEN
                    You got blood.  Did you get any sleep? 

                                    LILY
                          (shakes her head no,
                            then)
                    Annie's husband, is he...

                                    BEN
                    No word yet.  
                          (beat, then)
                    C'mon, let's go deliver a baby.  

      INT. CLINIC - O.R. - DAY

      Zee rushes around in the b.g., preparing for the C.  Lily
      gets Annie settled on the table.  Otis approaches.

                                    OTIS
                    Annie, I'm giving you a shot of
                      epibatidine in your belly.  It's an
                    extremely diluted form of the venom
                    of a frog we have down here - 

                                      ANNIE
                    You're shooting me up with...frog?

                                    OTIS
                    The epibatidine is the closest thing
                    we have to an anesthesia block. 

                                    LILY
                    Like nature's epidural.

                                    OTIS
                    Not quite as effective, but yeah.

      But Annie's panicking now.  As Otis moves to inject her...

                                      ANNIE
                    I can't believe Ali hasn't called
                      or...something's wrong.  He should
                    be here by now.

                                    LILY
                    There's no cell service and with the
                    roads flooded, they probably...

                                      ANNIE
                    It's been hours and hours, Lily. 
                    Even if they had to carry him and
                    walk, they'd be here - something is
                    wrong! I changed my mind, I don't
                    want to do this - I wanna wait 'til
                    we hear something -

                                    LILY
                    Annie -

                                      ANNIE
                    I can't do this without him...please,
                    just STOP!  Get me out of here! 

      Ben's in the doorway. Hearing this, he calmly approaches.

                                    BEN
                    The rescue team just radioed in,
                    they'll be here within the hour. 
                    They had to stop for the night.

                                      ANNIE
                    What about my husband, is he - 

                                    BEN
                    His leg is fractured in six places,
                    I'm guessing he's not the happiest
                    camper right now, but he'll be fine. 

      Lily and Annie both breathe a huge sigh of relief. 

                                    LILY
                    So Ali will be here just in time to
                    meet his new baby. 

                                      ANNIE
                    I am going to murder that man for
                    getting out of this.

                                    LILY
                    Maybe let us cast his leg first.

                                      ANNIE
                    Okay, but then murder.

      Lily and Annie smile, connected.  The O.R. resumes...

      EXT. SMALL VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

      A sweaty, dusty Manny and Charlie arrive, once more, at the
      family's house.  They glove and mask up once more.

                                      CHARLIE
                    So pretty much what you did yesterday. 
                    'Cause that worked. 

                                      MANNY
                    You're a little bully, you know that? 
                    And they call us imperialists...

      Manny pushes through the front door.  As Charlie follows...

      INT. CLINIC - SURGERY ROOM - DAY

      Ben, Otis, Zee and Lily are in the middle of Annie's C-
      section.  Tense.  Quiet.  Not a lot of beeping machines -
      things are being done by hand.  Lily holds Annie's hand.

                                    BEN
                    Cutting through the uterine wall -  

                                    OTIS
                      Placenta's holding steady.  You're
                    gonna feel some pressure now, Annie.

                                      ANNIE
                    Oh god...I can feel it pulling...

                                    LILY
                    It's okay.  It's gonna be okay.
                          (quiet, to Zee)
                    She can feel it.  She needs more of
                    the epibatidine.

                                    ZEE
                    It's a toxin, we can't give her more. 

                                    BEN
                    The placenta's in the way.  Hang
                    another bag of blood, Zee.

                                    OTIS
                    One more big pull, okay, Annie --

      Annie SCREAMS IN PAIN as Otis and Ben lift the PREEMIE BABY
      OUT - it's way too blue, way too small, and way too quiet.

                                    LILY
                    Annie, it's a girl.

                                      ANNIE
                    Is she...  Can I see her? 

      Otis hands the baby girl to Ben and Zee, who start breathing
      into her premature lungs with a MAKESHIFT VENTILATOR.  

                                    BEN
                          (quietly, to Zee)
                    Breath sounds shallow, pulse rapid... 

                                      ANNIE
                    What's wrong...why isn't she crying...

      Annie's eyes start to roll back, she's passing out. 

                                    LILY
                    She's losing consciousness!

                                    OTIS
                    The placenta's ruptured.  She's
                      hemorrhaging -- hang another bag --

                                    LILY
                    This is the last one. 

                                    OTIS
                    She's going through it too fast.  

                                    LILY
                    Can we do FFP or autotransfuse -

                                    OTIS
                    This isn't Mayo, we don't have it -  

                                    BEN
                    Switch from BA to O neg -

                                    OTIS
                    I've only got a couple left.

      Ben thinks fast, the pressure mounting.  He makes a decision.  

                                    BEN
                          (to Zee, re: baby)
                    Keep her lungs open and bp stable.

      Zee nods.  Ben turns back to Otis, re: Annie.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Switch from saline to LR, and make
                    this bag last as long as possible.
                          (to Lily)
                    You - come with me. 

      And Ben runs out.  And Lily follows.  

      INT. CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Meena walks a patient out, a YOUNG LOCAL WOMAN. 

                                      MEENA
                    Stay on the antibiotics, come back
                    if it doesn't heal, okay? 

      Meena turns to grab a CHART, sees the Old Woman there.  Back,
      again.  Sitting in the same spot she was yesterday.   

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Oh for the love of God.

      She crosses over to her, annoyed. 

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    You're back?  I told you it's just a
                    virus, there's nothing I can -

      The Old Woman lifts her head and WE SEE SHE'S GASPING FOR
      BREATH, HER FACE BLUE.  She collapses on the floor.  Meena
      starts CPR, shouts to a LOCAL ND CLINIC STAFFER NEARBY.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Crap!  She's in anaphylaxis.  Get me
                      epinephrine -  an epi shot -

      Meena mimes stabbing the epi in the leg.  The Staffer runs...

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    AND DON'T TELL ME WE DON'T HAVE IT!

      EXT. CLINIC - JUNGLE AREA - DAY

      Ben's quickly pushing through the jungle foliage, skillfully
      ducking leaves and branches.  Lily struggles to keep up.   

                                    BEN
                    The milk from young, green coconuts
                    has an electrolyte balance close to
                    blood plasma - under a scope they're
                      identical.  In World War Two, they
                    used it when they ran out of fluids.

                                    LILY
                    But she's hemorrhaged so much already,
                    how's she gonna drink enough to -

                                    BEN
                    She's not gonna drink it. 

                                    LILY
                    You're gonna put coconut milk in her
                    veins!? 

                                    BEN
                    We could go door to door for blood
                    donations but that'd take a while.

                                    LILY
                    Won't it kill her?

                                    BEN
                    She'll need a transfusion later but
                    it's our best shot to get her stable. 
                    Don't worry, I've done this more
                    than any other guy down here.   

      They reach some TALL COCONUT TREES.  Lily's flabbergasted.

                                    LILY
                    You have?  How many times?

                                    BEN
                    Once. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.  Great. 

                                    BEN
                    Hope you played little league.

                                    LILY
                    What?  Why? 

                                    BEN
                    I throw, you catch.

      And as Lily watches, stunned, BEN TAKES A FLYING LEAP UP AND
      BEGINS TO CLIMB THE COCONUT TREE.  AND WE...

                                  END OF ACT THREE

                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. CLINIC - JUNGLE AREA - DAY

      Ben reaches the top of the tree - he's at least THIRTY FEET
      UP.  Lily's on the ground, breathless, petrified.  

                                    BEN
                    You ready for this?

      No.  But Lily nods anyway, holds her arms out to catch it. 
      Ben starts to drop it, hesitates, suddenly a little nervous. 

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You can't miss, okay?  You gotta
                    catch it when I drop it. 

                                    LILY
                    I know.  If it breaks, it's unsterile. 

                                    BEN
                    Yeah, that's one of the reasons. 

                                    LILY
                    What's the other? 

                                    BEN
                    If it hits you in the head from this
                    height, you're pretty much dead. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.   

                                    BEN
                    Okay, one...two...

      And it's so tense, both Lily and Ben sweating it out...

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Three.

      And Ben drops it, it WHOOSHES down...and against all odds,
      Lily CATCHES it.  Ben breathes a huge sigh of relief. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh my god!  I did it! 

                                    BEN
                    Good job.  Let's go for another...

      The SECOND ONE DROPS.  Lily fumbles, BARELY catches this
      one.  Ben winces.  Lily laughs, giddy with adrenaline.

                                    LILY
                    Hey, I rock at this!  I'm all like,
                    Willie Mays basket catch --

      Ben shakes his head, tries to hide a smile.

                                    BEN
                    Brenner. 

                                    LILY
                    Yes?

                                    BEN
                    We have ten more to go.  Keep it
                    together.

      As Lily's quickly nods...

      INT. CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Meena is still doing CPR on the Old Woman.  A SMALL CROWD of
      PATIENTS and a few NURSES have gathered, watching her work.  

                                      MEENA
                    C'mon, breathe...breathe...

      The ND Staffer runs back with AN INJECTION, SPEAKING FAST IN
      SPANISH.  Meena's panicking.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    I have no idea what you're saying,
                    just give it to me!

      And Meena YANKS UP THE OLD WOMAN'S DRESS AND PLUNGES THE
      NEEDLE INTO HER THIGH.  And then waits.

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    COME ON, LADY, BREATHE ALREADY!

      Another tense beat and then suddenly...she does.  And so
      does Meena.  As a COUPLE STAFFERS help the woman to sit...

      INT.  CLINIC - SUPPLY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Meena slams the door behind her and slumps to the ground,
      shaking like a leaf.  She almost killed someone again.

      INT. SMALL VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

      Manny tends to the KIDS, one of them barely conscious now,
      woozy and feverish.  He's doing what he can medically for
      them, while he argues through Charlie with the Father.

      That was to the Father.  Manny takes a beat, trying to get
      control of himself, sweaty and incredibly frustrated.

                    telling him all how to run things. 
                    I'm not from your neighborhood.  I
                    don't get to just come in here and
                    tell you what to do, ask you to take
                    drugs you have no good reason to
                    believe in. 

      Manny glances up, the man's face is still unreadable,
      impassable.  Charlie has stopped translating and is just
      listening - cause now it seems like Manny's just babbling.

                    My Dad died of mesothelioma - it's a
                    nasty cancer, one of the worst. 
                    Kills you slowly and painfully, one
                    organ at a time.  They didn't have a
                    clue how to treat it back then, we
                    still don't.

                    Me, I'm a little smart-ass kid, and
                    I tell myself these clowns are
                    jerkoffs - when I'm a doctor someday,
                    I'll know how to help people.  I'll
                    know how to fight.  

      Manny shakes his head.

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Now I suck fat out of people's asses
                    and put it in their boobs.  I re-
                    arrange people's fat.  So I'm here. 
                    In your neighborhood, to do...
                      something.  To do better.  
                          (beat)
                    Also the New York medical board just
                    pulled my license.  "Ethical
                      misconduct" - or so they claim.
                          (beat, then admits)
                    Okay, so I pushed a few unnecessary
                      procedures here and there...slept
                    with a few too many patients... maybe
                    I'm a bad guy.  But I'm not a bad
                    doctor.   

      Manny crouches next to the Father, looks him in the eye.

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    And I don't want you to have to watch
                    your family die.  C'mon, man.  Just
                    let me help you. 

      A long pause.  Charlie translates only this last part,
      quietly, emotionally.  Then Manny gets up, feeling stupid --- 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Now I'm the ass talking to myself.

       -- When suddenly the Father holds out his hand to Manny. 
      Manny looks to Charlie, confused.  The Father says something
      in Spanish.   

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    What is he doing? 

                                      CHARLIE
                    He's trying to shake your hand.  He
                    says okay.

      As a stunned Manny shakes the Father's hand...

      INT. CLINIC - O.R. - DAY

      Lily and Ben burst in, carrying ARMFULS OF COCONUTS.  We SEE
      the baby's in a MAKESHIFT INCUBATOR as Zee manually inflates
      her lungs.  Otis is medicalling Annie, who's in bad shape. 

                                    OTIS
                    BP's in the gutter.  There's nothing
                    more to push -- she's bleeding out.  

                                    BEN
                    Get me an IV.

                                    LILY
                    Do you want me to drain one into a - 

      Otis tosses Ben an IV, and Ben quickly JAMS it DIRECTLY INTO
      A COCONUT, "hangs" it and inserts the needle into Annie's
      vein.  Lily's stunned. 

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
                    ...Or that works.

      COCONUT MILK begins flowing into Annie's body.  Ben starts
      sewing the placenta.  As Lily watches, awestruck...

      MATCH FROM ANNIE'S IV TO --

      INT. VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

      THE CHILDREN'S IVS, as Manny hooks the kids up to makeshift
      IV poles, which are wooden stakes with clothespins holding
      the lines.  Injecting life-saving meds into their veins. 

      In the B.G., Charlie watches, his expression unreadable. 
      Charlie turns and SLIPS OUT the front door, unnoticed...  

      INT. CLINIC - O.R. - DAY

      Ben works on Annie's bleeding, Otis does manual CPR. 

                                    OTIS
                    BP's touch and go.  I've got some
                      arrythmias. 

      Ben glances to Lily, standing at the sidelines.

                                    BEN
                    I need another hand to hold the last
                    bleeder while I tie it off.

                                    LILY
                    Me?  But I'm not a surgeon, you need
                    a surgeon --


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        46.

      Ben turns to her, speaking calmly, but intensely.

                                    BEN
                    Here, you are a surgeon.  Here you're
                      a surgeon, you're a social worker,
                    you're a midwife - if I need you to
                    run labs to the city, you're FedEx -
                    you are anything I need you to be
                    and what I need right now is for you
                    to stop over-thinking it and give me
                    your hand.

      And he's so intense that Lily doesn't think - she pulls on
      GLOVES and literally gives Ben her hand.  Ben places it in
      Annie's open abdomen, shows her what to do. 

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Keep a steady squeeze - don't pinch 
                    off the vessel.  Good.

      Lily looks up at Ben, stunned and exhilarated - she's hasn't
      felt like this, felt like a doctor, for a long, long time. 
      She's having a moment and Ben knows exactly what it is.  

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You're doing fine, Dr. Brenner.

                                    OTIS
                    BP's coming up. 

      Ben smiles.  Lily smiles back.  As the two lock eyes...

      EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - DAY

      Charlie and Manny get back into the truck, on their way out. 
      Manny's feeling great, proud of what he accomplished. 

                                      MANNY
                    I just saved the lives of an entire
                    family.  No, y'know what - make that
                      a village, cause that crap's
                      contagious, yo -   

      Manny holds his fist out for a dap, then SEES SOMETHING. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Hey - stop --

      And we SEE what he sees - the shallow grave they put the
      body in yesterday is now nicely shoveled in.  At the top
      there is a cross made out of wildflowers.  Manny eyes Charlie. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Thought you were just a "translator".

      Charlie doesn't answer.  Doesn't want to discuss it.  Manny
      knows not to tease him further.  It sits there a beat, then -- 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.  For everything.  You're
                    good.  Maybe someday you'll translate
                    for the WHO or the U.N... 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I don't think so.

                                      MANNY
                    Why not, dream big.  Your parents
                    must be really proud of you.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I left home when I was nine.  And
                    someday I'm not going to be a
                      translator,  I'm going to be a doctor. 

      That shuts Manny up.  Charlie guns the engine.

      INT. CLINIC - SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

      Otis enters, pulling off his scrub mask, finds Meena there,
      still shaking, her face tear-stained.  She quickly turns
      around when he enters, wipes a few remaining tears.    

                                    OTIS
                    You okay? 

                                      MEENA
                    If I could find a damn steroid around
                    here...a woman almost died - from a
                    stupid asthma attack - and there's
                    nothing here to help her!  This place,
                    is...it's pointless. 

      Meena shoves past Otis out of the supply room.  Off Otis,
      knowing there's more to it than that...

      INT. CLINIC - BREAK ROOM - DAY

      Meena enters, grabs her purse from a shelf, digs through it,
      until she pulls out --

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      HER OWN ASTHMA INHALER.  Which she's now holding as she talks
      to the OLD WOMAN, who's resting, recovering.  The ND Clinic
      Staffer, who helped her earlier, translates.

                                      MEENA
                    You have untreated asthma, you had a
                    severe attack.  I didn't see it before
                      because...well, I didn't see it.  

      Beat.  

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    This is an inhaler - to help you
                    breathe.  

      Meena places it in her mouth, gives her a PUMP.  The WOMAN'S
      EYES GO WIDE.  SHE STARES AT MEENA, SUDDENLY BREATHING EASY. 

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    I wish I could give you more, but I
                    only have a few, I brought them from
                    home.  I have asthma too. 

      The Old Woman grabs Meena's hands, so grateful.  

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    Really, it's... no big deal.      

      Uncomfortable, Meena quickly leaves.

      INT. CLINIC - RECOVERY ROOM - EVENING

      Later.  Annie's coming to, woozy.  Lily helps Ben check
      Annie's incision and nearby, the BABY rests bedside in the
      little makeshift incubator, Zee attending to her. 

                                      ANNIE
                    What happened?  Is the baby --

                                    LILY
                    She's right here.

                                    ZEE
                    Her breath sounds are getting
                    stronger.

                                      ANNIE
                    How's Ali?  Is he here, is he okay?

                                    BEN
                    Annie, listen to me.  We don't have
                    a NICU here, we don't have the
                    equipment to keep your baby warm, to
                    keep her heart rate up - 

      Annie notices Ben's evading the question.

                    The airlift should be here soon, but
                    right now the best thing for your
                    baby is to be with you, she needs to
                    be held and fed --

                    Dr. Hanley, Where is my husband!? 

      Beat.  Ben has no other choice but to tell her.

                                    BEN
                    Annie, your husband didn't make it. 
                    When our team got to him, he was
                    already gone.  I'm so sorry. 

      Annie's stunned.  So is Lily - this is news to her too.

                                    LILY
                    But you said they radioed in...

      Ben pauses, this isn't easy for him to say.

                                    BEN
                    They did radio.  And he did have a
                    broken leg.  He also had a hematoma. 
                    Bleeding in his brain.  He must have
                    hit his head during the accident.  

      Lily's staring at Ben, realizing he was lying in the O.R.

                                      ANNIE
                    No, no - he was fine when I left, he
                    didn't even say his head hurt...

                                    BEN
                    It probably didn't.  These type of
                    injuries don't show symptoms at first. 

                                      ANNIE
                    But I left him there, I just left
                    him sitting there.  I could've been
                    with him!  He was alone on the side
                    of the road...why didn't I stay...

                                    BEN

                    GO AWAY!!  GO AWAY!  Oh god...he's
                    coming back...he's coming back....

      Her grief is awful to watch.  A shaken Lily slowly backs out
      of the room, having an intense reaction.

      INT. CLINIC - INTAKE AREA - NIGHT

      Meena and Manny are still taking intakes.  They stare as
      Lily whirls on Ben, who has followed her out.

                                    LILY
                    When did you find out?  

                                    BEN
                    Hours ago.  He never had a chance. 

                                    LILY
                    She could've said goodbye...you didn't
                    even give her the choice.

                                    BEN
                    There was no choice.  He was dead. 
                    If she left, her baby'd be dead too.

                                    LILY
                    You lied to her, said he was fine -   

                                    BEN
                    Because that's what she needed to
                    hear!  That was the only thing that
                    was gonna get her through surgery.  
                    If you can't stomach that, if you
                    wanna practice safe, predictable
                    medicine, go home.  I'm not here to
                    protect you or save you.

      Ben looks to Manny and Meena who have heard the whole thing. 

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    There's a helicopter leaving for San
                    Helena tonight.  If any of you can't
                    handle this, I suggest you get on
                    it. 

      Ben walks away.  Off Lily, shattered, we...

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. CLINIC - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

      Lily shoves her wet clothes from this morning into her duffel
      bag.  Packing.  Leaving.  Done.  Meena enters.  Beat.

                                      MEENA
                    That was quick.  We haven't even
                    been here forty-eight hours.

      Silence.  More packing. 

                                      MEENA (CONT'D)
                    He was right.  What's your problem?  

      Lily stops packing, doesn't look at her.  A long beat. 

                                    LILY
                    My husband, Danny...he was a cyclist. 
                    On Sunday mornings he would always
                    ride while I made breakfast.  One
                    Sunday last year he was taking just
                      forever...he went on long rides all
                    the time.  Said it cleared his head. 
                    So I showered, read the paper, did
                    the crossword...half of it.  
                          (beat, then)
                      A neighbor found him a block away on
                    the asphalt.  Some artery just
                      went...poof.  I heard the ambulance
                    go by from the kitchen, didn't even
                    occur to me...I was scrambling eggs
                    like an idiot.  He was a block away,
                    dying on the street.  And I was
                      scrambling eggs.  Some doctor, right?

      And now Meena understands Lily's reaction to what Annie's
      been through, why medicine lost its meaning, why she left
      residency.  

                                      MEENA
                    So you're just gonna bail.  Like you
                    did on residency. 

                                    LILY
                    You heard what Hanley said - what it
                    takes to be here... I'm not cut out
                    for it.  I'm not ready to...I'm not
                    ready to feel like this. 

                                      MEENA
                    When are you ever gonna be?

      Meena leaves.  Off Lily, taking this in...

      EXT. CLINIC - LAB - NIGHT

      A makeshift lab where you spin blood with hand centrifuges. 
      Manny approaches Zee, who's doing just that with some samples.

                                      MANNY
                    Hey, I've got some labs for you. 

                                    ZEE
                    We don't "run labs", we spin the
                    blood down with a hematocrit
                      centrifuge, old school style.  And
                    by we, I mean you. 

                                      MANNY
                    Oh, okay, I didn't mean to -

                                    ZEE
                    Assume because I'm "one of the
                    natives" I'm at your beck and call?

                                      MANNY
                    Uh, no -

                                    ZEE
                    Because I'm a woman then. 

                                      MANNY
                    No! 

                                    ZEE
                    You got a thing against nurses? 

      To Manny's extreme relief, Otis enters. 

                                    OTIS
                    You get blood samples? 

                                      MANNY
                          (quick look to Zee)
                    I was just about to spin them down
                    now.  All by myself.  I was thinking
                    I'd go back tomorrow, check their
                    counts but they're all on antibiotics
                    now, so...that's good.

      Manny waits for some praise, but Otis just turns to leave.  

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Ass hat.

                                    OTIS
                          (stops, amused)
                    What did you call me?

                                      MANNY
                    ASS HAT.  I called you an ass hat. 
                    I've been busting my balls for two
                    days, I walked miles in three hundred
                    degree weather, got a sunburn, I
                    trashed my boots, would it kill you
                    to give me a little respect!?

                                    OTIS
                    I'll respect you when you do something
                    deserving of respect.  Today?  You
                    just did your job. 

      And Otis walks out, leaving Manny standing there.  Beat. 
      Then he looks down at the centrifuge, completely helpless. 

                                      MANNY
                    This thing come with directions or...  

      Zee taps a PAPER WITH SPANISH WRITING on the wall.

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Those are in Spanish. 
                          (off her look, quickly)
                    Y'know what, I'll figure it out.

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - NIGHT

      Lily enters, picks up the PREEMIE BABY.  Annie's staring off
      into space, emotionally spent.  Lily sits by her bed.  Beat.   

                                    LILY
                    I know.  You lost someone you loved. 
                    You lost the person you were gonna
                    spend the rest of your life with. 
                    And when that happens, you just...end. 
                    You have no idea why you're on the
                    planet anymore...you're just taking
                    up space, you don't belong anywhere.  

      Lily's speaking emotionally, clearly from personal experience. 
      Annie turns to face Lily, tears streaming down her face. 

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
                    I know you're not ready to deal with
                    this, but you're never gonna be. 
                    It's never gonna make sense...but
                    what does...what makes perfect sense
                    right now is your baby.  
                                      (MORE)

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
                    And I don't know about tomorrow, but
                    maybe now...you're supposed to be
                    here to take care of her.  And maybe
                    I'm supposed to be here to tell you
                    that. 

                                      ANNIE
                    I'm alone.  I'm twenty-five and...a
                      widow...you have no idea...

                                    LILY
                    Yeah.  I do. 

      Annie looks at her, surprised, but Lily remains silent.  A
      long beat.  Then Lily slowly moves and places the preemie
      baby in Annie's arms.  And Annie holds her daughter.  Annie
      starts to breastfeed then looks up at Lily, terrified, lost --

                                      ANNIE
                    I don't know how to do this. 

                                    LILY
                    I'll show you. 

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Ben standing in the doorway, watching,
      his face unreadable, as Lily helps Annie breastfeed her baby. 

      EXT.  CLINIC - PATIO - NIGHT - LATER

      Meena and Manny sit on an adorable little patio on the
      clinic's tropical lawn, drinking beers.  Manny and Meena are
      watching as IN THE DISTANCE, Ben, Otis and MEDICS take Annie
      and her baby into the MEDIVAC HELICOPTER.  Lily plops down.  

                                    LILY
                    There's no way I'm getting on that
                    dinky little plane again.

      Meena smiles, gets it.  Nothing more has to be said, their
      friendship is established.  Manny offers Lily a beer.

                                      MANNY
                    I found beer in the lab.  You gotta
                    spin down your own blood, but you
                    can drink beer while you do it.

                                    LILY
                    It's warm. 

                                      MANNY
                      Everything's warm here.  Except the
                    showers.  And that guy.  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        55.

      He nods to Otis, who's stepping back with Ben as THE
      HELICOPTER WHIRS TO LIFE. 

                                    LILY
                    I guess this is it. 

                                      MEENA
                    Last call for civilization. 

                                      MANNY
                    So much for that beach.     

      But nobody moves.  They just watch the helicopter take off. 
      Lily spots BEN walking off, away from the clinic, towards
      the trees.  She makes a decision, stands up, follows him. 

                                    LILY
                    I'll be right back.

                                      MANNY
                    Careful, it's a jungle out there.  
                          (off Meena's eye roll)
                    Get used to it, I'm gonna use that
                    one a lot.

      Just then, the Old Woman and HER DAUGHTER approach.  The Old
      Woman's clutching the inhaler, holding it like a precious
      gem.  The Daughter holds a STRAW BAG, speaks accented English. 

                                      DAUGHTER
                    You're the one who treated my mother?

                                      MEENA
                    I'm sorry.  That she had to...almost
                    die to get my attention.

                                      DAUGHTER
                    My mother is 90 years old.  And 
                    today she took her first breath. 
                    She said because of you she finally
                    knows what it feels like to...breathe.

      The Daughter reaches into the bag and pulling out a LARGE
      CHICKEN.  A LIVE ONE.  WRIGGLING AND CLUCKING.

                                      DAUGHTER (CONT'D)
                    Thank you for saving her life. 

                                      MEENA
                    Ohhhhh no - no, no, no, please --
                    that's so kind, but very unnecessary --

      But the Daughter's pressing the chicken firmly into Meena's
      arms.  The Old Woman smiles at Meena, tears in her eyes.


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        56.

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    Gracias, doctora. 

      And she's so clearly moved and grateful that Meena can't
      possibly say no.  So she pastes a smile on her face. 

                                      MANNY
                          (as the chicken)
                    Meena, will you be my Mommy?

      As Meena glares at a laughing Manny - 

      EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

      It's mysterious at night, full of strange, exotic sounds. 
      Lily finds Ben sitting against a tree, looking at the sky.     

                                    LILY
                    She fed her baby.  Before she left.
                      Just...thought you should know. 

      Ben doesn't say anything.  So Lily turns to leave, then -

                                    BEN
                    You ever seen the Southern Cross? 

      Ben points up to the night sky.  Clear and vibrant, full of
      bright stars, the way we never get to see it in Los Angeles.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Right there, those five stars...they
                    say Magellan used it to find true
                    south when he got lost.  And it gave
                    him the strength to keep going. 

                                    LILY
                    I didn't get on the helicopter. 

                                    BEN
                    I see that. 

                                    LILY
                    I was going to.  Because everything
                    you said you don't want, that's me. 
                    You need doctors who are heroes,
                    like you - 

                                    BEN
                          (sharply)
                    Heroes take risks because they have
                    nothing else to live for. 

      Lily takes that in, knowing he's talking about himself,
      wondering what the hell happened to this guy.  


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        57.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You don't have to be a hero.  Just
                    be a doctor who gives a crap.  

                                    LILY
                    Okay. 

      Lily notices Ben is suddenly moving towards her slowly,
      calmly, almost...seductively.

                                    BEN
                    Don't... move. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.  Look, I'm in a strange
                      environment...not to mention I'm not
                    exactly ready for...it's not that I
                    don't find you attractive...you've
                    got that whole Indiana Jones jungle
                    vibe going on which is...  I don't
                      think...you should kiss me.

      Ben's now almost lip to lip with Lily, looking into her eyes. 

                                    BEN
                    No?

      Just as Lily closes her eyes in anticipation, Ben SUDDENLY
      REACHES BEHIND HER HEAD AND WITH ONE DEFT JERK PULLS OUT A
      LONG SNAKE, its tail thrashing about wildly.  Ben THROWS IT
      INTO THE TREES.  Color drains from Lily's face.

                                    LILY
                    You said HAIR DOWN!  YOU SAID HAIR
                    DOWN, NO NESTING!!

                                    BEN
                    That's insects.  Snakes like long
                    hair. 
                          (turns to go, then)
                    And if I was gonna kiss you?  Believe
                    me, you'd know it. 

      And Ben walks off.  Off Lily, not sure what to be afraid of -
      the snake or her attraction to her new boss...

      INT. CLINIC - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

      Otis is closing up shop.  Meena walks by him, holding her
      chicken at arms length.  Without looking at her, Otis calls.

                                    OTIS
                    It was saline, by the way.



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        58.

                                      MEENA
                    What?

                                    OTIS
                    What you saw yesterday.  Recovering
                    addicts crave the needle even if
                    there's nothing in it.  

      Meena shrugs, playing nonchalant, but she's curious cause
      he's clearly speaking from experience.  Before she can ask -

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    What'd you do for the bird?

                                      MEENA
                    Nothing.  Gave that woman an inhaler. 
                    From my purse.  

                                    OTIS
                    Wasn't nothing to her. 

                                      MEENA
                    What's she gonna do when it's out? 
                    I can't go back to the States and
                    get her a prescription.  She'll be
                    okay for a month and then...it's a
                    band-aid, it's not a solution.

                                    OTIS
                    Well.  It was today.

      Meena considers this for a moment, wanting to let herself
      have the victory, but she just...can't.  She turns to leave...

                                      MEENA
                    I came here to do big things, okay? 
                    Things that save thousands of lives,
                    not just one or two...so.   

                                    OTIS
                    Man, you must've done something bad.

                                      MEENA
                          (freezes)
                    What? 

                                    OTIS
                    Why else would you be so guilty?

      Beat.  Meena keeps walking, holds up her chicken.

                                      MEENA
                    My chicken's giving you the finger.



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        59.

      Otis smiles, intrigued despite himself.  Then quickly wipes
      the smile from his face before anyone sees. 

      INT. CLINIC APARTMENTS - NIGHT

      The living arrangements -- a no frills, basic, dorm-like,
      three bedroom apartment above the clinic.  Meena is sitting
      on the floor, holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE, watching her
      CHICKEN cluck around in circles in the makeshift pen they
      built out of boxes.  Manny shuffles out in his pajamas. 

                                      MANNY
                    Here's a tip - you gotta put water
                    in the toilet before you flush. 
                    Learned that one the hard way. 

                                      MEENA
                    Having to live with you is cruel and
                    unusual punishment.

                                      MANNY
                    You'll change your mind when you
                    taste my roast chicken.  You gonna
                    kill that thing or what?  

                                      MEENA
                    She's not a "thing" - she has a name. 
                    Her name is..."Dinner." 
                          (beat)
                    Dinner dies tomorrow. 

      Lily shuffles out in her pajamas. 

                                    LILY
                    Anyone have scissors? 

      INT. CLINIC APARTMENTS - BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Lily looks at herself in the mirror for a long beat, scissors
      in hand.  Then she takes it to her hair and starts cutting. 

      INT. CLINIC APARTMENTS - MOMENTS LATER

      Lily emerges from the bathroom, HER HAIR CHOPPED OFF.  

                                      MEENA
                    Holy haircut.

                                    LILY
                    Let's go find what we were promised. 





                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        60.

      EXT.  CLINIC - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

      Ben comes outside to find Otis sitting there, smoking.  Ben
      pours both of them whiskeys, sets one down in front of Otis.

                                    BEN
                          (re: smoking)
                    You gotta cut that crap out.  You're
                    a doctor, for godsakes.  

                                    OTIS
                    This is so good for me it might as
                    well be a carrot stick. 

                                    BEN
                    How's that?

                                    OTIS
                    It keeps me from jamming a needle
                    full of something worse in my arm. 
                    Which I haven't in a long time. 

      Ben looks at Otis for a beat.  Makes the decision to trust
      him.  No more questions.  He raises his whiskey glass.

                                    BEN
                    To clean living. 

      It's an apology and Otis accepts, toasts Ben's glass with
      his cigarette. 

                                    OTIS
                    To those we've lost. 

                                    BEN
                    To those we've...

      But Ben can't finish the sentence.  His face is pained,
      haunted.  Otis sees it, immediately regrets his words.

                                    OTIS
                    Sorry.  

      But Ben just tosses his whiskey back and immediately pours
      another.  Doesn't want to talk about it.  A long beat.  And
      then Zee steps out onto the porch, beer in hand, points to
      OUR THREE DOCTORS WALKING ACROSS THE LAWN IN THE DISTANCE,
      HOLDING FLASHLIGHTS, HEADING TOWARDS THE JUNGLE. 

                                    ZEE
                    What the hell are those zonzos doing? 




                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        61.

                                    OTIS
                    Getting themselves killed.  Hundred
                    pesos says the bitchy one's anaconda
                    lunch.  

      Zee follows Otis' gaze to see he's watching Meena.  Maybe a
      little too intently.  Zee's a little hurt, looks away.

                                    BEN
                    Now that bet I might take. 

      As the three laugh...

      EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

      Meena, Manny and Lily tromp through jungle brush.

                                      MANNY
                    There are animals out here.  Big
                    ones with teeth.  Don't say they're
                    more scared of us then we are of
                    them - I guarantee I'm a bigger pansy
                    than the two hundred pound Puma.  

                                    LILY
                    Shhh -- do you hear that? 

      Lily suddenly takes off running through the darkness, the
      other two following, confused, until suddenly --

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

      They come upon a beautiful, untouched beach.  Waves breaking
      against rock, water glinting in the moonlight...

                                      MANNY
                    Jesus, it's a postcard.

                                      MEENA
                    It's better.

                                    LILY
                    It's ours. 

      They stare, in awe of the natural beauty.  Long beat.  Manny
      sees Meena staring at him, with a hint of a smile.  He grins. 

                                      MANNY
                    Told you.  A little time in the
                    jungle, I start to look pretty good --

                                      MEENA
                    Doctor Double-D.  The ads.  On the
                    subway, the bus stops...

                    What?

                    He's "Dr. Double D" - biggest
                      sleazeball in New York.  I stared at
                    his face every day from 14th to 59th.

                    You think if you travel 5000 miles...
                    whatever.  There's no clean slate.

      He sounds less ashamed than just tired.  Lily suddenly speaks
      up firmly, confidently, echoing Annie's words from earlier.

                    Yeah, there is.  Look at this place. 
                    If there was ever a place to start
                      over...this is it.

      where the possibilities do seem endless.  Long beat.

                    I do wish I'd taken Spanish though.

                    French impresses the ladies.

                                      MEENA
                    Trust me, it does not.

                                    LILY
                    Quelle dommage.

      As they wander towards the ocean, continuing to laugh and
      chat, we WATCH the ocean tide wipe the sand clean... then
      TILT UP to find the Southern Cross sparkling bright in the
