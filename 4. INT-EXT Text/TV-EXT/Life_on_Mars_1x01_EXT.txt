      Three unmarked Police cars tear past a row of defining 21st 
      century shops - typical of a modern, vibrant city, turning 
    off into a residential street.


      A white van caked in grime -  Heating Services . In the grime 
    are written these words - RooneyIs God.

    One of Manchester s modern buildings (the Halle perhaps) 
      rises up in the background - steel and glass. 

    GO WIDE - CID spill out of the cars. Everyone as neat and 
      sharp as SAM. All look to SAM - these next few minutes are 
      crucial.

      They run to an unloved house at the end of the terrace. 
      (Muffled rock music from the house next door.) SAM clocks the 
      music. MAYArings the bell. Dogs yap within.

                    Colin Raimes? Police. Please open 
                    the door.

      OFFICERS move forward with the battering ram but SAM motions 
    for them to hold back. He knocks. Almost polite.

                                  SAM
                    MrRaimes we have a warrant to 
                    enter the house and to remove 
                    property in compliance with the 
                    Criminal Evidence Act ..

      Noise from round the back. Flower-pot knocked over. 


      COLIN RAIMES (30s/ skinny / gingerhair / tracksuit) is 
      already clambering over the back wall. MAYAis the first to 
      reach him. He kicks her in the throat. She steps back, 
      gagging. RAIMES goes over. CID struggle to follow but SAM 
      takes the wall athletically.


      RAIMES running with frenzied vigor. SAM in pursuit. Like a 
      sprinter - piston arms, set jaw.

      RAIMES darts between moving cars. SAM does the same - 
      matching madness for madness. RAIMES cuts down an alley. SAM 
      stops. Scans houses opposite. 

      Crosses the street and goes over a gate. Over another garden 
      wall just as RAIMES is running by. SAM leaps onto RAIMES who 
      throws him off with a scream of rage. SAM reaches into his 
      belt and whip-cracks his baton to full extension. RAIMES 
      grabs a dustbinlid - gladiator s shield.

    TWO BOYS watch them.

      RAIMES swings the lid. SAM side-steps and lashes out with the 
      baton which RAIMES deflects.

                                  BOY 1
                          (to RAIMES)
                    Smash his face in!

      RAIMES giggles - king for a day.

                                  SAM
                    Colin, this is going to look very 
                    bad on your arrest report.

      RAIMES lunges at him. SAM parries and swings his baton into 
    the back of RAIMES  legs. RAIMES crumples. The BOYS boo. SAM 
      holds him down.



                                                                                            3       Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 4

      SCENE 7 OMITTED77


      Gleaming squad cars lined up outside a modern day terrorist 
      proof Police Station. Two POLICEMEN stationed outside. SAM 
      returns to the station. 

      Heswipes his security fob for immediate clearance into the 
      station - which it must be said more resembles the entrance 
    to an expensive private clinic than an inner city cop-house.


      SAM s Jeep pulls up. Close up of a sign - SatchmoreRoad.

    SAM walks through the desolate space. He crosses the 
      playground to where a couple of COPPERS are standing near a 
      swing. Maya s blouse hangs off the swing. Unmistakably hers. 
      A single fleck of blood spoils the material.

    SAM is horrified to the core yet his every sinew of his being 
      fights to hold SAM TYLERin check.

                                  SAM

      I/E. SAM S JEEP - DAY 1/1 14:001717

    SAM at the wheel - distressed but keeping a lid on it.  Life 
    On Mars  plays softly over his i-pod.He brakes hard. The 
      music floats around him as he tries to marshal his thoughts 
    and feelings. He steps out of the car. Leans against it to 
      pull in some clearing air. He is close to tears.

    He steps back to compose himself. A car smacks into him at 
      speed and in half a second SAM is thrown down the street like 
      a scarecrow full of straw. It s shockingly sudden.





                                                                                            9     Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 10




      High shot. SAM is thrown in a tangle across the tarmac.  Life 
    On Mars  builds on the soundtrack.


      FLASH SHOTS - Woods at night. POVof a young boy - looking 
      down at his own page-boy shoes pushing through the grass - 
      brass buckles catching the moonlight. 

      Looking up through the dancing branches at the stars. 
      Magical. Serene. The boy s hands reach up for the stars in 
    the sky.

      TOTAL BLACKNESS. TOTAL SILENCE.


    SAM unconscious on dusty ground. He is wearing a dated brown 
      leather jacket and bell-bottom cords.  Life On Mars  can 
      still be heard playing. SAM lifts his head. The music is 
      coming from the 8 Track playing in the Ford Granada that he 
    is lying beside. The door is open. SAM heads towards the car.

      A COPPER arrives. There is something about his uniform that 
      isn t quite right. He also has a large radio transmitter  
      around his neck. COPPER helps SAM to his feet. 

                                  COPPER 
                    What happened? Did you not see the 
                    signs?

    SAM realizes that he is standing in roadworks. A development 
      plot for the very same road he was driving on moments ago. A 
      road which now seems to be in the process of being built.  

                                  COPPER 
                    Do you remember what happened sir?

    He removes paperwork from the car.

      shirt.

                    No, hang on sir! Come back .. sir!

    SAM breaks into a trot. He crosses the street. Above him 
      looms a giant billboard with an artist s impression of the 
      Mancunian Way and the words  Opening Soon .

                                  COPPER

    SAM breaks into a run.


    SAM pelting through streets of old terraces. Collapses 
      against a lamp post. Becomes aware of the cars parked nearby - 
      Hillmans, Vauxhalls, Austins.

    He catches a glimpse of himselfin the chrome hub cap of one 
    of the cars. He crouches down to study  his reflection and 
      notices the change in his image for the first time.

      a leather wallet containing a card with the name SAM TYLER.

      SCENE 22 OMITTED2222


    SAM stands sweaty and panting staring in astonishment at 
      numerous black bicycles that are lined up outside. A Morris 
      Panda car pulls out. 


      CHRIS walks SAM to his (CHRIS S) car.

                                  SAM
                    This guy kills and then he .. what

                    why I m here? Because that s when 
                    he first struck? Does that make 
                    sense?

                    I can take him home.

    She is standing with a STUDIOUS GUY, NEIL, in glasses who 
      hangs back, staring at SAM. ANNIE is wearing a simple leather 
      skirt and looks much younger out of uniform.

                                  SAM
                    Can you smell that? Fish and chips? 
                    Amazing! I can almost taste the 
                    vinegar! 

    He bursts out laughing.

                                  CHRIS
                    Take him, he s your s. 

      CHRIS is only too happy to get in the car.

    SAM is disturbed by the way that NEIL is almost looking right 
      through him.

                                  ANNIE
                    Do you want me to take you home?

    SAM doesn t answer. ANNIE waves him away and turns to go.

                    Help me?

    She looks back at him. He is unabashed and vulnerable.


    SAM watches the world go by - but what world? He pinches 
      himself, sees the skin redden. Pinches himself harder until 
    it really hurts. 


    SAM is unnerved. He turns and walks back into the station.




    SAM slaps a pile of notes into ANNIE S arms.

    He pushes SAM under his chin with the flat of his hand. SAM 
      smacks his arm away. He swings a punch at GENE. GENE catches 
    it, twists his arm, pulls him in close and thumps the side of 
    his face. SAM drops to his knees.

    He walks away leaving SAM in utterly fazed shock.


    SAM strikes out. ANNIE (on patrol) breaks away from her

    He points down the High Street and we see it for the first

    He stops to look into a RECORD SHOP.

    The Cortina bounces onto the curb. A GANG OF KIDS look

      tank in a camel hair coat. The other is a squared-away pedant 
    in faded brown jacket. But fuckit, despite their 
      disagreements they actually look like some sort of 
      partnership.

    is on.

      MONTAGE6161

      Door to door in an area that reminds us possibly of the 
      Victorian terraces that SAM first raided in 2005.

      A series of front doors opened on GENE and SAM. Between them 
      they fill a doorway.

                                  GENE
                    All right love? CID.

    SAM walking, dejected, Gene eating a hotdog. Low point for 
      both of them.

    Sam looks at Gene, can t quite believe he s just said that.

                    Straight up, how long s she got?

                                  SAM
                    He could do her tonight.

      They cross to the car guarded by several KIDS.

                    Excellent job gentlemen.

    He tosses out 5ps.

      A bulky  squeals for attention in the front seat of Pyeradio
    the car. GENE drags out the mike. Blows into it.

      GENE looks to SAM.


      Outside KRAMER S house. GENE kicks the door in.

                                  SAM
                      Congratulations, you ve just

                    That s disconcerting.


      COPPERS drag a subdued KRAMER to a waiting Panda car. SAM 
      emerges. 

    He sees a grimy van parked in the street.  HEATING SERVICES . 
      Different van from 2005 but the same company. 


                                                                                          55     Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 56

    On the van is scrawled - George Best Is God.

    In the next garden a skinny LITTLE BOY with gingerhair 
      stands staring at him - a four year old COLIN RAIMES. Those 
      piercing eyes blaze with fire at SAM then turn with real 
      affection towards KRAMER. KRAMER gives the boy a wink.

      MRSRAIMES is being brought home. 

                                  MRSRAIMES

                    right, he knew the killer. We were

      WIDE SHOT. Pull back to reveal that they are in the same 
      street that he and MAYA raided. A tower block in the 
      background.


      ANNIE bursts out of the service door and onto the asphalt. 
    SAM is on the edge of the roof, a fifty foot drop behind him. 
    He is excited and energized.

                                  ANNIE
                    Sam! Come away from the edge.

                                  SAM
                    It s okay, I know the answer. I m

                    the definitive step I need to wake 
                    up. 

    He turns to face the drop.

    SAM peers down. NEIL waits in the street, bouncing anxiously 
      from foot to foot.

                                  SAM
                    I refuse to accept that.

    He lifts one leg, grinning and thrilled.

                    Please no! Don t do it!

      ANNIE climbs up onto the ledge with him.

    She holds out her stubby truncheon. Despite his predicament,

    SAM stares at her. And she smiles a bashful, hopeful smile 
      that suggests she feels a connection to him. And in that 
      moment he feels it to.
