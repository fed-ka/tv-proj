  HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT of SPARTACUS laying on an examination 
  table, a shaft of light illuminating him.  Unconscious. 
  Bruises and scrapes from his gladiator battle tattoo his 
  skin, but his lacerations have been crudely stitched.  We 
  DRIFT DOWN, coming to rest TIGHT ON SPARTACUS.

  A DIRTY HAND

  reaches out from the darkness and touches Spartacus  face. 
  His eyes SNAP OPEN as he grabs it and yanks the offender 
  into the light, revealing

  SURA,

  his wife.  Dirty and bloodied from her ordeal.  His heart 
  soars.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura...

  He pulls her into a desperate kiss.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        When the Romans... I thought I d 
                        never...

                                        SURA
                        Shhh.

  She kisses him, tears streaking her cheek.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        I will always be with you.  The 
                        gods themselves could not keep me 
                        from your side.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would kill them all for trying

  His lips find hers.  The kiss turns passionate as he pulls 
  her on top of him.  His hand slides up her thigh to reveal 
  THE PURPLE BINDING

  he tied there before he left for the war.  Sura eases down, 
  moving him inside her.  Their bodies writhe.  Breath 
  quickens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  SURA GASPS,

  nearing release.  Her back arches and her head whips back. 
  But instead of a moan of ecstasy, a sudden

  SCREAM OF PAIN

  erupts from her throat, BLOOD gushing from her mouth and 
  SPLATTERING Spartacus in the face.  SMASH TO --



  Spartacus JOLTS AWAKE.  Shackled to a table.  Wounds 
  treated. Sura is gone.  A fleeting dream.

  BATIATUS

  glances over, conferring with the MEDICUS, a bare-chested, 
  rotund man with a great unkempt beard.  Batiatus sniffs, not 
  caring for Spartacus  scent.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Medicus)(
                        Have him taken to the baths.  But 
                        first attend to all that fucking 
                        hair.

  Batiatus sweeps out.  The Medicus picks up a RAZOR SHARP 
  BLADE.  He nods to the GUARDS, who hold Spartacus down.  He 
  struggles as the Medicus descends on him and roughly begins 
  slicing off his hair.  A thick hunk of his mane falls to the 
  ground, WIPING US TO --



  Batiatus comes through the gate separating the ludus from 
  the villa.  TWO GUARDS lock it behind him as he moves up the 
  stairs and through his villa, a once grand monument now 
  fading into disrepair.  He reaches

  THE ATRIUM

  where his wife LUCRETIA stands frowning into a dried up pool 
  in the center of the room.  NAEVIA, her exotic young body 
  slave, is at her side.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The pool is dry.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We need rain.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Money would also see it filled.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We need that, too.

  He continues on through the villa.  Lucretia follows with 
  Naevia in tow

                                        LUCRETIA
                        How fares your new pet?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He breathes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His cost was enough to fill our 
                        pool for a month.  You paid beyond 
                        the asking.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I paid the man s worth, Lucretia.                                                                                    4.



  Batiatus and Lucretia enter.  Naevia follows, joining a 
  handful of other ATTENDING SLAVES.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Spartacus is a corpse yet walking.  
                        How long before he takes his place 
                      in the grave, dragging your 
                        investment with him?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Not before he serves his purpose.

  Batiatus produces a small SCROLL from his robes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        From Legatus Claudius Glaber.

  That gets her attention.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His intentions?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Nudging toward my desires.

  He hands her the scroll.  She unravels it, reads in 
  surprise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        He s coming here?

                                        BATIATUS
                      To the ludus of Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Two days hence...
                                  glancing up)(
                        The reason for his visit is absent.

  Batiatus begins undressing with the help of the slaves. 
  Lucretia follows suit, with Naevia attending.

                                        BATIATUS
                      In words, but the meaning shines.  
                      He comes to thank me.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        For what?  Paying too much for the 
                        Thracian?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        Spartacus defied Glaber s attempt 
                      at execution in the arena.  The 
                        crowd demanded his freedom, an 
                          embarrassment to the Legatus.  I 
                        offered alternative, by purchasing 
                        him.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      At inflated worth.

                                        BATIATUS
                      If Spartacus survives to swear the 
                        oath, the arena will be his tomb as 
                        first intended.  If not, his 
                        passing becomes an early delight 
                        for the Legatus.

  Lucretia smiles as she stretches out on the bed.  Naked. 
  Powerful in her sexuality.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Desires well nudged.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There s yet more stroking needed.

  Batiatus glances down at his nakedness with a frown. 
  Lucretia signals a FEMALE SLAVE to prepare Batiatus for 
  lovemaking.  The Slave gets on her knees,  fluffing  him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A simple gesture of gratitude from 
                        him falls short.  Patronage is the 
                        reward we seek.  Nothing short of 
                        it.

  Lucretia s hand drops between her legs, preparing herself 
  for her husband.  Naevia fans her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The Legatus as patron...

                        His coins... will fill our pool to 
                        overflowing.

  Batiatus grips the Slave Girl s head, thrusting harder.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        We ll need to prepare a feast.

                        With wine.  And water.  Lots of 
                        water.

                        Just enough... to wet the tongue.

                        I ll sacrifice a bull.  To appease 
                        the gods in our venture.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps something smaller...?

                        A ram, then.

  Batiatus pushes the Slave Girl away, climbs into bed.

                                        BATIATUS
                      To the gods.  May they bless us 
                        with good fortune...

  Batiatus GRUNTS as he slides into Lucretia.  Naevia s FAN 
  WIPES US TO --



  Naked Gladiators laugh and bathe, or, more accurately, 
  scrape.  Water is in scarce supply due to the drought, the 
  bath sitting empty.  Instead olive oil is applied to the 
  Gladiators, then scraped off removing dirt and blood.

  SPARTACUS,

  hair cut short and beard hacked to the stubble, is thrust 
  into the room by two GUARDS.  The room goes silent as 
  Spartacus stumbles to the floor.

  CRIXUS,

  a hard motherfucking Gaul, stares down at Spartacus.

  The Gladiators laugh.  BARCA, a brute of a man carved from

  More laughter.  Spartacus eyes the scene, confused.

                        What is this place?

  ASHUR, a smaller man with a crippled leg and eyes that

                        mountaintop!

  Shouts of pride assault Spartacus.  His face darkens, the 
  explanation a sour taste upon his tongue.

                        women. They smell like piss and 
                        shit.

  Spartacus steps into the light.  More dead than alive.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What are you, then?

                                        CRIXUS
                        A Gaul, little man, the greatest of 
                      my kind.  Crixus, the Undefeated!

  The men laugh and cheer.  Spartacus half smiles, nods.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A Gaul.  That explains why you 
                        smell like a woman.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.
  CONTINUED:

  The laughter dies out.  A tense beat, broken by a cool smile 
  bending Crixus  lips.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tend to your wounds.  Eat.  Rest.  
                        When you ve gained your strength, 
                        we ll revisit that remark.

  Crixus moves off.  Barca follows with Pietros in tow.  The 
  men return to their conversations and laughter.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS  EYES,

  glaring in defiance.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL he s now standing 
  in --



  TIGHT ON A DIRTY BOWL

  containing oily fish sauce and a stale crust of bread. 
  Accompanied by a small cup with a few swallows of water. 
  PULL BACK as they re handed to

  VARRO

  by a decrepit SLAVE COOK.  Varro grimaces at the 
    unappetizing meal as he navigates the mess hall.

  CRIXUS AND BARCA

  command one of the few rough-hewn tables, the remainder 
  crowded by the senior Gladiators.

  THE EXHAUSTED RECRUITS

  and lesser men are relegated to the dusty ground.  Varro 
  sidesteps Kerza and RECRUIT #4, who are fighting over some 
  imagined slight.  Varro settles next to

  SPARTACUS

  who eats by himself, lost in thoughts of vengeance and 
  escape.

                                        VARRO

                        Shit-fucking slaves and criminals, 
                        the lot of them.

  Spartacus responds absently, not looking at Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Are we the better?

                                        VARRO
                        You survived your own execution.  
                        Twice, if you mark the Gaul over 
                        there not introducing your brains 
                      to the sand.  No.  You are of a 
                        difference, Thracian.  Above this 
                        unfortunate collection.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And you...?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        The worst of the lot.  A free man 
                        consigned by his own hand.

  That gets Spartacus  attention.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Why would a man willingly condemn 
                        himself to this?

                                        VARRO
                        A small matter of debt, grown 
                        large.  The repaying of it proves 
                        difficult.  If the concern was only 
                      to me...

  Guilt and regret seize Varro s heart.  Spartacus knows the 
  look well.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A family.

                        Two years in the arena.  My

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Winnings?

                                        VARRO
                        Fight well, and you re rewarded 
                        with coin.  Enough even to balance 
                        what I owe, the gods be fortunate.

                        The gods.

  Spartacus turns away again.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        You are a fool.

  Varro smiles, feeling the truth of the remark.

                                        VARRO
                        And in good company, by the 
                        judging.

  Batiatus moves through the ludus.  Doctore follows.

                                        BATIATUS
                        They re the best I could do at the 
                        moment.

                                          DOCTORE
                        One or two show promise.  But the 
                        rest... My own mother would have 
                        them in the arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have no mother.  You were 
                        belched from the cunt of the 
                        underworld.  That s why I favor 
                        you.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Were there no better offerings?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Better, yes!  Within the reach of 
                      my purse, no!  You stand 
                        questioning and complaining instead 
                      of setting yourself to the task!

  Doctore realizes he s overstepped, politely lowers his eyes.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I press to honor you, Batiatus.  
                        And this ludus.

  Batiatus calms.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Legatus Glaber visits tomorrow.  
                        With him the hope of renewed 
                        fortunes.  In the mean, these men 
                        are all the straw afforded.  Bake 
                        them into brick, or crumble them to 
                        the mines.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your will.  My hands.

  Doctore bows slightly, exits.  Batiatus heads into --                                                                                    21.



  A cluttered space in desperate need of organizing.  A desk 
  occupies a place of prominence, piled high with loose papers 
  and books.  OVIDIUS, an unassuming man in his early 30s, 
  stands waiting.  Batiatus brightens into salesman mood.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Ovidius! Apologies for the wait!

                                          OVIDIUS
                        Accepted, if made with coin.

  Ovidius hands Batiatus a slip of parchment.

                                          OVIDIUS(cont'd)
                        Three months of grain, the payment 
                        standing past due.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Three, is it?

                                          OVIDIUS
                      To the day.

  Batiatus eyes the bill with a frown.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The games of the Vulcanalia 
                        approach.  If I could carry the 
                        debt until then...

                                          OVIDIUS
                        The principle, plus thirty percent.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Thirty?!

                                          OVIDIUS
                      Or settle the debt as it stands.

  Batiatus forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Principle plus thirty.  After the 
                        Vulcanalia.

                                          OVIDIUS
                        The day after.

  Ovidius bows, exits.  Batiatus seethes, his fist crushing 
  the bill in his hand as he follows, WIPING US TO:                                                                                    22.



  Spartacus, Varro, Kerza, and the other Recruits sprawl on 
  the floor, exhausted.  Shackles bind their wrists and ankles 
  for the night.

                                        KERZA
                        I could have taken him.

                        The shit would be running down your 
                        leg.

  The Recruits chuckle.  All except Spartacus, who stares off 
  at nothing.  Kerza tosses a sneer in his direction.

                                        KERZA
                        Wouldn t have ended up on my belly, 
                        fucked like a dog.

                                        VARRO
                        Without training, the Gaul would 
                        have bested any of us, Kerza.  
                        Speaking otherwise is bloated air.

  Recruit #4 darkens with worry, showing the strain of the 
  ordeal.

                                          RECRUIT #4
                        I pray not to face Crixus in the 
                        final test.

                                        KERZA
                        Nothing to worry.  You ll never 
                        make it that far, cock hole.

                                        VARRO
                        All can make it to the test.  And 
                        beyond.

                                          RECRUIT #4
                                  soft, a dream)(

                        One day.  If you fight well.

  Kerza snorts in contempt.

  Recruit #4 glances at Spartacus with hope.

                        You fought the gladiators there, 
                        Spartacus.  What do you think of 
                        our chances?

  A beat.  The answer is a simple statement, tinged with a 
  hint of sadness.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You re all going to die.

  He closes his eyes to sleep.  CLANG!  The cell door swings 
  open.  Doctore and the Guards stand in the doorway.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Up! You will sleep when you prove 
                        yourself men.

  Spartacus rises, exhausted but his eyes cold steel.  The 
  motion of his body WIPES US TO --



  where the Gladiators are already enjoying their meal.  Varro 
  works his shoulder, grimacing in pain.

  Varro casts a frown at Kerza and the remaining Recruits. 
  Half dead from the night s exertion.

                                        VARRO
                        Yes.
                                  a beat)(
                        Mostly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yet the fool, then.

  He takes in the haggard Recruits.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Batiatus paid for these men?

                                        VARRO
                        Very little, by the look of them.

  The thought is a bitter thing in Spartacus  mouth.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The Roman way.  Lives for coins.

                                        VARRO
                        Some deserving more than others.  
                        I ve heard a certain Thracian was 
                        quite the price.

  Spartacus darkens with thoughts of revenge.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would see the cost rise higher 
                        still.

  The Recruits reach the serving table where the Slave Cook 
  ladles PORRIDGE.  Barca appears next to him, beaming a 
  welcome to the exhausted Recruits.

                                        BARCA
                        I recall the hardship of The March, 
                        when I was a recruit.  Come!  You 
                        must be mad with hunger.  Fill your 
                        bellies!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

  Barca shoves the porridge pot, spilling the contents on the 
  dirty ground.  Crixus and the other Gladiators roar.

  KERZA AND SEVERAL RECRUITS

  drop to the ground, desperately scooping porridge and sand 
  into their mouths.  Spartacus glances at Doctore, who views 
  the scene with disinterest.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He does nothing.

                                        VARRO
                        What would be the purpose

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is Batiatus so thick with coins 
                        losing them matters shit?

  Varro indicates the sad state of the once opulent ludus.

                                        VARRO
                        Look about.  The shit matters.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then why value us so little?

                                        VARRO
                        Value isn t worth.  He spends what 
                      he can, gambling to find another 
                        Crixus to excite the crowds and 
                        fill his empty purse.

  Varro works his neck, grunting in exhaustion.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        Wake me when it s time to die 
                        again.

  He moves off into the shade, stretches out.  Spartacus casts 
  a glance back to Doctore, but the man is gone.  Ashur 
  appears, a smile creasing his face.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies for the porridge.  Barca 
                        finds the jest amusing.  Least he 
                        didn t piss in it this time.  Adds 
                      an unpleasant bite.

  Spartacus ignores him.  Ashur ignores the ignoring.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                        The day will be hard.  Without 
                        food, more so.

  Ashur presses a small loaf of BREAD into Spartacus  hand.  
  Spartacus pauses, suspicious.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You would give me your bread?

                                        ASHUR
                        Mine, no.  I move things from here 
                      to there, this hand to that.  Even 
                        from outside these walls.  Whatever 
                        your needs, Ashur provides.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Out of kindness?  Or profit?

                                        ASHUR
                        What profit isn t a kindness?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I owe no man.

  Spartacus presses the loaf back.  Ashur refuses.

                                        ASHUR
                        I ask nothing in return.  My only 
                        concern is your strength and well-
                        being in the coming day.

  Spartacus pins Ashur with a deadly glare.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Come to plain words.

  Ashur drops the friendly overtones, his eyes glinting.

                                        ASHUR
                        Simply stated, then.  In addition 
                      to other services, I offer odds.  
                        Will this man live?  That one die?  
                        How fast?  How slow?  On what day 
                      or hour?  Games to pass the time.  
                        And coin.

  Spartacus glances at the other Recruits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And how am I fixed?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                        Twelve to the one, favoring the 
                        mines. Higher towards your death.  
                        Crixus stands to lose a sum if you 
                        defy the numbering.  I would see it 
                        so.

  Spartacus considers the bread, locks eyes with Ashur.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Do not think me friend.

  Ashur smiles coldly.

                                        ASHUR
                        The thought is well removed.

  Ashur moves off.  Spartacus glances at Crixus braying with 
  Barca.  The bread could give him strength to silence the 
  laughter.  A warming thought.  Spartacus heads over to

  VARRO

  stretched out in the shade, eyes closed.  Spartacus tears 
  the loaf of bread, tossing half onto Varro s stomach.  Varro 
  creaks an eye open, annoyed at the disturbance.  His mood 
  brightens as he grabs up the unexpected meal.

                                        VARRO
                        How did you manage this?

  Spartacus rips a hunk of bread off with his teeth, chews.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      By playing the odds.

  Something catches Varro s eye behind Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                        I fear they re about to worsen.

  Spartacus turns to see two Guards hustling up.  They descend 
  on him, WIPING US TO --



  Dark and filthy.  Dim shafts of light stab through the 
  gloom. A few rusted CAGES litter the floor, just large 
  enough to stuff a man into.  CHAINS hang from the walls.  
  Spartacus  wrists are shackled to a set.  SLOW PUSH IN on 
  him, landing on his FACE as he hears


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

  from the corridor.  The cell door grinds open.  Spartacus 
  tenses as he sees

  LEGATUS CLAUDIUS GLABER

  entering in all his Roman Glory.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Glaber.

                                        GLABER
                        You will address me by title of 
                        Legatus.

  Spartacus lunges at him, enraged.  The chains snap him an 
  inch short of his mark.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Yet the animal.  The mark of your 
                        kind.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Where is she?

                                        GLABER
                        Who?  That little wife of yours?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Where?

                                        GLABER
                        Wherever I please!

  Glaber spits out his mocking response, his careful composure 
  cracking.  The Thracian has cost him dearly, driving him to 
  the brink.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She served you no grievance.

                                        GLABER
                        None.  But you...  You have grieved 
                        me. Stirring the auxiliary to 
                        desertion. Putting my command in 
                        question, imperiling my standing 
                        with the senate...And you grieve me 
                        again in the arena, by not knowing 
                        when to die.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      My life, then.  In exchange for 
                        hers.

                                        GLABER
                        Your life is no longer yours to 
                        bargain! If I wish it ceased, I 
                        need but whisper and good Batiatus 
                        will command it!

  Spartacus hardens.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then tongue the words in his ear.  
                        I will not beg.

  Glaber regains his composure, smiles warmly.

                                        GLABER
                        You mistake me, Thracian.  True, I 
                        sought death in repayment of your 
                        slights.  I see the error of that 
                        now.  Wishing for an end too quick.  
                        No.  My desires have turned to 
                        blood.  Spilled by the drop, over 
                        time, until you are drained.  As I 
                        told you before, the shadow of Rome 
                      is vast.  And you will yet die 
                        under it. Sliver by sliver, to the 
                        roar of the crowd.

  Glaber turns to exit, pauses.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        A parting kindness, to bind us.

  He produces a familiar PURPLE BINDING from his robes.  The 
  one Spartacus tied to Sura s thigh before heading off to 
  war. Spartacus stares at it, his heart rending.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        I took it from her thigh to 
                        preserve the scent.  Before my men 
                        stained it with theirs.

  Spartacus lunges again, straining to break his chains.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        She was a savage amusement.  When 
                        the fight ran from her eyes, I sold 
                        her to an unpleasant Syrian for 
                        half a coin.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.
  CONTINUED:

  He lets the binding fall to the ground.  Spartacus falls to 
  his knees, struggling against the chains to reach it.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        The Thracian finally learns his 
                        place before me.  On his knees.

  Glaber sweeps out, his purpose realized.  Spartacus strains 
  for Sura s binding, drawing blood from where the shackles 
  circle his wrists.  He finally latches onto it, tears of 
  regret and rage streaking his anguished face.  He screams, a 
  primal, savage sound.



  Spartacus  anguish echoes through the corridor.  Glaber 
  allows himself the hint of a smile as he joins Batiatus, 
  waiting for him in the corridor with two Guards.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your visit with the Thracian was 
                        satisfying, then?

  Glaber continues down the corridor, paying Batiatus little 
  mind.

                                        GLABER
                        The man is of no more concern to 
                        me.

                                        BATIATUS
                      No concern whatsoever!  Let us talk

                        had a feast prepared in your honor!

  Glaber waves the offer away.

                                        GLABER
                        I leave for Rome.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Rome?  Now?

  Glaber sweeps on ahead.  Batiatus calls after him, his hopes 
  of patronage quickly evaporating.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Perhaps something for your trip, 
                        then?  I offer the finest selection 
                      of delicacies in all of Capua!

  He hustles after Glaber, his fluttering robes WIPING US TO 
  --



  The Roman equivalent of a dining room.  TIGHT ON a silver 
  plate of ROASTED DORMICE.  PULL BACK to reveal Naevia and 
  the Slaves setting it out with the rest of a modest feast.  
  A far cry from Senator Albinius  opulent spread at the Cena 
  Libera.

  GLABER S WIFE ILITHYIA,

  dressed in expensive robes of the latest style, eyes the 
  food with a polite smile.  Lucretia stands with her, the 
  gracious hostess -- albeit less magnificently garbed.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You really shouldn t have gone to 
                        the trouble, Lucretia.  These 
                        common dishes leave my stomach 
                        unsettled.

  She means no slight in the remark, but Lucretia can t help 
  being stung by it.  Of lower social status, she s forced to 
  laugh the feeling away.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps some wine, while we wait 
                        for your husband?

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Do you have any Sestian?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No, but something of equal taste?

  Ilithyia frowns in disappointment.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Water, then.

  Lucretia motions to Naevia, who pours.  Ilithyia fans 
  herself.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        The heat and the dust.  Will it 
                        ever rain again?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One can only pray.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Can t place foot to street in Capua 
                        without hearing someone pleading to 
                        the heavens for a sprinkle.  And 
                        the gods yet ignore us.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps we ve done something to 
                        offend them.

  Ilithyia smiles, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she 
  takes her cup.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I try to do a little something 
                        every day.

  Lucretia laughs, seeing the opportunity to become a co-
    conspirator.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      So you re the cause, Ilithyia.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I d stand a bit away.  Jupiter 
                        could hurl a bolt any moment.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        He ll have to choose between 
                        targets.

  Lucretia smiles, a tinge of the salacious behind it.  
  Ilithyia eyes her with new appreciation.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And I thought I was in the presence 
                      of a proper Roman woman.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Proper is a word.  Forged by men 
                        who would enslave us with it.

  Lucretia exits to the balcony, her hook baited.



  TIGHT ON KERZA'S BLOODIED, SEMI-CONSCIOUS FACE as the 
  Medicus stitches a small gash on his cheek.  PULL BACK to 
  reveal Batiatus glowering at the mess.  Doctore is by his

                        I warned you of their quality.

                        You warn me nothing!  You counsel, 
                        and make promises to the air!   My

                                to himself, fuming)(
                        The Legatus, barely beyond my 
                        gates!

                                          DOCTORE
                        The Thracian is unpredictable.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Then school him to our standards.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Rod and lash fall unnoticed.  He s 
                      an animal, best unleashed in the 
                        mines.

                                        BATIATUS
                        No.  The rest to the gods, they 
                        were all of little cost.  Spartacus 
                      is more highly valued, his worth 
                        well exceeding their entire sum.  I 
                        will have return.  If not from the 
                        ungrateful Legatus and his 
                        patronage, then from the man 
                        himself.

                                          DOCTORE
                      He is uncontrollable.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is but passionate, and stirs the 
                        same in others.  A boon to the 
                        crowds, if we divine the instrument 
                      of his taming.

  Doctore s eyes narrow, his master s words resonating.  He 
  pulls Sura s purple binding from his belt.

                        I noted this in the hand of the 
                        Legatus, upon his arrival.

  Batiatus catches the delicate scent yet clinging to the 
  fabric.  His eyes sparkle with possibilities.

  Batiatus sweeps out, WIPING US TO --

  Spartacus is led in by the Guards.  They shove him forward, 
  staying a respectful distance back.  Batiatus sits at his 
  cluttered desk, reviewing documents with a burdened frown.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Why are you here?

  He makes a note on his document, takes a sip of wine, 
  stands.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      In this place.  Under my 
                        hospitality.  Do you know why?

  Spartacus  eyes flick up to Batiatus.  The fire in them has 
  been deadened, but far from extinguished.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Because I trusted in the honor of a 
                        Roman.

  Batiatus laughs.

                      An honest assessment, though 
                        straying from my intent.  You are 
                        here because of my grandfather.  He 
                        built this ludus, these walls, the 
                        floor you stand on.  This was his 
                        desk.  His life.  He believed that 
                      no man was without worth.  That

                        themselves have lost.  A small

                        Love?

  Batiatus grins, seeing the truth of it in Spartacus  eyes.

                        tensing of the jaw.  Love.  The 
                        wings that grant us flight.  And 
                        the shackles that ensure we never

                                          SPARTACUS
                        How do you know the heart beats 
                        beneath your chest?

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Most days, I don t.  I m just a 
                        simple Roman trying to make his way 
                        against the whim of the gods, 
                        politicians, and miscreants -- 
                        though often you cannot tell one 
                        from another.  But you.  You are 
                        the most dangerous of animals.  The 
                        beast born of the heart.

  Batiatus considers Spartacus, eyes narrowing.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        What would you do to hold your wife 
                        again?  To feel the warmth of her 
                        skin, the taste of her lips?  Would 
                        you kill?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Whoever stood between us.

                                        BATIATUS
                        How many men?  A hundred?  A 
                        thousand?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would kill them all.

  Batiatus laughs, his eyes dancing.

                        I did not lose her.  She was taken 
                        from me.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A white hair on a black jackal.  
                        She is gone.  You are here.  A man 
                        must accept his fate.  Or be 
                        destroyed by it.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am no man s slave.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Everyone has a master.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Even you?

                                        BATIATUS
                      Oh I answer to the most powerful of 
                        them all.  My own wife.
                                  soft)(
                        And I would have the world for her.

  Spartacus studies him, the heartfelt confession a surprise. 
  Or is it more honey to sweeten the trap?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Why would I place my fate in the 
                        hands of another Roman?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Because of what they hold...

  Batiatus produces Sura s binding from his robes.  The blood 
  pauses in Spartacus  veins.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Your wife s, isn t it?

  Spartacus nods, having no voice for his words.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Pass the final test, this night, 
                        upon the bridge.  With honor and

  Batiatus presses it into Spartacus  hands.

                        The choice is yours.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as he struggles with the devil's offer. 
  PRE-LAP: The gruff cacophony of CHEERS and SHOUTS rises to a 
  deafening roar.
