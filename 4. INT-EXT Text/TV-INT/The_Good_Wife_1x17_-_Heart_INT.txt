      A hospital hallway.  We re moving down it.  Gurneys passing.  
      A man and a woman rush past, looking out of place.  Suited.  
    Not hospital staff.  We follow them into...


      ...anempty hospital conference room.  The man drags a table 
    to the front.  The woman opens a briefcase, removes a tripod 
      stand and STENO MACHINE.  She s a court reporter.  The man 
      takes off his coat, revealing a bailiff s uniform.  He places 
      a GAVEL and name plate on the table:  Hon. Robert Parks.  

      It s an emergency courtroom.  Impromptu, mobile, 
        unexceptionable.  The door bangs open, and...

      ...the honorable ROBERT PARKS enters, the no-nonsense 
      conservative African-American judge from 104.  He s followed 
    by Will and a Robert-Reed-like insurance lawyer, MR. HARPER.

                                  WILL
                    Your honor, this is a delaying 
                    tactic.  It s--

                                  MR. HARPER
                    She was just contacted this morning-- 
                    that s not a delaying tactic, that s--   

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Sit.

      It s not loud, but Will and Mr. Harper immediately obey, 
      crossing to their seats-- two folding chairs in front of the 
       bench,  opening briefcases to place on chairs in front of 
      them.  Everybody making do.  Judge Parks zips open a garment 
      bag: a judge s robe.  Puts it on, nods to the court reporter.

                    Our lead attorney was caught unaware 
                    by this emergency motion--  

                                  WILL
                    This surgery needs to happen now, 
                    Your Honor.  LifeState s strategy 
                    here is to run down the clock.  
                    They have no defense so they want 
                    to make your ruling irrelevant.  In 
                    three days, my client s baby could

                    Objection.  Your client s fetus.  

      Judge Parks looks up, frowns: clearly a conservative justice. 
      Will smiles to himself: way to step into it, Harper.   

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Well, thank you, Mr. Harper.  I m 
                    sure we all feel better with that 
                    distinction.  This is an emergency 
                    court.  Get your attorney in here 
                    now, or start arguing for yourself.  
                    Do you understand?

                    I do.

      Harper whips out his Blackberry, and...

      twinkle, little star, how I wonder what...   PATTI NYHOLM, 
    the smilingly caustic and confrontational lawyer from 104, 
      sits in her parked car, keeping her eyes glued to her 
      rearview mirror and her sleepy INFANT in the backseat.  

    Her cellphone buzzes.  She checks the text:  Didn t work.  
      Need you now. Nyholm sighs: what she expected.  She double-
      takes at the mirror, sees a woman starting toward the 
      hospital.  It s Alicia, rushing, late.  Nyholm smiles...

      (mid-20s) earthy community organizer, five months pregnant, 
    her husband, JESSE, holding her hand.  Nervous, trying to

                                  DR. HALL*
                    Yes.  As you can see-- here-- the 
                    right ventricle is enlarged; left 
                    side severely underdeveloped.  It s

                    Yes.  It needs to happen by the 
                    24th week-- two days from now.

                    the Willoughbys  policy.  It s an

    Eli Gold considers it.  Nods.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Good.  Then let s set a meeting. 


      Jesse pushes Kate s wheelchair toward the emergency court as 
      Alicia walks with them... 

                                  KATE
                    It s just-- so bizarre.  We have  
                    insurance for exactly this kind of 
                    thing, and now... We could sell off 
                    everything and not cover this--

                                  JESSE
                          (reminding her)
                    But we re staying calm.  Thinking 
                    positive.  

                                  KATE
                    Right.  It was a good day.  He 
                    started kicking again.  

      Hand on her womb.  The two smile.  A sweet couple.  Alicia 
      likes them.

                                  ALICIA
                    Any closer to a name?

                          (trades a look with Jesse)

                                  JESSE
                    We want to make sure... we re all 
                    fine first.   

      Alicia nods, gets it, as she looks up to see Nyholm and Will 
      talking, too far away to hear.  Two pros:

                                  NYHOLM
                    How did you get a judge in here on 
                      a Saturday?

                                  WILL
                    Didn t count on that, did you?  So 
                    this isn t really your baby, is it?  
                    What s her name? 

                                  NYHOLM
                    Bite me.

                                  WILL
                    Is that Dutch?

    And Will enters court.


                                  NYHOLM
                    How many times have you performed this 
                    fetal heart surgery procedure, Dr. Hall?*

    Dr. Hallagain on the folding-chair-stand.  *

                                  DR. HALL*
                    I m not a pediatric cardiologist.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, I understand that.  But that 
                    would mean... none?  Right?

                                  DR. HALL*
                    ...Yes.

                                  NYHOLM
                    And how many times have pediatric 
                      cardiologists at your hospital 
                    performed this procedure?

      Will frowns, makes a note.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       10.

                                  DR. HALL*
                    It s a highly specialized--

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, but again the answer is none.  
                    No criticism implied, ma am, I just 
                    want to be clear on the facts.  

                                  DR. HALL*
                    Yes, that s correct.

                                  NYHOLM
                    In fact, how many times has fetal 
                    surgery for hypoplastic left heart 
                    syndrome been attempted in 
                    Illinois, do you know?

                                  DR. HALL*
                    I must confess: I don t.

      Nyholm holds up four fingers.  Then for the court reporter:

                                  NYHOLM
                    Four times.  Now, Dr. Hall, how is *
                    that not an experimental procedure? 

                                  WILL
                    Objection.  Not within her 
                    expertise.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Sustained.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, I can understand why Mr. 
                    Gardner wouldn t want you to answer 
                    that.  No further questions.  

      Kate and Jesse frown: clearly damaging.  Alicia smiles at 
      them comforting, but then trades a look with Will: not great.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Miss Nyholm, how long will you need to 
                    prepare your defense?

                                  NYHOLM
                    Well, your honor, I would be 
                    tempted to say one week, except--

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                      Twenty-four hours.

                    Except 24 hours is what I mean.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Good, then we ll reconvene 
                    tomorrow, and I would urge both 
                    parties to use that time wisely in 
                    finding a compromise.

      Will and Nyholm look over at each other.  Unlikely.  As...


      ...a handshake.  Between Peter and PASTOR ISAIAH EASTON, 30s, *
      Jeremiah s son.  Intense, charismatic, sturdily religious, 
      with an intelligence that shines through.  Golden, Eli Gold, 
      Kya, Jeremiah are there too, all listening.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Thank you, Pastor.  We feel Peter 
                    needs some spiritual guidance.  He 
                    has paid his debt to society, but 
                    we know there is a greater debt. 

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH*
                    You want to use me?

      Golden starts to correct him, but...

                                  PETER
                    Yes.

      Pastor Isaiahlikes the straight-forwardness of that, looks *
    at Peter for the first time.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH*
                    Why?

                                  PETER
                    It looks good if I m embraced by 
                    you.  Our polling is below par 
                    among African-American women.

                    from my life, watching everything I

      Stuffed animals.  Jonas Brothers posters.  Pink bedding.  And 
    Eli Gold, Golden, Kya, and Jeremiah crowded into Grace s

      Peter stares at him.  Just slightly intimidated.

      Nyholm nods toward her daughter sleeping in a baby Bjorn 
      strapped to her chest.  Will rolls his eyes, but whispers...

                    Even if youdon t sympathize with

                    well in the press.

                          (whispers back)
                    Come on, Will, how bad do you think 
                    you can make an insurance company 
                    look these days?

                    operation right now-- high six-
                    figures, right?  Mr. Harper can 
                    cover that with a stroke of a pen.

    An irritated Will shoves out of the conference room, followed

    An understatement.  Pomeroy is on the folding-chair-witness-
      stand in emergency court.  Judge Parks.  Will, Alicia, Cary.  
      Behind them Kate in a wheelchair, a little more pale.  Jesse 
      beside her.  Nyholm questioning.  Mr. Harper.  No baby.

                                  PAMELA POMEROY (CONT D)
                    I can t even imagine the stress 
                    Kate must be under-- but a risky, 
                    medically unnecessary surgery is 
                    not the answer.  

      Will leans toward Alicia, whispers:

                    To be fair, you re a claims manager, 
                    not a medical professional?

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    Yes, but that s why we hire 
                      independent medical consultants: 
                    retired doctors contracted to 
                    evaluate medical records and make a

                    And what was the consultant s 
                      determination here?

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    He concurred, unfortunately: fetal 
                    surgery is not considered 
                     medically necessary  when there s 
                    a tried and tested alternative-- 
                    waiting until the baby s born.

                                  NYHOLM
                    No further questions, Miss Pomeroy.  
                    I know this was hard, and your 
                    sympathy really goes out to this 
                    couple.

                    This, according to your denial

                    Overruled.  Policy language is

                    Yes.  Yes.  This is my child.  Of 
                    course he s worth-- anything.  

                                  NYHOLM
                    And you can live with that hypocrisy-

      Nyholm studies the judge-- did she go too far?  


      Will approaches Alicia sitting with a rattled Kate and Jesse--

                                  WILL
                    How re you doing?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       24.

                                  KATE
                    I don t know.  I guess I ve been 
                    better.

      Alicia follows Will s gaze down toward Nyholm pacing with the 
      other LifeStateexecs on their cellphones. 

                                  WILL
                    You did well.  They re worried 
                    Patti pushed it too far.  It s hard 
                    to read this judge, but I think we 
                    have a fighting chance.

                                  JESSE
                    And if we lose?  Then what?

                                  WILL
                    What do you mean?

                                  JESSE
                    What are our options?

      Will pauses, looks at Alicia.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Let s not worry about that now.  

      Will nods, starts off.  Alicia excuses herself, joins him.

                                  WILL
                    We can t drop our class-action.

                                  ALICIA
                    I know.

                                  WILL
                    There are 68 couples just like them.

      Alicia doesn t answer, looks off.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Yes, it s about the firm too.  But 
                    we can t drop this class-action.

                                  ALICIA
                      I understand.

      Will looks at her.

                                  WILL
                    Don t you like this: being a 
                    lawyer?  Isn t it fun?

                          (smiles)
                    It has its moments.    

    And the two stare at each other.  For a second.  Another 
      second.  Then-- bang-- the bailiff opens the door.  

                                  WILL
                    Well... here we go.  


      Judge Parks sits beside his  bench,  readying himself as Will 
      eyes him, can t read his face.  Whispers to Alicia and Cary:

                                  WILL
                    I can t tell.

    But at that second Jesse tries to wheel Kate into the room, 
      bumping up against one of the closed double doors.  Judge 
      Parks immediately hops up, crosses to unlock the double door, 
      nodding pleasantly at Kate.  Will smiles, whispers:

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    We re good.

      Nyholm, seeing the same thing, frowns to her cohorts, 
      whispers...

                                  NYHOLM
                    Dammit. 

      Parks returns to his seat, adjusts his robes.  Preparing to 
      speak.  But before he can start:

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    Your honor, I m sorry, I need to 
                    raise a quick issue if you don t 
                    mind.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    I m ready to rule, Miss Nyholm.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, your honor, but everything 
                    about this emergency court has been 
                    rushed and unorthodox, and 
                    something has come to our attention 
                    within the last ten minutes.

                    What is she doing?

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Quickly, Miss Nyholm.

                                  NYHOLM
                    All this litigation has led to a 
                    higher level of scrutiny of the 
                    Willoughbys  policy application.  
                    I m afraid we ve uncovered some 
                      deal-changing issues--

                                  WILL
                    Oh come on--

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner, I m 
                    startled myself.  When we began 
                    these proceedings I didn t expect 
                    Mr. Willoughby to misrepresent his 
                    medical history on the application--  

                                  JESSE
                    What?!

      Alicia grabs Jesse s hand as Parks shoots him a stern look:

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Sit down, sir.

                                  NYHOLM
                    This misrepresentation gives 
                    LifeStatethe right to rescind the 
                    policy entirely.

                                  WILL
                    Your honor, this isn t a buffet.  Miss 
                    Nyholm can t just pick one attack, and 
                    then, failing that, try another.

                                  NYHOLM
                    I would argue this goes to the heart 
                    of contract law, your honor.  Even 
                    if you are prone to rule in the 
                      plaintiff s favor, at the very 
                    minimum you should hear whether 
                    there was a legal contract to begin 
                    with.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       27.

      CONTINUED: (2)2222


                                  WILL
                    Your honor, we are racing a ticking 
                    clock, and Miss Nyholm is counting 
                    on this surgery being irrelevant by 
                    the time you decide.

      Parks clears his throat: that s enough.  He thinks about it.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Mr. Gardner, urgency is not it s 
                    own rationale.  A just decision 
                    will not be rushed.
                          (Will frowns: fuck)
                    Miss Nyholm, prepare your exhibits 
                    and witnesses, and I will hear on 
                    this matter tomorrow.

      Bang-- that s it.  A frowning Parks starts out as Will sees 
      Alicia s disappointment.  He turns to Nyholm:  

                                  WILL
                    You understand what you re doing 
                    here, Patti?  You take their 
                    coverage away altogether, that baby 
                    gets nosurgery at all--

                                  NYHOLM
                    That s on you, Will.  You have 
                    another option.  

    And Nyholm exits, leaving a slumping Will.

      Alicia, Will, Cary, a few other associates.  Exhaustion in 
    the ranks.  Starbucks being handed around...

                                  CARY
                    We went over everything in his 
                    policy application.  The only thing 
                    we could find is he failed to 
                    disclose a possibleheart condition. 

                                  ALICIA
                    LifeState will say they didn t have 
                    a full picture of the underwriting

                    Okay.  Alicia you take Jesse s 
                    direct.  Let s go.   

      Everybody starts out.  Will notices Cary s disappointment, 
      calls him back.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Cary.  The only reason I m going 
                    with Alicia is because she has 
                    Nyholm s number.  

                                  CARY
                    I know.  I get it.  

                                  WILL

                                  CARY
                    Thanks.

    And Cary heads out the door.  Will considers it a second.  
      Sees Alicia has left her SCARF on the back of one of the 
      chairs.  Starts toward it.  Stops.  Leaves it there.

      Alicia questioning Jesse...  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Willoughby, LifeState is saying 
                    that this question was answered 
                      inaccurately.  Can you see that?

      Alicia zooms in on Question #2-- Circulatory Disorders/ 
      Problems-- on a projector displaying Jesse s policy 
      application: fine print, tiny boxes.  

                                  JESSE
                    Yes.

      Kate watches with Will, Cary, other associates.  Kalinda in 
    the gallery behind them.  On the other side: Nyholm, Harper, 
    her team.

                                  ALICIA
                    You were to check the box if you d 
                    had  Circulatory Problems including, 
                    but not limited to, chest pain, heart 
                    murmur, palpitations, phlebitis--  
                    What is phlebitis, by the way?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       31.

                                  JESSE
                    I don t know.

                                  ALICIA
                    Funny, I don t either.  
                          (to Nyholm)
                    Do you?

                                  NYHOLM
                      Objection--

      Will smiles.  Loves that Alicia s dishing it back to Nyholm.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Mrs. Florrick.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, your honor, just noting that 
                      LifeState scustomers are asked to 
                    accurately report conditions their 
                    own representation can t define--

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Sustained.  

      Kalinda, meanwhile, notices Nyholm texting on her cell phone.  
      Glances toward her curiously.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why didn t you check box number 
                    two, Mr. Willoughby?

                                  JESSE
                    Well, because it says  Circulatory 
                      Disorders/Problems.   The doctor 
                    said the heart palpitations were 
                    nothing to worry about-- they 
                    weren t a problem.  So I thought I 
                    was just being... accurate.   


      Nyholm s now crossing Jesse.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Let s chalk up question two to a 
                      misunderstanding.  But if an 
                    applicant outright lied about a 
                    relevant health issue, that would 
                    be grounds for voiding a policy, 
                    correct?  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       32.

                    Yes.  But I didn t.

      Will eyes Nyholm nervously.  What does she have?

                                  NYHOLM
                    Question ten on your application: 
                     During the past 12 months has any 
                    applicant smoked cigarettes, cigars, 
                    pipes, or used chewing tobacco?   
                    You answered no, correct?

                                  JESSE
                    Correct.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Good.  Thank you.  Now last fall, 
                    did you go on a fishing trip with a 
                    friend with the lovely name of 
                    Brent Boyle? 

      Jesse stares at her as Will sees his hesitation, jumps up:

                                  WILL
                    Objection, relevance.

                                  NYHOLM
                    I m getting there.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Overruled.  The witness may answer 
                    the question.

                                  JESSE
                    ...Yes.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Yes.  You did go on such a fishing 
                    trip?  Good. 

      Nyholm flashes her own visual aid on the screen: Brent 
      Boyle s Facebook page.  A picture of Jesse there.  

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    Here s you...  Annnnnd... here....

    She zooms into the photo... closer in on Jesse, his hand, his 
      fingers... holding a cigarette. 

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    Hmmm.  That looks like a cigarette 
                    you re smoking there.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       33.

      Alicia closes her eyes: damn.  Everything destroyed.  

                                  JESSE
                    That was-- it was only one.  I ve 
                    never been a regular smoker--

                                  NYHOLM
                    The question wasn t whether you 
                    were a regular smoker.

                                  JESSE
                    Yes, but I didn t think--

                                  NYHOLM
                    Your Honor, the question was 
                    simple; Mr. Willoughby s answer was 
                    a lie.

    Off Alicia and Will -- that hurt...


    All parties present for the ruling.

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Setting aside my sympathy for the 
                    plaintiff, this boils down to a 
                    simple matter of contract law.  

      Will stares down.  Depressed.  Alicia beside him, depressed 
      too.  

                                  JUDGE PARKS (CONT D)
                    Mr. Willoughby s material omissions 
                    gives LifeStatethe right to render 
                    this contract null and void. 

      Alicia glances back toward Jesse and Kate.  Pale with despair.

                                  JUDGE PARKS (CONT D)
                      Plaintiff s motion is denied.  The 
                    policy rescission stands.

                                  WILL
                    Your Honor, I would ask for an 
                    emergency motion to reconsider. 
                    Sending Kate Willoughby home 
                    without this surgery is a death

                    Will, you just lost at craps.  You 
                    don t make a deal with the 
                    croupier.  You just go home.

    She exits as Will and Alicia share a look.  Damn.  Will looks 
      over to Jesse and Kate, sitting quietly.  Shocked.  In their  
    own private hell.  An eerie, sad image.  Off Will, affected--


      It s late.  The hallways dark.  Almost everyone gone for the 
      night.   Just...


      ...Will in his office.  One light on.  On the phone:

                                  WILL
                    Look, if I were you, Patti, I d 
                    still want the certainty-- 

      Alicia comes to the door, peers in.  Will looks up toward 
      her, shakes his head: not going well.

                    Oh, come on.  Right, good-bye.    

    He hangs up.  Looks like hell.  Shoulder s slumped.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I blew it.

                    No, Jesse blew it, and he knows it.

    He swallows, emotionally.  Alicia eyes him.  Never seen him 
      like this before.  Eyes wet.  Wrecked.  Alicia approaches, 
      moved... 

                                  ALICIA
                    Will.  You did everything.

    But he shakes his head.  Alicia reaches out, touches his 
      shoulder-- a comforting gesture, whispering:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    You did.  Will.  Listen.  I know 
                    you did.

    He looks up at her.  Her hand still on his shoulder.  Alicia 
      leaving it there.  Their eyes holding each other.  

      A long moment.  

      Will takes a step toward her.  Alicia should back up, but she 
      doesn t.  She swallows.  Their faces inches away now.  And...  

      ...Will kisses her.  

      A lingering slow kiss.  A decade and a half of regret in that 
      kiss.  Then...

      ...Will stops, pulls back an inch.  Pauses.  The world seems 
    to hold its breath.  Will and Alicia s lips inches apart.  
      Then a whisper... 

                                  WILL
                    Your scarf, it s--

    But Alicia cuts him off, kissing him.  And Will returns it, 
      passionately.  Nothing soft and Hallmark about this.  
      Escalating. Then-- sanity rules.

    She can t.  She fuckin  can t.  Alicia pulls herself together, 
      lurching herself out the door as Will watches her go. 


      Alicia rushes quickly toward the elevator.  Hits the down 
      button urgently.  Come on.  Come on.  She looks back toward 
    the door, tempted.  DING.  Doors open.  She goes--


      Pushes the ground floor button.  The elevator moves.  Alicia 
      exhales.  Reeling.  What the hell just happened?


      Alicia heads across the garage.  Just get to the car.  She 
      reaches it, grabs for her keys, puts them in the door--

    And stops.  Can t bring herself to get in the car. 

    She closes her eyes.  Thinking.  Making a huge decision.  She 
      pulls the keys back out of the door and slips them in her 
      pocket.  Strides back through the parking lot toward--


      Alicia gets in the elevator.  Another moment of hesitation.  
      What the hell is she doing?  Her fingers hover over the 
      buttons.  27.  But she pushes... 28.  Will s floor.

    The doors close.  Alicia watches the digital numbers 
      increase.  14. 15. 16.  To herself...

                                  ALICIA
                    This is not a good idea.

      Floor 28.  The doors open; Alicia steps out to--


      Alicia heads down the hall, determined now, moving faster, 
      turns the corner, slightly startled by DIANE S ASSISTANT, 
      MARSHA, leaving for the night.

                                  ALICIA

      Alicia continues down the hall.  Reaches Will s door, one 
      last moment to back out... but she doesn t.  She opens the 
      door--


      Will s desk light on, his briefcase here.  But no Will. 


      Will s headed down the stairs to--


    He moves toward Alicia s office.  A light goes off inside.  
    He walks faster, getting to her.  But it s COURTNEY coming 
    out of the office.

                                  COURTNEY
                    You just missed her. 

                                  WILL
                    Oh.  Thanks.


    One floor up, Alicia stands in the hallway.  What the hell 
    was she thinking, anyway?  Moves back toward the elevator--


    As Will does the same.  Hits the elevator down button-- but 
    he just missed it.  The digital numbers show floor 26... 
      25... Alicia just seconds ahead of him.


      Alicia sits in her car.  Shaken.  Shocked at herself.  What 
    she almost did.  She gathers herself, starts the car.  


      Will stands in his office door, arms outstretched, bracing 
      himself, thinking about it.  He turns, sees Alicia s scarf, 
      still on the back of a chair from this morning.

      ...Alicia, driving through the garage, hears her phone 
      vibrating.  Pulls to a stop.  Takes her cell out.  Sees the 
      call is from  Will Gardner.   

    She pauses there in the garage, then hurriedly clicks off the 
      phone, screen going black.  No.


      Will sets down the phone.  Considers it.  Starts around his 
      desk to go home when the phone RINGS.  He moves toward it, 
      eager-- Alicia?

                                  WILL
                    Hello?


                                  JESSE
                    Mr. Gardner?  Please, we need your 
                    help.

      A panicked Jesse pacing in the hospital ER.


      Alicia.  She enters her apartment, very late night.  Quiet as 
      a tomb.  She goes to the kitchen.  The refrigerator.  She 
      opens it, then turns, sees in the pantry...

      ...light coming from Peter s door.  She goes to it, intently 
      now.  Determined.  Finding... 


      ...Peter in bed, t-shirt, reading.  

                                  PETER
                    Oh, hey.  

      Alicia nods, eyes him.  A look in her face.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Everything alright?

    She moves to the bed.  Grabs his face.  Kisses him.  Fumbles 
    for his shirt.  Pulling at it.  Quickly.  Not stopping to 
      think about it, as...  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #116     "Heart"     PINK COLLATED     2/8/10       39.

      ...a startled Peter looks toward a small silver chain and 
      CROSS he has hanging from a beside light.  It s working.  He 
      turns to his wife, hurriedly pulling his t-shirt off as 
      Alicia kisses his chest, pushes him down on the bed.  A 
      passionate whisper:

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Let s go to the bedroom.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Here.

      It s urgent.  Peter nods, and they kiss.  Alicia reaching for 
    the light.  And...

      WHOOSH-- Will charges through the ER door to find Jesse 
      sitting with a panicked Kate, clutching her stomach.  Having 
      contractions.  Jesse moves toward Will quickly--

                                  JESSE
                    We re hoping it s Braxton-Hicks, 
                    but they re still not...

      Will rushes to the admission desk, manned by a HEAVYSET WOMAN 
    in slow-motion.

                                  WILL
                    Excuse me.

    She doesn t look up.  Will reads her nametag:

      Alicia stands in the kitchen, drinking coffee.  Peter enters.  

                                  PETER

      Alicia smiles.  Thinks about it. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Are you becoming religious?

                                  PETER
                    I don t know.  I don t know what 
                    I m becoming.  But I want to 
                    change.

    Oh.  Alicia steps out of the way to let him by.  No, Peter 
      laughs at the misunderstanding.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    No.  Really change.

    Oh, Alicia smiles.  Knock-knock.  Someone at the door.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Probably Eli.  I ll get changed.

    The two pass each other.  Peter kisses her.  A hubby kiss.  
      Awkward because Alicia is moving on.  Still not in each 
      other s rhythms.  Alicia not sure what to think of that as 
    she goes to...   


      ...thefront door, pulling it open to reveal...

                    Hi.

      Will.  In last night s clothes.  Circles under his eyes, five 
      o clock shadow.  Fuck!  Alicia stares at him, shoots a look 
      over her shoulder.  A whisper:

                                  ALICIA
                    Um, Will.  You can t--

                                  PETER
                    Will.  

      A dressed and surprisingly cheery Peter heads toward them.  

                                  WILL
                    Hey, Peter.  Been a long time.  

      Alicia s frozen.  This couldn t be more awkward or loaded as 
    the two men shake hands.  

                                  PETER
                    A very long time.  Come on in.  


      Alicia, alone in the kitchen.  Post-heart-attack.  Placing 
      coffee mugs and pastries on a tray.  She hears the two male 
      voices in the other room.  And pauses there a second.  

    She laughs under her breath, the ludicrousness striking her. 
    My life is a soap opera.  Back to business, she puts the last 
      pastry on the tray.  Looks toward a planter in the window.  

      A flower there.  She picks it.  Puts it on the tray too.  
      Considers it.  A pretty flower alone on the tray.  A nice 
      touch.  And she starts into...  


      ...the living room where Will and a surprisingly magnanimous 
      Peter sit.  Alicia places the tray in front of them.  

                                  WILL
                    The surgery s tomorrow; we ve

                    You didn t need to do that.

      Alicia smiles, politely: lets that pass.  Will trying to read 
    any small inflection, movement of her eyes.

                                  PETER
                    So how can I help?

                                  WILL
                    Well, a company like LifeStateis 
                    motivated by two things: money and 
                    fear of a revoked license.

      Peter nods, considering it-- or taking a moment to relish the 
      power position.

                                  PETER
                    Get something concrete, I can get

                    Thank you.

      Will shoots a quick glance to Alicia, who averts her eyes.

                                  PETER
                    How s Alicia doing at work?

                    Alicia?  Good.  Great, really.  
                    Sorry for all the late hours.  

      Alicia looks between the two.  God, this is insanity 
      personified.

                                  PETER
                    Hey, I get it.  A lawyer s life.

                                  PETER
                    Yes-- I don t know.  The State s 
                    Attorney seems intent on retrying 
                    no matter how thin the evidence.

      Polite laughter.  As Will exits.  Peter turns from the closed

                    No problem.

                                  WILL
                    I should talk to her.

                    Mr. Gardner? 

      Will turns to see Diane s assistant leaning through his door.

                                  MARSHA (CONT'D)
                    Did Alicia get her laptop last 
                    night?

                                  WILL
                    Alicia...?

                                  MARSHA
                    After you left, she came back 
                    looking for her laptop in your 
                    office-- just making sure she got 
                    it.

      Will stares at her, thinking it through.  As Kalinda studies 
      him.  Will realizes he s being watched:

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, she got it.

    The Assistant nods, leaves, as Kalinda continues to study 
      Will.  Something going on.  Will can t hide it.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Okay.  So I ll go see... Pamela.


      Alicia sits in her office.  Staring straight ahead.  Work.  
      People rushing by-- with very simple lives.  Alicia sits up, 
      seeing...

      ...Will approach, but-- no-- it s not for her.  It s for 
      Cary.  He s going to Cary.  A few traded words.  Then Will 
      starts toward her.  Opens the door.

                                  WILL
                    Hi, sorry about this morning.

                                  ALICIA
                    You don t have to be sorry.

      Alicia nods, moves case files from a chair.  Will sits.

                                  ALICIA
                    So... you re my boss.

                                  WILL

                                  WILL
                    I know.  You came to my office.  
                    Last night.  After you went to your 
                    car, you came back to my office. 
                          (Alicia winces: damn)
                    Why?

                                  ALICIA
                    I... Will.  Help me out.  Please.  
                    We had-- whatever we had at

                    But you came back.

                                  ALICIA
                    I know, it was wrong.  

                                  WILL
                    Because you re married?

      Alicia just stares at him.  Her head exploding.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Okay.  I have a suggestion.

                    I don t want to make everywhere I

                    No.  I mean-- I didn t mean that--

                    Alicia.  It s fine.

      Alicia nods.  Okay.  Will gets up, goes to the door.

    And he s gone.  Alicia watches him go.


      Will and Kalinda charge down the hall, followed by Cary, the 
      other associates.

      Upscale.  This is a firm that isn t hurting for money.  Will 
      heads down the hall with JONATHAN DOBBS, 50s, distinguished.

                    I appreciate your willingness to 
                    follow through on this.

                                  JONATHAN DOBBS

                    Before we get into details, I d 
                    just like to have a quick 
                    conversation with her; make sure 
                    I m not misunderstanding anything. 
                    Do you mind waiting a minute?

      Dobbs smiles.  Knows this maneuver.

                                  JONATHAN DOBBS
                    That s fine.

    He takes a seat outside an office marked  PATRICIA NYHOLM.   
      Will knocks on the door.  No answer.  He goes--


      Nyholm s at her desk, facing away from Will, a black shoulder 
    bag next to her.  She glances over her shoulder to see Will.

                                  NYHOLM
                    Not a good time.

                                  WILL

                                  NYHOLM
                    Suit yourself.  

    She flips a switch.  The whir-whoosh of a machine.  An empty 
      baby bottle nearby.

                                  WILL
                    Is that--

      around, opting to negotiate over his shoulder.

                                  NYHOLM

                    Jonathan Dobbs.  The Insurance 
                      Commissioner.  

      Nyholm detaches the pump, fixes her shirt.  Places a Blue 
      Tooth in her ear...

                                  NYHOLM
                    Tammy, is there a man in the 
                    waiting room?...  Describe him.

      A second.  Nyholm hears what she doesn t want to hear.  
      Tosses the blue tooth on her desk.

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)

      Will and Alicia are back in the ER waiting room with Jesse.

    And Alicia meets Will s eye.  A long second.  Jesse inhales, 
      seeing a SURGEON approach, surgical mask on.  Expression 
      unreadable.

                    We ll find another way.

                                  NYHOLM
                    I doubt that.

      Nyholm turns to Kalinda, who finishes signing--

                                  NYHOLM (CONT D)
                    How dyou find it?

                                  KALINDA
                    Find what?  

                                  NYHOLM
                    PAM.

                                  KALINDA
                    Who s Pam?

      Nyholm smiles as Kalinda heads out.  Will signs as well as 
      Alicia.  Nyholm gathers the papers, goes to leave.  Looks back 
    to Will and Alicia-- a last chance to unnerve an opponent.

                                  NYHOLM
                    You two sure make a cute couple.

    She exits, leaving Will and Alicia alone.  They stand there.  
      Uncomfortably.  And Alicia exits.

      Alicia enters as Peter turns from the kitchen...  

                                  PETER
                    Hey, how d it go?
                          (off her look)
                    The insurance case.  Jonathan 
                    showed up, right?

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, right.  He did.  It did the 
                    trick.  Our client got the surgery-- 
                    went really well.  How was your 
                    day?

                                  PETER
                    Good.  Some more time with Pastor 
                    Isaiah.  He wants us to go to *
                    church.

                                  ALICIA
                    Well... that would be interesting.

      Alicia looks at the clock.

                                  PETER
                    Getting late.

      Alicia nods.  Hesitates.  He s watching her, waiting for her 
      move-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    Well.  Goodnight, Peter.

    And she goes into her bedroom alone.  Closes the door... 
      Peter stares at it and...
