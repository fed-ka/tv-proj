...where a CRUISE LINER can be seen fighting choppy waves as 
it methodically heads out to sea.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
You re pacing, Marc.

CUT TO:


...as the CAMERA PANS past a bathing suit clad couple 
canoodling in the hot-tub, to find the aforementioned...

MARC (AGE 33)
We shouldn t have taken this trip.

...shifting in his shoes in front of the owner of the FEMALE 
VOICE, Marc s wife ANNA (31), who sits in a deck chair, below 
a large observation window, her head between her knees. 

ANNA
I m fine.

MARC
But what if you re not? What if you get 
into trouble and we re in the middle of 
the Caribbean and we can t get to a--  

ANNA
I m fine. The baby is fine...

Now Anna sits up, revealing... a watermelon belly, which 
houses what looks-to-be a 7 MONTH-OLD FETUS.

ANNA
...though he s kicking the crap out of me.
(good-natured, re: her discomfort)
Its sea-sickness... or lack of 
sleep... or maybe its just YOU walking 
back and forth like a caged puma.

They share a smile.

MARC
I m sorry. Its just after 
everything we ve gone through...

ANNA*
(with a chuckle)*
Who s this WE you speak of? *Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft2.

ANNA (CONT'D)
How many times did YOU get stuck in *
the ass with a 3 inch needle?*

Marc laughs. Anna reaches out to touch him.*

ANNA*
Dr. Gunner said,  Its safe. Go have *
fun while you still can. *
(rolling her neck, deep breath)*
See, I m starting to feel better alrea--*

And that's when... BANG... A VIOLENT COLLISION rocks the boat, 
sending Marc sprawling, his head SLAMMING AGAINST THE DECK.

CLOSE ON: MARC 
...a TRICKLE OF BLOOD from a forehead laceration in his eyes 
as he staggers to his feet, stumbling to the railing to see...

BELOW, IN THE WATER, A CHEMICAL BARGE
...that's just CRASHED INTO THE CRUISE LINER.

BACK ON: MARC
...spinning, his eyes catching sight of dozens of injured and 
confused passengers before finally locking on...

ANNA
...lying on the deck, the observation window that was directly 
behind her having exploded into shards that flew like 
shrapnel, imbedding in her body in dozens of separate places.

QUICK CUTS,  WHAT MARC SEES OF HIS BELOVED WIFE : 
Anna s blood spreading across a pool towel... a glass shard 
protruding alongside Anna s exposed collarbone... Anna's 
eyes, quivering in shock.

BACK ON: MARC
...as he opens his mouth to call for help, but, instead, 
produces little more than a HIIIIIIIISSSISS, which is when he 
realizes that HE HAS A SINGLE PIECE OF GLASS STICKING OUT OF 
HIS THROAT, the air escaping as it bypasses his vocal chords.  

As Marc starts to hyperventilate, extracting the glass and 
plugging the hole with his finger so he can scream...

MARC
(raspy, desperate)
NEED A DOCTOR! OVER HERE!

...THE CAMERA is suddenly on the move, PUSHING ACROSS THE 
DECK, FLYING THROUGH HALLWAYS and DESCENDING STAIRS, before 
finally PAUSING as it arrives at the...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft3.




...which is a 166,000 square foot, stand-alone building, 
located under blue-skies and palm trees, on the sun-soaked 
campus of Jackson Memorial Hospital. 

The CAMERA FOLLOWS a woman, who we'll soon learn is FIRST-
YEAR TRAUMA RESIDENT DR. SERENA WARREN (29), as she 
simultaneously kicks her skateboard, texts on her blackberry, 
sips a triple-vente, iced frappa-Starba-something, and 
grooves to the salsa beat emanating from her Ipod earbuds. 

As Warren glides through Ryder s automatic front doors...

CUT TO:


...where elevator doors open to reveal Dr. Zambrano leading...

DR. WARREN 
(wide eyed and WOW)
...naked. Buck naked. Stark raving, 
fleshy, birthday-suit...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(still reeling)
...I was there, Serena...

DR. WARREN
...first day on my trauma rotation at 
Hopkins the attending said that, like, 
60% of trauma doctors wash out...

DR. ZAMBRANO
...in the first 5 years.

DR. WARREN
One guy... he started speaking in 
tongues during a multiple gunshot 
victim. Totally freaky.
(can t stop going over it)
But Rayner? He s been around since 
before trauma was housed in its own 
building, right? I mean, he s run 
Bravo since the beginning?

DR. ZAMBRANO
(changing subjects)
Hit the door.

Dr. Warren, nods, hitting a SQUARE BUTTON, triggering 
automatic doors that open up onto the...


...where they meet up with NURSE (CAROL) and an INTERN who 
wait expectantly as a HELICOPTER BANKS IN FRONT OF A GROVE OF 
PALM TREES and starts to slowly lower itself for a landing.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(seeing the Copter touch down)
PATIENT S NAME IS ANNA!
(surging forward)
HEADS DOWN AND GO!

Now Zambrano, Warren, Nurse Carol and the Intern surge forward, 
arriving as the helicopters side door as it s opened by...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft15.



TRANSPORT ATTENDANT
(yelling over the din)
THIRTY-ONE YEAR OLD BLAST INJURY WITH 
HYPOTENSION, GRAVID TENDER ABDOMEN!

The Transport Attendant shifts positions to reveal Anna, on a 
crash-board, her neck stabilized in a brace, her body covered 
neck-to-toe in a red thermal blanket. She s conscious, if only 
barely, her many lacerations are perfunctorily bandaged

DR. WARREN
SHE S PREGNANT, RIGHT?

TRANSPORT ATTENDANT
VERY OBSERVANT, DOC.

DR. ZAMBRANO
HEAR ANY FETAL HEART TONES?

TRANSPORT ATTENDANT
ITS A HELICOPTER, I CAN T EVEN 
HEAR MYSELF THINK!

As all transfer Anna from the helicopter onto the gurney...

ANNA S POV, LOOKING UP AT THE FACE OF MERCY, IN THIS CASE:

DR. ZAMBRANO
Try not to worry, Anna. We re going 
to make you better now.

And now Zambrano pushes Anna, surging back into the...


ANNA
The baby-- Is the baby--

DR. ZAMBRANO
We ll find that out soon as we 
can, but I need you to stay as 
still as possible.

DR. WARREN
(whispered, to Zambrano)
Her pain s got to be high. You want 
to give her 50 of Fent?

DR. ZAMBRANO
(whispered, looking at the 
chart, shake of the head)
BP s too low.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft16.

DR. ZAMBRANO (CONT'D)
(then to Anna)
Can you tell me where you are, Anna?

ANNA
Ber-- Bermuda?

And that wrong answer prompts Dr. Zambrano to lift up the 
blanket to get her first look at...

ANNA S BODY
...which is riddled with dozens of glass-filled lacerations, 
all discharging blood in drips and rivulets. She might as 
well be the victim of grenade attack in a war zone.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(brave face, back to Anna)
You re doing really great, Anna.

...and now they re onto the...


...past a phalanx of press to a pacing, agitated Marc.

TUCK
Here you go.

Marc takes the water, but doesn t drink, all his attention 
focused back towards the trauma unit.

TUCK
Marc? Its Marc, right?

MARC
(he s not listening)
When can I see Anna?
(then, increasing his worry)
I heard some nurse say you had a 
doctor walk out this morning... 
just quit and left on you?

TUCK
(calm, never losing eye 
contact with Marc)
Your wife has serious injuries, but 
the doctors are working, which means 
they believe they can make her better.

MARC
(only hearing the doubt)
 Believe ?

Marc inches forward, like he wants to go back inside, but 
Tuck instinctively moves to stay in his path.

TUCK
Look, I m partial, but those are 
the best and the brightest; the 
rock stars of medicine. Ryder 
here... biggest trauma catchment in 
the country... most critical 
patient load. If trauma surgeons 
are rock stars, these guys are the 
Rolling Stones.

Marc takes a deep breath, Tuck s influence allowing the first 
non-panicked thought to fight it s way through.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft25.



MARC
Anna and I saw the Stones in New 
York in 2006. At MSG.

TUCK
Gotta love the Stones, huh?

As Marc nods, finally taking that drink of water...

CUT TO:


...where he talks to a SECURITY GUARD, who points toward...

CUT TO:


...where Tuck walks up to a MAN IN HIS LATE-FORTIES who 
stares out at the surf.

TUCK
Hey, are you Deepesh s brother?

HEMENDRA
Hemendra, yes. How is he?

TUCK
Considering his injuries... fighting 
hard. But we re having a hell of a 
time controlling his pain.
(delicate)
I don t want to violate your 
brother s privacy, but, it'd help 
to know if there s any reason his 
body would be used to narcotics?Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft31.



HEMENDRA
(staring, confused)
Used to? What would cause that?

TUCK
A tolerance to drugs.

HEMENDRA
Prescription drugs?

TUCK
Any drugs.

HEMENDRA
(brow furrowed, taken aback)
You mean,  Is he an addict?  Is 
that-- Who said he was an addict.

TUCK
I m just guessing based on his non 
reaction to the pain medication-- 

HEMENDRA
Maybe you ve got the wrong medication.
(then, more forceful)
Its not drugs.

Tuck turns, starts to leave then...

TUCK
(this is a lie)
Look I wouldn t have said anything... 
but I thought I recognized him...
(a risk)
...from a meeting.

HEMENDRA
A meeting?

TUCK
(but THIS is the truth)
AA. NA. Sexaholics anonymous. You name 
it, I ve stood up and said,  Hello, my 
name is Tuck and I'm an addict. 
(then)
I know the importance of  Anonymous , 
so I wouldn t bring it up if I--

HEMENDRA
It could be heroin.
(pulling out a pocket knife, 
fiddling, his nervous habit)Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft32.

HEMENDRA (CONT'D)
He said-- promised he was getting 
clean-- and I-- I just don t want 
him to get fired.

TUCK
This stays with me and the doctors.

Hemendra nods, thank you.

TUCK
One more thing? Your brother keeps 
saying,  Meraa Peelaa Fooel  We were 
told that means,  My Yellow Flower .

HEMENDRA
 My Yellow ROSE.  Its his pet name 
for his wife Nishta. Back in Mumbai.

Tuck takes that in...

TUCK
I ll keep you posted on your 
brother s condition.

As Tuck nods,  Froggering  his way back across Collins Drive...

CUT BACK TO:


...where Marc, sitting on a bench, looks up to see Tuck 
holding a pack of vending machine sandwich in his hand...

TUCK
Have you eaten anything, Marc?

MARC
Not much of an appetite. 
(looking away, clearly exhausted)
This morning Anna and I are on 
vacation... discussing our baby...

CUT TO:


MARC
...our son... after Anna s late 
grandfather.

CUT BACK TO:


...where Dr. C., Warren and Tuck have found a picnic table with a 
view of the sky and the sound of the surf.

Dr. Proctor exits the bathroom, staring at his blackberry.

DR. PROCTOR
Want the good news or the bad?Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft58.



TUCK
Let s try the good.

DR. PROCTOR
Based on my e-mail, it appears I ve 
been reassigned to Bravo Team.

DR. C.
And the bad?

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Based on his e-mail... he s stuck 
working with you, Chris.

And now all turn to see... Dr. Zambrano walking toward them.

DR. C.
(big smile)
Well, well. Look what the cat--

...but before Dr. C. can finish that thought...

DR. ZAMBRANO
Oh, bite me, you Redneck.

Laughter from Dr. C. and Tuck, as well as a smile from...

DR. WARREN
I m getting another round.

As Warren heads to the bar...*

TUCKDR. PROCTOR
(following Warren)(following Warren)
I got this one.No, no. New guy pays.

...leaving Zambrano and Dr. C. alone.

DR. ZAMBRANO
Come on.

DR. C.
What?

DR. ZAMBRANO 
You know you want to say it.

DR. C.
Say what?

She waits... he smiles... OK he ll say it...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft59.



DR. C.
You kicked my ass in there today. 
Tomorrow... we shall see.

DR. ZAMBRANO
I may be a mess with a microphone 
and a stack of note cards...

DR. C.
MAY BE a mess?

The two share a smile, then...

DR. ZAMBRANO
You're an attention whore, Chris... 
you sweat arrogance and entitlement... 
you re a pain in my backside, but I 
respect your work as much as anyone 
I've worked with and if YOU ever need 
saving... I'll be there.

As Dr. C. nods, accepting her compassion...

CUT TO:

THE END OF THE BAR
...where Dr. Proctor and Warren stand waiting for drinks.

DR. WARREN
Y know There are a lot of rumors 
about you. About your story... where 
you came from... why you re here...

DR. PROCTOR
(knowing she s seen it)
...and then there s that scar.
(a moment, is he going to tell)
Walking to my car after an ordinary 
day in an average week and I just went 
down. Massive heart attack. Rushed to 
trauma. Cut open. Pronounced dead on 
the table. 38 seconds. But I came 
back... after 38 seconds I m back... 
but different.
(eyeing Warren)
So, you want to know why am I here? 
I m here to live.

Now their drinks arrive, Proctor grabbing beers for all... 
Warren carrying a tray with tequila shots... both of them 
meeting up with Tuck, who has ginger ale for himself...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft60.



DR. WARREN
(passing out tequila)
So, what are we drinking to?

DR. C.
To saving every soul in South Beach.

TUCK
To Bravo Team.

DR. WARREN
(a look to Proctor)
To second chances.

DR. ZAMBRANO*
