      He's in a PUBLIC SQUARE.  Surrounded by COPS, ONLOOKERS, 
      REPORTERS.  It's Chaos.  Squad Cars, dozens of drawn GUNS.

      A Strategic Response Unit cop in TACTICAL UNIFORM, tense but 
      composed, tries to reason with the Gunman.

                                  SRU NEGOTIATOR
                    You know why we're all here? It's

                      understand?  Help.  But you.  You

      Sound of A HORN BLARING, LOUD.


      A POWERFUL MALE HAND presses a car's horn.

      WORDSWORTH, 30s, waits in a suburban driveway, impatient.  
      He's an SRU cop in street clothes.  A boxer-nosed hoser, 
      built like a truck, with a surprisingly gentle soul.

      They're joined by two more SRU members:

      ROLAND CRAY, 36, strong, hardworking, driven.  His emotions 
      are his business -- but once he knows you he'll do anything 
      for you.

      And SPIKE SCHARFE, late 20s, athletic, with an easygoing 
      charm.  Still the team rookie after two years.

      POLICE CRUISERS everywhere, COPS and DETECTIVES crouching for 
      cover.

      ONLOOKERS, restrained by COPS, brandish cell phone cameras.

      TV JOURNALISTS jostle for position.

      POLICE DOGS strain on their leashes.

      The Plaza is in CHAOS.

      In the eye of the storm:

      Goran holds his gun to the head of his terrified hostage.

      The Plaza is in CHAOS.

      In the eye of the storm:

      The Gunman holds his gun to the head of his hostage.  He's 
      nervous, shifting his weight back and forth.  He yells at a 
      DETECTIVE who's been trying to negotiate through a bullhorn. 

                                  GORAN
                    Go vori im da otidje!

      The detective lowers the bullhorn.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    This is going nowhere.

      INSPECTOR STAINTON, 40s, conservative, greying, watches as 
      the SRU team approaches.

      The team vaults over the cordon and jogs toward the scene.

                    Spike, Wordy, you're with me.

      Roland, Carl and Shakes split off.

                    No.  I don't think he speaks

                                  SGT. PARKER

                    How long you been here?

      Stainton glares at him.  


      Ed jogs past a couple of Uniforms, revolvers drawn, watching 
      the action from behind a mailbox.

      The Uniform looks at Ed blankly.  Ed points across the 
      square.

      The Uniform looks.  Another cop, behind Goran, has got his 
      revolver pointed at the Uniform.

      Parker tries to make sense out of Stainton and the Detective.  
      Wordy and Spike stand by.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    I think it's Yugoslavian.  
                    Croatian.

      Inspector Stainton strides off, visualizing witty retorts.   

      Parker edges closer to Goran, palms open.  Wordy and Spike 
      cover him with STEEL SHIELDS and ASSAULT WEAPONS.

      Jules races past a ventilation shaft toward her rooftop *
      position. 


      Ed pushes open the rooftop door.

      He creeps low along the graveled rooftop and peers over the 
      edge of the building.  

      Ed's POV:  Up high, Goran and Hostage are small -- a pinwheel 
      in the middle of chaos.

      Ed STRAPS HIMSELF to the ledge.                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  27.



      The Shaggy-Haired Man works his way to the front of the 
      police cordon.

      He takes in the scene.  Immediately spots the SRU team 
      members: the negotiator, closest by; two more with shields, 
      and machine guns.  

      The Shaggy-Haired Man's eyes travel skyward, knowing where to 
      look.  On top of the east building: gloved hands, LASER 
        RANGEFINDER.  The Observer Sniper.


      Jules's POV.  On top of the east building.  She's on the left *
      side of Goran.  A clear view of Sgt. Parker below.  She talks

      Goran continues to shout.


      Everyone's eyes are glued to Goran. 

      Not the Shaggy-Haired Man's.  He scans from the top of the 
      east building to the top of the north.  Finds what he's

      The rooftop door opens.  Inspector Stainton, pleased to be 
      back in charge, walks out with a couple of UNIFORMS.

      Their voices are muffled, far-away.  

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    Tape it up.  This is a crime scene.  
                    Don't speak to the Subject Officer.

      The uniforms start taping.  Stainton stands over Ed.  

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    Give me your weapons.  Rifle and 
                    Glock.

      Stainton snaps on rubber gloves.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  39.

                    Let's go, constable.

      Ed, without looking, hands the rifle to Stainton.  Stainton 
      empties the ammunition.  A uniform holds out a plastic 
      evidence bag: Stainton places everything inside.  The bag is 
      sealed.  Same process with the Glock.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    Gloves too.  Residue.

      Ed's gloves go in another bag.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    You're under investigation.  This 
                    is the drill.  

      Ed looks up at him.  Numb.

      Inspector Stainton leads Ed towards Sgt. Parker.

      Ed's POV, SLOW-MO tunnel vision:  Goran's feet.  Orange 
      blanket, blood seeping.  

      Reporters, Cops, Medics milling around.

      The hostage, in shock.  Seated on the back of an ambulance, a 
      medic wiping her face.  

      Ed stares as the medic wipes BLOOD from her face and hair.

      Jules exits her building, eyes hunting for Ed.  Her eyes land *
      on him, concerned.

      Ed's POV: He sees Dr Luria and another MEDIC holding up the 
      devastated SON.  

                                  SON
                          (sobbing)
                    Tata... my Tata... What am I going *
                    to do?  What am I going to do?*

      Ed walks on, shaken, led by Stainton...  

      ...and briefly LOCKS EYES with the Shaggy-Haired Man.  The 
      Man watches as Ed's escorted off like a criminal.


      Nearby, a SRU CAR pulls up next to Sgt. Parker.  SRU 
      Commander Holleran, late 40's, fit, steps out.  Seeing him, 
      Dr Luria approaches, as well as the female SRU SCRIBE.   






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  41.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Jesus, Gregory, that went down 
                    fast.  Your scribe's got the notes?

                                  SGT. PARKER 
                    Yeah.

      She puts the INCIDENT NOTES into an ENVELOPE.  SEALS it.  
      Hands them over.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Fine.  Thanks.

                                  DR. LURIA
                    By the book as far as I'm 
                      concerned, Norm.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (O.S.)
                      Technically, that'll be for SIU to 
                    decide.

      Commander Holleran recognizes the voice.  He turns to face 
      Inspector Stainton, arriving with Ed.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Thank you, Stainton.
                          (to Ed)
                    Ed.  This was you?

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    Subject officers are not--

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    --Yes thank you Inspector.       
                          (to Ed)
                    Good job, constable.

      Ed is silent.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    Let's go.  Parker, you too.

      The three of them turn and head towards the vehicles.

                                  SGT. PARKER
                    Eddy.  How you doing?

      Stainton slides open the door of a police van for them.

                                  STAINTON
                    Come on.  You're both--




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  42.

                                  SGT. PARKER
                    How about you just plug your 
                    earholes while I ask my buddy here 
                    how he's doing--

                                  ED
                    --Fine... I'm fine.

      They settle into the van.  Sgt. Parker looks hard at Ed.

                                  SGT. PARKER
                    Ed.  Good job.

      Ed looks out the window.  The van pulls away.  


      Jules, Wordsworth, Spike, and Roland watch the van disappear.  *

      They pack up in silence.  Jules turns and begins breaking *
      down her sniper rifle, covering her concern.  Then senses 
      someone behind her.

                                    SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
                    Hey.  Saw the whole thing. 

      She looks up and sees the Shaggy-Haired Man.

                                  SAM 
                    I'm Sam.  

      Jules keeps working, not into groupies.*

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    Sam Braddock.

                                  JULES*
                    Good for you.

                                  SAM 
                    Don't see Lady Snipers too often.  
                    That's kinda sexy.  What's that, a 
                    Remmy 700?  Sweet.  Crisp trigger 
                    on her, eh?  I got a vintage Colt.

      Jules straightens.  Turns.  *

                    Pearl grips.  It was my Dad's.  
                    Here, want to see? 

      He reaches into his jacket --

      ROLAND, SPIKE AND WORDY race over, weapons drawn.

                    HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM! HANDS

                                  SAM
                    Okay.  Okay.  Whoa.

      He raises his hands.  He's holding a PHOTOGRAPH.

      Commander Holleran races over, alarmed, followed by Parker.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Lower your weapons!  Easy!  Easy!

      Sam shows the photo to the team, landing on Jules: his DAD *
      WITH HIS PEARL-GRIP GUN.

                                  SAM
                    Pearl grips.  See.  That's my Dad.

      They lower their weapons to half-mast.

                    Braddock.  What the hell are you 
                    doing?  You were supposed to meet

                    Sorry.  Heard it on the radio,

      Holleran swallows his annoyance.
