      FADE IN:


      INT. LAND OF THE DEAD - DESOLATE BUILDING - DAY

      Some kind of metaphysical way-station.  A place without time,
      where everything takes an eternity and happens in an instant. 
      PICK UP edgy fringe rocker ERIC DRAVEN, a lonely man in deep
      despair.  As Draven wakes up in a pool of water under a shower
      of glass, he pulls off his shirt to check himself for wounds. 

      Something flutters across his field of vision with a WHOOSH. 
      The spirit crow lands on a nearby sign, head darting about.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Where did you come from?

      The crow shoots past him.  Draven watches, decides --
      desperate -- that he will follow this living thing.


      EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD - FORESTED AREA - DAY

      Elements of man's presence give way to a lush rainforest. 
      The spirit crow waits on a tree branch for Draven before
      taking off again.  Draven plunges ahead until he emerges
      from the dense canopy.  Draven is floored by what he sees:

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly?


      EXT. THE BRIDGE BETWEEN WORLDS - ON SHELLY - DAY

      She's Draven's girlfriend, a beautiful woman in her early
      twenties.  She's standing about half-way across a suspension
      bridge, spanning a gorge, high above turbulent waters.  

      As Draven runs toward her, past the spirit crow, the bridge
      sways under his weight.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly?

      Draven arrives, and the two look at each other, almost afraid
      to believe.  They pull each other into a crushing embrace.

                                      DRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    It's you.  It's really you.

                                      SHELLY
                    Yes, yes.  I've been waiting.  It
                    seems like forever.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   2.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I can't remember anything.  It's
                    like I just woke up here.

                                      SHELLY
                    Time isn't the same here.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Where are we?  Everything looks
                    familiar but I don't recognize
                    anything.

                                      SHELLY
                    It's a Land of the Dead.  It has to
                    be.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I thought it was a nightmare.  It
                    really happened, didn't it?

      Shelly nods.  Draven is overwhelmed by his guilt, holds her
      out at arm's length so he can look at her.

                                      DRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    God, Shelly, I am so sorry...

                                      SHELLY
                    We're together.  That's all that
                    matters.

      The spirit crow appears before Draven and Shelly, perching
      on the handrail.  Draven nods in its direction.

                                      DRAVEN
                    He led me to you.

                                      SHELLY
                    A crow?

      Shelly's face falls.  Draven reads her worry.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Why?  What's it mean?

                                      SHELLY
                    It's a legend.  Something about a
                    second chance.

      While reaching out to Draven, Shelly is seemingly drawn
      farther away, as if pulled by some kind of supernatural force. 
      From Shelly's POV, however, it is Draven who's distant.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   3.

                                      SHELLY (CONT'D)
                    Set things right, Eric.  I'll wait
                    for you...

      But Shelly is gone.  Draven lets out a PLAINTIVE WAIL as the
      CAMERA PULLS OUT revealing, ultimately, the immensity of
      where Draven is, and what a small piece of it he is.  Alone. 
      So very alone. 

      Back close, the spirit crow simply cocks its head to the
      side, then takes off in soaring flight, diving from the
      bridge.  Draven, in terrible pain and confusion, watches.


      DRAVEN'S POV - THE CROW

      Plummeting toward the rushing waters below.  Disappearing in
      a COSMIC RIPPLE, leaving nothing but rocks and water, two
      hundred feet down.


      RESUME BRIDGE BETWEEN THE WORLDS

      Stunned, Draven hops up onto the thick steel cable from which
      the bridge is suspended, balancing on it like a tight rope. 
      Arms extended for balance, feet together, looking very much
      like a crow himself, he stares down, trying to fathom what
      he has seen.  Everything, it seems, disappears into nothing. 
      Beyond comprehension, he closes his eyes, balancing, until...


      DRAVEN DIVES OFF THE BRIDGE!

      Free-falling, arms outstretched like a bird in flight. 
      Draven, too, disappears into the COSMIC RIPPLE rather than
      crash into the water below. 


      INT. URBAN BARRIO - DAY

      The yearly holiday where the dead are honored.  Special foods,
      songs, candles, religious rites, feasts.  It's native Indian
      blended with Spanish conquistador, complete with costumes
      and Halloween-like make-up.

      Ominously, the celebration now becomes deathly quiet as a
      RUMBLE rolls from the distance until it now seems quite
      literally BENEATH THE GROUND the people stand on.  LIGHT
      COLLECTS IN THE SKY above them. 

                                      MEXICAN WOMAN
                    It's a miracle! 

      The woman faints, her knees buckling as she witnesses:       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   4.

      DRAVEN'S APPEARANCE!

      Out of the COSMIC RIPPLE, Draven materializes before our
      eyes with the force of nature, not the gentle hand of God. 
      He comes down hard on the muddy ground.  The first image
      Draven sees is:


      THE CROW MASK!

      By this, we mean the stark feature-film version of the full-
      on Crow make-up (not the look that will become our signature). 
      Like a mad mime with a bleached white face and red eye
      teardrops, the face stands over Draven.

                                      SPANISH CROW
                    Se or, Se or!  Est s bien?  Qu  pasa? 
                    Are you okay?

      Draven recoils in fear.  He has no idea what is happening to
      him or where he is.  The Crow who just scared the crap out
      of Draven is someone made up in garish face paint as part of
      a holiday skit.  He turns to his fellow celebrants: 

                                      SPANISH CROW (CONT'D)
                    He has crossed the worlds between
                    death and life.

      We notice the spirit crow watching over Eric Draven who --
      for better or worse -- is back on solid Earth, as we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                      END OF PROLOGUE      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   5.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      A girl, SARAH MOHR, a young 14, the picture of thrift store
      cast-off street-chic and all attitude, grinds through the
      pavement on her skateboard.  Finally, she flips the board
      up, and begins to walk across the grass, stopping at two
      headstones.  Based on their inscriptions, they belong to Eric
      Draven and Shelly Webster.  She pulls off a weathered back-
      pack, pulls a small bouquet of flowers from it.

                                      SARAH
                    Big Mikey paid for them, but I picked
                    'em.

      Sarah places the flowers at the foot of the graves. 

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Happy anniversary...  I guess...

      Sarah stands there in silent contemplation.  Finally, she
      puts to words her thoughts.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I hate the people that did this to
                    you.  I hate them so much I hate
                    even thinking about hating them.
                          (self-aware)
                    And what I really hate is I'm talking
                    to a couple of stupid graves.

                                      ALBRECHT (O.S.)
                    If only they'd talk back, huh?

      It's DETECTIVE DARYL ALBRECHT, an African-American cop.

                                      SARAH
                          (angry)
                    Hey, Daryl, quit following me, okay?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You're supposed to be in school.

                                      SARAH
                    There's no classes today.  It's a
                    national holiday.

                                      ALBRECHT
                      Halloween?  Maybe when you get to be
                    Mayor.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   6.

                                      SARAH
                    Got that right.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    C'mon.  I'll give you a ride.

                                      SARAH
                          (shakes head)
                    I want to stay here and feel sorry
                    for myself, okay?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No, Sarah.  It's not okay.

                                      SARAH
                    Look.  These were my friends, not
                    yours. 

      Albrecht nods his agreement.  Still, he's made a commitment
      to himself to care about this kid.  He awkwardly pats the
      top of Draven's headstone.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You get five minutes.  I'll wait in
                    the car.

      Albrecht turns and leaves. 


      EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

      Draven is on the move now, in an urban environment.  He hears
      the sound of DISTANT THUNDER.  Taken away from his thoughts
      by the sounds of a domestic quarrel in progress.

      A sports utility vehicle has stopped at an intersection. 
      The driver, MITCH, has the passenger window down and is
      screaming toward the street.

                                      MITCH
                    Get in the car!

      But the young woman on the street keeps walking.  This is
      CYNTHIA and she's scared, her eyes still wet from crying.

                                      CYNTHIA
                    Just leave me alone.

      Mitch jumps out of the car and moves to confront her.

                                      MITCH
                    This is the last time I'm gonna say
                    this.  Get in the damn car!      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   7.

      Mitch grabs Cynthia by the arm and begins to pull her toward
      the vehicle.  She struggles but is no match for his strength.


      DRAVEN'S POV - CYNTHIA / SHELLY

      As the altercation continues, Draven -- in quick FLASHCUTS
      alternating between seeing Cynthia as herself and as Shelly
      struggling against Mitch.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Draven -- still amnesic -- is unable to process the meaning
      of this profoundly disturbing sequence, yet still feeling
      the anger and rage welling up inside him.  It is at that
      exact moment that Mitch, in a masterstroke of bad timing,
      sees Draven looking at him and decides to look for a
      scapegoat.

                                      MITCH
                    What are you lookin' at?

                                      DRAVEN
                    You.  She's afraid of you.

      Mitch pushes Cynthia away, turns his attention on Draven,
      grabbing him and throwing him against a nearby vehicle.  He
      closes, pushing Draven hard in the chest.

                                      MITCH
                    You're the one who oughta be afraid.

      Draven starts to look down but then just racks the guy in a
      quick succession of blows, battering him to the ground,
      surprising himself by his aggressive fearlessness. 

                                      DRAVEN
                    Not anymore.
                          (to Cynthia)
                    He doesn't love you... 

      Mitch has gotten to his feet.  He reaches through the window
      of his SUV and pulls out the anti-theft "Club" and raises it
      behind Draven.  He pounds him on the back, dropping Draven
      to his knees.  Cynthia shrieks:

                                      CYNTHIA
                    You're going to kill him!

      Draven, however, has the hint of a smile as he rises from
      his knees and turns to face Mitch.  Mitch takes another swing,
      but Draven catches the club in mid-swing.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   8.

                                      MITCH
                    Who are you, man?

      Draven considers this.  He's not sure.  Then:

                                      DRAVEN
                    I'm nobody.  Just like you.

      Draven pitches Mitch backward, spins and kicks him on the
      way down.  During the brief fight, Cynthia jumps in the SUV
      and takes off down the street.  Draven watches then turns
      back to Mitch who scrambles away from Draven, scared for his
      life, running in the opposite direction.

      Again, the spirit crow flutters past camera.  A beat of
      hesitation, then Draven follows, eyeing a bead on it, his
      only link to what's happening.


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Albrecht drives his unmarked car, Sarah looks out the window.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    So how's your mom?

                                      SARAH
                    Darla's sleeping in late, as usual.
                          (dry)
                    Up all night baking cookies.

      Albrecht sees something on the street, pulls the car sharply
      to the side.  Sarah reaches reflexively for the door handle.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No.  You stay.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm not your dog. 

      Albrecht ignores this as he pulls over to cut off TIN-TIN
      who, literally in mid-step, spins around and begins walking
      in the other direction.  Albrecht jumps out and intercepts
      Tin-Tin.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Hey, Tin-Tin.  Tell me all about
                    your Halloween plans. 
                          (pointedly)
                    Since last year was so much fun.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    I don't have to say nothin' to you.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   9.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You got lots to say.  You're a smart
                    guy --

                                      TIN-TIN
                    -- I'm not smart at all.  Ask anybody.

      Albrecht grabs Tin-Tin by the shoulder.  Spins him to the
      car, pats him down for a weapon.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm not carryin'.

      Albrecht indicates a mean chain, wrapped around his mid-
      section.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    That's fashion, man.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    And I'm Tommy-damn-Hilfiger.  Now,
                    about the reason you're not carrying --
                    that new B-and-E you're up on. 

                                      TIN-TIN
                    What about it?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Three strikes, that's what.  Give up
                    the others, we'll cut a deal with
                    the DA.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    I got a public defender says not to
                    talk to you.

                                      ALBRECHT
                          (hard)
                    Those two kids -- Webster and Draven --
                    did not deserve to die.  I got you
                    casing the same building twenty-four
                    hours earlier. 

                                      TIN-TIN
                    You had that a year ago.  I'm walkin',
                    man.  You got no right to harass me. 
                    I'm walkin'...

      Tin-Tin pulls free of Albrecht's grip.  Albrecht, knowing
      he's got nothing to hold him with, has to let him go but
      still gets in his parting shot.       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 10.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Okay, you think about it, Tin, because
                    when I nail this -- and I will --
                    you'll want to be helping the good
                    guys...

      From Albrecht's look, he may not believe his own threat.


      EXT. CITY STREET - PAWN SHOP - DAY

      Where Draven moves through the landscape, alone among a throng
      of strangers.  Draven stops as the spirit crow lands in front
      of a store.  "Gideon's Pawn Shop."  He looks in the window. 
      Among the items on display: an electric guitar.  The store
      owner, a pear-shaped man with food on his shirt, GIDEON,
      observes.

                                      GIDEON
                    You can't afford that one.  Got
                    another one inside though...

      Draven shakes his head, not interested.  The spirit crow
      takes off, destination across the street, down the block, an
      abandoned building, just another piece of urban decay.


      EXT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

      The spirit crow lands on the window sill of the huge circular
      window.  Looks in.  As this happens:


      CROWVISION - INSIDE THE LOFT

      Showing us a view of an abandoned loft, through the
      distortion. 


      EXT. CITY STREET - ON DRAVEN - DAY

      Reacts to the vision, matched in his own view to a high shard
      of broken glass which becomes:


      INT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

      Where Draven, in this small studio, appears to be giving a
      private concert to SHELLY WEBSTER (whose spirit image we saw
      on the bridge).  Call Draven's song, "Seven Circles",
      accompanied by an electric guitar, plugged into a small room
      amplifier.  There's a rawness to the voice, and the song
      itself has a real tension beneath its sentiment.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 11.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I love you in whispers, I love you
                    in screams, I love you in waking, I
                    love you in dreams...

      From the looks of the place, we have a rock musician and a
        photographer sharing space here.  Shelly is actually recording
      this performance on a video camera.  She sets the camera on
      top of a TV just so, then moves into frame to be with Draven. 
      As she does, our POV becomes:


      CAMERA POV - DRAVEN AND SHELLY 

      As Draven's song continues.  Eric and Shelly are lovers the
      way it's supposed to be.  Merged completely in spirit, two
      people lucky enough to find each other while very young. 
      They're trading shy looks with each other because what they're
      doing tonight is kind of goofy, but terribly romantic, and
      just a little bit scary.  It's a personal "commitment
      ceremony." 

      At this point, THE IMAGE SPEEDS UP and we realize that what
      we are watching is a VIDEOTAPE and we are really in:


      INT. BLACKOUT - TOP DOLLAR'S "PALACE" - NIGHT

      Where the scene between Draven and Shelly continues on the
      projection wall screen.  It's being watched by T-BIRD, Tin-
      Tin, and FUNBOY, a bad-ass tribe of urban malcontents.  The
      most important guy in the room is TOP DOLLAR, flipping a Bali-
      song knife back and forth.  This is his space, and -- when
      the automatic mini-blinds are open -- it overlooks a rock
      club known to the locals as "Blackout."  A wall-mounted
      collection of hand-weapons completes the look.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Zapper.

      As T-Bird surrenders the zapper, we realize that Top Dollar
      has a huge, comfortable chair -- the throne, literally sitting
      on top of a red carpet.  Everyone else has a straight
      uncomfortable chair.  People are not meant to stay here.

                                      T-BIRD
                    C'mon, Top.  This is my favorite
                    part...

      On the TV, Shelly appears to be really moved by Draven's
      song. 

                                      SHELLY (T.V.)
                    That was beautiful.  Have you played
                    it for the band?       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 12.

                                      DRAVEN (T.V.)
                    No.  Never even wrote it down.
                          (taps temple)
                    All up here.  Just for you... 

      Funboy takes a drink from a bottle of wine.

                                      FUNBOY
                    This guy deserves everything he's
                    gonna get...

      Again, on screen, Shelly leans over and kisses Draven.  She
      settles back, producing a handwritten piece of paper.  Her
      turn to read.

                                      SHELLY (T.V.)
                    I've lived a thousand lifetimes to
                    find a soul like yours... A soul so
                    pure, a soul so brave... An angel
                    who takes my breath away.  I want to
                    lie with you forever...

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Forever didn't last too long, baby.

                                      SHELLY (T.V.)
                    My passion knows no bounds...  I
                    want to shield you from all evil... 
                    Protect this love we found.

      Now it's Draven's turn to be moved.  Shelly opens a small
      velvet bag and produces a ring, a thin band of gold.

                                      SHELLY (T.V.) (CONT'D)
                    I give you this Eric as I give you
                    myself.

      Draven accepts the ring, pulls out his own box and produces
      another simple band for Shelly.

                                      DRAVEN (T.V.)
                    I give you this Shelly as I give you
                    myself.

                                      SHELLY (T.V.)
                    Mine? 

                                      DRAVEN (T.V.)
                    Forever.

      Draven hands a glass of wine to Shelly.  She smiles playfully.

                                      SHELLY (T.V.)
                    Only forever?       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 13.

      They toast and kiss again.  Startled by the door being kicked
      in!  And, suddenly, the apartment is stormed by these same
      losers, minus Top-Dollar, all armed with guns and knives. 
      No doubt that they mean to do harm to Draven and Shelly.

                                      TIN-TIN (T.V.)
                    Time to rock-and-roll! 

      On the tape, WE SEE Draven try to hold them away from Shelly,
      but he is quickly knocked down while she is dragged away. 
      Then the camera is picked up off its mount.

                                      FUNBOY (T.V.)
                    Hey, look, Top's gonna like this.

      Back in our ROOM POV, Top Dollar uses the Bali-song knife to
      cut a fingernail.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Mistake number one.

                                      FUNBOY
                    I know.  Don't ever say your name
                    out loud.  We've been over this,
                    Top. 

      Meanwhile, on the TV, the camera pans up and down Shelly,
      struggling against her captors.   In the room, however, Top
      Dollar zaps the TV off.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    We're gonna go over it again.

      Top Dollar levels the others with a contemptuous look.

                                    TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
                    You were paid for a simple suicide. 
                    This guy was supposed to take too
                    many pills and stick a gun in his
                    mouth.  What I got was a double
                    homicide.

                                      T-BIRD
                    It was a two-fer.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    It was a screw-up.

      Top Dollar keys in the code on a nearby door, then enters
      with the tape while the others watch.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 14.

      THE TROPHY ROOM

      A Museum of Murder.  Newspaper articles detailing crimes are
      posted next to items like necklaces, shoes, credit cards. 
      All talismans of death.  Top Dollar places the videotape
      next to an article that headlines: "KING HENRY AREA ROCKED
      BY DOUBLE MURDER -- Musician's Promising Career Cut Short."


      TOP DOLLAR'S "PALACE"

      Top Dollar returns to the main room, speaks to the men before
      him.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    I expect a higher degree of
                      professionalism.

                                      T-BIRD
                    We know.  But it was a year ago.  We
                    haven't messed up any jobs since
                    then. 

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                          (to Tin-Tin)
                    Tell 'em.

                                      TIN-TIN
                      Albrecht's still tryin' to sweat me
                    big-time. 

      All eyes on Top Dollar.  This is not good.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Let's add this puke to the museum's
                      collection.
                          (to Tin-Tin)
                    Tell him you're ready to roll on us
                    and set a meeting.


      EXT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

      Featuring the loft's distinctive circular window.  In its
      life, it was downscale.  Now it only remembers death -- two
      of them -- from a year ago.


      INT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - NIGHT

      Draven approaches a door, still blocked off with fluttering,
      useless, yellow "crime scene" tape.  Boarded up, scheduled
      for demolition.  Draven, undeterred, pulls the tape away and
      enters.  A light, long dormant, flickers back on.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 15.

      As Draven moves inside, WE SEE that this is the same location
      where he sang to Shelly moments earlier.  Draven stoops to
      inspect an area that actually looks currently lived in.  He
      picks up a broken picture frame.  In it is a photo of Draven
      and Shelly, squeezing each other tightly, flashing smiles to
      the camera. 

      As Draven's confusion gives way to the onslaught of memory,
      he reels.  It's all coming back and it's horrible beyond
      belief.  Draven stumbles to the open window.  The spirit
      crow is there, cocking its head, looking at him.  And,
      suddenly, we are transported back in time.


      FLASHCUTS - THAT DREADFUL NIGHT

      Essentially picking up the interrupted story on the videotape
      seen by Top Dollar and his men.  Awful images.  Shelly being
      grabbed away from Draven.  Draven on his knees, being held
      up by both Tin-Tin and Funboy, having obviously been beaten
      badly.  T-Bird glowers down at him.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Time to beg for it, boy.  Time to
                    beg...

      Draven looks up at him.  His voice is soft, but his message
      is clear.

                                      DRAVEN
                    ... go to hell...

                                      T-BIRD
                          (snorts)
                    Sorry, pal, you first.

      At that, both Tin-Tin and Funboy hoist him up and drag him
      to the window.  They give him a heave-ho and he crashes
      through the window in a spray of SHATTERING GLASS.


      THE LOFT - RIGHT NOW

      Draven SCREAMS out in agony as the memory floods around him. 
      The spirit crow flies off through the open window.  Draven
      moves across the loft, picking up once precious items, now
      trash -- all of them bringing with them:


      FLASHES OF MEMORY - DRAVEN AND SHELLY 

      Smiles, kisses, love lost.  Dancing, playing, loving.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 16.

      THE MIRROR - SHELLY APPEARS!

      Draven sees Shelly's form slowly appear in the reflection
      behind him. 

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly? 

      She reaches to touch him.  He turns to grab -- nothing. 
      She's not really there.  He's alone.  Draven SMASHES THE
      MIRROR with his fist!  To his surprise and ours, his hand
      heals spontaneously.

      As Draven realizes the full extent of his loss and isolation,
      he cries black tears.  He buries his face in his hands in
      rage, causing the tears to smear black.  When he looks up:


      THE SHATTERED MIRROR - THE CROW

      Draven's face is now drained of color and the eyes are etched
      with darkness.  As reflected in the broken pieces, he is
      becoming the realistic version of the familiar Crow persona. 
      As the transformation continues, Draven is revealed as the
      mythic Crow, the avenger of the dead, a man alive but not of
      the living, as we:

      INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

      A junkyard of ill-gotten gains.  Gideon, the weasel owner,
      counts receipts, chewing a cigar.  A fist bangs on the door,
      belonging to a figure seen only in shadow.

                                      GIDEON
                    Get lost, moron.  We're closed.

      Now the fist smashes through the glass, reaches in and turns
      the lock.  As blood flows, the hand vices shut.  The Crow
      enters, starts for the display window.

                                    THE CROW
                    Change your hours.

      The Crow grabs the guitar from the display window.  Gideon
      aims a gun at the Crow.

                                      GIDEON
                    You owe me for that window, clownman!

      Fearless, the Crow advances on Gideon, brandishing the guitar.

                                    THE CROW
                    Tell me where you got this!

                                      GIDEON
                    Home Shopping Network.  Why do you
                    care?

                                    THE CROW
                    I want what's mine.  I want my life.

                                      GIDEON
                    I don't sell lives.

                                    THE CROW
                    No.  You trade in death.

                                      GIDEON
                    Thanks for your opinion.  Now, here's
                    mine.

      Gideon readies his gun.  The Crow reaches out so quickly
      that he is able to grab the gun even as it FIRES.  He forces
      Gideon's hand to the counter and crushes it until he releases
      the weapon.  The Crow forces Gideon's face into the guitar.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 18.

                                    THE CROW
                    Take your time.  Take a good look.

                                      GIDEON
                          (sputtering)
                    Belonged to some dead rock punk. 
                    All the sicko kids come in to see
                    it.

      The Crow lets Gideon breathe again.

                                    THE CROW
                    Get anything else from the DEAD...
                    ROCK... PUNK?

                                      GIDEON
                    No...

      The Crow sees a collection of rings.  He picks up the gun
      and uses the butt end to smash the glass case, pulling out a
      ring.  It matches the very one he wears.  He holds the ring
      in front of Gideon.

                                    THE CROW
                    How much for this one?

      Gideon has pulled a rifle from another display behind the
      counter.  He aims it at the Crow.

                                      GIDEON
                    You know, you're really starting to
                    get on my nerves.

                                    THE CROW
                    Give it to me.

                                      GIDEON
                          (sick smile)
                    You forgot to say 'trick or treat.'

      Gideon FIRES THE RIFLE, catching Draven in the shoulder. 
      The rifle shot throws the Crow down, but does not cause him
      to bleed -- or to feel much more than the raw impact.  The
      Crow is as surprised as Gideon.  The Crow holds out his hand
      again to Gideon, demanding the rifle.  Gideon is trembling
      now at this supernatural display.

                                    THE CROW
                    Give the gun to me now and I won't
                    kill you.

      Gideon debates another shot, but hands the weapon over, having
      seen what he's seen.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 19.

                                      GIDEON
                    I... can't help you, man, really.  I
                    don't ask questions.  See, I'm not
                    asking you how you did that...

      The Crow hops up on the counter and sits cross-legged, leering
      at Gideon who agonizes half a second then gives them up.

                                    THE CROW
                    Your suppliers.  They must have names.

                                      GIDEON
                    T-Bird and his crew.  Tin-Tin,
                    Funboy...

                                    THE CROW
                    That was easy.  Now, where can I
                    find them?


      INT. DARLA'S PLACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A small, welfare-mother's one-bedroom apartment.  A collection
      of guns and ammunition are arrayed on the bed, obviously
      kept in a large, now unlocked suitcase.  T-Bird, currently
      on a cell phone, and his crew -- including Tin-Tin and Funboy --
      are at work checking their hardware, and loading weapons. 
      It's dangerous work as is, but these guys are smoking and
      drinking while they're at it.  T-Bird notices  Funboy taking
      a long drink from an open wine bottle.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Hey Funboy, go light, bro, I don't
                    want you hittin' one of us.

                                      FUNBOY
                    Just gettin' oiled like my piece...

      Tin-Tin checks out Funboy's firepower.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Hey, where'd you get the Black Rhinos?

                                      FUNBOY
                    Some dude outta Detroit scooped 'em
                    on Devil's night.


      FRONT ROOM

      Darla -- a faded flower, drained by alcohol -- bangs on the
      door.       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 20.

                                      DARLA
                    Hey, my manager'll throw me out if
                    he finds out you're here. 
                          (pleading)
                    C'mon, Funboy.  Your friends gotta
                    go.


      THE BEDROOM

      T-Bird hangs up the cell phone, yells to the door.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Keep your pants on, Darla. 
                          (to the crew)
                    Gideon says some crazy clown just
                    trashed his pawn shop and's on the
                    way over.
                          (to Funboy)
                    Funboy, you stay here and roll out
                    the welcome mat.
                          (pointedly)
                    And get your woman under control,
                    will ya?

                                      FUNBOY
                          (checking gun)
                    I'll straighten her out.

                                      T-BIRD
                          (to Tin-Tin)
                    We gotta rack-and-pack.  Here.

      T-Bird tosses Tin-Tin a 38-special.  Tin-Tin looks at it
      with disgust.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    I don't want no part of this low
                    rent piece a' junk.

      Tin-Tin slides out the long chain he wears for a belt, begins
      to wrap it around his fist, clearly intended for use as a
      lethal weapon.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    Don't need no firepower to put that
                    cop to sleep.

                                      T-BIRD
                    For your information, Tin, we ain't
                    takin' no chances on Albrecht.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 21.

                                      FUNBOY
                    Sounds like we oughta perish Gideon
                    while we're at it.


      FRONT ROOM

      Darla continues banging on the door.

                                      DARLA
                    Hey!  C'mon, Funboy, I'm not
                      kiddin'...

      Darla doesn't notice the front door open.  Sarah, her
      daughter, enters, carrying her skateboard.

                                      SARAH
                    We got company again, Darla?

      Darla begins to fumble for a few dollars from her purse.

                                      DARLA
                          (speech slurred)
                    Honey, why don't you go get some
                    Halloween candy?

      The door opens.  It's Funboy.

                                      FUNBOY
                    Hey, Darla, you wanna get smacked?
                          (sees Sarah)
                    What are you lookin' at?

      What she's looking at is the gun he's holding at his side,
      and the crew exiting through the fire escape.  The door
      closes.

                                      SARAH
                          (re: Funboy)
                    Great costume.

                                      DARLA
                      They're... he's leaving...

                                      SARAH
                    What a co-ink.  Me, too.

      Sarah exits but not before grabbing the money from Darla's
      hand.  STAY WITH Darla momentarily, giving us the chance to
      see the pain that even alcohol can't hide.       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 22.

      INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

      Working at his desk, Albrecht is on the phone, scribbling
      onto a piece of paper.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Yeah, I know the place... I'll be
                    there alone.  You be there alone.

      Albrecht hangs up the phone, closes his eyes, makes a fist
      and a chugging motion.  Face falls as he looks at a high-
      collared jumpsuit studded with sequins hanging on the post
      near his desk.  He quickly bangs out a phone number.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    Cordy?  It's me.  I got a big break
                    on the Draven case.  One of the
                    shooters wants to cut a deal, doesn't
                    seem to care about our Halloween
                    plans, though...
                          (checks watch)
                    Look, I'll change after the meeting,
                    see you there...  Me, too...

      Albrecht hangs up the phone, starts toward the door, when he
      abruptly stops and returns to take the jumpsuit with him. 
      As he leaves:

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    Albrecht has left the building.


      INT. DARLA'S PLACE - NIGHT

      Funboy sits in a ratty stuffed chair, playing with his gun,
      facing the door, waiting, bottle of wine at his side.  He
      hears something behind him.  It's the spirit crow, flying
      into the room.

                                      FUNBOY
                    Big freakin' bird.

      He levels his gun at it, pretends to shoot at it.

                                      FUNBOY (CONT'D)
                    Bang, bang.

      The crow flies into the back bedroom.

                                      DARLA
                    Can you at least get him out of here?

      Funboy sighs, moves toward the bedroom.  As he starts to
      shoo the spirit crow out the open window, he is startled by:      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 23.

      THE CROW'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN

      That is, Draven as the Crow, hanging upside down from the
      door-frame.  Funboy freaks.

                                    THE CROW
                    Hi.

      The Crow reaches down and takes Funboy's weapon from him
      before he can react.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    Not nice to play with guns.

      With an unexpected agility, the Crow flips over in the air,
      landing on his feet in front of Funboy.

                                      FUNBOY
                      Wh...who...who...
                          (to front room)
                    Darla!

      The Crow throws the gun on the bed, uses both hands to twist
      Funboy's face to look straight at him.  He's literally
      squeezing Funboy's lips together.

                                    THE CROW
                    Look at me when I speak to you.  Are
                    you looking?

      Funboy nods, wide-eyed.  He sure as hell is looking.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    Want you to give your friends a
                    message.  Very simple.  Think you
                    can remember it?

      Again, Funboy nods.  He'll give it a try.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    Tell them the Crow comes for them
                    tonight.

                                      FUNBOY
                    The Crow?

                                    THE CROW
                    It's a bird.
                          (beat)
                    Sharp claws.

      The Crow runs two arched fingertips across Funboy's face,
      drawing blood.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 24.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    Big, flapping wings.

      The Crow bitch slaps Funboy three times in quick succession. 
      Funboy looks back at the Crow, his face beet red and bleeding.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    You've killed for money.  Never come
                    back here.
                          (beat)
                    Now... run for your life... while
                    you still have one.

      Funboy, fear of God in him, takes off.  The Crow turns his
      attention to Darla.  As he advances, she tries to stand,
      stumbles.  The Crow reaches out to steady her. 


      FLASHCUT - WHITE NOISE / WHITE LIGHT

      Once again, our visual/audio empathic connection.


      THE CROW LETS GO...

      Darla seems to sober up a bit.  With a degree of tenderness
      which matches the anger he handled Funboy with, the Crow
      runs his hand across her cheek.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    You're Sarah's mother?

                                      DARLA
                    Some mom.  No wonder that kid hates
                    me.

      The Crow moves closer to her.  His eyes meet hers, and they
      are piercing.

                                    THE CROW
                    'Mother is the name for God in the
                    hearts and minds of all children.'
                          (gently)
                    She doesn't hate you.  Just what
                    you've done to yourself.

      Darla buries her face, sobbing in humiliation.  Meanwhile,
      Draven experiences:


      CROWVISION

      The distorted, wide-angle imagery, showing Funboy moving
      quickly down an alley.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 25.

      BACK TO DARLA'S APARTMENT

      The Crow places a hand on Darla's shoulder.

                                    THE CROW
                    I'll talk to her.  After my
                      business...

      And the Crow is gone.  Leaving Darla to feel a change
      happening.


      EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

      The Crow is seen moving through a building above the alley
      we saw Funboy hurrying down earlier in Crowvision.


      EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

      Tin-Tin stands behind a burning trash can, which keeps him
      warm while throwing a flickering light against the bricks. 
      A beat, then Funboy rounds the corner, races up.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    You take care of it?

      Funboy gasps for breath after running the whole way.  Tin-
      Tin inspects Funboy's fingernail scarred face.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    What happened to you?

                                      FUNBOY
                    Gideon's right about this guy... 
                    He's... I don't know... he's just
                    weird, man.  Scary weird... called
                    himself a crow or something.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Oooh, poor-baby-Funboy, got himself
                    scared by a widdle-birdie!

                                      FUNBOY
                    Where's Tin-Tin?

      Tin-Tin indicates the shadows where T-Bird waits in ambush. 
      Frowns to Funboy.


      THE CROW

      On top of the building above them, looks down on this scene. 
      There is an inner rage building inside this man.  He dive-
      bombs from the window into the alley below.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 26.

      Coming up from a tuck-and-roll, he kicks over a burning
      garbage barrel, sending embers flying.


      THE ALLEY

      Funboy points to the end of the alley where the Crow has
      fallen.

                                      FUNBOY
                    It's him, man!

      Tin-Tin starts toward the area.  Funboy tries to hold him
      back.

                                      FUNBOY (CONT'D)
                    Be careful, what you gonna do?

                                      TIN-TIN
                    We're gonna take out the trash, that's
                    what.  Get some huevos.  You're making
                    me wanna hurl.


      THE CROW MOVES TOWARD THEM!

      Reflected menacingly in the throw-glow of another barrel
      fire.

                                    THE CROW
                    The tides of sin draw tighter and
                      brighter... The hours become heavier
                    and weighted... And the shadows smile,
                    dark and wild.

      The Crow smiles at Tin-Tin and Funboy.

                                      FUNBOY
                    I told you, man, he ain't normal.

      Tin-Tin holds up a hand.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    This bird-boy's mine.

      Tin-Tin advances toward the Crow, swinging his chain.

      The two face off, Tin-Tin swings and connects, lashing the
      Crow across the chest and face.  The Crow goes down, cut and
      hurt.

      Tin-Tin turns back to Funboy, looking for approval.  Instead,
      Funboy is already trying to get away.

      Suddenly, the Crow is in front of him.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 27.

      The gash on his face heals before our eyes.  The Crow throws
      him toward Tin-Tin, and he collapses against the wall.

      This time when Tin-Tin swings his chain, the Crow grabs the
      end of the chain link, and uses it to pull Tin-Tin toward
      him.  Up close, he hisses:

                                    THE CROW
                    One year ago, you killed two people. 
                    Tell me the story.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Once upon a time, there was a freak. 
                    He died.  The end.

      Tin-Tin pushes away from the Crow.  As he does, he produces
      a long knife.

                                    THE CROW
                    Make the first one count.  One to a
                    customer.

      Tin-Tin lunges toward the Crow with the knife.  The Crow
      blocks the attack and, putting Tin-Tin's arm in his vice
      grip, snaps the bone.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Ahh!!  Damn...

      The Crow throws Tin-Tin to the ground, then kicks him over.

                                    THE CROW
                    You killed a woman who never did
                    anything to you.  Why?

                                      TIN-TIN
                    We were bored.

      The Crow leans down to Tin-Tin, grabs him by the hair and
      the pants.

                                    THE CROW
                    'Time to beg for it, boy.'  Remember?


      FLASHCUT - DRAVEN IN THE LOFT

      The Crow remembers the moment when Tin-Tin helped throw him
      through the window.


      RETURN TO SCENE

      WE HEAR the SHIFT-CLICKS ON MULTIPLE WEAPONS as T-Bird and
      Funboy step out of the shadows.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 28.

      Tin-Tin scoots behind their protection, taking a weapon.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Say your prayers.

                                    THE CROW
                    What are you going to do?  Kill me?

      The crew begins to unload their weapons into the Crow's body. 
        A malevolent ambush of evil seen clearly in their faces. 
      Played off the Crow only long enough to establish that under
      this much firepower his re-animated body is not invulnerable. 
      He's going down and he's staying down.

      Even as they lay down another line of fire, T-Bird and his
      crew flee the scene of the shooting.


      NEARBY - ALBRECHT

      Albrecht creeps through the alley across the street in his
      car, headlights off.  He hears the firing, and keys his
      microphone.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    This is Unit KJ-62.  I have shots
                    fired.  Old Hoover shipyard.  Can't
                    get a good view from here.  Requesting
                    immediate back-up and an ambulance.


      THE CROW - WITH SHELLY'S SPIRIT

      WE SEE his bullet-riddled body, trying to crawl to his knees. 
      WE SEE Shelly, placing her arms around him, trying to soothe
      him in some kind of mystical healing of body and spirit.


      ALBRECHT'S POV - THE CROW

      The Crow is alone.  There is no Shelly.  At least, not in
      this reality.  It's very hard to make out anything. 
      Especially the Crow as he stumbles off into the darkness
      while Albrecht's RADIO SQUAWKS.

      INT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - NIGHT

      Sarah lies in her sleeping bag, curled up on the floor, a
      lantern by her side.  She hears FOOTSTEPS outside the door. 
      She turns off the lantern.  The DOOR OPENS.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 29.

                    Whoever you are, I've got a gun.

      No answer.  She's freaking.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I'm not afraid to use it.

      A beat.  Then:

                                      DRAVEN
                    Take a number.

      Draven is revealed, stepping forward from the shadow.  His
      body has been mangled and mauled by the gunfire attack in
      the alley.  Sarah leans forward, trying to get a better look. 
      Finally, she is completely blown away.

                                      SARAH
                    Eric?

      But it's too late.  Draven slumps, falls to the floor,
      seemingly lifeless.  A shocking moment of revelation and
      loss, as we:

                                                                                FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      EXT. BACK ALLEY - EARLY MORNING

      Now a crime scene, complete with uniformed cops, detectives
      and Albrecht.  The senior man is Albrecht's boss, LIEUTENANT
      DAVID VINCENNES.  He's not an easy man to like, high standards
      and little patience.  Albrecht approaches.

                                      VINCENNES
                    What are we up to?

                                      ALBRECHT
                      Thirty-four shell casings.  We're
                    still looking. 

                                      VINCENNES
                    But no body?  No weapon?

      Albrecht holds Tin-Tin's chain, left behind.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Just this.  Belonged to Tin-Tin.

                                      VINCENNES
                          (weary)
                    Why don't any of these gangsters
                    have real names?

                    Mark Tremaine, a.k.a. Tin-Tin.

      Albrecht's cell phone RINGS.  He mumbles an excuse to
      Vincennes, picks up.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                      Albrecht... You're sure?... No, her
                    mother's not going to be much help. 
                    I have an idea where to find her... 
                    Look, this isn't a great time.  I'll
                    have her there by third period...
                    Alright, bye.

      Albrecht hangs up.  Vincennes has a low tolerance for this
      kind of interruption.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Trouble at home?

                    Now, exactly what led you to believe
                    this was any more than target
                    practice? 

                                      ALBRECHT
                    I saw somebody move but I thought it
                    was one of the shooters.

                    I don't know. 

                                      VINCENNES
                    Let's not let this become one of
                    your epic open cases, okay?
                          (indicates scene)
                    Where's the blood?

      Albrecht produces a plastic baggy.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    We found about sixty grams of this. 
                    Some kind of ashes, like charcoal. 
                    Lab's running it.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Is this a barbeque or a homicide?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    I don't have a theory yet, Lieutenant.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Get one.

      Vincennes takes off.


      INT. DRAVEN'S LOFT - EARLY MORNING

      Draven huddles in a corner, obviously weakened, his eyes
      closed, not sleeping but in some kind of meditative state,
      covered in make-shift bandages made from some of Sarah's own
      clothing.  Sarah sponges his forehead with cool water. 
      Finally:

                                      SARAH
                    Eric, I need you to say something so
                    I know I'm not dreaming.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly?

      Draven's eyes flutter open.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 32.

                                      SARAH
                    Sarah.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Hey...

                                      SARAH
                          (hopeful)
                    Is Shelly okay, too?

                                      DRAVEN
                    I thought I saw her in the mirror. 
                    Then this... thing... happened to
                    me...
                          (beat)
                    You're not the only one who thinks
                    they're dreaming.

                                      SARAH
                    Life has really sucked without you. 
                    I... I don't know where to start... 
                    How can you be alive?  I saw you. 
                    You were dead a year ago.  And last
                    night...

                                      DRAVEN
                    There's a lot I don't know.

                                      SARAH
                    You're hurt.  I can ask a hundred
                    million questions later.

      Sarah moves to pull off Draven's bandages.  He resists.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I need to change these things.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I'm not the same guy you knew.

                                      SARAH
                    Tell me about it.  Are you like an
                    angel now or what?

                                      DRAVEN
                    I don't think so.

                                      SARAH
                          (considers this)
                    I do.

      Draven turns around, looks at her, puts a hand on her
      shoulder.  Looks at her with those eyes.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 33.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I'm too angry to be an angel.

      Draven gets to his feet, moves to the window, looking out on
      the sky through the broken glass.

                                      DRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    One of the men who did this was at
                    your mother's apartment.  Do you
                    know him?

                                      SARAH
                    Funboy?  Total loser.    

                                      DRAVEN
                    They're all going to pay for what
                    they did to Shelly.

                                      SARAH
                    Didn't do you any favors either.

      Draven cocks his head to the side, with preternatural
      instinct.  Sarah mistakes this for disagreement.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.  Probably should just keep my
                    mouth shut, huh?

                                      DRAVEN
                    No.  It's... something... else...

      Draven's right.


      INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY MORNING

      It's Albrecht, heading for Draven's loft.  Outside the door,
      he stops on the landing to catch his breath.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Sarah, it's me.  You in there?


      INTERCUT: CORRIDOR / LOFT

      Sarah freaks, yells toward the door.

                                      SARAH
                    Stay there!  Coming!
                          (to Draven)
                    It's the cop from your case.  It's a
                    long story.  I'll let him drop me
                    off at school, then I'll come right
                    back.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 34.

      Sarah pushes through the door.  Sees Albrecht.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  Let's go.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Let's go?  Let's go?  What happened
                    to 'back off, you're not my dad?' 

      Sarah starts down the stairs.

                                      SARAH
                    I'll be late for early lunch if we
                    don't go.

      Albrecht eyes her skeptically, then moves inside, his cop
      instincts taking over.  His eyes have to adjust to the dimly
      lit loft.  Sarah rushes in behind him, moves to block.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You want me to go.  I'm trying to
                    go.  Can we just go?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    What don't you want me to see, Sarah?

                                      SARAH
                    Now don't freak out, okay?  It's --

      Albrecht makes out a form in the shadows.  He pulls his gun
      from its holster, aims it at the form. 

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Whoever you are, I want those hands
                    to grab the ceiling.  Then I want
                    you to walk out real slow.

      A beat.  Draven steps out from the shadows, holding his arms
      up in the air.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Tough guy.  This okay?

      Albrecht takes a long look, and he is amazed at what he sees.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Holy Mother...
                          (to Sarah)
                    Did he hurt you?

                                      SARAH
                    Leave him alone.  He's been through
                    enough.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 35.

                                      ALBRECHT
                          (serious as a judge)
                    Sarah.  Take off.  Go to school.

      Sarah starts to protest.  Draven nods for her to go.  She
      grabs her stuff, and storms angrily out.  Albrecht turns
      back to Draven.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    Are you Eric Draven?

                                      DRAVEN
                    Not if that's a crime...

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You and me -- we're gonna have to
                    talk. 


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Draven sits behind a simple wooden table.  Looking around,
      as if he's seeing things for the first time.  A moment, then
      Albrecht enters.  He's anxious, but trying to play it cool.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    So, if you're Draven, where have you
                    been lately?

                                      DRAVEN
                    I don't know.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You don't want to answer the question?

                                      DRAVEN
                    That is my answer.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    See, that's going to be a problem
                    for me.  I'm going to need specifics. 
                    Places, phone numbers, people who
                    can corroborate your story.

                                      DRAVEN
                    There is no story.  I'm not trying
                    to convince you.  I'm not even sure
                    what day it is.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Really?  It's exactly one year and
                    one day after you were supposedly
                    murdered.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 36.

      Albrecht takes the measure of Draven as he absorbs the
        information.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    That surprise you?

                                      DRAVEN
                    Nothing surprises me lately.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Let's start with who the other guy
                    was.

      Draven doesn't get this.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    A man was thrown out a sixth story
                    window.  You're telling us you don't
                    know who he was?

      Draven is shocked to consider the way it may look to Albrecht. 
      Still, the only answer he has is the true one.

                                      DRAVEN
                    That was me.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    But you're here.  You couldn't be
                    here if that was you.

                                      DRAVEN
                    But here I am.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Okay.  Let's try this again.  The
                    last time anyone saw you alive was,
                    let's see...

      Albrecht flips through the police report.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    The afternoon of October 31st.  The
                      'Stop-and-Go' on West Hatcher.  You
                    bought milk and a box of raisin
                    cereal.  You remember that?

                                      DRAVEN
                    You did your homework.

      Albrecht exhales.  Looks Draven right in the eye.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Had to.  I'm investigating a murder.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 37.

      EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

      Sarah skateboards down the street.  A Thunderbird pulls up
      in front of her, blocking her path.  T-Bird rolls down the
      window.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Hey, kid.  I gotta talk to you.

      Sarah stops.  Stands there holding her skateboard, defiantly.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah?  What do you want?

                                      T-BIRD
                    Just that you understand how we were
                    never at your place last night.  How
                    it'd be bad for your mom if you
                      remembered anything different.

      Sarah gets the drift of this threat.

                                      SARAH
                    You guys got a lot bigger problem
                    than me talking to the cops...

                                      T-BIRD
                    Yeah?  Like what?

                                      SARAH
                    Like the guy you thought you killed
                    last night?
                          (beat)
                    He's not dead.


      INT. BLACKOUT - TOP DOLLAR'S "PALACE" - DAY

      Top Dollar watches the floor from his perch above it all. 
      Some daytime activity is visible through the mini-blinds. 
      He presses a button and the shades on the window pull shut. 
      He pushes Sarah inside.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Why is she here?

      T-Bird pushes her into a chair.  Uses a roll of duct tape to
      put her hands tightly together behind her back.

                                      T-BIRD
                    The freak who showed up instead of
                    the cop?       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 38.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    This would be the same man you and
                    your playmates emptied half a dozen
                    guns into last night?

                                      T-BIRD
                          (nervous)
                    The kid thinks he's alive.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Dream on, kid.

      Sarah still has that problem.  She can't keep her mouth shut.

                                      SARAH
                    You guys are such losers.  I just
                    wanna watch him kick your butts.

      Top Dollar starts punching out the combination to the "trophy
      room."

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Put her with all the other souvenirs
                    of our fun together.
                          (to Sarah)
                    One word -- one word -- and you die.

      Sarah starts to protest.  Top Dollar holds up a finger in
      warning, like a parent.  At the window, WE SEE the spirit
      crow.


      CROWVISION - SARAH

      As she is manhandled by T-Bird.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Draven, already like a caged animal, reacts to the image. 
      Albrecht keeps a steady eye on him.

                                      DRAVEN
                    You can't keep me here.  You have to
                    let me go.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Not really.  I can hold you seventy-
                    two hours without charging you.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Charging me?  For what?

      Taking his time.  Ignoring the question.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 39.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Let's talk about your roommate, Shelly
                    Webster.

                                      DRAVEN
                    You're unbelievable.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No.  A man who leaves the day of a
                    double murder then comes back a year
                    later without an alibi -- he's
                      unbelievable.
                          (beat)
                    You and Shelly fight often?

      Draven just stares at Albrecht.  Doesn't want to go there.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                    Did you know that it took thirty-one
                    hours for her to die? 

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shut up!

                                      ALBRECHT
                    That the last word that came out of
                    her mouth was your name?

      The questions are like knives in Draven's heart.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Don't do this.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    My job is to find justice for that
                    woman.  I'll do whatever I have to.

      Draven can't stand it.  He comes at Albrecht, pinning him up
      against the wall.  He's seething.

                                      DRAVEN
                    T-Bird and Funboy and Tin-Tin, those
                    are your killers!

      A terrible realization crosses Draven's face.  He's losing
      it.  The Crow wants out and he's creating the conditions. 
      He suddenly lets go of Albrecht and turns away.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Think about it, Draven, before you
                    point the finger.  Pre-meditation
                    costs more than a crime of passion. 
                    Which you seem about ready to commit
                    again...      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 40.

      Draven's face is beginning to take on the look of the Crow. 
      He is fighting for control.  In very slow, measured words,
      he says:

                                      DRAVEN
                    I am... finished... talking... to
                    you...

                                      ALBRECHT
                    I got a whole file on you and your
                    temper.  You lost it the night Shelly
                    Webster died, didn't you?

                                      DRAVEN
                    Leave me alone.

      Albrecht has lost it himself.  He doesn't realize Draven's
      plight, and just keeps heaping it on.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Or what?  You gonna kill me, too? 
                    Are you?!

      OFF Draven's face, now fully changed into the Crow.  Albrecht
      is in mortal danger, as we:

                                                                                FADE OUT.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The Crow still has his back to Albrecht who continues:

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Your confession now could make the
                      difference between life and death
                    for you.

      The Crow continues to face away.  Almost smirking...

                                    THE CROW
                    The difference between life and death? 
                    You have no idea.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Turn around and look at me, Draven,
                    'cause this is important.

      The intercom on the wall BUZZES.

                                      VOICE (P.A.)
                    Albrecht?  You in there?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Not now!

                                      VOICE (P.A.)
                    It's Vincennes.  He's coming down to
                    see you.

                                      ALBRECHT
                          (to Draven)
                    We're just getting started.

      Albrecht takes off.


      INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION - CONTINUOUS

      Albrecht exits with file in hand, finds Vincennes approaching.

                                      VINCENNES
                    So you've re-opened the Draven case.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Never actually closed it.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 42.

                                      VINCENNES
                          (taking file away)
                    And who exactly is the man you've
                    been interrogating?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    It might be Eric Draven.

                                      VINCENNES
                          (big one to swallow)
                    Your victim?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Not if it's really him.

                                      VINCENNES
                    You have any evidence?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Not yet.  I think we start by exhuming
                    the grave.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Slow down.  What about motive?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Crime of passion. 
                          (off his reaction)
                    Maybe he found her in the sack with
                    another guy, killed them both.  He
                    had a temper...

                                      VINCENNES
                    That's a big maybe.

      The thought hangs in the air.  Vincennes hops off the desk,
      heads away. 

                                      VINCENNES (CONT'D)
                    I'm going to talk to your man myself. 


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Vincennes pushes the door open.  There's nobody there. 
      Nothing.  A beat.  Albrecht enters.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Where is he?

      Albrecht looks around.  His jaw drops.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Here.  He was just here.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 43.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Facts.  I like facts.  The fact is
                    there is nobody in this room.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    This is impossible.

                                      VINCENNES
                      Detective, you read the papers. 
                    There are a lot of people who would
                    like to see this department take a
                    fall.  I think you've been set-up.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No.  This is the biggest break since
                    the night of the murder. 

      Vincennes lets out a snort of disgust.  Hands the file back
      to Albrecht.  As he leaves:

                                      VINCENNES
                    You're walkin' on the wild side of
                    that thin blue line.

      STAY WITH Albrecht who looks around the empty room.  His
      world is starting to implode on him.  A beat, then he, too,
      exits.

      STAY INSIDE the interrogation room.  REVEAL, on the ceiling,
      wedged in a nearly impossible space, literally hanging to
      the wall by his fingertips ... the Crow!


      EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      The Crow crawls out a window, lands on a van, uses it to
      launch himself over a fence, landing safely in a lot marked,
      "Police Impound:  Stolen Property".  The Crow surveys the
      area.  A couple of cars and a few motorcycles.


      EXT. PORT COLUMBIA - NIGHT (STOCK)

      To ESTABLISH our transition to evening.


      INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The Crow appears at the fire escape with the window open,
      surprises Darla.

                                    THE CROW
                    Your daughter's in trouble.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 44.

                                      DARLA
                    I know she stays out too late, but
                    that's gonna change, really...

                                    THE CROW
                    No!  The men who were here last night. 
                    Where would they take her?

                                      DARLA
                    Oh, my God...  Um, they usually hang
                    out at the Blackout, it's a --

                                    THE CROW
                    I know the place.
                          (taking off)
                    Stay here.  Wait for her.


      INT. BLACKOUT - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

      The place is alive: dancing, drinking, bad behavior, urban
      darkness.  A local band is on the stage and, basically, nobody
      notices the Crow in this sea of youth and music.


      INT. BLACKOUT - TOP DOLLAR'S "PALACE" - NIGHT

      Top Dollar sits on his throne, involved with a woman of exotic
      sexuality.  It's the best seat in the house.  Top Dollar is
      distracted by the girl, and from his window perch doesn't
      see the Crow entering the main floor.


      INT. BLACKOUT - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

      The Crow notices T-Bird, walks straight up to him.

                                    THE CROW
                    Now where were we?

      T-Bird's jaw drops.  He's seriously spooked.  The Crow grabs
      T-Bird by the jacket.

                                      T-BIRD
                    We capped you...

                                    THE CROW
                    I want to make a complaint to the
                      management.  Coming? 

      T-Bird nods, "sure."      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 45.

                            night of his murder)
                    'Sorry, pal, you first.'


      THE CROW THROWS T-BIRD THROUGH THE WINDOW!

      That's right.  He literally sends him flying straight up,
      through the window of Top Dollar's office.


      INT. BLACKOUT - TOP'S "PALACE" - CONTINUOUS

      Top Dollar's involvement with his woman is interrupted when
      T-Bird crashes through the window.  He pulls himself away,
      stands over the stunned T-Bird.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    I was busy.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Birdman didn't stay dead.

      T-Bird passes out.  Top Dollar turns to the woman.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Wait for me downstairs.


      INT. BLACKOUT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Shattering glass on the floor sends the remaining clubbers
      scrambling to get out the door.


      INT. BLACKOUT - TOP DOLLAR'S "PALACE" - MOMENTS LATER

      Top Dollar pulls a large samurai sword off its wall mount,
      takes a few practice swings.  The man's good.  As the woman
      exits, the Crow knocks, enters with mocking politeness.

                                    THE CROW
                    Hope I'm not interrupting.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Live by the sword, keep your edge.

      He turns and gives the Crow a hard look.

                                    TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
                    Damn, you're even ugly for a clown.

                                    THE CROW
                    Before you go away, I want to know
                    why you killed her.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 46.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    You're gonna have to be more specific. 
                    I do a lot of business.

      Top Dollar flails the sword menacingly at the Crow.  He's
      used this before, probably with fatal results for the victim.

                                    THE CROW
                    Shelly Webster.

        A choreographed fight ensues.  The Crow has an uncanny ability
      to get out of the way.

      Ultimately, the sword has to be stopped.  The Crow simply
      catches it -- blade end and all -- with his hand and grabs
      hold.  It causes a gash but allows him to pull Top Dollar
      toward him, disarming him.  The Crow vises his hand shut
      into a fist.  With the weapons dispensed, the Crow begins to
      punish Top Dollar.

      Top Dollar, however, is a worthy opponent, capable of the
      same martial-arts type movements that the Crow seems to have
      at his command.

      During this, T-Bird seems to come to.  He's groggy, but
      moving.

      Finally, however, the Crow gains the upper hand and in a
      series of punishing blows he has Top Dollar subdued.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    The question is simple.  Why kill an
                    innocent woman?

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Who sent you? 

      The Crow is about to smash a fatal blow into Top Dollar's
      face when his own face suddenly contorts.  T-Bird has run
      him through with the samurai sword.

      Top Dollar rolls free, kicks the Crow to the ground who,
      eyes still wide from the pain and shock, is too hurt to speak.

                                    TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you just hurry up and die!!

      Top Dollar uses his remote device to open the trophy room.

                                    TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
                    Tee, I want you to get my wheels and
                    meet me in the alley.       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 47.

                                      T-BIRD
                    What's the plan, Top?

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Little C-4 in the night ought to
                    blow our friend straight to hell
                    this time.

      The door springs open:


      TROPHY ROOM

      Sarah is restrained in here, in this macabre serial killer-
      like museum of articles and artifacts.


      PALACE - TOP DOLLAR

      Grabs the Crow under both arms and begins to slide him across
      the floor to the trophy room.  The Crow is weak, but he grabs
      the ring around his neck and clutches it tightly.

                                    THE CROW
                    ... Shelly wore this...

      The Crow pulls himself up closer to grab Top Dollar by the
      arm in a vice-like grip.

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    All her pain... all for you...


      FLASHCUT - SHELLY'S PAIN

      Shelly, nearly comatose in the loft as two paramedics load
      her onto a gurney.  Her eyes are the only part of her that
      can move.  Bruised and broken.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Top Dollar's back arches in unspeakable agony.  The Crow
      seems to gain strength from the rage this brings.

      The Crow sees Sarah, gagged and restrained, her eyes as
      frightened as Shelly's.  He leaves Top Dollar long enough to
      break her free.

                                      SARAH
                          (re: trophy room)
                    You and Shelly weren't the only ones
                    these sickos killed.

                                    THE CROW
                    Go.  You don't want to see this.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 48.

      Sarah backs out into the main room as the Crow grabs Top
      Dollar and throws him into the trophy room, collapsing him
      against the wall.  He gets down on the floor next to him and
      demands:

                                    THE CROW (CONT'D)
                    Why?  Why Shelly? 

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Because she got in the way, because
                    somebody wanted her boyfriend dead...

                                    THE CROW
                          (stunned)
                    She died because she knew me?

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                          (coughs up blood)
                    And don't ask who, because he's a
                    hell of lot scarier than you're ever
                    gonna be...

      The Crow's shock turns to anger.  He is going to kill Top
      Dollar.

                                    THE CROW
                    Shelly sends her regards.

      The Crow hears a SOB from off-screen.  It's Sarah, shielding
      her eyes.  She just can't watch what her friend Eric has
      become.

                                      SARAH
                    I'd kill him, too...
                          (beat)
                    ... but Shelly wouldn't.

      Slowly, the Crow releases his grip.  Then, he begins to gather
      up the talismans that make up the trophy room.  Shoes,
      necklaces, wallets, credit cards, even the videotape from
      his own murder.  The Crow clutches them all close to his
      body with one hand.  He reaches out for Top Dollar who squirms
      to get away, sensing what's coming.

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    Wait!  We can still make a deal. 
                    There's ten large in the box there. 
                    Take the dope, too.  Whatever you
                    want...

      The Crow drills Top Dollar with those eyes.  Not the intense
      ones, the hellish ones.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 49.

                                    THE CROW
                    All of their pain.  All at once. 
                    All for you.

      The Crow reaches out and grabs Top Dollar.


      FLASHCUT - WHITE NOISE / WHITE LIGHT

      Serving as a visual/audio reminder that Draven has achieved
      some kind of empathic connection with Top Dollar.  Images of
      the articles and artifacts are intermixed.


      BACK TO SCENE

      The psychic connection of suffering is unimaginable.  Top
      Dollar's body begins to buck as if he's getting electro-shock
      therapy.  When it's over, Top Dollar babbles, barely above a
      whisper, in incomprehensible words mixed with his own pathetic
      sobbing:

                                    TOP DOLLAR
                    ...saw the snake... the little lamb...
                    flush it... happy birthday to me...
                    let go... man, that's gotta hurt...
                    it was ordered... hamburger and
                    fries... let go... drowning... over
                    here...

      The Crow doesn't appear to be much better.  Only he sits on
      the floor experiencing his shattering mind-walk, silently. 
      SIRENS can be heard on the approach.  Sarah shakes the Crow. 
      She kneels to him.

                                      SARAH
                    Eric?  I think we better go.  I don't
                    think there's a lot of people who
                    are gonna believe your story just
                    now.

                                    THE CROW
                    Why should they?  I don't.

      Sarah instinctively wraps her arms around him in a hug.

                                      SARAH
                    I don't know how you came back...
                          (beat)
                    ...but I'm glad you did.
                          (beat)
                    What do you do now?

      The Crow leads Sarah to the window, lets her climb out.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 50.

                                    THE CROW
                    Maybe even things out.  My soul can't
                    rest until I set things right.

                                      SARAH
                    You never used to talk like that.

                                    THE CROW
                    Things have changed.

      The Crow follows her out, as we:

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                    END OF ACT FOUR      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 51.

      FADE IN:


      INT. DARLA'S PLACE - FRONT ROOM - MORNING

      Darla sits at the kitchen table, drinking from a cup of
      coffee.  Sarah enters.

                                      SARAH
                    What's in the coffee?

                                      DARLA
                    Coffee.

                                      SARAH
                    Are we 'getting our act together'
                    again?

                                      DARLA
                    I'm gonna try.  That's all I can
                    tell you.  I'm gonna try.

      Sarah breezes past her to the refrigerator.  Been there,
      heard that.

                                      SARAH
                    Whatever.

      Darla summons all her courage.

                                      DARLA
                    I'm gonna need your help.

      It hits Sarah hard.  She sits down at the table.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm not real good at holding hands.

      A tough moment between the two.  Darla slides a paper bag
      across the table.

                                      DARLA
                    I made you lunch.
                          (beat)
                    If I have to do this, you have to go
                    to school.

      Sarah looks inside the sack.  Turns up her nose.

                                      SARAH
                    Peanut butter?  I'm not in
                      kindergarten.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 52.

                                      DARLA
                    Sorry...  I...  I just thought... 
                          (grabs sack back)
                    I'll throw it out.

      She starts to throw the sack in the trash.  Sarah reaches
      out, grabs her by the forearm.

                                      SARAH
                    Wait.  I'll eat it.

      Darla almost smiles.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Just don't start going to PTA
                    meetings, okay?

      A fragile moment of truce and beginning, observed by the
      spirit crow at the window.


      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      Albrecht stands next to a pile of fresh dirt watching as a
      couple of gravediggers help pull a coffin out of the ground.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Let's have a look.

      A crow lands on the top of Shelly Webster's gravestone.

                                      GRAVEDIGGER
                    Procedure says we take this down to
                    one of the city approved mortuaries
                    before we open it.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Just open it, Greely.  Heat's on me.

      The gravedigger considers this, indicates to his counterpart
      that they should go ahead.  They both put protective masks
      on.  Albrecht covers his mouth and nose with his handkerchief.

      The casket is popped open.  Surprise registers on all faces.

                                      GRAVEDIGGER
                    This some kind of joke, Albrecht?

      Albrecht slowly lets his handkerchief fall from his face.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    If it is, I'm not in on it.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 53.

      THE CASKET
