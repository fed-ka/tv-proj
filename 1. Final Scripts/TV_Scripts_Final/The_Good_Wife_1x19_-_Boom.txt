      White.  Then a dot.  Another.  We move across them coming to 
      a line.  It s a sketch.  Meanwhile, we hear...  

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (V.O.)
                     At 8:16 pm on November 5th, the 
                    explosion hit.  It was felt over 
                    four blocks away. 

    We follow the line to a rectangle-- the edge of a sketched 
      suitcase.  Oh, it s a cartoon-- a political cartoon-- but 
      we re too close in to see much more than lines, shadings.   

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                     Federal Investigators determined 
                    it was a pipe bomb consisting of 
                    ammonium nitrate and anhydrous 
                    hydrazine nitrate, which had been 
                    thrown through the window of the 
                    newsroom layout office. 

      Another line.  Again leading in from the cartoon s edge (as 
    if we re afraid of the middle).  This one becomes an airplane 
      outside an airport window.  

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                     No culprits were ever apprehended, 
                    and the federal government 
                    continues to investigate. 

      A last line.  Becoming the top of a metal detector: a warning 
      light blinking with cartoon urgency.

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                     The explosion killed the plaintiff, 
                    Mr. Jeffrey Sanborn, 42, managing 
                    editor of the Cook County Vindicator.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY11

      ...JULIUS CAIN sitting with Cary and Alicia across the table 
      from three opposing lawyers.  All with thick contracts.  

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER
                    Noted and accepted. Replacing  killed. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      2.

      CONTINUED:11


      It s a small insurance negotiation.  Tedious below-the-radar 
      work.  The Walter Mitty OPPOSING LAWYERS yellow-line their 
      thick settlement agreements, continuing to read: 

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (CONT D)
                     Mr. Sanborn is married, and has two 
                    teenaged dependents who will suffer 
                    from loss of wages and affection. 

      Alicia peers behind the opposing lawyers from the words to 
    the fact: KAREN SANBORN, widow of the deceased.  40 s, red-
      eyed, soulful.  Life is kicking the shit out of her, and 
      Alicia can t help but sympathize.  

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER (CONT D)
                     Mr. Clay and the Cook County 
                      Vindicator, jointly and severally, 
                    agree to pay...?   Julius?
                          (looks up at him)

                                  JULIUS
                     $250,000 from capped business 
                      insurance,  $100,000 from capped 
                    renter s insurance.   But only if 
                    we agree now.  

                                  OPPOSING LAWYER
                    We agree.  Mrs. Sanborn?

      They turn to Karen who stares straight ahead intently.  

                                  JULIUS
                    Mrs. Sanborn?

                                  KAREN
                    The man you re discussing-- my 
                    husband-- he was working on a novel 
                    at night, after work.  I just 
                    started reading it.  It s... 
                    beautiful.  
                          (chokes up)
                    And you re telling me he s worth 
                    $350,000?

      Silence in the room.  The lawyers all staring at real pain.  
    Not sure how to handle it.  Alicia clears her throat:








                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      3.

      CONTINUED: (2)11


                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Sanborn.  No money will ever 
                    replace your husband.  But the only 
                    way we can talk here is about 
                    money.  I m sorry.

      Karen stares at Alicia, hears the warmth in her voice, and it 
      makes her paradoxically angry.  A controlled cleansing anger.

                                  KAREN
                    I ve been reading a lot of books 
                    about grief; and they all suggest 
                    waiting six months before you make 
                    any big changes in your life.  
                    Well, Jeffrey died six months ago 
                    this week, so...
                          (turns to her lawyer)
                    You re fired.  And you are too.

    The three opposing lawyers, stunned, stare at her.

                                  JULIUS
                    Mrs. Sanborn, if you do this, we 
                    have to start over, and you may not 
                    get a better settlement from our 
                    client.

                                  KAREN
                    I think I will.

                                  JULIUS
                    Why?  Why do you think that?

      Karen raises her cellphone, reads a text...

                                  KAREN
                    Because I just hired a new lawyer.

      And...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION/HALLWAY - DAY22

                                  STERN
                    Jeanette!

      JONAS STERN plows off the elevator-- just like in episode 
      108.  Bigger than life.  The receptionist, JEANETTE, runs to 
      him, jumps into his arms, thrilled.  Stern laughs:






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      4.

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    God, I miss you.  Get out of this 
                    hellhole, Jeanette, and come work 
                    for a real firm!  Hey, Bob, Larry, 
                    and new lawyer I don t know.

      Stern shaking hands with them all as we notice three young 
      lawyers getting off the elevator behind him.  They have the 
      clipped efficiency of young RoboLawyers. Two men, one woman.    

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    Oh my god, what is that?

      A laughing Stern pointing to a flower arrangement.  He pulls 
    one out.  Laughing, loving it:

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    God, fake flowers, they really are 
                    at death s door.  

    He looks toward the conference room, and...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY33

                                  STERN
                    I have arrived!

      Alicia turns.  Oh fuck.  Cary turns, Julius turns.  Stern in 
    all his glory, loving it.   

                                  KAREN
                    Mr. Stern, thank you for joining us.

                                  STERN
                    Mrs. Sanborn, it is my extreme and 
                      unconditional pleasure.  Hello, Julius... 
                          (looks toward the glass)
                    I see you haven t taken the  S  off yet.

                                  JULIUS
                    We re looking for a new Stern.  

      Stern laughs, turns to Alicia...

                                  STERN
                    Coffee.  Two sugars.  Thanks.

      Alicia stares at him for a second, not sure if it s a joke.  

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                          (to his robo-lawyers)

                    Youth, they have no appreciation 
                    for caffeine.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Stern, how re you feeling?

      Stern stares at her: not sure if it s a pointed question.  
    And maybe it is.  He recovers quickly:

                                  STERN
                    How am I feeling?  I m feeling like 
                    amending a complaint.  How s that sound?

                                  JULIUS
                    Jonas, insurance is capped at $350,000.  
                    The newspaper can t pay more.

                    It can if it s an intentional act.

      Silence.  Alicia studies Stern.

                                  RACHEL (O.S.)
                      Intentional act opens you up to 
                    punitive damages.

      RACHEL WILEY (28).  Stern s female Robo-Lawyer.  Sexy.  Tough 
    as an assassin.  Knows how to use her body to wrap men in 
      knots.  And one of them seems to be Cary, staring at her 
      intently, almost angrily.  What s that about?  

                                  STERN
                    I love it when she talks.  It sounds 
                    so much better from a young person.

                                  DIANE
                    How is it an intentional act?

      Stern turns to see Diane, cross-armed, entering.   Stern 
      smiles.  A man who appreciates drama.  He glances at Rachel, 
    who reaches into her briefcase and hands him a folded up 
      newspaper.  He holds it up-- we only see it from behind.

      Will s office.  Alicia starts toward it, sees Will is inside 
      chatting amiably over sandwiches with another man.  A large 
      man.  Can t see who it is.  

      Will s SECRETARY enters with something for Will to sign, 
      leaving the door slightly ajar.  Alicia moves closer, leans 
    in slightly to hear the two chuckling men...

                    It s never about money.  It s

                    Well, I m sorry we can t help.    

    The secretary exits, closes the door-- noticing Alicia has 
      moved.  Alicia peers nonchalantly in at the large man, now 
      standing, shaking hands with Will.  He turns and we meet...

      ...GERALD KOZKO exiting alone.  50 s.  An immaculately 
      dressed bulldog.  G. Gordon Liddy as a shady real-estate 
      developer.  He stops, noticing Alicia.  He takes a second, 
      surprised.  Nods.

      INT. THE VIOLET HOUR BAR - NIGHT66

    Hip bar.  Hip music.  Hip everything.  Six-figure 28-year-olds 
      trying to feel like players.  Rachel Wiley sits in a corner 
      banquette, male model whispering in her ear.  Cary approaches.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      11C.

      Rachel looks up.  Smiles.

                    You re not going to pout, are you?  
                    I hate when men pout.

      Cary sits in the banquette.  Rachel grins, tells the model:

                                  RACHEL (CONT D)
                    Go away.

    He does as Cary scoots closer:

                    So let s inspect the level of 
                      coincidence here.  I haven t seen 
                    you since college.  We bump into

                    I m doing.  I talk about the 
                    Muhammad cartoon case, and then the 
                    next day-- lo and behold-- you and 
                    your firm are suing my client.

                                  RACHEL
                    Well, if you put it that way it 
                    does sound coincidental.

      Rachel s cell buzzes.  She checks the text.  Taking her time.

                                  RACHEL (CONT D)
                    Cary, think about it.  If I let slip 
                    a piece of information like that to

      Stern, in his own world.  He stares at a row of eight pencils 
    in front of him on a table.  He moves one pencil.  Then 
      another.  Another.  A zenexercise?  Finally he takes a

      Karen Sanborn on the stand.  In black.  Restrained.  Tough.  
    The jury watches her intently, liking her.

                                  KAREN
                    Mr. Clay? Yes. Until recently. It had

                    Objection.  Beyond the scope.

      JUDGE IRA GARRETT peers down from the bench.  Above the fray.  
      Detests conflict.  He hates objections.  Pained--

                    Well, I really think we re safe 
                    here, don t you?  You may answer, 
                    Mrs. Sanborn.  

      Diane eyes Stern like he s a snake, Clay and Julius beside 
      her.  Alicia, Cary behind them.  

                                  KAREN
                    Well, the paper was in financial 
                    trouble.  They had to lay off a lot 
                    of staff.  The stress took its toll.

                    And that was it?   

                                  KAREN
                    No.  Jeff was also frustrated by Mr. 
                    Clay s pursuit of a New Yorker

                    Something controversial.  Like the 
                      Obamafist-bump cartoon on the New

      Cary meanwhile looks across toward Rachel, second chair at 
      Stern s table.  She glances back, the two showing no recognition.  

                                  STERN
                    Mrs. Sanborn-- did your husband 
                    help Mr. Clay choose this cartoon 
                    to publish in the paper?

                                  KAREN
                    Yes.  It was a contest and he 
                    helped Mr. Clay judge it.

                                  STERN
                    But the cartoon was different, 
                    wasn t it?

                                  KAREN
                    Yes.  I saw the original.  It 
                    didn t depict Muhammad.  It was 
                    just a Middle-Eastern man.

      Alicia closes her eyes.  Damn.  As Diane takes furious notes 
    and Stern shoots a cocky look toward her.  

                                  STERN
                    So whose decision was it to change 
                    the cartoon to depict Muhammad?

                                  DIANE
                    Objection, your honor.  Hearsay.

                                  STERN
                    It s not being offered for the 
                    truth of the matter, Judge.  Only 
                    as an accurate representation of 
                    what Mr. Sanborn said.

      Judge garrett sighs-- why can t we all just get along?  Then:

                    Jeffrey told me the decision to 
                    change it to Muhammad was Mr. 
                    Clay s.  To generate more 
                    controversy.  

      Diane shoots a look at Clay, who shakes his head:  No.  But 
    the damage is done.  Behind him, Cary leans into Alicia--

                    Is it just me-- or do we really 
                    need to find that cartoonist?

      INT.  27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY1414

      Which is exactly what Kalinda s endeavoring to do, with the 
      help of PYM GABRIEL-- 20 s, heavyset.  Think Hurley from 
       Lost.   He clicks a few buttons on a laptop--

                                  GABRIEL
                    Okay, so here s your cartoon--

      --and an image pops up on the screen: the cartoon-- although 
    we don t see it.  He clicks again, ZOOMING IN on a corner of 
    the drawing.  The lines we saw during the opening.

                                  GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    See this cross-hatching-- how it 
                    almost looks like bars?  That can 
                    indicate a sense of suffocation-- 
                    like they can t say what they mean.  
                    In this case, it might indicate 
                    someone who s a Muslim themselves.

                                  KALINDA
                          (bored out of her mind)
                    Fascinating.  Does this really work?

                                  GABRIEL
                      Graphology?

                                  KALINDA
                    As applied to drawing.

                                  GABRIEL
                    It does if you know what you re 
                    looking for.  You don t respect my 
                    job, do you?

                                  KALINDA
                    I am... incredulous.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      21.

      Challenged, he clicks another couple of buttons, now bringing 
    up a Google Image search, cross referenced against the 
      drawing.  He clicks the keys again, filtering the results--

                                  GABRIEL
                    It s best with comparison.  You run 
                    an image search, cross-referenced 
                    with the unique elements of the 
                    sample drawing-- 

      Still a whole page full of results.

                                  GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Still too much.  Let s see...

    But Kalinda peers toward the screen, thinks. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Narrow it down by location.  To 
                    Chicago.

      Gabriel nods, clicks some more keys.  A-ha:  now there s only 
      three matches.  Kalinda reaches over and clicks on the first 
      one--and up pops a Facebook page for someone named  Tarik
      Bassir  of Western Springs, Illinois.  

    No photograph-- just tons of pencil and ink cartoon drawings, 
      many of them depicting traditional Muslim imagery or Middle-
      Eastern looking figures, women in burkas, etc.

                                  KALINDA (CONT'D)
                    Well, well.  I m a believer.

                                  GABRIEL
                    They all end up believing.  I seem 
                    to breed lowered expectations.

      Kalinda writes down the name, squeezes his shoulder, leaves.  
      Passing by Will s office where Cary is talking awkwardly with 
      Will...

      Cary pauses, wanting Will s attention.  Oh, Will looks up 
      from his e-mail.

                    When you hired me, I was told the

                    salaries-- for down-payments, cars.

                    Yes.  Got my eye on a condo in

      Cary glances out at Alicia disappearing down the hall.

                                  CARY
                    I just want to know if there s

                    You are.  Nobody has made any

      Cary stares at him.  Not a ringing endorsement.

      EXT.  DOWNTOWN CHICAGO CONSTRUCTION SITE - LIFT - DAY1616

      A downtown building under construction.  Golden and Gold ride 
    up in a construction lift with Gerald Kozko.  The lift stops 
    on a floor and they exit.  Golden doing all the talking; Eli 
      doing all the watching.  

                                  KOZKO
                    So... how s Peter holding up?

                                  GOLDEN
                    He s good.  He would be better if 
                    he had a clearer sense of what 
                    Childs was planning. 

                                  KOZKO
                    So he got the message?  My apology? 

                                  GOLDEN
                    You and Peter go back a long way.  
                    If Childs is threatening you-- 
                    naturally Peter wants to help his 
                    friends in any way he can.

                                  KOZKO
                    I don t want to hurt Peter.  But 
                    it s not just me.  I have a legacy 
                    to protect.  My son.

    He nods across the floor to ANTHONY KOZKO (late 20s) in 
      managerial hard-hat.  Good looking kid.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Peter has a family too.

                                  KOZKO
                    We all have families.   

    Eli stares at him, finally... 

                                  ELI
                    Okay, pleasantries over.  Whatever 
                    you ve got, or can devise, to hurt 
                    Peter-- he s got twice as much to 
                    hurt you.

                                  KOZKO
                    I know your reputation, Mr. Gold.

                                  ELI
                    Then you know I don t screw around.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      24.

                                  KOZKO
                    I know Peter has religion.  

    Eli pauses, surprised.

                                  ELI
                    Meaning?

                                  KOZKO
                    He s off his game.  You have some 
                    pastor giving him spiritual 
                    instruction.  And now he s going to 
                    church.  Hey, I m in risk 
                      assessment, Mr. Gold.  At the 
                    moment, Childs is the bigger risk.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Did he give you immunity?

      Kozko just stares at them.  Then goes off to join his son.  
    Eli and Golden frown.

                                  ELI
                    That s not good.  

      EXT.  SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (EVENING)1717

    The sun s starting to set as Alicia and Kalinda approach the 
      door of a well-kept suburban home.  Kalinda knocks.

    The door opens, revealing a friendly-looking Middle Eastern 
      woman.  DR. BASSIR.  40 s, very well dressed, western.

                    Yeah, it was my idea. Some jackhole 
                    at the airport gave me a hard time, 
                    so I drew about it.  First I just 
                    made it a random Muslim.  Then I 
                    thought-- what the hell?

                                  DR. BASSIR
                    Language.

    his eyes: old world concerns.

                    I mean-- if I m going to make a 
                    statement, why not really make a 
                    statement, you know?

                                  ALICIA
                    So it was your idea to depict...

                                  TARIK
                    ...the Prophet, yeah.  Somebody has

                      Fundamentalists.

    Oh.  Alicia nods, as Tarikcontinues:

                      I emailedClay, told him I wanted 
                    to change the cartoon.  Put it out 
                    in the open, get other Muslims to

                    That s not up to Tarik.  

      They look to the mother.

                                  ALICIA
                    Tarik could testify in camera-- in 
                    the judge s chambers.  There would 
                    just be the Judge, the court 
                    reporter, the lawyers.  We d use a 
                    pseudonym.  

                                  DR. BASSIR
                    Mrs. Florrick, Miss Sharma, I know 
                    the name of only one cartoonist.  
                    Kurt Westergaard, the man who drew 
                    one of the Muhammad cartoons in the 
                    Danish paper five years ago.  And 
                    he has lived under 24 hour security 
                    ever since.   I will not do that to 
                    my son.  If he was your son, would 
                    you?

                                  KALINDA
                    We could subpoena him.

      Alicia looks toward Kalinda: a little tough.

                                  DR. BASSIR
                    Then subpoena him.  I will not let 
                    my son testify.

      They eye the mom, arms crossed, unyielding.

      INT.  CIVIL COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM #310 - DAY2121

      Back at trial.  RUSSELL THIESSEN (30 s) in the witness box-- 

                                  THIESSEN
                    Yes, I was at the Vindicator when 
                    Mr. Clay made the decision to 
                    publish the cartoon.  

                                  STERN
                    Did you argue against it?

                                  THIESSEN
                    I did.  I felt it was insensitive 
                    to Muslim believers-- especially 
                    when the same point could be made 
                    without depicting Muhammad.  

                                  STERN
                    You also argued it was reckless?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Yes.  I was the reporter who 
                    covered the synagogue bombing.  I 
                    saw the devastation that caused.  

    He nods toward the widow, Karen Sanborn, in the gallery.  She 
      nods back.

                                  STERN
                    Were you present when Mr. Clay met 
                    with the Vindicatorlawyer before 
                    printing the cartoon?

                                  DIANE
                    Objection, your honor!  Attorney-

                    to cross-examine.

      Great, Diane sits, looks over at a worried Clay.  Alicia 
      watches him too.

                                  STERN
                    And what was said at this meeting?

                                  THIESSEN
                    The lawyer warned Mr. Clay against  
                    printing the cartoon.  

      Stern eyes the jury, all listening intently.

                                  STERN
                    Why?

                                  THIESSEN
                    He referenced TheNew York Times
                    and Yale University Pressdecisions 
                    not to reprint the Danish cartoon.  
                    He believed, in both cases, the 
                    fear of inciting violence trumped 
                    the public s need to know.

                                  STERN
                    I see.  Thank you, sir.  

      Stern and Diane glare at each other as they pass, he sitting, 
    she standing.

                                  DIANE
                    Mr. Thiessen, you were worried the 
                    paper would be insensitive to 
                    religious believers by printing the 
                    cartoon?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Yes.  I m not a Muslim myself, but 
                    I can sympathize. 

                                  DIANE
                    And what is this?

      Diane holds up a picture.  Thiessen rolls his eyes, knowing 
      where this is going.

                                  THIESSEN

                                  DIANE
                    Yes, an artwork that depicts a 
                    crucifix placed in a cup of urine.  
                    This photo illustrated an article 
                    of yours on controversial art?
                          (Thiessen nods)
                    My goodness.  Why not the same 
                      sensitivity to religious believers?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Because that is unlikely to incite 
                    violence.

      Diane shoots a look toward the jury.  Is she losing them?  
    No, they re right with her.

                                  DIANE
                    I see.  So it s not about 
                    sensitivity.  It s about fear?

                                  THIESSEN
                    It s about both.  

                                  DIANE
                    You were fired from the Vindicator, 
                    weren t you, Mr. Thiessen?  As part 
                    of Mr. Clay s cost-cutting?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Yes, but that has had nothing to do 
                    with my testimony.  

                                  DIANE
                    Of course not.

                                  KALINDA
                    It s an ongoing investigation.

                            (distracted)
                    ...thereis something here. 

    She indicates a photograph of the bomb scene-- debris strewn 
      everywhere, windows blown out and half the walls blown away.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    The theory is that the bomb was 
                    tossed in through the window.

                                  ALICIA
                    Just like at the synagogue.

                                  KALINDA
                    But the windows were all blown out 
                    by the force of the blast.

                                  ALICIA
                    So?

                                  KALINDA
                    So there s no way to tell if the 
                    bomb was tossed in or not.  At the 
                    synagogue bombing they had 
                    eyewitnesses who saw two men toss 
                    the bomb in and flee the scene.

      Kalinda points to a place in the center of the room that s 
      circled in the photo-- the epicenter of the blast.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    That s the blast site.  

    She points to the wall behind it, half blown apart.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Remember what Clay said-- those 
                      dumbwaiters they used during 
                      Prohibition to haul the liquor up.  
                    They re all over the place.  

      Alicia looks at the photo, the blown out wall--

                                  ALICIA
                    So if there was a dumbwaiter there--

    She looks up at Kalinda.  As...

      Jackie stares at him, takes her keys from the lock, enters, 
      sees Daniel on the phone pacing in the living room.

                                  JACKIE
                    You re not the plumber?

      Jackie stares at him suspiciously.  Eli smiles, sizes her up 
      immediately.

      INT.  COOK COUNTY VINDICATOR - BASEMENT - DAY2929

      Alicia and Kalinda move along a semi-dark corridor in the 
      cellar underneath the building, coming to A DUMBWAITER DOOR 
    set into the wall.  The blown apart remnants of a rope and 
      pulley system stick out of it.

                                  KALINDA
                    So this is the access to the office 
                      dumbwaiter.

                                  ALICIA
                    The blast blew it apart.  Doesn t 
                    mean the bomb went up this way.  

    She sees Kalinda concentrating on something on the floor near 
      a basement garbage can.    

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    What?  

      Kalinda shrugs, moves the can, revealing a splatter stain on 
    the floor burned into the concrete.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    What is it?

      Kalinda shrugs, kneels, sees the splatter extends up the 
      wall, but stops at the edge of a border of tile.   

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Kalinda.  Words. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Right.  The bomb was hydrazine 
                    nitrate.  Liquid explosive.  It 
                    stains concrete, not tile.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (looks at her)
                    Howdo you know that?

                                  KALINDA
                    I looked it up. 

      Alicia shakes her head-- okay-- as Kalinda runs her finger up 
    the stain... 

                                  KALINDA (CONT'D)
                    The splatter stained here, not 
                    here.  Concrete not tile.  

                                  ALICIA
                    It could ve been blown down the 
                    shaft from the blast.

                                  KALINDA
                    Not in liquid form.

                    So what are you saying, somebody 
                    mixed the bomb here, and raised it 
                    up the dumbwaiter?

      Alicia and Kalinda download their findings to Will and Diane.

                                  KALINDA
                    The blast blew apart the wall with 
                    the dumbwaiter, so there was no 
                    evidence it was even there.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Should I bring Julius in on this?

                    No, not yet.  We ll update him later.  
                          (Alicia stares at him: odd)
                    I still don t understand how the 
                    Fedsmissed this-- 

                                  KALINDA
                    My guess is they didn t.  Their 
                      investigation is still open-- they 
                    just haven t issued any findings 
                    yet.  And they won t, until they 
                    catch whoever s responsible.

      Will, seeing Cary in the hall, opens the door: 

                                  WILL
                    Cary, come on in.

      Alicia notes this.  Not sure what to make of it.  

                                  DIANE
                    The question is, what does it mean?

                                  ALICIA
                    Stern s theory is that Clay wanted 
                    a violent backlash.  That rests on 
                    the fact that he cut back security.  

                                  KALINDA
                    But if the bomb came from inside-- 
                    no security could ve prevented it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Right.

                                  DIANE
                    Stern will argue the bomb was still 
                    planted by a radical Islamic group-- 
                    they just had help from inside.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      39.

      Diane and Will pause, offended.  Partly because it s true.

                    Look-- I really didn t want it to

                    no secret this place is in some 
                    financial trouble--

                                  WILL
                    Half of which is Stern s fault.

                                  JULIUS
                    We were in trouble before Stern 
                    started taking clients.  Right now, 
                    his new firm seems more stable.  And 
                    I consider him a mentor.

                                  DIANE
                    So do I.  But at the end of the 
                    day, I bet on myself, not him.  
                    With Stern-- it s all about Stern.

                                  JULIUS
                    I m sorry.

      Julius gets up to exit.

                                  WILL
                    Julius-- you re one of the best 
                    lawyers we have.  You have a great 
                    client list.  So what s it gonnatake?

      Julius considers this, takes a folded letter from his pocket.  
      Hands it to Diane and Will.

                                  JULIUS
                    That s my offer from Stern.  

      Diane studies it.  A bit thrown.  But covering well.

                    We lag behind virtually every major 
                    Chicago firm in diversity hiring.  
                    I m tired of being the poster child

                    Okay.  We ll find the money.

      Julius nods.  Surprised.  They said yes.

                    Now it s your turn to do something 
                    for us.  The 10 lawyers who planned 
                    to leave with you-- their names.

      Julius looks up, startled, as Will hands him a pen and pad.

                                  JULIUS
                    You want me--?  But they ll stay 
                    now.  Stern wanted me, not them.  

                                  DIANE
                    Yes, but we don t want turncoats 
                    with access to proprietary 
                    information.

                                  JULIUS

                          (Julius stares at him)
                    Write down the names.

      Julius turns to the pad.  The pen.

      A photograph of a bombed-out synagogue, with the words  JIHAD 
    IS THE WAY  printed underneath in boldface.  Kalinda lays it 
    on the desk.  Diane, Will, and Alicia...

                                  DIANE
                    What is that?

                                  KALINDA
                    The result of our questioning of 
                    employees.  One received this from 
                    an anonymous coworker a week before 
                    the attack.  

      Will and Diane trade a look.  Damn.   

                                  WILL
                    Tell me they didn t take this to 
                    Clay?

                                  ALICIA
                    They took it to Clay.

                                  DIANE
                    And he ignored it?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                          (sighs)
                    So it s even worse now that it s an 
                    inside job.  Clay isn t liable for 
                      unforeseeable acts of his 
                    employees.  But now if he had prior 
                    notice...

      Will shakes his head, looks at Diane--

                                  WILL
                    If we know this, Stern knows this.  

                                  DIANE
                    That s a happy thought.

                    That s me, Mr. Cheer.  It makes the 
                      questioning of Clay tomorrow that 
                    much more important.

                    Which brings up another problem: 
                    Julius was handling questioning.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why is that a problem?

      Diane and Will trade a look.

                                  WILL
                    Maybe Cary should take it.

                                  DIANE
                    No.  Alicia.  She can get in 
                    Stern s face more effectively.

      Will and Diane look at each other, surprised at their switch 
    in mentorees.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER3535

      Alicia and Kalinda make their way down the stairs.

                                  KALINDA
                    The fact is, you know something 
                    about Stern no one else knows.

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t use it, Kalinda.

                                  KALINDA

                    Only if you tell someone.  So don t

                    That s untrue.  The cartoonist 
                    contacted me with that idea.  

      Alicia shoots a look toward Karen Sanborn in the gallery.  
      Clearly hurting her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Still it was your decision to run 
                    the cartoon, Mr. Clay.  Why did you?  

                                  CLAY
                    Because it was newsworthy.  It 
                    wasn t sensational.  And-- this is 
                    America; we can handle it.

      Alicia takes a beat, then heads toward her seat-- no further

                    The investigative report merely 
                    states that it appears the bomb was 
                    planted from inside.  It doesn t

                    dumbwaiters.  We ask that statement

                    Is that really necessary, Mrs. 
                    Florrick?  Overruled.

      Diane shoots Alicia a look-- what the hell are you doing?  
    But Alicia ignores her as she sits back down.  

      Stern tries to gather himself, but it s becoming clear what s 
      happening: Alicia s objections are throwing him off his game.

                                  STERN
                    Thank you.  I-- where was I?

      Rachel, Stern s associate, glances up at him-- should she say 
      something?  Stern stands there a second, then--

                    Right.  The dumbwaiter-- employees.

                    employees ever come to you with any

                      Objection-- overly vague.

      Judge Garrett stares at her.  So does Diane.  But Stern is 
    now genuinely confused.

      Alicia keeps her poker face, staring straight ahead.  As 
      Stern looks over at her, a dawning realization.  Alicia 
      doesn t look at him.

                                  KALINDA
                    Because of the threat.  The bomb.

                    Right, but doesn t it make more

      Kalinda stares at him.

      Russell Thiessen is back on the stand. Cary stands to 
      question, taking his time, shooting a smile toward Rachel 
      Wiley as he passes.  She just frowns a  fuck you  look back.

                    Mr. Thiessen, you covered the

                    And it s your opinion that this

      Stern studies Cary-- what s he up to? 

                                  THIESSEN
                    Well, in both cases the device was 
                    fashioned from a metal cannister, densely 
                    packed with hydrazine nitrate explosive 
                    and a simple remote-triggered circuit.

                    different triggering mechanism than 
                    the synagogue bombing?

                                  THIESSEN
                    No, no-- it was identical.

                    Yes, from a camera-- it s quite 
                    clever.  It produces just enough 
                    flame to trigger the fuse.

                                  CARY
                    Interesting.  But when you reported 
                    on the synagogue bombing-- you 
                    never mentioned that fact?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Well, it s kind of a technical 
                    detail.  A little beyond the scope 
                    of a basic news article.

                    who possesses all of that knowledge-
                    - would be you.

      Alicia looks toward the jury, sees them furiously taking 
      notes.  So does Rachel.  As Stern reaches across the aisle 
      with the piece of paper.  Diane looks toward him, takes it.

      Diane opens it, reads:   $350k.   She considers.  Scratches 
    out the number, writes in  $250k.   She offers it back.

                    nothing further.

    And Cary returns to his seat, passing Stern and Rachel.  Both 
      trying to hold a poker face, staring straight ahead, as Stern 
      reads the amount.  Both crushed, as... Choir singing gets 
      louder and louder, and we find ourselves in...

      opportunity to lean in toward Alicia.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    Mrs. Florrick, would you ever like

      Isaiah laughs at her bluntness.

                                  PASTOR ISAIAH
                    I have respected the way you ve

                    Well, it s a lesson in something.

    And with that Alicia starts up the aisle with Zach and Grace, 
    as the Pastor eyes her, intrigued.  Peter catches up, and the 
      family walks side-by-side toward a pew, a lot of eyes on them.

      Peter smiles, slips his hand into Alicia s and gives hers a 
      squeeze.  They take their seats.  And then Peter s phone 
      BUZZES-- it s not noticeable over the music, but Peter checks 
      it-- then whispers:

                    I know.  That s why the coffee. 

    She takes it, looks at it.

                                  RACHEL
                    Why d you tell them?  Why didn t 
                    you just come over to Stern s?  You 
                    don t seem like the loyal type.

                                  CARY
                    I know.  Crazy, huh?

                                  RACHEL
                    What about Lockhart/Gardner?  Is 
                    there a job there?

                    No.

      Final.  Rachel stares at him, crosses to the sink, pours out 
    the coffee, fills the cup with water.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    What re you doing?

                                  RACHEL
                    The coffee was too hot to throw in 
                    your face.

    Oh.  Cary nods.  Makes sense.  He waits there.  Looks toward 
    his scarf.  Takes it off, doesn t want to get that wet, as 
      Rachel returns, throws the water in his face.  Cary s smile 
      never disappears.

                                  CARY
                    Take care.

      Rachel slams the door in his face.  And off we go, back to--    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      56.



      INT.  LORD IN CHRIST CHURCH - DAY - AS BEFORE4242

      Alicia and the kids alone, doing their best to clap along.  
      Alicia looks around, wondering: where the hell is Peter?

      INT.  LORD IN CHRIST CHURCH - BASEMENT - SAME TIME4343

    In the basement of the Church.  We hear the music down here, 
      muffled but ever present, as we find Peter with Gerald Kozko, 
      greeting.  A hug between two titans.  Eli watching.    

                                  PETER
                    Okay, it s just us.  What s up?

                                  KOZKO
                    He s got me in a corner.  Childs.  
                    He has stuff on me even you don t 
                    know about.  And he ll use it--

                                  PETER
                    Unless you testify against me?

                                  KOZKO
                    Peter, I have no choice--  

    Eli rolls his eyes.  

                                  PETER
                    Childs is going to get you to lie 
                    on the stand--

                                  KOZKO
                    It s not lies.  Not the videotape 
                    of us.

      Peter looks sharply at him.  Kozko pauses...

                                  KOZKO (CONT D)
                    You know, the meeting at the hotel.  

                                  PETER
                    Do you believe in hell?

                                  KOZKO
                    Do I believe in hell?  Sure.  Why?  

                                  PETER
                    Do you believe you have to answer 
                    for your sins?  

                                  KOZKO
                    Peter, we don t have time.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      57.

      CONTINUED:4343


                                  PETER
                    Do you believe it?

                                  KOZKO
                    Yeah, actually I do.  Why?

      And-- boom-- Peter suddenly, alarmingly reaches out, rips 
      Kozko s dress shirt, buttons flying as he tears it open.  
      Yanks Kozko s undershirt down.  Revealing... 

      ...the wire.  A thin line taped to Kozko s chest, a small 
      transmitter.  Eli winces: fuck.  As Peter drops it to the 
      floor, crushes it.  Grabs Kozko s tie, pulls him closer.

                                  KOZKO (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, Peter.  Childs threatened 
                    me; he threatened everything.

    An intense look on Peter s face we ve never seen before.   

                                  PETER
                    Let s not even talk about the stuff 
                    I have on you.  I know you re past 
                    caring about that.  Let s talk 
                    about the stuff I have on your son 
                    Anthony.  Your marriedson.  

      Kozko looks up, worried.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    That s right.  Your legacy.  Your 
                    beautiful legacy.  You believe in 
                    hell now?  

                                  KOZKO
                    Don t, Peter.  You re a Christian.

                                  PETER
                    Damn right, haven t you read the 
                    Old Testament? 

      Peter shoves him away.  Kozko races toward the stairs, starts 
    up, as Eli looks toward Peter.  Stunned.  Impressed.  As...

      EXT. LORD IN CHRIST CHURCH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER4444

      ...Alicia steps out of the church, sees Kozko coming up the 
      basement stairs, trying to save the remnants of his ripped 
      shirt, rushing off to his car, worried.  And as Alicia s 
      trying to process this, she sees...  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      58-59.

      CONTINUED:4444


      ...Peter coming up.  She locks eyes with him, studying him.  
      Without a word, Alicia heads back into Church.  

      INT.  ALICIA S APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT4545*

      Peter, finished changing,exits the master bedroom, hears... *

                                  ALICIA (O.S.)*
                    Tonight sounds good.  Yeah.  No. *

      Alicia on the phone.  Something about her tone.  Peter pauses *
      there, listening.  *

                                  ALICIA (O.S) (CONT D) *
                    I can make a reservation.  No, it s *
                    fine.  Really, Will, it s fine.  I*
                    phoned you.*

       Will.   Like a slap to Peter s face.  He sees a picture *
      hanging on the wall.  Him and Alicia.  Hugging.  Feels like a *
      million years ago.  Peter enters...  *

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT4646*

      ...the kitchen.  Alicia sees him, keeps her voice at the same *
      volume.  Nothing to hide.  *

                                  ALICIA*
                    Good, this ll be fun.  See you then.*

    And she hangs up.  Barely looks at her husband as she crosses *
    to the fridge, takes out a cellophane wrapped bowl.  Places *
    it on the island.  Opens the freezer.  Takes out a pizza.  *

                                  PETER*
                    You re going out?*

                                  ALICIA*
                    Yep.*

                                  PETER*
                    Where?*

                                  ALICIA*
                    I don t know.  Let the oven preheat *
                    ten minutes.  And ignore the box; *
                    it says 12 minutes to cook.  It s *
                    more like 15.*

                                  PETER*
                    And I m not supposed to be jealous?*



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      58-59A.

                    I don t think I care what you are.  *
                    Tell Zach one hour on the computer.  *

    And Alicia starts into the bedroom.  An overwhelmed Peter *
      follows.  Her blase  attitude making him dizzy.  Watching the *
      dissolution of a marriage.*

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT4747*

                                  PETER*
                    I feel like you re punishing me for *
                    something I didn t do.*

      Alicia grabs a coat from the closet. *

                                  ALICIA*
                    I m not punishing you, Peter.  I m *
                    going out to dinner with an old *
                    friend. *

                                  PETER*
                    What you saw at church was me *
                    protecting my family.  He was *
                    wearing a wire.   *

      Alicia stops, looks at him.  Almost a whisper...*

                                  ALICIA*
                    Peter, it s over.*

      There it is.  The quiet words of finality.  Peter quiet too:*

                                  PETER*
                    What is?*

                                  ALICIA*
                    Us.  Me caring.  Me thinking you re *
                    actually changing.*

                    No, you re not.  You want to think *
                    you re changing so you can go back *
                    to what you did before.   *

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT4848*

      Alicia opens the front door, Peter behind her... *



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      58-59B.

                    Then help me.  If you re right, *
                    then help me.*

      Alicia looks back at him.  He s earnest.  Pained.*

                                  ALICIA*
                    No.  *

    And Alicia is out the door.  Peter tries to follow, but stops *
    on the threshold.  Looks down at his feet.  *

                                  PETER*
                    Alicia.*

    She turns, sees him stopped there.  Both looking down at his *
      feet.  Stuck on the threshold.*

                                  PETER (CONT D)*
                    You used to say we re fine as long *
                    as we talk.  We can argue; we can *
                    fight.  The only danger is when we *
                    stop.  So don t stop.   *

      Alicia.  She almost looks like she ll return, but-- no, she *
      pushes the elevator button.  *

                                  PETER (CONT D)*
                    Then there s nothing I can say?  *

                                  ALICIA*
                    That s right.  *

      And-- ding-- the elevator arrives.  Alicia gets on.  Pushes *
    the down button.  The doors close.  And we pan over to...*

      ...Peter alone in the open doorway.  Still stuck at the *
      threshold.  He looks toward the empty landing.  Alicia gone.  *

      Then Peter has a thought.  A dizzying frightening one.  He *
      looks down at...*

      ...his feet.  Just the tip of his shoes sticking over the *
      edge.  He looks over at the HMDunit.  And Peter closes his *
      eyes.  A cliff diver in Acapulco.   *

    He steps one foot over the threshold.  Nothing.  His anklet *
    on the other foot.  He steps his other foot across, and...*

          ...WAHHHHH-WAHHHH--the warning alarm sounds.  Fully across *
    the threshold now, Peter could still go back, still answer *
    the anticipated police call.  But...*


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      58-59C.
