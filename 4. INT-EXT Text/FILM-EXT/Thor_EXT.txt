A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
down the street and heads out of town.
The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
at the sky.
JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
spare parts of other devices.
JANE
Hurry!
We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
well, rubbing his head.
JANE (CONT'D)
Oh-- watch your head.
SELVIG
Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
of yours supposed to look like?
JANE
It's a little different each time.
Once it looked like, I don't know,
melted stars, pooling in a corner
of the sky. But last week it was a
rolling rainbow ribbon--
SELVIG
(GENTLY TEASING)
"Racing "round Orion?" I've always
said you should have been a poet.
Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.
JANE
Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
my gloves, will you?
Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.
JANE (CONT'D)
Not until you see it!
SELVIG
(re: the gloves)
I recognize those. Think how proud
he'd be to see you now.
Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
JANE
Thank you.
SELVIG
For what?
JANE
The benefit of the doubt.
The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.
JANE (CONT'D)
It's never taken this long before.
Darcy calls up from the front seat.
DARCY (O.S.)
Can I turn on the radio?
JANE
(an edge to her voice)
Sure, if you like rocking out to
KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
time."
Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
her, yanks her back in.
Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
out of the clouds comes --
AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
thousand freight trains as it touches down.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.
The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
them with a terrifying intensity.
The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.
The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
charred and blackened.
DARCY
I think that was legally your
fault.
JANE
Get the first aid kit.
Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
the life back into him.
JANE (CONT'D)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
and don't be dead, okay? Open your
eyes and look at me.
Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
them.
For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.
DARCY
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
know CPR.
A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.
JANE
HIS EYES--
DARCY
(DREAMILY)
--are beautiful.
JANE
--are dilating. That's a good
sign.
SELVIG
We still have to get him to a
hospital.
JANE
(HOPEFULLY)
After we get a reading on the
storm?
SELVIG
Immediately, Jane.
Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
above their heads. A thought strikes her.
JANE
Where did he come from?
They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
glowing remnants of the storm, and into:
EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.
HEIMDALL (V.O.)
Questions, they've always asked
questions -- this race called man,
on this planet they call earth.
Passionately longing to know how
they are connected to the heavens.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
galaxy.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In ages past, they looked to us as
gods, for indeed so many times we
saved them from calamity. We tried
to show them how their world was
but one of the Nine Realms of the
Cosmos, linked to all others by the
branches of Yggdrasil...
We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
out into the black void of space.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
a universe of wonder, beauty, and
terror that they barely
comprehended.
We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But for all their thirst for
knowledge, they let our lessons
fall into myth and dreams.
Where did he come from? He came
from us, the proudest race of
warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
He came from this -- the greatest
Realm the universe has ever known.
We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
what's on the other side:
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He came... from Asgard!
Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
modern yet timeless.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.
The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
out before it.
We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE
STANDS --
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.
ODIN ALLFATHER
Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
land at his side.
Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
ready their battle gear for their journey.
Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
Hogun notices.
THOR
We must first find a way to get
past Heimdall.
VOLSTAGG
That will be no easy task. It's
said the Gatekeeper can see a
single dew drop fall from a blade
of grass a thousand worlds away.
FANDRAL
And he can hear a cricket passing
gas in Niffelheim.
VOLSTAGG
Jest not! He heareth all!
FANDRAL
Please. Getting past him should be
simple enough now, since he seems
to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
under his nose.
Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
VOLSTAGG
Forgive him! He meaneth no
offense!
Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.
Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
most astounding path in this Realm or any other --
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
Observatory.
The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
them, blocking their way, staring them down.
There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.
LOKI
Keep your weapons sheathed and your
mouths closed. This is going to
take subtlety and sincerity, not
brute strength. Leave it to me.
Loki dismounts and steps forward.
LOKI (CONT'D)
GOOD HEIMDALL--
HEIMDALL
You're not dressed warmly enough.
Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.
LOKI
I'm sorry?
HEIMDALL
The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
will kill you all in time, even
Thor.
(THEN)
You think you can deceive me? I,
who watch all? I, who can sense
the flapping of a butterfly's wings
a thousand worlds away?
He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.
HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
Or can hear a cricket passing gas
in Niffelheim?
Fandral looks gob-smacked.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.
FANDRAL
That was just a bit of a jest,
really...
Loki goes into damage control.
LOKI
You must be mistaken. We're not--
THOR
(STEPPING FORWARD)
Enough.
(TO HEIMDALL)
Heimdall, may we pass?
Heimdall stares him down.
HEIMDALL
For ages have I guarded Asgard and
kept it safe from those who would
do it harm. In all that time,
never has an enemy slipped by my
watch -- until this day. I wish to
know how that happened.
THOR
Then tell no one where we've gone
until we've returned.
Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
him.
VOLSTAGG
What happened? Your silver tongue
turn to lead?
LOKI
Get me off this bridge before it
cracks under your girth.
Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
the Observatory.
A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
imprinted on the ice around them.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.
THOR
Come on, big fella. Up...!
With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:
VOLSTAGG
This belt! This belt is now my
lucky belt! I will never remove
it! Even when bathing!
FANDRAL
You bathe?
Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
city lies in the distance.
HOGUN
We shouldn't be here.
THOR
Too late now.
FANDRAL
Actually, it's not. We could turn
right around, hop back to Asgard,
share a mug by the fire. Could be
nice.
Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.
LOKI
Perhaps we should wait.
Thor turns back to his brother.
THOR
For what?
LOKI
To survey the enemy. To gauge
their strengths and weaknesses from
a distance.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.
VOLSTAGG
I'm liking that. Gauging,
surveying. Particularly the
distance part.
THOR
We know all we must. It's time to
act.
Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.
SIF
He's just got to swing his
hammer...
The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.
THOR
It feels good, doesn't it? To be
together again, adventuring on
another world?
FANDRAL
Adventuring? Is that what we're
doing?
THOR
What would you call it?
FANDRAL
Freezing.
VOLSTAGG
Starving.
SIF
Whining.
THOR
How about a song to lift our
spirits?
The others groan.
HOGUN
No, not that!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.
SIF
Please don't make us sing again!
FANDRAL
If I have to listen to Volstagg's
singing voice one more time, I'll
fall on my own sword!
SIF
Well, now I'm on board.
She and Thor share a grin.
The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
central plaza.
SIF (CONT'D)
Where are they?
THOR
Hiding. As cowards always do.
Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.
JOTUN SENTRY
What is your business here,
Asgardian?
The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.
THOR
I speak only to your King. Not to
his foot soldiers.
JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
Then speak.
Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
his people have endured.
LAUFEY
I am Laufey, King of this Realm.
THOR
And I am--
LAUFEY
We know who you are, Odinson. Why
have you brought the stench of your
blood into my world?
THOR
I demand answers.
Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.
LAUFEY
You "demand?"
THOR
How did your people get into
Asgard?
LAUFEY
The house of Odin is full of
traitors.
Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
by the Jotun King's words.
THOR
Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies.
LAUFEY
Your father is a murderer and a
thief. He stole what was ours, and
left our world in ruins. We have
the right to reclaim the Casket.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.
THOR
Not when you'd use it to make war
against other Realms.
Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.
LAUFEY
And why have you come here? To
make peace? You long for battle.
You crave it. I see you for what
you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
a boy, trying to prove himself a
man.
THOR
This boy has grown tired of your
mockery.
Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
him.
LOKI
Thor, stop and think. Look around
you. We are outnumbered.
THOR
Know your place, brother...
LAUFEY
You should listen to his counsel.
You know not what your actions
would unleash.
Laufey steps out of the shadows.
LAUFEY (CONT'D)
But I do. Go now, while I still
allow it.
Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.
LOKI
We will accept your most gracious
offer.
The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
nearby mutters under his breath.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.
JOTUN
Run back home, little princess.
Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
coming.
LOKI
Damn.
In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.
VOLSTAGG
Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
own!
ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.
FANDRAL
I'm hoping that's just decorative.
Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
this.
THOR
Next!
Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
FANDRAL
Well? What move, do you think?
VOLSTAGG
I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."
FANDRAL
At this close range? I think "The
Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.
VOLSTAGG
(DISGUSTED)
Maybe if they were three feet tall!
No! How about "The Randy
Valkyrie"?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.
HOGUN
Shut up!
Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
with his mace.
Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.
SIF
If you don't treat me like a lady,
I won't act like a lady!
She takes out the Jotun.
Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.
LOKI
(to the falling Giant)
Pathetic.
He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
once.
Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.
THOR
Come on! At least make it a
challenge for me!
He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
rises, grins.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.
THOR (CONT'D)
Now that's more like it!
He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
head over heels.
Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
back to his grasp.
THOR (CONT'D)
(re: the fallen Brute)
Ugly and stupid.
Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
the chest. The Jotun falls dead.
SIF
(to Hogun, re: knife)
I'm so glad I taught him how to do
that!
Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
hits in.
VOLSTAGG
You may want to put some ice on
that!
The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
You may be taller, but I'm wider!
Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
flying.
Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
sending him crashing to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
It's not too late for you to
surrender.
Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
out a small FLASK.
Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
to his comrades.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Don't let them grab hold of you!
He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
battle.
Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
stops mid ice layer.
The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
and the warrior drops to one knee.
Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
(on his belly)
Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
had him!
SIF
Of course you did.
Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
goes.
VOLSTAGG
Hang on!
Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
close to hacking into Hogun's legs.
HOGUN
Watch the legs!
VOLSTAGG
(REALIZING)
Right. Sorry.
Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
freeing Hogun's feet.
Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.
FANDRAL
You really think your icicles are a
match for Asgardian steel?
Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
away.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Fair enough.
Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
sword and snaps it in half.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Could we stop just a moment while I
get another sword?
Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
through with his own weapon.
The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
rendering him helpless.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
them off.
Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.
VOLSTAGG
That's unfortunate.
He hurries to his wounded comrade.
FANDRAL
I may need a bit of help. Not a
good look, is it?
VOLSTAGG
Just try not to bleed.
FANDRAL
How's the face?
VOLSTAGG
Flawless.
Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
stalagmite.
Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
Giants.
The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
-- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
distraction, KICKS the Giant.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
the Jotuns around him.
THOR
Come on!
But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
Mjolnir falls to the ground.
A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
ground, to no avail.
Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
leave.
From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
feet.
LOKI
That can't be good.
VOLSTAGG
Yes, it could! Might be an early
spring!
They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.
LOKI
Thor, we must go!
Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
of battle.
THOR
Then go!
SIF
There are too many of them!
THOR
I can stop them!
The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
around them.
SIF
Thor!
But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.
VOLSTAGG
Run!
Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
chase.
Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a
MOMENT --
THOR'S FIST
Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
He opens his hand, beckoning.
One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
with all his might.
KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
What's Thor done?
LOKI
Likely killed us all!
As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
comrades.
Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.
THOR
Loki, we have to see.
Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
many, even for a Thunder God.
VOLSTAGG
(TO LOKI)
Actually, could you bring the mists
back, please?
Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --
ODIN ALLFATHER
Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
to-face with Odin.
Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
about to happen.
Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
earshot of the others.
ODIN
Laufey. End this.
LAUFEY
Your boy sought this out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.
ODIN
You're right. These are the
actions of a boy. Treat them as
such. You and I can stop this
before there's further bloodshed.
Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
blade at the end of his arm.
LAUFEY
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather. He'll get what he came
for -- war and death.
Odin looks grim, determined.
ODIN
So be it.
Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
fleeing Jotuns with delight.
THOR
Now! We'll finish them together!
ODIN
Silence!
Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.
Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
into him, as we:
CUT TO BLACK.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
After a beat, we hear familiar voices.
DARCY (V.O.)
I think that was legally your
fault.
JANE (V.O.)
Get the first aid kit.
(THEN)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
and don't be dead, okay? Open your
eyes and look at me.
THOR'S POV
Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.
DARCY (O.S.)
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
know CPR.
END THOR'S POV
TIME CUT TO:
Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
heads. A thought strikes her.
JANE
(TO SELVIG)
Where did he come from?
They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.
JANE (CONT'D)
Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
Thor searches the ground.
THOR
Hammer...
DARCY
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
That's pretty obvious.
Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
her flashlight down at the sand.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.
JANE
Erik... look at this.
He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
away.
JANE (CONT'D)
We've got to move fast before
anything changes.
(MORE)
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.
JANE (CONT'D)
We need soil samples, light
readings, everything.
She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
Thor, who stares up at the sky.
SELVIG
Jane, we need get him to a
hospital.
Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
cannister.
JANE
Not right now. It'll take too
long. County's an hour away.
We'll drop him off after we're done
here.
Selvig looks uncertain.
JANE (CONT'D)
(RE: THOR)
Look at him, he's fine.
Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.
THOR
Father! Heimdall! I know you can
hear me! Open the bridge!
JANE
(off Selvig's look)
Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
hospital, I'll stay here.
SELVIG
You expect me to leave you alone in
the middle of the desert?
Thor turns to the others, frustrated.
THOR
You! What world is this?
The group is intimidated by his fervor.
SELVIG
It's all right, my friend. We're
going to get you some help.
Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
agitated, belligerent.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.
THOR
Where am I?! Answer me!
Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
Jane looks on, concerned.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.
JANE
Erik, just back away...
SELVIG
(to Thor, calming)
You're in the desert outside the
town of Puente Antiguo.
THOR
What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
DARCY
Uh... New Mexico?
Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
unsure what to make of it.
THOR
You dare threaten Thor with so puny
A--
Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.
DARCY
What? He was freaking me out.
As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.
SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
Next time you decide to taser
someone, do me a favor and make
sure they're already inside the
truck.
(TO JANE)
Jane, come on...
Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.
The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
meteor.
40 OMITTED 40
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39.
The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.
Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.
TOWNIE
Huh.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
strains with all his might, with no luck.
He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
object.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.
TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Huh.
The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
and excitement.
JANE
Darcy, when you're done, take the
soil samples to Professor Meyers in
geology. Remind him, he owes me.
SELVIG
We might want to perform a spectral
analysis.
JANE
"We?"
SELVIG
I flew all the way out here --
might as well make myself useful.
This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
rack-mounted server.
JANE
You know what would be really
useful? Do you still have that
friend at LIGO?
SELVIG
She was more than a friend.
JANE
Could you call in a favor?
SELVIG
You don't think this was just a
magnetic storm?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.
JANE
If I'm right, their observatory
must have picked up gravitational
waves during last night's event.
SELVIG
Meaning?
Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
JANE
Meaning these anomalies might
signify something bigger.
SELVIG
How "big" are we talking about?
Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
covered with stars.
JANE
I think the lensing around the
edges is characteristic of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
DARCY
A what?
SELVIG
I thought you were a science major.
DARCY
Political Science.
Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
JANE
She was the only applicant.
SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
"theoretical" connection between
two different points of space-time.
Darcy stares blankly.
JANE
(TO DARCY)
A wormhole.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
monitor.
JANE (CONT'D)
Erik, look...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
through the "bubble" in the clouds.
JANE (CONT'D)
What do you see here?
SELVIG
Stars.
JANE
Yes. But not our stars.
She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
excitement.
JANE (CONT'D)
This is the star alignment for our
quadrant, this time of year. So
unless Ursa Minor decided to take
the day off... those are someone
else's constellations.
Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
image catches her eye.
DARCY
Hey, check it out.
Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
SELVIG
Is that...?
JANE
I think I left something at the
hospital.
As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
of a MAN.
At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
looking out over Asgard.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.
Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.
JANE
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
doing that on purpose.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
Thor looks up at the sky.
THOR
Blue sky... one sun... This is
Earth, isn't it?
DARCY
I think you may have hit him with
the car one time too many.
JANE
(TO THOR)
Let's get you some clothes.
Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51.
It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
cell phones.
They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
from the back of the truck.
He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.
EAGER TOWNIE
This'll do it.
He yells to the driver.
EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, let 'er rip!
The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
and go flying.
People dive out of the way.
The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"
LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
continuing. They don't notice as --
ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
crater.
He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
pulls out a phone.
COULSON
(INTO PHONE)
Sir -- we've found it.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 51A.
Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.
JANE
Where are you going?
THOR
Twelve miles east of here.
He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
with him.
JANE
Why?
THOR
To get what belongs to me.
JANE
So now you own a satellite?
THOR
It's not what they say it is.
JANE
Whatever it is, the government
seems to think it's theirs. You
intend to just walk in there and
take it?
THOR
Yes.
He stops walking.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.
THOR (CONT'D)
If you take me there now, I'll tell
you everything you wish to know.
JANE
Everything?
THOR
All the answers you seek will be
yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
Darcy looks to the others.
DARCY
"Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,
WHEN:
SELVIG
Jane.
He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
care for him.
SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO JANE)
Please don't do this.
JANE
You know what we saw last night.
This can't be a coincidence. I
want to know what's in that crater.
SELVIG
I'm not talking about the crater.
I'm talking about him.
JANE
He's promised us answers.
SELVIG
He's delusional! Listen to what
he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
"Mjolnir." These are the stories I
grew up with as a child!
JANE
I'd just be driving him out there,
that's all.
SELVIG
It's dangerous. He's dangerous.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
Darcy.
JANE
I'm sorry. I can't take you.
THOR
I understand. Then this is where
we say goodbye.
He takes her hand and kisses it.
JANE
That's... thank you.
Thor bows slightly to each of them.
THOR
Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
Darcy. Farewell.
He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.
SELVIG
Now... let's get back to the lab.
We have work to do.
Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
as he walks away down the street.
Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
Room.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
from her lab.
JANE
Hey! That's my stuff!
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
scientific instruments and documents.
JANE
What the hell is going on here?!
The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
COULSON
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with
SHIELD.
Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.
JANE
I don't care who you work for, you
can't do this!
SELVIG
Jane. This is more serious than
you realize. Let it go.
JANE
Let it go?! This is my life!
COULSON
We're here investigating a security
threat. We need to appropriate
your equipment and all your
atmospheric data.
JANE
By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.
COULSON
This should more than compensate
you for your trouble.
She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
JANE
I can't just pick up replacements
from RadioShack! I made most of
that equipment myself!
COULSON
Then I'm sure you can do it again.
JANE
And I'm sure I can sue you for
violating my constitutional rights!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.
COULSON
We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
fully herself, fueled by outrage.
JANE
So are we! We're on the verge of
UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
extraordinary.
Jane holds up her notebook.
JANE (CONT'D)
Everything I know about this
phenomenon is in this lab and in
this book, and no one has the right
to take it from me.
Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
carrying. Jane is stunned.
COULSON
Thank you for your cooperation.
He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.
Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE
INTERNET."
SELVIG
I'll just be a minute.
He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
and sees something that intrigues her.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.
Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.
As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
closer, we see the glow comes from --
A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
complex.
Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
crater.
Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
center of it all -- Mjolnir.
Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.
JANE
That isn't a satellite crash. They
would have hauled the wreckage
away, not built a city around it.
Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.
THOR
You're going to need this.
JANE
Why?--
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
takes his jacket.
THOR
Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
will return what they stole from
you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
request.
THOR (CONT'D)
Deal?
JANE
No! Look what's down there! You
can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
and walk out!
THOR
No.
Jane looks relieved.
THOR (CONT'D)
I'm going to fly out.
Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.
JANE
Wait...
But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
above.
CUT TO:
73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:
A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
jeep to investigate.
Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
coming from the hammer containment area.
The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
flashlight, see nothing unusual.
AGENT JACKSON
(INTO RADIO)
Looks like we're good here. Must
have been another coyote.
Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.
AGENT DELANCEY
Jackson?
The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
shotgun at Thor.
Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.
Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
the base.
Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
radio.
SHIELD AGENT
Agents down! We've got a perimeter
breach!
As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.
A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
recorded message.
SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.
His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.
JANE
Erik, okay, first of all, don't
worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.
JANE (CONT'D)
But if you don't hear from me
again, you might want to come out
to the crater site and look for me.
I kind of did what you said I
shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
She hangs up.
Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
lit up site uneasily.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67.
A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
ground.
Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
entrance tube to the center of the site.
A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
right on him.
Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
the ATV's spotlight.
Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
the wheel to protect himself.
The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
the site entrance.
The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
the crater lip.
The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67A.
Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.
82 OMITTED 82
82A OMITTED 82A
Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.
As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
inside.
Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
Coulson activates his radio.
COULSON
I want eyes up high. With a gun.
Now!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67B.
Lightning CRACKLES around the camp.
Barton approaches a CRANE BUCKET. He leaps in, and the
bucket lifts into the air.
Through the translucent plastic, we see Thor racing through
the tubing.
Jane looks down at the crater through binoculars, frustrated
that she can't clearly see what's happening.
Coulson watches the commotion in the tunnel complex. He
heads off for the command trailer to enter the tunnels.
82J OMITTED 82J
The crane basket ascends into the high winds as Barton
readies his sniper rifle.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67C.
We see the figure of Thor inside the complex, heading down a
ladder from a junction box, with other figures converging on
him.
The crane holding Barton arcs out over the structure. Barton
takes aim.
BARTON
(INTO RADIO)
One shot, one kill, sir. Just give
the word.
BARTON'S NIGHTVISION POV
Overlooking the complex. It's a clear field of vision,
nowhere to hide. A digital read-out gives information on the
distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
heading towards the cube structure.
BARTON (CONT'D)
Hello, handsome.
Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the
junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68A.
Barton has Thor in his sites. The sniper stands still as a
statue.
Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube
containment structure.
JANE
No...
Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
his view.
Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
Thor's momentum carries him past.
Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
defeated.
Thor races back towards the structure.
Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
trigger.
Barton stands ready to take Thor down. His finger starts to
squeeze the trigger.
COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
...hold your fire.
Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69.
Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad
to worse.
She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A.
Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers
his head.
Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
do it?
He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.
As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
it from the pile and pockets it.
Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.
COULSON
Just keep him away from the bars.
SELVIG
I will!
THOR
(TO SELVIG)
Where are we going?
Selvig drops his cool demeanor.
SELVIG
To get a drink.
Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
GARRETT and CALE.
COULSON
Follow them.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76.
Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
surface of the planet.
Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
in time with the song.
THOR/SELVIG
(SINGING)
"The mood is good, our hearts are
full, there's magic in the air. /
It's all because we're here
tonight, and haven't got a care. /
So raise a glass, and toast to
life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
friend is fine indeed!"
Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.
Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
up, a couple chairs, some blankets.
JANE
I come up here sometimes when I
can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
reconcile particle data. Or when
Darcy's driving me crazy.
(THEN)
I come up here a lot, now that I
think about it.
Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.
JANE (CONT'D)
I'm glad you're safe.
THOR
You've been very kind. I've been
far less grateful than you deserve.
JANE
I also hit you with my car a couple
times, so it kind of evens out.
He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her
NOTEBOOK.
JANE (CONT'D)
I don't believe it...
She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.
THOR
It was all I could get back. Not
as much as I promised. I'm sorry.
JANE
No, this is good. Thank you. This
means I don't have to start from
scratch...
She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.
THOR
What's wrong?
JANE
SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
never going to let this research
see the light of day.
THOR
You must do this. You must finish
what you've started.
JANE
Why?
THOR
Because you're right. It's taken
so many generations for your people
to get to this point. You're
nearly there. You just need
someone to show you how close you
really are.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
point to another in space.
THOR (CONT'D)
Look -- your ancestors called it
magic. You call it science. I
come from a place where they're one
and the same thing.
We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.
JANE
What is it?
THOR
This is how my father explained it
to me...
(THEN)
Your world is one of the Nine
Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
each other by the branches of
Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
you see it every day, without
realizing. Images glimpsed through
-- what did you call it?...
(checks her notebook)
...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
Realms...
They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
going to be a long night.
Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
stares up at the night sky.
She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
the town beyond her.
Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.
Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.
Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:
SELVIG
I need some coffee.
The three head inside Smith Motors.
FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
small audio surveillance device towards the lab.
On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
turns to Cale.
AGENT GARRETT
They want an update.
AGENT CALE
Tell them he's eating eggs.
AGENT GARRETT
Scrambled or fried?
Cale glares at him.
AGENT CALE
(INTO COMM-LINK)
Target is eating eggs, sir.
We'll keep you posted.
In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
(Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.
THOR
To replace the one I broke. Please
forgive my behavior.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.
ISABEL
Okay. Thank you.
THOR
If I may, I'd like to come back for
more of your "coffee."
ISABEL
Any time.
He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
shrugs.
ISABEL (CONT'D)
She could do worse.
Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
cover the desert sand around them.
VOLSTAGG
He must have landed nearby. It's
time to put our tracking skills to
work. Spread out. Check the sand
for indentations of his boot
prints.
FANDRAL
The winds would have blown them
away by now. We should look for
signs of a campfire.
SIF
Or we could just start there.
She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.
FANDRAL
It's worth a look, I suppose.
The party tromps towards the town.
Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.
A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side
of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth
dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car
up with one hand.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He
hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.
VOLSTAGG
There you go, lad!
The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head
off.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Is it just me, or does Earth look a
little different to you?
SIF
It has been a thousand years...
VOLSTAGG
Things change so fast here. You
leave for a millennium, and it's
like the whole neighborhood's gone.
Volstagg sniffs, smells something.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Perhaps we should split up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89.
Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
down the street.
AGENT GARRETT
Is there a Renaissance Faire in
town?
AGENT CALE
Call it in.
But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
their heads together. They're out.
VOLSTAGG
Never cared for spies.
He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
bite. He likes what he tastes.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Exquisite.
Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.
EINHERJAR GUARD
My liege, the Warriors Three and
the Lady Sif have gone missing.
Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.
Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.
HEIMDALL
Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
Jotuns into Asgard?
LOKI
You think the Bifrost is the only
way in and out of the Realm? There
are secret paths between worlds to
which even you with all your gifts
are blind. But I have need of them
no longer, now that I am King.
(THEN)
And I say, for your act of treason,
you are relieved of your duties as
Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
a citizen of Asgard.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90.
HEIMDALL
Then I need no longer obey you.
Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --
THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
relief and steps past him.
A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
Agent.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92.
COULSON
Get somebody from Linguistics out
here.
Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
storm ROARS in the sky above.
Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
desert floor.
Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.
120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120
From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
moves towards them.
SHIELD AGENT
(RE: DESTROYER)
Is that one of Stark's?
COULSON
I don't think so. But the guy
doesn't tell me anything.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93.
Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
Destroyer.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Hello! You're using unregistered
weapons technology. Please
identify yourself.
We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
inside.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Incoming!
As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
fire.
Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
Thor turns to Jane.
THOR
Leave this town now. Get yourself
and your friends to safety.
JANE
What about you?
THOR
I must stay and fight.
The Asgardians look to Thor.
THOR (CONT'D)
I'm still a warrior, and I will
fight by your side.
VOLSTAGG
You're but a mortal now. You'll
get yourself killed!
FANDRAL
Or one of us, trying to protect
you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94.
SIF
The best thing you can do is get
the mortals to safety and leave the
battle to us.
Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
oncoming threat.
THOR
(TO SIF)
You're right.
Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
THOR (CONT'D)
Help me clear the streets. I'll
let none of these people die this
day.
Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head
across town, towards the Destroyer.
124 OMITTED 124
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 95.
The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The
smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about.
Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused
TOWNSFOLK into cars, moving others indoors.
A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
front of it. Then we see it --
THE DESTROYER
Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
within it.
It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
storefronts aflame.
128 OMITTED 128
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96.
Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the
Destroyer.
SIF
Keep him distracted.
She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the
behemoth.
FANDRAL
What do you think? "The
Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the
Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?"
Volstagg grins eagerly.
VOLSTAGG
"The Flying Mountain."
Hogun and Fandral groan.
FANDRAL
Not "The Flying Mountain!" It
threw out my back for a year last
time!
VOLSTAGG
Trust me, it'll work.
Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors
Three get into position before the Destroyer.
THOR
(TO JANE)
My friends fight bravely, but they
won't be able to hold it back much
longer.
Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.
DOWN THE STREET
Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as
Volstagg stands limbering up.
FANDRAL
(TO VOLSTAGG)
Come on!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.
VOLSTAGG
For Asgaaaaard!!!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
apologetically.
The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
smashing into them, when --
SIF
Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
brief moment of hope.
But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
degrees to face its attackers.
The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
free, landing in the middle of the street.
Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
impaled by a twisted piece of iron.
JANE
Erik!
She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
into shock.
SELVIG
(TO JANE)
Go! Leave me!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
pouch and races back.
He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.
THOR
Come on... give me one!
Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
the end of the iron rod.
JANE
What are you doing? What is that?
As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
completely.
Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
flesh.
SELVIG
(to Jane, re: Thor)
I'm really starting to like him.
Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.
THOR
Go, while you can!
SIF
But the others...
THOR
You can't help them now. Your job
is to survive.
She struggles to sit up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.
SIF
No! I will die a warrior's death.
Stories will be told of this day--
He gently takes her shield from her.
THOR
Live and tell those stories
yourself.
At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
towards them.
Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
and Fandral.
THOR (CONT'D)
(RE: VOLSTAGG)
Get him out of here!
FANDRAL
No. We can still fight!
THOR
But not win. Move Volstagg, or
he'll die!
Thor looks at them, grins.
THOR (CONT'D)
Don't worry, my friends. I have a
plan.
The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
drag him away from the battlefield.
After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
tosses Sif's shield aside.
He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
defenseless.
THOR (CONT'D)
Brother... for whatever I have done
to wrong you, whatever I have done
to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
But these people have done nothing
to you. They are innocents.
He continues towards the Destroyer.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.
THOR (CONT'D)
Take my life, and know I will never
return to Asgard.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.
SELVIG
Jane, no!
He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
watching the scene --
Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
unleash its fiery blast.
Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
Clouds form in the sky above.
Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
straight up into the air like a rocket.
The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --
KRAKAKABOOM!
A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --
JANE
Oh. My. God.
THE MIGHTY THOR
Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
down onto the ground.
KRAKABOOM!
Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
force winds.
Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
Destroyer.
Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
within him, firing out of all his openings.
Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.
COULSON
Donald... I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.
Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
Darcy turns to Volstagg.
DARCY
So, how can you speak our language?
VOLSTAGG
Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
you're speaking ours.
Thor calls up to the sky.
THOR
Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!
Heimdall stands frozen.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.
Thor looks to the others with concern.
THOR
He would open it if he could. I
fear the worst.
VOLSTAGG
Then we're trapped here forever.
FANDRAL
Then I suppose we'd best start
settling into our new lives.
He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Are all earth maidens as fair as
you?
Darcy enjoys the attention.
DARCY
No.
Thor shouts back up to the sky.
THOR
Heimdall!
From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
Observatory.
The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
Agent's machine gun.
VOLSTAGG
Primitive. Good enough for hunting
small game, I suppose.
Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.
FANDRAL
Sorry, my love. These things
happen.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
Coulson.
THOR
Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
we fight for the same cause -- the
protection of this world. From
this day forward, count me as your
ally.
(THEN)
If you return the items you have
stolen from Jane Foster.
COULSON
Not stolen. Borrowed.
Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.
COULSON (CONT'D)
You'll get your equipment back.
You're going to need it to continue
your research... which, after
today's events, SHIELD would like
to fully sponsor. If that's all
right with you.
Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
again.
THOR
Whatever fate lies before me, you
are part of it.
He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.
Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
palace.
Thor races through the entrance to the palace.
Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
pools below.
Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.
Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.
THOR
Jotunheim...
Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.
It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
ice.
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
it.
SELVIG
Jane?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A.
JANE
Something's wrong.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109.
Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.
LOKI
Thor! Help me!
Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
up at him desperately.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Please...
Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
him across the bridge.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.
LOKIS
I was always more clever than you.
THOR
Yet still not clever enough.
With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
Lokis.
All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
knocked from his grasp.
Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
away.
Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
pinned to the ground.
Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
do.
Loki watches him smugly.
LOKI
Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
With all your strength, what good
does it do you now?
Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
channels the power of the storm into it, then --
He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Stop! What are you doing?!
Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
out from it. Loki thinks fast.
LOKI (CONT'D)
If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
never see her again!
Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
through the back.
THOR
Forgive me.
Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
out of it.
Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
from the broken Bridge.
They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
by the debris, when --
A POWERFUL HAND
Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to
SEE --
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.
ODIN ALLFATHER
Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
disappointment and regret.
Loki lets go.
THOR (CONT'D)
No!
But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
into his father's arms.
ODIN
It is over.
159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
in all directions.
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
significance of what's just happened.
JANE
It's gone.
Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
walks up behind him.
ODIN
You'll be a wise King.
THOR
There will never be a wiser king
than you. Or a better father.
(THEN)
I have much to learn. I know that
now. But some day, perhaps, I will
make you proud.
ODIN
You've already made me proud.
Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.
Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
energy, drifting off into space.
Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
Thor stares out at the stellar void.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.
THOR
Can you see her?
Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.
HEIMDALL
Yes.
THOR
How is she?
Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
facility, abuzz with activity.
SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
the-art equipment.
Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.
DARCY
Here you go.
JANE
Thanks.
Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
DARCY
He would have come back if he
could.
JANE
I know. But if he can't get here
on his own...
Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.
"
JANE (CONT'D)
...maybe we can help him find his
way back.
