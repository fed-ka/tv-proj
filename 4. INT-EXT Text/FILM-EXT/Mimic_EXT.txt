MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.
A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.
Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
the cars on crosstown detours.
Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
in a military phalanx.
A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.
Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.
The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.
Her mask is
off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.
An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.
PETER (OS)
How we doing?
She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.
A
HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.
He has the look of a man who's
just fought a long battle and come out victorious.
SUSAN
We'll see...
He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.
Susan smiles,
shakes her head.
She wearily leans against him.
Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.
THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.
A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.
ANCHORMAN (VO)
Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan
like a thief in the night, claiming its
first hundred victims before it was even
classified.
The runner exits the News Van.
Other such vehicles parked
nearby.
A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of
PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.
Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...
REPORTER 1

immune to chemical control...
REPORTER 2

Department that an end to the nightmare

MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...
The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.
ALPHABET CITY STREETS
Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
layer of rain.
SUPERIMPOSE:
TWO YEARS LATER
A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.
CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.
WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
with terror.
He looks back down the steps.
Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
shadows on the wall.
Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.
The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.
Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
something inhuman, determined to break through.
The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.
On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
grow.
Needles of rain stab his flesh.
He searches wildly for a possible escape.
He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
sidewalk.
Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
surrounding concrete.
WHAM!
The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
SMASHES against it again and again.
Frenzied SCRATCHING.
The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
adjoining building...
THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV
Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
tarp.
A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
being painted over.
THE CHINESE PREACHER
Looks back to the door.
BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
gives.
He CRIES OUT in terror.
The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
it?
He takes a few steps back, a few more...
Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
and rain.
THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.
Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
onto the curtain of rain.
Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
to the catwalk.
It's too far.
He FALLS...CRASH!
he hits the platform, knocking boards
loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.
He
bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
loose board to save himself from falling.
The RAIN blasts down.
The scaffold CREAKS.
He hits the
edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.
He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.
BELOW
Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.
CU HANDS
The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.
FEET
The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
find a purchase on the wet brick wall-
THE CHINESE PREACHER
is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
model.
He looks up above him, sees something-
CHINESE PREACHER
No.
Please, God, no!
A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
on one end.
HANDS
The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
wet wood.
His hands paw the air.
WIDER
For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.
THE GROUND
Impact. His body cracks the pavement.
Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.
We CRANE to reveal
A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.
He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.
APARTMENT
It's a small one-bedroom apartment.
An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
benign face.
All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.
A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
standing by the window is
CHUY
HIS P.O.V.
We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
figure in a swirl of color.
Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.
CHUY
CHUY
(a whisper)
Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...
He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
wire into shape.
THE PUDDLE OF PAINT
around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
and across the neon sign...
CHUY
hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.
His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
his eyes.
ACROSS THE ROOFTOP
We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
attention.
TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...
The strange clicking sound grows louder.
The figure begins
moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
forward and drops out of frame.
CHUY
His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
arc.
Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
a better view.
GROUND LEVEL
The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.
CHUY
We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
noise FADES AWAY.
Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.
He begins to click them together.
Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.
THE CHINESE PREACHER
is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
this hole.
CHUY
watches, still clicking with his spoons.
THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY
is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.
There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
like a rag doll.
CHUY
His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
terrible cracking and scraping sounds.
THE WINDOW
The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
the opening.
CHUY
watches, still fascinated.
CHUY
(very low)
Funny, funny shoes...
He starts a new wire sculpture.
CUT TO:
Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the
windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.
Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his
steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his
stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.
PETER
Excuse me, ladies...
Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past
them.
Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a
water fountain.
As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the
sidewalk.
The derelict spots Peter.
He picks up his chalk, drifts off.
Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
to a manhole cover set among the bushes.
Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.
Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.
GRAFFITI
A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged
lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is
little more than a malignant blotch.
CUT TO:
A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic
jam.
The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse
where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.
COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH
badge.
JOSH
Health Department...
The cops let them pass.
PETER
You really love flashing that thing,
don't you?
JOSH
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.
PETER
Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were
the first on the scene?
WOYCHEK
(gestures to Rice)
We were both on patrol, saw this paint
mess. Then I looked through that cellar
window. We both did...
PETER
You gone in?
WOYCHEK
No. We waited.
PETER
Good.
Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.
Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE
FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.
PETER
(to Josh)
Get the EMT's in there, now.
CUT TO:
LATER
PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.
Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to
Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of
shoes.
Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.
MANNY
C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.
(discreetly crossing himself)
Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.
He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.
JOSH
uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy
stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.
CRANE TO a nearby alley.
A GAUNT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands in the shadows, looking up
at Siri working on the window.
As a streetlamp lights up, he backs up into the shadows.
CUT TO:
The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.
Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.
The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war
building. Josh and Peter climb out.
Peter is reviewing a roster.
PETER
Josh, what was Immigration's
countdown?
Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes
and running shoes.
JOSH
Thirty-three workers.
Peter hands him the roster.
PETER
There are thirty five listed in the
reverend Wong's roster...
JOSH
Shit.
Peter walks up the front steps.
PETER
Remember what that woman said, about
people being taken? Check with the
copsin the area.
A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.
Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
wiper.
A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.
SUSAN
Metaxonycha Godmani.
PETER
So?
Susan looks around.
Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by
a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
performance artists.
An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.
Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small
urban wilderness.
Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them
from the weeds.
RICKY (OS)
If you want your money back, forget it!
Peter and Susan look up.
The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE
CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.
DAVIS (OS)
We already spent it!
Susan walks forward.
SUSAN
We're here to deal.
Long beat.
The door to the clubhouse swings open.
CUT TO:
An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant
hospital.
Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire
escape with his spoons in hand.
The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.
OVERHEAD VIEW
The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.
The CLICKING sound comes again.
STREET LEVEL
The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.
It
continues a little bit, then stops.
Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.
Beat.
A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.
Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front
of the building.
He comes to the boarded entrance.
There is a hole, narrow,
and low in the doorway.
Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.
Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.
A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
hooks.
Shoes, tires, rags...
A GRINDING SOUND is heard.
The Workman YELLS out to a
CONTROL BOOTH above.
WORKMAN
Hold up!
We gotta block on filter D.
SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.
The Workman walks to the filter area.
He sinks his grappling
hook into the polluted waters.
UNDERWATER SHOT
Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
filter...
...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...
...and connects with a LARGER FORM.
ABOVE WATER
The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.
He gives a
YANK, hooking whatever it is.
He begins pulling it up.
A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.
The Workman's face goes pale.
WORKMAN
Oh, God...
A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.
CONTROL BOOTH
VOICE
What's the problem?
It take the Workman a moment to speak.
WORKMAN
I think it's a baby!
The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
toward the edge of the tank.
He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.
The Workman SCREAMS.
His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.
CUT TO:
Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway
station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.
A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS
AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-
deserted, a bit creepy.
She takes a deep breath, descends.
It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned
flophouse.
He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,
on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger
shoeprints...
...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.
MANNY
Chuy...
He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too
strong.
ALLEY
Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for
a way in.
A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.
Something moves in the shadows!
Something long and thin,
haloed
by the rain.
It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.
It's The Overcoat Man!
The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.
ALLEYS
Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.
There is the OVERCOAT MAN.
CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,
unloading produce.
The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head
down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and
hopping, he skitters into an alley.
FOLLOWING
Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He
pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.
Once it takes effect he moves on.
The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??
It's too high!!!
The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal
fabric cuts his shirt.
On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except
for...
A SEWAGE GRATE
Manny lifts it.
SEWAGE PIPE
Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He
flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.
This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.
Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-
legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.
Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.
MANNY
Chuy...
Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around
his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...
...then begins to move down the pipe.
CUT TO:
PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY
Susan examines the Polaroids.
She pulls out a payday bar.
The crew of repairmen are leaving.
REPAIRMAN
Hey, Lady, all power will be down in
five minutes, okay?
SUSAN
Okay....
She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught
her attention.
The fridge light illuminated this photograph.
Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find
something different in the lines.
A train roars by.
Then she notices it:
THE POLAROID
The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.
SUSAN
Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.
A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and
out.
Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!
He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
lights.
Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.
Life as usual on Delancey street.
Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
umbrellas.
Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front
stores, boom boxes, car horns...
They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...
SUSAN
hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a
metallic CLANG!
CLANG!
CLANG!
SIDE TUNNEL
CLANG!
The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS
the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.
SUSAN
looks around frantically.
She crosses to a METAL LID on the
floor, lifts it.
A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.
The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.
Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
metal lid by handles on its underside.
The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...
Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...
WHANG!
The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
second before the creature reaches it.
The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.
