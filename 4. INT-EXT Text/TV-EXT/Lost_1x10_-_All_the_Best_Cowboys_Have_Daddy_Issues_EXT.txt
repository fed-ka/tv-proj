      JACK runs down the PATH -- LOCKE at his side.

      We re MOVING with then, CLOSE on the two men as this growing 
      sense of dread FUELS THEIR SPRINT --

      -- AND OTHER THAN THE HARDCORE SOUND OF THEIR BREATH, all we  *
      get is the SOUNDS OF THE JUNGLE - birds - trees - the wind -

      And LOCKE abruptly STOPS.  His head turns to the right as 
      those preternatural EYES focus on something --

                                  LOCKE
                    Jack.

      And JACK, already ahead, comes to a STOP.  Turns towards us --  *
      EYES QUESTIONING what Locke is looking at...

      But Locke is already striding through the FOLIAGE.  Whatever 
      it is, now Jack sees it too...

      TWENTY YARDS AWAY

      And as the two men approach us, CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to reveal --

    A BAG.*

      Just sitting here, surrounded by lush, green JUNGLE.  Oddly 
      out of place.  Locke squats down in front of it -- as Jack  *
      makes an awful realization -*

                                  JACK*
                    She was moving to the beach. *

      Locke turns to shoot Jack a quizzical look:*

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                          (indicating the bag)*
                    Claire.  It s hers.*

      Locke nods, turns back to the bag.  Jack is overwhelmed with  *
      guilt -- trying to make sense of this... and NOT --*

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    What -- what happened?  Where --?

                                  LOCKE
                    I don t know.

      And we re ON LOCKE NOW, an EERIE CALM coming over him as he 
      examines the GROUND around the bag --*

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                      Footprints - at least three *
                    discrete sets - they re all over *
                    the place - looks like there might *
                    have been a struggle -*

      But Locke has found something REALLY INTERESTING NOW on the 
      periphery of the clearing.  BENT and BROKEN GRASS.  He moves 
      to it suddenly --

                                  JACK*
                    What?  What is it?

                                  LOCKE
                    Drag marks.  Here... and here. *

                                  JACK*
                    Charlie -- he came after her.  They *
                    were together...*

      Locke explains what both of them are thinking, and said so  *
      simply it s all the more TERRIFYING --

                                  LOCKE*
                    I think they ve been taken.

      ON JACK, Locke s words freaking him out because he KNOWS 
      THEY RE TRUE -- Looking around the DARK, DENSE JUNGLE.  They 
      could have gone anywhere -- FRANTIC -- SHOUTS --

                                  JACK
                    CLAIRE!  CHARLIE!
                          (then; in another 
                            direction)

                                  LOCKE
                    Jack.

      Jack s head whips around, back on Locke -- And if Jack is 
      dialed up to TEN, Locke is sitting comfortably at ONE --

      And as we PUSH IN, he carefully brings a raised finger to his 
      lips --

                                        ACT ONE


      ECU on Locke s hand - picking up a twig - WIDER as Locke  *
      examines a break in the wood --*

      -- Jack steps up behind him, the two men exchange glances.   *
      Locke motions for Jack to follow him - the two move down the  *
      path - checking behind and around, suspicious that someone  *
    may be watching them -*

    - Locke finally breaks the silence as he examines a footprint  *
      on the soft earth - but their voices stay quiet, furtive -  *
      full of amped-up intensity --*

                                  LOCKE*
                    The tracks are still fresh.*

                                  JACK*
                    It doesn t make any sense -- How *
                    could one man drag two people -- *
                    one of them pregnant...?*

                                  LOCKE
                    You re asking the wrong question.  *
                    Not how...*
                          (turns to him)
                    Why?*

      Jack absorbs this.  And as there is no answer --

                                  JACK
                    You think it was Ethan?

                                  LOCKE*
                    It certainly feels like it was *
                    Ethan.*

      ON JACK.  Yeah.  It does - but the questions still outnumber  *
      the answers -- This is fucking IMPOSSIBLE -- FRUSTRATED -- *

                                  JACK*
                    By himself?  How --?*

                                  LOCKE
                    We can t account for all of our *
                    people --
                          (beat; then)
                    And more importantly, who s to say 
                    they re even our people?

      This effectively freezes Jack.  What the fuck is he...?

                    Sayid said there were others.

                          (no...)
                    He said  we are not alone. 

    A beat, then --

                                  LOCKE
                      Semantics.

                                  JACK
                          (refusing to believe this)
                    Sayid s injured -- we don t know 
                    where he went -- he s delerious...

                                  LOCKE
                    I m only telling you what the 
                    ground is telling me.

                                  JACK
                            (frustration mounting)
                    So which way is the ground saying 
                    they went?

      Locke looks at Jack, his tone cautious, measured:

                      LOCKEJACK
      Jack -- we don t know what s 
      going on here.
                                                  -- We know enough.

                                  LOCKE
                    We need to prepare -- we can be 
                    back at the caves in ten minutes -- 
                    organize a search party, get 
                    weapons --

                                  JACK
                    Which way did they go, Locke?

      Locke stares at Jack - practically vibrating with impatience.  
      After a moment, Locke simply points into the woods -

    - and Jack just takes off in that direction -

      AND OFF LOCKE, his expression betraying nothing in spite of 
      having no intention whatsoever of following...





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      7.




      Jack runs - knocking tree branches aside - propelling himself 
      as fast as his legs can carry him - and as he does -

                                  JACK S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                    Let s get a clamp on that artery so 
                    I can ligate above the tear -


      Jack PUSHES HIS WAY THROUGH GIANT JUNGLE LEAVES, continuing 
      to run - and the silence of the previous scene is overtaken 
      by the dull ROAR of the jungle - the look on his face 
      identical to that seen in the operating room -

    - and then a SOUND - and it is the kind of sound that could 
      be anything.  The WIND, the RUSTLE of trees, the HOWL of an 
      animal - but to Jack - it is a sign to push even harder -



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "All the Best..."   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/12/04   10.
      (CONT'D)66


    - and as Jack picks up the pace, growing smaller and smaller 
      as the jungle grows larger and larger around him -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Michael and WALT walk toward the entrance in mid-argument --

                                  WALT
                    I could take Vincent, you know, he 
                    could sniff something that belonged 
                    to Charlie and - I can help.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I said no, man.

      Michael reaches Locke as he stuffs ANOTHER knife into his 
      VEST, falls into step with him as he moves out -- Kate and 
      Boone lagging behind --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      12.

                                  MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    A lot of us don t want to just sit 
                    here waiting for news.  We re 
                    willing to go out and look too.

      Locke barely stops to look at Michael -

                                  LOCKE
                    Thanks, but we re set.  Anyone else 
                    is just going to slow us down.

                                  MICHAEL
                    Yeah -- Okay -- so maybe I can put 
                    together another party...

                                  LOCKE
                    Good idea.  We re going north.  I 
                    suggest you go south.

      And with that, Locke STRIDES OFF, leaving Michael alone.

      And as Michael looks at Walt, aware that he has just gotten 
      the same kind of dismissal he was giving his son...


      ECU on Jack s hand, reaching for a twig, then WIDER as he 
      brings it up to his face, trying to read it, only to crush 
      and throw it to the ground, frustrated.

      Out of breath, Jack continues to walk, looking down - trying 
      to find ANY SIGN that will tell him where to go -- the sad *
      truth, however, is that Jack is lost and alone -- *

      -- but that doesn t mean he is beaten or resigned.  Jack  *
      looks up at the sky, then, after a beat - he turns back to  *
      the ground, redoubling his effort to find Ethan s trail -- *

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      ON KATE, happy to see him.  And despite the circumstances,  *
      he s happy to see her, too.

                                  KATE
                    You find anything?

                    No.

      Locke approaches, compassionate.  Sincere --

                                  LOCKE
                    You should get back to the caves.  
                    Sayid s leg...

    - but Jack shrugs him off, even as Locke continues to try to 
      be a voice of reason.

                                  JACK
                    I dressed Sayid s leg.  You found 
                    me -- Then we can find Charlie and 
                    Claire.  So do we have a trail to 
                    follow or not?

                                  LOCKE
                    Jack --

                    This is my fault.

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  LOCKE
                    I ve been hunting with Ethan.  
                    Spent time with him.  Never sensed 
                      anything...
                          (beat)
                    Off.

                    For everything I know -- about 
                    hunting?  Tracking?  Whoever he 
                    is... he knows more.  If we catch 
                    up to him -- I don t want anything 
                    to happen to the only trained 
                    physician on the island.
                          (beat)
                    Go back and be the doctor - let me 
                    be the hunter.

      No malice or threat in any of what Locke said.  Just genuine 
      concern.  Jack just looks at him.  And after a beat --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "All the Best..."   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/12/04   16.

                                  JACK
                    Can we go now?

      Beat.  Locke shakes his head.  If that s the way it s going 
      to be --

                                  LOCKE
                    Follow me.

      And as Locke turns to go, Jack does indeed follow.  
      Exchanging a look with Kate.  And then... BOONE --

                                  BOONE
                    Jack.

    - and although innocuous enough, given their past history, it 
      is clear that Boone s greeting is intended to give Jack the 
      sense that Boone is finally playing with the big dogs.

      Off Jack, offering Boone a cursory nod...

                    We keep our progress marked by line 
                    of sight -- we tie these off so we 
                    don t get lost.

                                  BOONE
                    But you can lead us back to camp, 
                    right?

                                  LOCKE
                    Unless something happens to me.

      Boone doesn t like the sound of that -- but he s not gonna 
      SHOW IT.  Puts out his hand.

                                  BOONE
                    Then maybe I better take marker 
                    detail.

      Locke smiles, appreciatively.  Hands over the shirt.

      FIND JACK & KATE, the former anxiously coming back towards

      Locke takes out a bottle of water.  Takes a SWIG.

                    should rest for a minute.  Get our

      Locke offers the water bottle to Jack --

      Jack can t fucking believe this.  Boone looks on, somewhat 
      intrigued by what s happening here as KATE moves up to Jack--

                    What s going on?

      Kate just looks at him.  Feeling his pain.  Not knowing what 
      to say to make it go away.  And that s when --

                                  BOONE (O.S.)
                    JACK!  KATE!

      And as Jack and Kate turn to the sound of Boone s VOICE --

                                                                          UPCUT TO:


      Kate and Jack rush up to join Boone, standing over a 
      CROUCHING LOCKE.  All their interest focused on what s in 
      Locke s hand -- He holds it up and opens his palm slowly:

                                  KATE
                    What is it?

      And now we re CLOSE ON IT --

    - a piece of gauze bandage with the letter  L  written on it 
      with magic marker.

      And just as we re beginning to connect to what it might be, 
      let s instantly SHARE with those not as familiar with the 
      show as we are --

      CHARLIE - as seen at the end of  Tabula Rasa  - sitting by 
      the fire on the beach, using a Sharpie to write the word 
       LATE  on the gauze bandages wrapped around his knuckles.

      After lingering on Charlie s knuckles for a moment -

      Locke examines the gauze - turns around and looks to Jack, 
      his eyes TWINKLING, maybe he d be smiling if the

      Boone steps up, confused --

                                  BOONE
                    What?  You think it just... came

      OPEN ON an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the  A  scribbled on a piece 
      of gauze from Charlie s knuckle.  And we RACK FOCUS to find 
      it in the hand of --

      JACK.  Crouching at the base of a BANYAN TREE in a beautiful 
      JUNGLE CLEARING.  Beyond the tree, a narrow SWATCH of path 
      cuts through the DENSE JUNGLE.

                                  JACK
                    They went this way.

      WIDEN to reveal Kate and Boone, a few yards behind Jack.  All 
      of them COVERED IN SWEAT -- BREATHING HARD --

      But LOCKE is actually ACROSS THE CLEARING.  RUNS his fingers 
      along the slightly BENT BRANCHES OF A FERN --

                                  LOCKE
                    I m not so sure.
                          (turns to the others)
                    There s another trail here.

      Jack stands, crosses to Locke --

                                  JACK
                    What do you mean, another --?

                    These are footprints.  People moved *
                    off this way.

      Jack holds up the  A.   Feels he s getting close -- 
      FRUSTRATION MOUNTING --

                                  JACK
                    Charlie is leaving us these to

                            Banyan)
                    They re heading that way.

      Locke just looks at him.  Then --

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    What if Charlie isn t the one 
                    leaving them?

      Both men turn towards Kate --

                    If Ethan knows we re behind him, he 
                    might be setting up a dummy trail.  
                    Take off one way, then double-back 
                    in his own footprints.

      And the SURPRISE registers on Jack s face as what he s 
      thinking is verbalized by --

                                  BOONE
                    Wait -- Now you re a tracker?

      Kate says nothing, playing a LOOK with Jack as Locke turns to 
      her, AMUSED --

                                  LOCKE
                    You re just full of surprises.

      Locke doesn t know the half of it.  Jack shakes off his 
      surprise, simply doesn t have the time because it s pretty 
      fucking clear what they ve gotta do --

                                  JACK
                    If there are two trails, we split 
                    up.  I m taking this one --

                                  LOCKE
                          (shakes his head)
                    We should stay together, Jack...

                                  JACK
                    Why?  We have two trails...
                          (pointed; to Kate)
                    And apparently two trackers.

    A moment.

      Locke considers this.  And since Jack isn t really asking for 
      permission, he doesn t have much of a choice.  Finally --

                                  LOCKE
                    Be careful.

      And as the four exchange a series of LOOKS, the safety of 
      their number about to be HALVED --*


      Locke kneels - studying the ground cover when ZIP! - RACK

                      Supervisor for a box company.

                                  BOONE
                          (what?)
                    A box company?

                                  LOCKE
                    They made boxes.

      Boone stops, perplexed.  A beat.  Locke turns to him.  Offers 
      that smile.  And Boone LAUGHS --

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah, right.

      Locke raises his eyebrows -- yeah, let Boone think he was 
      kidding.  But as he turns back to his work...

      The smile falls away.


    A large leaf covering the view gives way as Jack SMASHES it 
      away, pushing through the path with great speed.

                                  KATE
                    Would you please slow down?  Jack?

      Jack stops as Kate catches up.

                                  JACK
                    You said they went this way...

                                  KATE
                    I think they went this way.  I m 
                    not as good at this as Locke...

                                  JACK
                    So when d you pick up the tracking 
                    skills, Kate?  Before or after you 
                    were on the run?

      And with that, KATE abruptly STOPS.

      After a few beats, Jack realizes she s not behind him.  Turns 
      back to her.  And we can see that she s HURT --

                                  KATE
                    I m trying to help, Jack.

                                  JACK
                    You know what might help?  A little 
                    honesty.  Just give me something 
                    real.  Anything.

      Kate just looks at him.  Then, after a moment --

                                  KATE
                    My dad was in the Army.  Ranger 
                      Battalion.  We were stationed at 
                    Fort Lewis.  Washington State.  We *
                    would go hiking together.  One day *
                    we spent eight hours tracking 
                    deer... being in the woods, that 
                    was his religion.*

      And there s something else here.  Something DEEPER.  But --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    That was real.

      That s all she s gonna give him now.  So she just stands  *
      there, watching him.  Then, after a moment -*

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    Anything you wanna share, Jack? *

      Jack looks at Kate - what does she mean?  About his father?   *
      About his driven need to find Claire?  About anything  *
      personal?*

      No - this is his turn to be mysterious.*

                                  JACK*
                    No.*

      And with that, Kate is on the move again.  Striding past  *

      in the memories brought on by this conversation --*

      Boone is actually a little ASHAMED for some reason.  Then --

      Boone ponders this.  Maybe for the first time.

                    Guess it doesn t matter, does it?

                      Temporarily.*

      With that, Locke stops moving.  Smiles.  Boone stops too.   *
      What is it?  Then Locke looks SKYWARD.*

      Locke turns to Boone.  A look of CONCERN on his face --

                    You should turn around, Boone.

                    I can take care of myself.

                        LOCKEBOONE

                                                  -- I m not heading back.

      Locke sizes up Boone.  A beat.  Then, he nods.

                                  LOCKE
                    All right, then.

      And it happens in an instant --

      DOWNPOUR.  RAIN.  LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF RAIN.  Both Boone 
      and Locke soaked to the skin within SECONDS.  Boone shouts 
      over the STORM --

                                  BOONE
                    THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO PREDICT THE 
                    WEATHER AT THE BOX COMPANY?


      The end-of-the-world weather grows even more severe as Jack 
      and Kate rush to the foot of a hill covered in long grass... 
      and at the foot of the hill, wedged between two rocks -

    - is the  T  from Charlie s hand.

      Jack and Kate exchange looks -

                                  JACK
                          (grimly)
                    I guess we were right.
                          (then)
                    Where to now?

    - but before Kate can answer, the two hear that SOUND again - 
      the one that Jack heard as he first ventured into the jungle - 
      something between a rustle of trees and a howl -

    - something that distinctly conveys a presence -




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      37.
      (CONT'D)2525


    - only now the sound is followed by something very close to a 
      SCREAM from the top of the hill! 

      Or was it a scream?  The trees?  The wind?

      Jack doesn t care.  He looks at Kate - and as he stands there  *
      in the rain, girding himself for what he knows he must do -- *


    - Jack - having just heard the SCREAM from the top of the  *
      hill, ready to do what he has to do, he springs into action -  *
      powering himself up the muddy slope! *

      Kate follows - the hill grows steeper and steeper, Jack drops 
      to a crawling position - clinging on to the grass as Kate 
      comes up behind him -

      They turn and scramble across the side of the incline.   *
      Grabbing hold of anything to keep them vertical.

                                  KATE
                    This is -- can t be right -- how 
                    could they have gone this way?!

                                  JACK
                    Just follow me, keep moving!

      Jack presses on into the driving rain.

      And in the rain and buffeting wind, another sound seems to 
      come and go everywhere around them - strange WHISPERS (like 
      those heard by Sayid in  Solitary ...)

      That s when the sodden slope under his feet gives way.  Jack 
      falls.  Grabs for something, anything.  No luck.  Gravity 
      takes over.  He begins to tumble down the slope.

      Now that he s got his momentum going, there s no way he s 
      going to stop himself.  He s a one man tumbling human 
      avalanche, nearly free-falling through the rain down the 
      steep slope.

                    Jack!!

      BACK TO JACK

      Slipping, sliding, tumbling, he finally rolls to a stop in a 
      tangle of jungle at the bottom of the slope --


      Jack reaches for his aching head -- DISORIENTED -- DIZZY -- 
      RAIN pouring down on him --

      And this is something he SENSES before he actually looks up 
      and sees it.  And we SENSE it too --

      There is someone here.

      And as Jack slowly looks up -- standing right in front of him 
      -- just FIVE FUCKING FEET AWAY --

      Is ETHAN.

                                  ETHAN
                    Hello, Jack.

      Holy.  Fucking.  Shit.*

      Jack looks at him, ragged breath, but EYES BURNING.  And he 
      asks the question that hopefully all of America has been 
      asking for the past week --

                                  JACK
                    Who are you?

      And we re LOOKING UP at Ethan.  SOAKING WET but seemingly 
      oblivious to the rain.  And his EYES.  His FUCKING EYES.

                                  ETHAN
                    Stop.  Following.  Me.*

                                  JACK
                    Where are they?  What did you do 
                    with them?  What --*

      Ethan cuts Jack off by STOMPING down on Jack s CHEST with his *
      foot, pressing him down into the MUDDY GROUND...  Jack  *
      winces, and Ethan makes sure Jack is good and uncomfortable  *
      before reiterating his warning.*

                                  ETHAN
                    You are not understanding... so 
                    listen very closely.

      And he PUSHES down with his foot even HARDER.  Into Jack s 
      SOLAR PLEXUS.  Cutting off his breathing.  Ethan leans in...

      And when he says this, it is CHILLING --

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    If you do not stop following me, 
                    I will kill one of them.

      Yeah.  We heard that right.  And Ethan fucking means it.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    Do you understand?

      TIGHT on Jack s eyes as he ABSORBS THIS.  Understands it.

      But he doesn t ACCEPT IT.

      Jack summons every last bit of his strength to get himself 
      out from under Ethan s foot -

    - REACHES UP, grabs ETHAN S ANKLE -- PUSHES -- Ethan s LEG 
      TWISTS -- SPLASH -- HE GOES DOWN IN THE MUD!

      Jack ROLLS OVER, GOES for Ethan and --

      THIS IS CLOSE QUARTS COMBAT.  RAIN FALLING.  But it quickly 
      becomes APPARENT that ETHAN IS ONE BAD MOTHERFUCKER as --

      SMASH.  HIS OPEN PALM JAMS into JACK S NECK -- An ELBOW under 
      his CHIN -- ETHAN IS JUST SO FUCKING FAST AND BRUTAL -- BLOW 
      AFTER BLOW -- All covered in QUICK AND DEVASTATING CUTS til --

      Jack literally FLIES BACK into the MUD.  Onto his back.  
      Completely SPENT.  Done.

      Defeated.

      And as Ethan begins to move towards JACK --*

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    No more warnings.

      And as he cocks his fist back and DRIVES it towards camera...

      And there is great INTIMACY as Kate dabs at his wound, puts 
      her other hand on the back of Jack s neck --

                                  JACK
                    Ethan was here.  He...

                        KATEJACK
      You banged your head --
                                                  -- He was here.

      And Jack GRUNTS, gets to his feet.  A little WOBBLY.

      Kate immediately GRABS him as he STUMBLES.  She s genuinely 
      CONCERNED.  Softly --

                                  KATE
                    Jack -- you have to stop.

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  KATE
                    The rain s washed the trail away.  *
                    Even if you did see him...

                    They re gone.

      Jack just looks at her.  And PULLS AWAY.

                                  JACK
                    No.
                          (then)
                    I m not letting him do this.

      Kate looks at Jack - the look on his face is FARAWAY - like 
      he isn t thinking about Ethan anymore -- Kate s confused --

                                  KATE
                    Not letting him -- ?

      But Jack is already moving for the INCLINE and begins to SLOG 
      his way back up --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    JACK!

      But he s not listening.  And as we CLOSE IN on him, more  *
      INTENSE NOW than we ve ever seen --

                                  JACK
                          (under his breath)
                    Not again.

      And the sounds of the jungle -- and Jack s breathing -- begin  *
      to drop out as --

                                  SHEPHARD (O.S.)
                    - at which time the patient went 
                    into cardiac arrest -


      Jack and Kate clear the hillside and rush into the dense 
      wilderness - their pace is determined - even as the foliage 
      around them grows thicker, blotting out the light -*

    - Kate leads the way - until she knocks down a large leaf and 
      finds herself face-to-face with -

      CHARLIE S HAND - THE  E  STILL ON HIS PINKY

    - attached to the rest of Charlie -

    - REVEALED hanging above them - with a noose wrapped around 
      his neck!  And a ratty cloth BLINDFOLD covering his eyes!

      KATE SCREAMS!

      And before we can take in the full HORROR of all of this, 
      THANK FUCKING GOD --

      Jack is here.

      He wraps his arms around Charlie s legs, pushing him up to 
      get some slack on the rope, allowing him to breathe -

                                  JACK
                    You have to cut the noose.

      Kate pulls out one of Locke s knives, but -

                                  KATE
                    - I can t reach it -

                                  JACK
                    - hold him -

      Kate grabs Charlie, awkwardly exchanging the knife with Jack, 
      but in the muddy ground, even as tall as he is, Jack can t 
      get to the noose with the knife -

    - so he grabs a hold of Charlie again - turning to Kate -

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You have to cut the rope from the

    - Kate climbs the slippery trunk - her foot slips - she *
      slides down, until she grabs onto a branch - barely hanging 
      on while -

      JACK




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      46.

    - struggles to keep Charlie up above the rope choking him, 
      but the mud and rain make it tremendously difficult -

                                  JACK
                    Just hold on, Charlie - hold on!

    - as Jack wages his battle to keep Charlie breathing -

      KATE

    - launches herself onto a branch - she can see the rope, a 
      white line dead ahead - as she moves, drawing the knife -

      JACK

    - he loses his grasp on Charlie, his feet sliding on the  *
      muddy earth - then - as Jack picks him back up -*

      KATE

    - finally reaches the end of the branch - she holds out the 
      knife - but the rope is just out of arm s length.

      Kate tries to marshal her anger and frustration - she holds 
      on to another branch - arches her body forward and -

    - SLASHES through the rope with the knife!

      JACK

    - falls to the ground, breaking Charlie s fall.  Scrambling 
      to his knees, Jack lays Charlie out, PULLS OFF THE BLINDFOLD 
      as Kate descends from the tree and hurries over.

      Jack checks for vital signs - but Charlie s body is inert, 
      limp, his eyes are shut - his lips are blue -

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    He s not breathing.

    - and a look of dread plays across Kate s face - an 
      uncontrollable emotional response to the blunt truth staring 
      her in the eye -

    - Charlie is dead.

      But Jack has not come this far to let it go.  He tilts 
      Charlie s head back to unblock the airway - still not 
      breathing - Jack breathes into Charlie s mouth -

    - nothing - without hesitation, Jack rips into Charlie s 
      shirt and starts compressions -



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST      "All the Best..."     (YELLOW)      10/18/04       47.

      Jack breathes into Charlie s mouth again - nothing - He  *
      resumes compressions -

                    Come on... come on...*

                    Come on... breathe...*

    - Jack puts his ear to Charlie s MOUTH -- NOTHING -- Tilts  *
      Charlie s head back -- BREATHES IN TO IT -- Back to  *
        compressions -- his eyes absolutely fucking DESPERATE - *

    - and Kate breaks into sobs beside him - *

                                  JACK (CONT D)

                    He s... He s not --*

      But Jack SLAMS his closed fist into Charlie s chest -- AGAIN.   *
      AGAIN.  AGAIN.  AGAIN.*

      Puts his ear to Charlie s mouth, checking for breath --  *
      Waiting -- Waiting for something... ANYTHING --*

      AND SUDDENLY WE RE WIDE --*

      Looking at this tableau from twenty yards away.  Charlie  *
      still.  Jack bending over him.  Kate standing behind them. *

      SILENCE.*

      And we just sit here for an excruciatingly long moment.  Long  *
      enough to know in our hearts...*

      Charlie is gone.*

      AND WE COME BACK IN CLOSE as --*

      Kate gently puts her hand on Jack s shoulder --*

    - Charlie shoots up with a GASP, taking his first breath in 
      minutes.

      Kate bursts into tears, scooping Charlie up in her arms as he 
      sputters his way back to life.  Jack leans back, looking up -  *
      until Kate puts her hand on his shoulder -

    - Jack turns to look at her and Charlie - battered, and still

 - 3433OMITTED33 - 34


      We find LOCKE & BOONE moving through the jungle, Locke 
      GUIDING the way with a POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT as they SPLASH 
      through a small STREAM.

      Boone follows a few steps behind.  It s clear his earlier 
      bravado has been replaced by FEAR.

                                  BOONE
                    Are we lost?

                                  LOCKE
                    No, Boone.  We re not lost.

                                  BOONE
                    It s just... I don t see how you 
                    can still be following the trail.

      But Locke just POWERS on.  Guided by... well, something.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    I think we should go back, man.

      And Locke stops.  Turns to Boone --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "All the Best..."   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/12/04   51.
      (CONT'D)3636


      And we re getting that old, familiar feeling.  That one we 
      haven t felt in awhile --

      That Locke KNOWS something the rest of us don t.

                                  LOCKE
                    Don t you feel it?

                                  BOONE
                          (confused)
                    Feel what?

                                  LOCKE
                    It.

      ON BOONE.  Maybe a little CREEPED OUT by this.  And Boone is 
      backing off now, not liking this one bit --

                                  BOONE
                    Okay, John -- I m just gonna follow 
                    the strips back, okay?

      Locke just stands there.

                                  LOCKE
                    Suit yourself.

      But Boone is already turning around, moving off --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Boone!
                          (Boone turns --)
                    You need this more than I do.

      Locke TOSSES him his FLASHLIGHT...

      But Boone bobbles it!  It slips through his hands and --

      SPLASH!  Ends up in the STREAM --

                                  BOONE
                    Dammit!

      And as Boone crouches down to pick it up, he suddenly STOPS.  
      Because the flashlight is illuminating something SHINY in the 
      stream -- about the size of a book -- *

    A piece of metal.

      Boone furrows his brow, trying to make SENSE OF THIS --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "All the Best..."   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/12/04   52.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Hey... John?

      But Locke is already here -- crouching down next to Boone. *

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    What is it?

      Locke looks at Boone -- UNSHEATHES his biggest KNIFE...

      And uses it to POKE the metal under the water.  TAPS it  *
      against the surface.

                                  LOCKE
                    Steel.

                                  BOONE
                    Maybe it s wreckage -- part of our 
                    plane...

      Locke uses his knife to SCRAPE away DIRT around the periphery  *
      of the metal, REVEALING MORE METAL.  We can see from Locke s  *
          curious-but-determined expression: THIS IS NO PIECE OF THE *
      PLANE.*

      Now even Boone is doubting that it came from their jet.  Even  *
      in the darkness, it is clear that this thing is shiny,  *
      polished, and part of something much larger. *

                                  BOONE (CONT D)*
                    What is that?*

      And we re ON LOCKE -- clearly fascinated by this thing.  And  *
      it is most definitely worthy of that fascination --  And  *
      after a moment -- Locke looks over at Boone --

                                  LOCKE
                    That s what we re going to find 
                    out.

      And OFF BOONE.  OFF LOCKE.  AND OFF THAT SUBMERGED METAL... *
