      LIGHTNING ripples silently through the clouds above a traffic 
      filled road. Leaning over the steering wheel, the BUS DRIVER 
      peers up at the darkening skies ahead.

      Coach looks over her shoulder, whistle hanging from his lips. 
      He breathes a low grumble of displeasure at the storm. Until 
      something catches his eye in the rear view mirror.

      A BLAST OF THE WHISTLE startles a teenager standing to talk 
      to a girl in the seat behind him. 

                                  COACH
                    Sit down.

      The teen drops back, revealing a bus filled with the Cross 
      Country team. Some study, some text, others sleep. In one 
      seat, Isaac and Boyd exchange tense whispers.

                                  ISAAC
                    Stop thinking about it.

                                  BOYD
                    Like you re not thinking about it 
                    too?

                                  ISAAC
                    Okay, we both stop thinking about 
                    it.

                                  BOYD
                    I can t.

                                  ISAAC
                    Yeah, well, you can t do anything 
                    about it either.

                                  BOYD
                    You sure about that?

      He nods to a row behind them where Ethan sits, checking his 
      PHONE for a message. Beside him, Danny watches Ethan push the 
      phone back into his pocket with a frustrated breath.                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/132.

                                  DANNY
                    You okay?

                                  ETHAN
                    Yeah, why?

                                  DANNY
                    That s like the third time you ve 
                    checked your phone in five minutes.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just waiting for a message.

                                  DANNY
                    Anything important?

                                  ETHAN
                    No. Nothing.

      His tone belies his words, however. Turning, he gazes 
        surreptitiously down the aisle to Scott and Stiles sitting in 
      one of the back seats.

      While Stiles taps a finger over his tablet, Scott leans his 
      head against the window, heavy eyelids beginning to close.


      The bus door CLATTERS open and team members burst out, racing 
      to get off. Coach yanks one of the windows down to yell out.

                                  COACH
                    Somebody get towels. Or a mop.

      He peers back in again, cringing at the sight inside.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Or a new bus.


      The bus s ENGINE starts up. Coach gives a BLAST of the 
      whistle and waves his hand.

                                  COACH
                    Let s go! Back on the bus.

      Stiles and Lydia look to each other.


      Racing to catch the bus, Allison holds her arm around Scott, 
      trying to keep him steady. Lydia darts toward them.

                                  LYDIA
                    Is he okay? Are you okay?

                                  SCOTT
                          (nodding)
                      Stiles--where s Stiles?

                                  LYDIA
                    Trying to stall Coach.
                          (to Allison)
                    And we still have no gas.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m not leaving him.

                                  LYDIA
                    Then we have to leave the car.

                                    ALLISON
                    Good idea.

                                  LYDIA
                    What? That wasn t an actual 
                      suggestion. Allison, wait! Oh, 
                    screw it.

      She hurries after them.*


      A WHISTLE BLOWING over a crowd outside the bus where a fight *
      has broken out. Coach desperately tries to pull the teenagers *
      apart. *

      Stiles turns to Scott who arrives helped by Allison and *
      Lydia.

                                  STILES
                    He went after him--I told him what 
                    was happening with you and he just

                    Boyd?

                                  STILES
                    No--

                                  COACH
                    Isaac! Isaac, back off!

      But still swinging his fists even as Danny struggles with 
      him, Isaac tries to get another hit at Ethan. The twin takes 
      the beating with a disturbing smile until-- 

                                  SCOTT
                    ISAAC.

      Scott s VOICE THUNDERS through the crowd, turning every head *
      and shutting every mouth. Whistle hanging off his lip, even 
      Coach falls silent under the young man s commanding presence.

      Lowering his fist, Isaac looks at the healed Scott with 
      relief. And finally, backs off.


      In the sparsely occupied parking lot behind Deaton s Clinic, 
      the two reflections of Peter and Cora slip across the window 
      of a car.

                                  CORA
                    An Animal Clinic?

                                  PETER
                    Not as ordinary as it looks. The 
                      building s half made out of 
                    mountain ash. I m not actually sure 
                    how to get in.

                                  CORA
                    Maybe we do what normal people do? 
                    Knock on the door.

      She starts forward, but Peter yanks her back, alarmed.

                                  PETER
                    They re here.

                                  CORA
                    Who?

                                  PETER
                    All of them.                TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/1337.



      Hidden behind an SUV, Peter and Cora watch the building.

                                  CORA
                    But who do you think s inside? Is 
                    it Derek or Ennis? Or both--

      Peter s hand closes around her arm, silencing her. The rear 
      door of the Clinic clatters open. 

      Kali charges out, Aiden following. As he pulls her into a 
      comforting embrace, she lifts her head to SCREAM, a sound 
      that seems to shake the earth.

      CAR ALARMS GO OFF all around them. Pulling behind the SUV, 
      Peter and Cora share a look of dread.

                                  PETER
                            (whispering)
                    We know one thing. That wasn t for 
                    Derek.


      Struggling to carry her bag, coat and an armful of papers to 
      grade, Jennifer Blake fumbles the door of her car open in the 
      otherwise empty school parking lot.

      She starts the engine and turns to the window to reach for 
      her seat belt when--

      A BLOODY HAND presses to the glass.

      Jennifer flinches back in shock as Derek slumps into view. 
      Quickly opening the door, she steps out to help. But he 
      collapses to the ground in front of her, bleeding, pale and 
      barely breathing. Severely wounded, but not dead. 

      Not yet...

                                                                          FADE OUT:
