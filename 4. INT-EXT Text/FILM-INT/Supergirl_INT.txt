AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.
THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.
TEACHER
And now, who can give me the electron
wave functions for Kryptonian covalent
bonding?
The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.
CHILD
The cube root of the wavelength over the
natural log of the integral of the speed of
light squared.
The teacher smiles.
TEACHER
Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...
THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .
A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.
Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.
KARA
What are you making:
ZALTAR
It's going to be a tree, I think.
KARA
What's a tree?
ZALTAR
It's something they have on Earth. You know,
where your cousin went.
KARA
Where is Earth?
ZALTAR
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in
school?
KARA
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in
my head.
Zaltar laughs.
ZALTAR
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in
outer space. And we're in inner space.
KARA
I don't understand.
ZALTAR
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.
ZALTAR.
This is one of the four Power Sources of the City.
I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I
can do with it.
Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.
ZALTAR
You see, a tree is a living thing.
KARA
Can you create life?
ZALTAR
No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays
over the surface. . .
A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Kara. Kara.
Kara calls out in reply.
KARA
I'm here, mother.
Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.
ALURA
Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge
without a grown-up.
KARA
I'm sorry, Mother.
ZALTAR
I was keeping an eye on her.
Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.
ALURA
Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.
Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.
ZALTAR
You and your husband have been kind to me,
Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going
away. Soon.
ALURA
But where?
Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.
ZALTAR
Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.
She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.
ZALTAR
Good. Now, go make something pretty.
Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.
ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom
Zone.
ALURA
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
ZALTAR
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself
to
Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm
starting to repeat myself here with this airy,
glittery stuff....
Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.
ALURA
But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We
were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension.
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!
In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.
ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other
people come second.
ALURA
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.
ZALTAR
Kara---the Power Source!
Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir.
The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair
tenderly.
KARA
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
ZALTAR
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use
the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
ALURA
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
ZALTAR
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do
with three.
ALURA
But what will happen?
ZALTAR
The Guardians will be angry. They may even
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't
really have permission to borrow it. I must go
explain to them...
Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.
DISSOLVE TO:
DAY
Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.
INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.
BACK TO SCENE.
DAY
Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.
LIVING ROOM
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.
Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.
The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.
ELDERLY MAN
Is this Nigel's doing?
SELENA
It's a warning, that's for sure.
ELDERLY MAN
Maybe it was just an accident.
SELENA
(mysteriously)
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has
meaning, if you can read the signs.
The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.
ELDERLY MAN
Then what does it mean???
Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.
SELENA
Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.
Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.
MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.
MYRA
Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really
scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.
Linda walks on up to the next f1oor.
Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.
MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.
MR. DANVERS
Don't you believe in knocking?
LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.
MR. DANVERS
What can I do for you?
LINDA
I'm Linda Lee.
My cousin wrote you.
MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.
MR . DANVERS
Cousin? Wrote me?
Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.
Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.
LINDA
The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.
MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.
LINDA
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
MR. DANVERS
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry
about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.
CUT TO:
MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor.
A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.
STUDENT MONITOR
Man on the floor!
Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door.
LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up.
LUCY
Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.
MR. DANVERS
Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?
LUCY
It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.
MR DANVERS
Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her.
Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her
cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of
enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads
her into the room chattering away excitedly.
LUCY
Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a
hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one
get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm,
some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness...
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.
Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.
LINDA
I can do that.
LUCY
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
LINDA
There isn't any.
LUCY
This is all your clothes?
Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN.
LINDA
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a
chance since...
LUCY
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or
something?
LINDA
I'd rather not talk about it.
LUCY
You're not...an orphan are you?
LINDA
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
LUCY
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen,
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
LINDA
Thank you. You're very kind.
LUCY
I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was
something tragic if you show up without a
wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this.
Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda.
CUT TO:
Girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms. Showers are running in the background. Linda unlaces her shoes. Lucy is unlacing beside her.
LUCY
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
LINDA
But what for?
LUCY
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower.
Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing.
MYRA
(whispering)
Are they in?
Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position.
MYRA
Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.
She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve.
MUFFY
But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and
give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it,
could scald them.
MYRA
So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.
Myra pulls on the wrench.
Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall.
Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess.
CUT TO:
MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.
MR DANVERS
Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take
weeks before the computer. It still takes a long
time without certain algorithms.
Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision.
Linda smiles to herself.
MR. DANVERS (O.S.)
Linda? Are you with us?
She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.
LINDA
Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.
She looks at the board.
LINDA
The answer is 5,271,009,010.
Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.
MR. DANVERS
You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in
the future.
She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.
Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a
built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca.
SELENA
Stop the car!
Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.
Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.
SELENA
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
BIANCA
What is it?
SELENA
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.
SELENA
What does it mean?
BIANCA
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.
SELENA
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a
baseball game?
BIANCA
Softball.
SELENA
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
BIANCA
But which one?
SELENA
Drive on. We have already attracted enough
attention.
Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.
SELENA
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls
just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to
something--we'll find out.
BIANCA
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
The car swerves slightly.
SELENA
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at
the wheel. OK?
BIANCA
Sorry, mistress.
CUT TO:
Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.
LUCY
Hey, Linda, you in there?
LINDA (o.s.)
Uh-huh.
Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
LUCY
How much longer you gonna be?
LINDA (o.s.)
Not long. I'm cutting my hair.
Lucy crosses to the bathroom door.
LUCY
You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.
Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror.
SUPERGIRL
I can manage, thanks.
Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand.
LUCY
I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only
thing was to go totally punk!
Linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. She is wearing her brunette wig and her Linda clothing. Lucy is puzzled.
LUCY
Your hair looks the same.
LINDA
It was just a trim.
The student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.
JODY
Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home.
LUCY
What's in it?
JODY
A hair dryer that makes popcorn!
LUCY
Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.
Lucy hurries to the door. Linda holds back.
LINDA
No thanks. You go on.
LUCY
You sure?
Linda nods bravely, and Lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. Linda stands alone in the room.
A beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. Linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.
Lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by Gloria's new hair dryer. The package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. Some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. One of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "There's No Place Like Home". One by one the other girls join in. It's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to Linda's loneliness.
Linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. From down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.
GIRLS .o.s.)
"Be it ever so humble, There's no place like
home..."
A tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in Linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. She steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.
ALURA (o.s.)
Kara, my darling...
LINDA
Mother! Is it you? Where are you???
ALURA (o.s.)
In Argo City. Have you found the Power Source?
LINDA
Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where
to begin to look.
ALURA (o.s.)
Kara, be careful. There is some terrible evil force coming
near you. I can feel it. Keep to your disguise. Let no one
know who you are.
LINDA
But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.
ALURA (o.s.)
There are more powers in the universe than we know.
And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And
come home safely.
The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.
The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.
GIRLS (o.s.)
"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be
it ever so humble, There's no place like home."
CUT TO:
Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line.
MR . DANVERS
Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million,
nine thousand, and ten.
He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena.
BIANCA
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
SELENA
He will be. In about five minutes.
BIANCA
Have fun.
Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors.
SELENA
Finished your estimate?
ETHAN
Well, there's several ways to go .
SELENA
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.
SELENA
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always
see your truck parked around.
ETHAN
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my
service.
SELENA
I bet they do.
ETHAN
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
SELENA
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.
ETHAN
Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending
on how alkaline your soil is.
Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.
SELENA
I just love plants and growing things. It must be
wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!
Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.
ETHAN
Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day.
Selena gestures outside.
SELENA
But look, it's almost sundown!
Ethan glances outside. Selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.
ETHAN
Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some
honeysuckle there and there...
Selena pouts exaggeratedly.
SELENA
Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family
recipe, I'm famous for them.
Ethan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.
ETHAN
What is it?
SELENA
A passionfruit smoothee.
ETHAN
Well, just one.
He takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.
SELENA
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
ETHAN
I'll drink to that.
He takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.
ETHAN
Hmmm. Delicious!
He tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly.
ETHAN
Now, about my fee...
He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.
SELENA
Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes
and be all mine.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Selena looks up with annoyance.
SELENA
If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...
She angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan.
SELENA
Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back.
Ethan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously.
INSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN
The room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours.
BACK TO SCENE
Ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace.
Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors.
SELENA
Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything!
Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.
MRS. DANVERS
I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda.
The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.
Linda stands up from the chessboard.
LINDA
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs.
Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a
terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
MR. DANVERS
What? Me?
LINDA
Sure. Mate in five moves.
She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...
LINDA
...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't
see it coming. Well, bye.
She walks out the door into the night.
MRS . DANVERS
What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must
have her back, don't you think?
MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.
Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.
SELENA
Show me Ethan.
She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
SELENA
The silly fool!
Selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle. She looks at the IMAGE OF ETHAN in
her mirror.
SELENA
Power of Shadows...bring him to me.
The box in her hand glows with an inner light.
Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.
SUPERGIRL
Everything's going to be all right. She's just
unconscious. No broken bones.
INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP
Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.
BACK TO SCENE
There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.
ETHAN
God...you're beautiful.
Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.
ETHAN (in the mirror)
God...you're beautiful.
SELENA
That was meant for me!
Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror.
BIANCA
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
SELENA
It's what we were warned about.
Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.
BIANCA
A Storm Dragon?
SELENA
No, a super girl.
TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside.
FIRST INTERN
What was that?
SECOND INTERN
Maybe we better take a look.
EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT
Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys.
ETHAN
Don't leave me.
SUPERGIRL
I have to.
ETHAN
When can I see, you again ?
SUPERGIRL
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream.
Goodbye.
She gives the gurneys a shove.
The automatic doors open and Ethan and Lucy roll inside on the gurneys.
FIRST INTERN
Did we use the laughing gas tonight?
SECOND INTERN
That was last night.
FIRST INTERN
Then this is really happening.
The two interns catch the gurneys, and start examining Ethan and Lucy.
SECOND INTERN
Hey fella, can you talk???
Ethan begins to babble deliriously.
ETHAN
The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this
before. I love her. My angel.
He sits up, tears brimming in his eyes, and grasps the , intern by the lapels.
ETHAN
Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die
if I can't have her.
The intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.
FIRST INTERN
She's right here fella.
ETHAN
No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us
through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.
The two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.
SECOND INTERN
This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
a 412. Send down the boys from psycho.
ETHAN
No! She's real ! I saw her !
CUT TO:
NIGHT
Selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ETHAN IN THE HOSPITAL STRUGGLING WITH THE TWO INTERNS . Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.
SELENA
Why did she have to show up now?
BIANCA
Eliminate her.
SELENA
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
BIANCA
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman
on Earth.
SELENA
Am I? Still?
There is a pause as the implications reverberate.
BIANCA
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can
withstand its power.
SELENA
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
BIANCA
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless
it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare
oppose you again. No one.
Selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.
SELENA
Not even Nigel.
Selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
SELENA
What do I do?
I don't know her name.
BIANCA
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate
on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.
SELENA
Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be.
Find her and destroy her.
A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.
SELENA
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
BIANCA
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.
SELENA
I think I'd better keep it.
BIANCA
Whatever you say.
SELENA
Yes. Whatever I say.
From now on.
She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.
CUT TO:
Mrs. Danvers is on the phone.
MRS. DANVERS
The housemother still doesn't answer.
Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.
MR. DANVERS
Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right.
MRS. DANVERS
We should have driven her.
Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket.
MR. DANVERS
I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right.
Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.
Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of
Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.
Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.
Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.
LINDA
Hey, that's my roommate's car!
Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!
Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in.
A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically.
NIGHT
Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room.
Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue
tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed.
MR. DANVERS
A Supergirl...
(to her)
Linda...is it Linda?
Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly.
SUPERGIRL
I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so
tired...forgot...
M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed.
MR. DANVERS
Are you all right?
SUPERGIRL
Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage
outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...
MR. DANVERS
But why?
SUPERGIRL
An evil force. Trying to destroy me.
She sits up and looks anxiously at him.
Selena watches their image in her mirror.
SUPERGIRL
(image)
You won't tell anybody, will you?
MR. DANVERS
(image)
Not even my wife. And, if there's anything I can do to
help---I'd be honoured.
Supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes.
SUPERGIRL
Thank you, Mr. Danvers.
She lapses into a deep sleep. Mr. Danvers stands up, and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture. He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.
CUT T0:
Lucy Lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. Superman's pal JIMMY OLSEN is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. Lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when Linda enters.
LUCY
...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't
let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha
Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my
roommate just walked in. Bye.
Lucy hangs up and turns to Linda.
LUCY
Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I
don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy
Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the
newspaper.
JIMMY
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your
cousin Clark taught me everything I know about
the newspaper business.
LINDA
Nice to meet you.
She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy.
LINDA
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
LUCY
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the
insurance money. B.F.D.
Jimmy keeps looking at Linda.
JIMMY
Do you have any theories about last night?
LINDA
Theories?
JIMMY
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all
that damage at the school. The police are calling it
a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
LUCY
(overlapping)
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one
second?
JIMMY
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural,
or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
LINDA
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But
I don't know what it is.
JIMMY
Can I quote you?
Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal.
LUCY
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers
in water before they die?
JIMMY
Oh, sure.
He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.
LUCY
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak?
He's private property. I've been waiting years
for him to develop.
LINDA
He's nice.
LUCY
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.
JIMMY
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
LINDA
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
JIMMY
I knew it ! He's working on a
hot scoop !
CUT TO:
Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.
He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.
Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up.
ETHAN
Oh no, not you again.
SELENA
What an adorable hat.
ETHAN
They think I have a concussion.
SELENA
And you think you're in love.
ETHAN
I know it.
SELENA
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you
a temporary love potion.
ETHAN
Why should I believe you?
SELENA
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all
about that girl.
Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.
ETHAN
Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!
Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
SELENA
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be
interested in that puny little girl?
ETHAN
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
SELENA
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
I saw you
SELENA
(continuing)
Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I
gave you.
Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.
ETHAN
Nurse! Nurse!
SELENA
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid
you don't know who I am.
ETHAN
Nurse!
SELENA
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have
Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get
what I want.
ETHAN
Nurse! Help !
The door opens and a NURSE walks in.
NURSE
Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying
to sleep.
ETHAN
Get her away from me.
She's crazy.
NURSE
(to Selena)
Are you family? Visiting hours are over.
SELENA
They're over for you sweetheart.
Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.
SELENA
Now you see who you're dealing with.
Ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.
ETHAN
Leave me alone.
Selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.
SELENA
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving
you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
ETHAN
I don't want your help.
SELENA
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
Selena reaches out a hand to Ethan.
ETHAN
No!
SELENA
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no
different from the rest!
The door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push
inside, with guns drawn.
SECURITY OFFICER
Okay, what's going on in h--
Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.
Selena ducks out into the corridor.
Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.
Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.
SELENA
Power of Shadow---seize him.
The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases
Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.
Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.
A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.
The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.
Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.
NURSE
Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas
problem.
DOCTOR
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.
Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.
He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.
Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.
Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.
CUT TO:
Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.
LUCY
Omigod.
A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.
DELIVERY BOY
Where you want this?
LUCY
Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him
a tip, Jimmy.
Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.
JIMMY
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
LINDA
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to
meet you, Jimmy.
LUCY
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
LINDA
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
LUCY
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna
be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
Her phone rings and she picks it up.
LUCY
Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?
Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.
JIMMY
Can I give you a lift?
LINDA
Oh, no thanks.
JIMMY
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.
CUT TO:
He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.
Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.
ETHAN
Supergirl'?
He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.
Waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.
Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.
SELENA
Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.
OTHERS IN UNISON
The Circle is complete.
NIGEL
You better have a pretty good explanation for
this, Selena.
SELENA
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of
the Craft.
INDIAN WOMAN
But Superman has been away.
SELENA
It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She
knows we exist..
ELDERLY MAN
Then she must be destroyed.
NIGEL
How did she find out about us?
ELDERLY MAN
That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will
become curious and learn more. When she learns
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will
try to stop us.
BIANCA
We must destroy her first.
ERICA
But how can we destroy her?
SELENA
By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must
volunteer
to take on the combined power of us all.
Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.
NIGEL
You! You want to take our power for yourself!
Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.
SELENA
Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.
Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.
SELENA
(continuing)
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
NIGEL
You would! You revealed our existence so you could
have all of our power.
SELENA
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself,
Nigel?
NIGEL
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer
of Shadow too much.
It is beginning to rule your heart.
SELENA
Nonsense.
Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.
FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.
Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?
BIANCA
Enough quibbling. Let us vote.
They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.
SELENA
I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?
Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence.
NIGEL
I have no choice.
His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.
The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.
CUT TO:
A barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.
Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.
SELENA
At last. Ultimate Power.
BIANCA
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
SELENA
What do you mean we?
She turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.
CUT TO:
In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.
SUPERGIRL
(image)
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
ETHAN
(image)
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped
like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
CUT TO:
Supergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.
SUPERGIRL
Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.
BIANCA
I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me.
But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind.
Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.
SUPERGIRL
What are you talking about? Where's Selena?
BIANCA
No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.
Hurt you.
SUPERGIRL
I have to find her. Tell me.
Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.
NIGEL
Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain.
Stop her before it's too late!
Supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.
Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.
ETHAN
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
SELENA
I could force you.
ETHAN
If that worked, you would've done it already. No,
you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well
let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell
before I fall for that one again.
SELENA
Go on,
talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.
SELENA
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's
see how thirsty you get in a week.
ETHAN
You vicious--
SELENA
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.
Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.
The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.
Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors
to the garden.
Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.
SUPERGIRL
Ethan!
She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared.
The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.
Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.
SELENA
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.
Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.
Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.
SUPERGIRL
Ethan! Don't let her do this!
Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.
SUPERGIRL
No. No. It isn't true.
The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.
The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone.
TRANSLATOR"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.
BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.
SELENA
Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!
The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.
SELENA
I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of
Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And
I bring you myself as her representative here
on Earth.
The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.
SELENA
From this moment forth, all science, religion and other
unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I
will teach the One True Way of our ancient
grandmothers.
The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to
interrupt Selena.
PRESIDENT
You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we
know it.
SELENA
And it's about time too.
PRESIDENT
I do not know who you are, or what evil force
you represent, but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.
Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.
SELENA
Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation.
I have something better.
She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.
The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.
CUT TO:
He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.
SUPERGIRL
It's lovely. . .
ZALTAR
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything
just right. Nobody telling you to change this,
move that around. Please yourself. That's
the secret of happiness.
SUPERGIRL
Are you happy, Zaltar?
ZALTAR
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do
whatever I want. All the time.
SUPERGIRL
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.
ZALTAR
I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy.
It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.
He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.
SUPERGIRL
You look at them? How?
ZALTAR
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you
have the right tools.
Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.
He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.
ZALTAR
There you see? What could be more boring than that?
He waves his hand, and the image disappears.
SUPERGIRL
Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?
Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.
ZALTAR
It'll only make you sad.
He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.
ZALTAR
This goes closer. This moves it around. And
this begins.
He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :
Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.
A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.
SECRETARY
No more audiences today. Go home. All
of you.
Through the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like
a pet animal.
DISSOLVE TO:
The secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "Selena! Selena!"
SELENA
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
ETHAN
Yeah.
Selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.
SELENA
Coming?
Ethan follows her sullenly.
Supergirl reels with shock at the scene
SUPERGIRL
That horrible woman!
ZALTAR
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would
make you sad.
He starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.
SUPERGIRL
No. I have to see this.
Zaltar shrugs.
DISSOLVE TO:
The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.
LUCY
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers
have been arrested!
JIMMY
How do you know?
LUCY
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
JIMMY
Did anybody notice you?
LUCY
I can't help it if men notice me.
JIMMY
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for
treason!
She kisses him on the nose.
LUCY
Just kidding. Nobody saw me.
Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.
The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.
JIMMY
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
LUCY
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
JIMMY
I heard stories.
I don't think you wanna know.
There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.
LUCY
Hey! Ethan!
ETHAN
Hmmm?
LUCY
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
ETHAN .
Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.
LUCY
Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?
ETHAN
A little.
LUCY
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
ETHAN
I'll mention it upstairs.
He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.
JIMMY
The blonde girl who saved your life---where
is she now?
Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.
ETHAN
She's gone. No one will ever see her again.
CUT TO:
Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.
SUPERGIRL
Zaltar, please help me.
ZALTAR
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
SUPERGIRL
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are.
They need me.
Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.
ZALTAR
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped.
That's why they send the criminals here.
SUPERGIRL
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
ZALTAR
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.
ZALTAR
There is a way.
SUPERGIRL
I knew it!
ZALTAR
But it's impossible.
SUPERGIRL
Why?
ZALTAR
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.
ZALTAR
I could do it.
She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.
SUPERGIRL
Then teach me how.
ZALTAR
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get
one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a
sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
He takes another sip of his drink.
SUPERGIRL
Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.
He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.
ZALTAR
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand.
Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards
too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have
the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's
out of the question.
SUPERGIRL
Then come with me.
ZALTAR
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
SUPERGIRL
You could do anything. You could sculpt
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows!
You'd have superpowers.
ZALTAR
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
SUPERGIRL
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are
in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power
Source, Argo City will die.
He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.
ZALTAR
Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.
He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.
SUPERGIRL
You're going to take me back?
ZALTAR
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.
LUCY
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
ETHAN
I did.
LUCY
(bitterly)
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Ethan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.
Ethan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.
ETHAN
What's going on?
Selena snaps irritably at him.
SELENA
Guess! Go on.
ETHAN
I don't know. You seem afraid.
SELENA
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
ETHAN
(the truth dawns on him)
Supergirl?
Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.
Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.
Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.
SELENA
Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.
She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in
Selena's eyes.
ETHAN
You're not going to hurt her, are you?
Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.
SELENA
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
ETHAN
Well...I guess I can't.
SELENA
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.
Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.
SUPERGIRL
Why are you stopping?
ZALTAR
Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you
musn't do.
He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.
ZALTAR
Oh dear!
The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.
Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.
ZALTAR
The wand. Use it.
Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.
ZALTAR
Good girl! That's the way!
But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.
ZALTAR
You can use the wand.
SUPERGIRL
Better than when I was a child.
She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.
ZALTAR
I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like
your mother.
CUT TO:
Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.
Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.
ZALTAR
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
SUPERGIRL
Don't stop. Keep moving.
ZALTAR
Yes, mustn't stop.
SUPERGIRL
(grimly)
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.
SUPERGIRL
Zaltar. Use the wand!
ZALTAR
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.
ZALTAR
(voice over)
Goodbye...
SUPERGIRL
Zaltar!
She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.
SUPERGIRL
You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.
Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.
Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.
SUPERGIRL
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
ETHAN
She has hostages.
SELENA
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
SUPERGIRL
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.
INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.
BACK TO SCENE
Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.
Jimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.
JIMMY
Hey, what gives?
The blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.
Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.
SELENA
All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till
the last card's dealt.
Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.
All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.
SUPERGIRL
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
SELENA
Not yet.
Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.
ETHAN
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
SUPERGIRL
How do I fight it?
ETHAN
Turn it against her.
Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.
There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.
REAL SELENA
Power of Shadow, kill her!!
The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.
SECOND SELENA
No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.
REAL SELENA
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.
SECOND SELENA
You are my shadow, you must obey me.
The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.
Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.
ETHAN
I've got it! The Power Source!
The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.
And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.
REAL SELENA
(terrified)
No! Stop! Please!
Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar.
SECOND SELENA
Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.
ETHAN
It is you, then, really?
Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.
SECOND SELENA
Well?
ETHAN
It's you all right.
SECOND SELENA
I'll make it easy for you.
She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.
ETHAN
I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.
SUPERGIRL
I never doubted you for a moment.
REAL SELENA
Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...
Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.
The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.
SELENA
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
SUPERGIRL
For what?
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.
SELENA
Ever since I found that thing I've been like
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
SUPERGIRL
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to
Argo City where it won't be misused.
(to Ethan)
You could come too. It might be safer for you.
ETHAN
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll
vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks
for my memoirs.
SUPERGIRL
I'll come back as soon as I can.
SELENA
What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around
here.
Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.
ETHAN
She's right. They'll string her up.
SUPERGIRL
Do you want to come to Argo City?
SELENA
What's it like?
SUPERGIRL
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
SELENA
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.
SUPERGIRL
Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the
journey through inner space.
Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.
CUT TO:
Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.
The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.
EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY
All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.
CUT TO:
