      A BLOOD RED HARVEST MOON rises high above the dark waters of 
    the North Atlantic.  Bands of crimson moonlight cradle deep 
      rolling swells as they push their way towards the flickering 
      lights of a distant shoreline.  THE STEADY VOICE of a 
      determined young woman draws us in to hear her story.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    REVENGE.  The Oxford English 
                    dictionary defines it as the infliction 
                    of punishment in retaliation for an 
                    injury, harm, or wrongdoing done to 
                    oneself or another.  

    THE CAMERA GATHERS SPEED as it glides across the open sea 
      towards specks of light growing larger on the horizon.

                    Sunday school proverbs package it 
                    inside morality slogans like  an eye 
                    for an eye,  and  two wrongs don t 
                    make a right.   But two wrongs can 
                    never make a right because two 
                    wrongs can never equal each other.  

      A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT from somewhere on shore-- where a small spate 
    of East Coast mansions rests nobly beyond cresting whitecaps and 
      cascading sand dunes.  ANOTHER GUNSHOT pierces the night, 
      followed by an EXPLOSION of RED AND WHITE FIREWORKS...

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Hamlet, Medea, Captain Ahab, Charles 
                    Bronson.  The icons of vengeance 
                    teach us that for the truly wronged,  
                    real satisfaction can only be found 
                    in one of two places: absolute 
                      forgiveness or mortal vindication.

      A CRASHING WAVE stretches inland, POOLING FOAMY WATER around the 
      feet of A YOUNG MAN in a white tuxedo, face down in the wet sand.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (CONT D)
                    This is not a story about forgiveness.

      Victoria, a subtle look of satisfaction on her face, steps 
      away from Conrad s office to survey the party below.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20115.


    The photo montage of Daniel and Emily projected beneath her 
      makes for an intriguing composition.  

      ANGLE ON THE PATIO, where Emily endures a surface conversation 
      with two random guests.  She glances up, meets Victoria s 
      gaze.  Holds it for a loaded beat.  On the wall below flashes 
      a photo of Victoria standing between Emily and Daniel with a 
      cool smile, her arm draped over her son s shoulder...



    TWO HANDS DIVE INTO FRAME, grabbing the man in the water by 
    the arms, pulling him from the clawing surf.  With tremendous 
      effort, a breathless BEN PORTER, 26, blue collar townie in 
      jeans and a dark blue hoodie, drags the body to dry land.

      Distraught, Ben collapses on the sand next to the body, head 
    in his hands.  Away from the immediate shore, the sound of 
      rolling surf is now joined by the distant din of music and 
      laughter coming from the engagement party a few hundred yards 
      away.  Ben turns his head to the majestic summer home at the 
    tip of the cape, but the driftwood fence and long stretch of 
      pristine white sand are not the only things separating Ben 
      from the people at this party.  

    TWO FIGURES appear at the top of the hill, chasing each other 
      towards the beach.  Ben ducks down, watching the shadows of a 
      TIPSY young couple weaving their way through the low rising 
      sand dunes, laughing.  As they get closer we recognize the 
    two teenagers as Charlotte and Declan.  Charlotte races 
      ahead, pulling her red mini-dress over her head, tossing it 
    in the sand as she scampers into the surf.  Declan stops at 
    the shoreline.  Neither notices Ben and the body, hidden just 
      beyond the driftwood fence and hill of sand. 

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Come on bad boy, lets see what you 
                    got--

      Declan grins, starts pulling off his tuxedo...  

      BACK WITH BEN, considering his options.  A CELLPHONE STARTS 
      RINGING LOUDLY next to his ear.  It s coming from the dead 
      man s tuxedo pocket.  Ben quickly rifles through the jacket, 
      locates the phone-- there s a picture of EMILY on the ID 
      screen.  He tears the battery out, yanks the hoodie tight 
      over his head and staggers to his feet, stuffing the cell 
      phone into his jeans.  

                                  DECLAN (O.S.)
                    Yo, Eight-mile, private party here.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20116.


      Just over Ben s shoulder, less than 40 yards away, Declan 
      stands, stripped down to his boxers, posturing.  Charlotte 
      comes out of the water, hiding herself behind Declan.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    That guy better not be taking pictures. 

      Declan wraps Charlotte in his suit jacket.  Ben stands there, 
      frozen, his back to the young couple.

                                  DECLAN
                    We got a problem?

      Declan obviously doesn t recognize the man in the hoodie.  
      Which is all Ben needs to know before racing inland, 
      stumbling in the sand as he goes...

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Creep.

      Charlotte grabs for her dress, finds a discarded handgun in the 
      sand next to it.  Picks up the gun, looks to Declan:  WTF?  



      Emily stands away from the guests, phone to her ear:  The 
      party you are trying to reach is unavailable, please leave 
      your message at the tone...    Beep.   Emily s about to say 
      something-- but we ll never know exactly what...

                                  NOLAN ROSS (O.S.)
                    Nice night for it.

      Hanging up, Emily turns to see NOLAN ROSS, 34, a Howard 
      Hughes/Mark Zuckerberg-ian tech genius cum social misfit.  
      He s wearing a thrift-store 70s style white tuxedo, a RED SOX 
      BASEBALL CAP, and red KEDS All-Stars.  Emily and Nolan have 
    an understanding of one another, but not much affection.  

                                  EMILY
                    Nice night for what?

      Nolan grabs a champagne from a passing server, toasts her.

                                  NOLAN ROSS
                    Celebrating.

                                  EMILY
                    You aren t supposed to be here, Nolan.

                                  NOLAN ROSS
                    That makes two of us.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20117.


                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    Fire and Ice...

      Emily, Nolan, and the rest of the guests turn to look up at 
      Victoria, standing on the balcony above, holding a wireless 
      microphone and a glass of champagne. 

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    When we first sat down to discuss 
                    tonight s theme, I was immediately 
                    taken by the idea of an evening 
                    inspired by two primal bookends.  
                    Fire and ice, beginnings and 
                    endings, the elements in harmony. 

    As Victoria descends the stairs to the patio, she nods to 
      Ashley, the architect of the event.  ASHLEY smiles back, but 
      there s worry behind it.  She turns to Emily as a small circle 
    of guests are now clearing a space around her friend, whose 
      fiance, Daniel, is now conspicuously absent.  

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Tonight not only marks the final 
                    weekend of a truly remarkable 
                    summer in the Hamptons, it is also 
                      a celebration of my son Daniel s 
                    engagement to the lovely and 
                    beguiling, Miss Emily Thorne.

      Applause.  Emily manages a smile, trying to maintain composure 
      through the unwanted attention.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Though it s only been a few short 
                    months since Memorial Day, Emily 
                    already feels like a piece of the 
                    family puzzle we had no idea was 
                    even missing.  In a nutshell, I 
                    approve.  And as anyone here will 
                    attest, approval isn t something I 
                    give away freely. 

    As the crowd laughs, Victoria leans in to Emily, sotto voce...

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Where the hell is my son?



    CU on Charlotte, stumbling up the slope of a steep sand berm, 
      soaking wet in her red dress and Declan s white jacket-- She 
      twists her ankle, collapses on the dune.  Lifts her head towards 
    the house, and SCREAMS at the top of her lungs...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20118.

      FROM HIGH ABOVE,THE CAMERAPEERS DOWNat the dead man in the 
      white tuxedo, face down in the sand.  Declan is kneeling 
      beside the body.  Guests begin to gather at the scene, and we 
      hold on the tableau as Victoria enters frame, pushing her way 
      through the crowd towards the body... GRADUALLY, VICTORIA, HER
      GUESTS AND THE BODYDISSOLVE AWAY and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY-- 

    THE BEACH BELOWis now barren and cold on a stark Spring 
      afternoon.  THE CAMERA PANS UP to reveal a charming New England 
      summer home 50 yards inland.  LEGEND: SIX MONTHS EARLIER.WE 
      HEAR a woman s voice with a thick Long Island accent:

                                  REALTOR S VOICE (O.C.)
                    I can t tell you what a rare 
                      opportunity you have here, Miss Thorne.  



      Victoria s bedroom terrace.  Victoria stands at the balcony, 
      face to the morning sun, her attention focused on the house next 
      door.  She watches Emily, who seems to be staring up at her, 
      challenging.  After a beat, Emily surprises Victoria with a 
      small, friendly wave, then heads inside, shuts the sliding door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Looks like Robert and Dianne s 
                    renter is settling in. 

      REVEAL CONRAD at a patio table behind his wife.  He s wearing 
      a golf hat, reading the WSJ.  Victoria does not turn back.

                                  CONRAD
                    Lucky girl, scoring that property.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Pretty one, too, even from up here.

                                  CONRAD
                    Guess that makes her doubly lucky.

    He approaches Victoria at the balcony, hands her her coffee.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I don t believe in luck.

                                  CONRAD
                    Could have been a heavy metal band.

      Touche.  He goes in for a kiss.  She allows it.

                    Ew, get a room you guys--

      They look down to see Charlotte enter the courtyard, holding a 
      pair of heels, looking like she just stumbled out of a club.  

                                  CONRAD
                          (waves over the balcony)
                    Sorry, Charlie, didn t hear you 
                    sneaking up.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201114.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Didn t hear you sneaking out last 
                    night, either, Charlotte.  

      Conrad steps back to the coffee table. 

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    I went over to Tracey s.  I told you I 
                    was going to before you went to bed.

                                  VICTORIA
                    No, you didn t.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Mom, you re too young and too 
                    pretty to be this senile.

    On that, Charlotte slips inside the door.  Conversation over.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Remind me to buy her a cat bell.

                                  CONRAD
                    Aahh, let it slide.  Charlotte got 
                    straight A s this year.

                                  VICTORIA
                    No one s accusing her of being stupid. 

    As Conrad disappears into the bedroom, Victoria returns her 
      attention to Emily s rental, but no one is there.  OFF 
      Victoria s intuitive curiosity--



    CU ON the name  Amanda  painted on the aft of a painstakingly 

      restored three sail vintage schooner.  AN OLD TIMER OF A YELLOW 
    LAB rests happily on deck, chewing on an oversized piece of 
      driftwood.  A palette of food, water, gas cans, etc., is being 
      loaded off the dock and into the boat by Declan Porter, the 17 
      year old bad boy we remember from the opening sequence.  Ben 
      Porter, who we also remember from the opening as the young man 
    on the beach in the blue hoodie, leans against the captain s 
      wheel kissing a pretty girl named MELISSA CONWAY, 25, sweet as 
      they come.  Declan uses his brother s romantic distraction to 
    set aside a case of beer.  When Melissa pulls out of Ben s kiss 
    we see that she s crying.  

                                  MELISSA
                          (her smudged eye make up)
                    Great.  The customers are going to 
                    think I m a basket case.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201115.


    We notice she s holding a green server s apron.  

                                  BEN
                    Why should today be any different?

                                  MELISSA
                    Jerk.

    She appreciates his humor, pulls herself together and kisses him 
    one more time, steps off the boat and heads towards shore.   Ben 
      watches her go with a smile.  Turns his attention to Declan. 

                                  BEN
                    Don t think I didn t see you 
                    eyeballing that case of beer, Dec.  

                                  DECLAN
                    Our parents own a bar, dumb ass, I 
                    can get as much beer as I want.

                                  BEN
                    That case, I ll make sure dad double 
                    checks inventory while I m gone.

    The two boys look to see their kind but tough father, CARL 
      PORTER, approaching.  Ben grins.

                    Dec was just telling me how he s

      Declan hops down, angles off towards the nautical themed bar 
      nestled just beyond the docks.  The Captain s wheel out front 
      reads:  PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN. Carl shakes his head...

                    Going on two, actually.  Don t worry, 
                    still a lot that needs doing.

      Carl smiles at his son with fatherly pride.  Jake starts barking.  
    Ben and Carl turn to see what s bugging him.  It s Nolan Ross in 
      nautical pants and GREEN KEDS, walking up the dock.  

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Looks like tourist season s 
                    officially started...

      Carl just grumbles, heads for shore.  Nolan arrives, tips his 
      ever present Red Sox hat to Ben.  

                                  NOLAN
                    Ahoy, Cap n Porter.  

                                  BEN
                    Welcome back, Nolan.  What can I do 
                    for you?

                                  NOLAN
                    Need a boat for the summer, this 
                    one will do.

                                  NOLAN
                    Who said anything about renting?  
                    How much you want for it?

                                  BEN

                                  NOLAN
                    No, I m terrified of the ocean.  
                    Big difference.  Spent a lot of 
                    time and money working through that 
                    this year, among other things.  So, 
                    I m buying a boat.

                                  BEN
                    Just not this one.

                                  NOLAN
                    You don t like me, do you?

                                  BEN
                    Something else for you to work 
                    through, I guess.
                          (Jake growls at Nolan)
                    Good boy, Jake.

      With that, Ben heads into the hull with an armful of 
      supplies.  Off Jake, growling...

                                  ASHLEY S VOICE
                    The response to your  In With The 
                    New  Memorial Day party has been 
                      overwhelming, Mrs. Grayson.  



      Emily stands ankle deep in the chilly water, watches as the 
      wave recedes and sinks into the sand... WE HEAR THE LAUGHTER 
    OF A LITTLE GIRL and CUT INTO A FLASHBACK...

      YOUNG AMANDA AND HER FATHER CHASE WAVES WITH JAKE, THE PUPPY.

                                  AMANDA
                    Eeeee!  These waves are freezing!

                                  KEVIN
                    There s a trick, you know.  If you 
                    plant your feet and stand still for a 
                    whole wave, the next one will feel 
                    warmer, then the next one after, and 
                    the next one... until you barely 
                    notice the cold at all.  Want to try? 

      Amanda nods, tentatively.  Kevin takes her hand as a wave rolls 
      towards them.  The cold water nips at their ankles.  She 
      squeals, squeezes his hand, but holds her ground...

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (O.C.)
                    Must come from a family of polar bears. 

    AND LIKE THAT, WE SNAP BACK TO PRESENT DAY, WHERE Emily turns 
    to see Lydia Stockwell approaching from behind her.

                                  LYDIA
                    That water s ice cold.

                    I m Lydia Stockwell.  We ll probably 
                    be seeing a lot of each other, I 
                    walk this beach nearly every day.  
                    Not that it does my ass much good.

                    I do believe you re going to fit 
                    right in around here, Emily.  
                    Welcome to the Hamptons.  

      With that, Lydia starts her power-walk along the shoreline.  
    As Emily watches her go, her smile drops.  After a beat, she 
      drops her robe as well, DIVES into the frigid ocean... As she 
      swims out, WE HEAR:

                                  TELEVISION REPORTER (O.S.)
                    All eyes were on Lydia Thomas this 
                    afternoon as the federal government 
                    called its most damning witness yet 
                    against disgraced wall street exec, 
                    Kevin Clarke.



      Emily sips coffee in the lobby-adjacent restaurant, her eyes 
      trained on A MAN checking in at the front desk.

                                  EMILY
                    That depends.  What am I not 
                    killing you for?

                                  ASHLEY
                    The fact that I have to stand you 
                    up this afternoon.  It s been one 
                    fire after the next over here, I m 
                    so sorry.

                                  EMILY
                    You re working, I m sight seeing.  
                    Hardly a capital offense.  Want me 
                    to pick your dress up for you?

                                  ASHLEY

                                  EMILY
                      Absolutely, go, go...

    THE MAN Emily s been watching receives his key, turns around-- 
      it s CONRAD.  He makes a phone call as he waits for the 
      elevator.  When the doors open, he steps in.  A BEAT later, 
      LYDIA enters the lobby from outside, on her phone.  As she 
      slips into the elevator behind Conrad, OFF EMILY...



      Paramedics rush a gurney out of the hotel lobby towards a 
      waiting ambulance.  The man they re tending to is CONRAD, 
      who s clutching his chest in great pain as a PARAMEDIC 
      squeezes an oxygen bag above his mouth.  Rushing along side, 
      holding his hand is Lydia, practically hysterical.

                                  LYDIA
                    One minute he was fine, the next he 
                    couldn t breathe.  

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Is he taking any medications?

                                  LYDIA
                    I m not sure-- 

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Pulse is 100 over 60 and dropping.

                                  LYDIA
                    Is that bad?  Is he going to be okay?

                                  PARAMEDIC
                          (loading him in)
                    Ma am, I need you to step back.  

                                  LYDIA
                    Where are you taking him?

                                  PARAMEDIC
                      Southampton hospital.

    On that, he shuts the doors and the ambulance takes off.

                                  WOMAN S VOICE
                    Lydia?

      Lydia turns to see Emily step out of the crowd that s gathered.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201131.


                                  EMILY
                    It s Emily Thorne.  Was that your 
                    husband?  Do you need a ride to the 
                    hospital?

    ALL EYES ON LYDIA.  She suddenly realizes how vulnerable and 
      conspicuous she is.  

                                  LYDIA
                    No, I don t.  I... I have a car.

    And on that, Lydia turns ankle and motors for the hotel  
      parking lot.  Emily watches as Lydia s brisk pace turns into 
    an all out run.  As the crowd begins to whisper, OFF Emily...



      Emily walks along the bike path with a pink dress in a dry 
      cleaning bag slung over her shoulder.  Jake the dog jogs past, 
      chasing after a piece of driftwood.  By the time he gets 
      there, he s tuckered out.  Sits down and starts chewing on it.  

                                  BEN (O.C.)
                    Whole point of fetch is to bring the 
                    stick back when I throw it, Jake.  I 
                    really gotta explain this again?

      Emily turns to see Ben, about thirty yards away. 

      INSIDE EMILY S MEMORY-- FLASHBACK NINE YEAR OLD AMANDAand 
    her father, Kevin, play in the same spot with Jake, now just 
      a puppy.  Kevin hands Amanda a ball.  

                                  KEVIN
                    Go ahead, throw it.

      Amanda heaves the ball.  

                                    KEVIN/YOUNG AMANDA
                    Go get it, Jake!  Fetch!

    The puppy races off, but not towards the ball.  Instead, he 
      runs up to BEN, now a NINE YEAR OLD BOY, dredging a mud 
      puddle with a stick.  Next to the boy is a fishing pole and a 
      Folger s can full of worms.  Jake splashes into the puddle, 
      starts a tug of war for the stick.  

                                  KEVIN
                    No, Jake!  The ball-- get the ball!

      Young Ben slips in the puddle as Jake zips off with the stick.  
      Amanda and Kevin run over.  As Kevin helps the boy up...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201132.

                                  YOUNG BEN
                    Yeah...

      Kevin chases after the puppy.  Amanda smiles apologetically 
    to Ben as he flicks off the mud.

                                  AMANDA
                    Sorry.

                                  YOUNG BEN
                    S okay.  

                                  AMANDA

                    Ben.  Looks like your dad could use 
                    some help catching your dog.

      Amanda smiles.  And as the two kids run after Kevin, calling 
    for Jake... WE SNAP OUT OF EMILY S FLASHBACK--

                                  EMILY
                          (softly)
                    Jake?

    Old Jake immediately turns to Emily s voice.  Comes bounding 
      over, barking playfully, jumping up on her like he s 
      reuniting with a long lost friend.  Because he is. 

                                  BEN
                    Jake, get down.  What are you doing?

    Ben arrives, pulls Jake off of her.  But not before Jake s 
      knocked the pretty pink dress onto the muddy path.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Jake!  

    Ben bends down to help Emily with the dress.  Jake kisses her 
      face, spins around in a circle.  It s an adorable mess.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    I don t know what s gotten into him, 
                    he s not usually so... friendly.  
                    Kind of an old grump, actually.

      Emily looks up, Ben s eyes are like tractor beams.  He smiles, 
      taken back by her beauty and... something he can t put his finger 
      on... He notices a tear in the garment bag and a stain on the hem.

                                  BEN
                    He got mud on your dress.  

      Their hands touch.  The sensation is electric.    

                                  EMILY
                    It s not my dress... I was picking 
                    it up for a friend.  

                                  BEN
                    Even worse, huh?  There s Sam and 
                    Emma s dry cleaners around the 
                    corner, I ll walk you over.

                    That s okay, I ll find it.

    She starts to march towards town.  Ben keeps up with her.

    She stops, takes control, tries her best to put a stop to it.

                          (firmly)
                    I m sorry, I really have to go.

                                  BEN

                    He feels terrible.  Don t you, Jake.

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks anyway.

                                  BEN
                    All righty, then.  Well, you have a 
                    great summer.

    But Emily is already hustling off, leaving Ben to watch and 
      wonder what might have been.  As she disappears around a 
      corner, OFF Jake whimpering...



      Emily rounds the corner, shaken by the unexpected run in with 
      Ben.  She leans against a wall, takes a deep breath...



      Cross-fading pastel lights dance off the billowing satin 
      ribbons draped above the hip and sophisticated looking patio.  
      Subtle ambient club music creates a feeling of instant cool. 

      ANGLE ON EMILY AND ASHLEY about halfway up the terrace stairs 
    on the first landing.  Ashley is pointing out various guests.

                                  ASHLEY
                    See that girl in the one of a kind 
                    Jimmy Choos?  That s Ellen 
                    Bloomberg, Mayor Bloomberg s niece.  
                    The woman she s talking to?  Now 
                    this one s important, Megan Foster, 
                    shoe buyer for Barney s New York. 

                                  EMILY
                    What s with the mafia looking guy  
                    at the oyster bar?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Actual mafia, steer clear... 

                                  EMILY
                    Any regular people?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Just us.  And hopefully that cutie 
                    I may or may not be crushing on.

      Ashley points out Tyler, by the bar.  Tyler spies Ashley spying 
      him, play acts being struck in the heart by cupid s arrow.  

                                  EMILY
                    Looks like it may or may not be 
                    mutual.  Who is he?

                                  ASHLEY
                    One of Daniel Grayson s Harvard 
                    pals.  Which should be a red flag.

                    Looks like he walked away okay.

                    Much better than the waitress in

                          (then, spotting someone)
                    And the plot thickens...

      ANGLE ON NOLAN ROSS,taking a video of the party...

                                  EMILY
                    Who is he?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Nolan Ross, former tech boom whiz 
                    kid and perennial pain in the ass.  
                    If you emptied the bank accounts of 
                    everyone at this party, it wouldn t 
                    add up to the interest his makes in 
                    a week.  Thinks the rules don t 
                    apply to him, and he s right.

    As Emily watches Nolan, we enter one of Emily s FLASHBACKS--



    The blonde girl exits the holding area, now in street 
      clothes, carrying the only possessions she entered with: her 
      sketch book and art supplies.

      Amanda turns to see a geeky version of Nolan (now mid 20s).

                                  NOLAN
                    Not exactly how your father 
                    described you.

                                  AMANDA
                    My father hasn t seen me in eight 
                    years.  Who are you?

                                  NOLAN
                    The only friend either one of you 
                    seem to have.  Happy birthday.

      Nolan hands her a sealed envelope that reads:  FOR AMANDA ON 
    HER 18th BIRTHDAY  underscored by TWIN INFINITY SIGNS.  OFF

      EMILY S WORLD GOES INTO SLOW MOTION.  She watches Victoria 
      weave through the party like a snake through an overgrown 
      garden.  Greeting and moving on, greeting and moving on.  Her 
    eye finds the girls.  Cocks her head curiously at Emily.

                    Conrad, may I steal you a moment?

      Conrad excuses himself and they step to a private area.

                    Today was just too... awful.  I 
                    wanted to go with you to the

                                  CONRAD
                    Trust me, it s a good thing you didn t.  
                    Besides, I m fine.  

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t think I can do this 
                    anymore.  It s not fair to any one 
                    of us, least of all, Victoria--

      Karrie Thurgood, Lydia s frienemy from the planning session 
      notes the hushed voices, can t help but satisfy her curiosity. 

                                  KARRIE
                    What are you two doing hiding in the

                                  CONRAD
                    No one s hiding from anyone, Karrie.

                                  KARRIE
                    Rumor has it you really dodged a

                    Well I m thrilled to hear it.  I ll

                    I m sure you will.  Looks like you 
                    could use another drink.  Would you 
                    show Karrie to the bar, darling?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201143.

                    Can t think of anything I d rather do.

      Conrad nods to Lydia, takes Karrie s empty glass and leads 
    her off.  Victoria gives Lydia the  hate her  eyebrows, but 
      Lydia isn t her usual playfully snarky self.

                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    I had no idea you were even here, 
                    why didn t you come find me?

                                  LYDIA

                    Are you all right?  You don t seem 
                    yourself.

      Lydia is torn.  Hates that she s deceiving her best friend, 
    but can t see a way out.  Before she can respond, they hear:

                                  ASHLEY (O.S.)
                    Mrs. Grayson?

                    Hello, Mrs. Grayson.  I m 
                      embarrassed to say I showed up 
                    uninvited, but Ashley put so much  
                    effort into your party, I just had

                    give generously.

      Ashley squeezes Emily s elbow with a smile, exits.

                    I will.  Thank you.

                    And then this afternoon in Montauk.  
                    I hope your husband s feeling better.

    And there it is.  Victoria looks to Lydia, who is looking over 
    at Conrad at the bar.  All at once, Victoria understands the 
      magnitude of her betrayal.  Turns to Emily, the messenger...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Excuse me.

                    Victoria, wait...

    But Victoria has no interest in hearing Lydia s explanation.  
      Victoria disappears into the party, grabs Conrad and leads him 
    up the terrace stairs.  Lydia simultaneously splits off in the 
      other direction, panic-stricken.  OFF EMILY and her plan...

      Nolan and Ben sit at a table on Ben s boat.  Ben is holding 
      tight to the brass compass his father gave him, practically 
      white knuckling it as Nolan cuts a check.  Jake growls.  Nolan 
      notes the party at the Stowaway.

                                  NOLAN
                    Sounds like quite the local 
                    shindig.  What s the occasion? 

                                  BEN
                    Going away party.

      Nolan hands him the check.  Ben pockets the compass.

                                  NOLAN
                    Oh yeah?  Who s getting out?

                                  BEN
                    No one, anymore.

    Ben signs the deed to the boat, hands it to Nolan. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Dog included?

                                  BEN
                    Dog stays with me.  I ll have my 
                    stuff cleared out by morning.

    As Nolan steps off, he notes the name painted on the stern.  
      Smiles, curiously...

                                  NOLAN
                    Why dyou name her Amanda?  
                          (Ben doesn t answer)
                    If I m gonna own her, I oughta know 
                    the story.

                                  BEN
                    Just a girl I knew once.  

                                  NOLAN

                                  BEN
                    That s it.  Take care of her.

    And as Ben and his dog head below deck, we linger with Nolan--



                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The week before my father was 
                    killed, he asked me to make him one 
                    last promise... 

      Amanda, early 20s, wearing black, exits the gates with her 
      father s personal effects, including a hand made wooden box 
      forged in prison, the twin infinity signs branded on top.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... That I would lead the life he 
                    had always wanted for me, walk away 
                    from my anger, and find a way to 
                    forgive the people who destroyed us.

    She opens the box and a photograph flutters out.  A picture of 
    the two of them when she was a little girl, laughing on the 
      beach, squeezing Jake on a warm summer day.  She notices a 
      loose panel under the lid of the box-- a secret compartment.  
      Amanda pulls away the panel, discovers a worn, folded 
      photograph of a large group of people on a Hawaiian vacation, 
      posing happily in front of a banner that reads:  GRAYSON 
      GLOBAL EXECUTIVE RETREAT - 1995  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But that was a promise I couldn t keep.

    OFF Amanda, her face streaked with tears of rage and loss... 



      Emily stands on the docks outside the bar, looking in the 
      tavern windows at Ben with his family and friends.  He s 
      telling something important to Melissa.  Melissa kisses him, 
      pulls him into a supportive hug.  Emily turns away, walks 
      down the dock until she sees the name  Amanda  painted 

      lovingly on the aft of a schooner.  She kneels to touch it, 
    all the gentle memories of her childhood surging forth.  
      JAKE, THE DOG, COMES UP FROM BELOW DECK, BARKS HAPPILYat 
      Emily.  From inside the bar, Ben hears the commotion.  But 
      when he comes out to check, Emily is nowhere to be seen...

                                  BEN 
                    What is it boy?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201160.


    But for now, that question will go unanswered.  As Ben looks 
    out towards the ocean, THE CAMERA GLIDES OUT over the dark 
    and forbidding sea as Emily s voice over continues...

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    My father died a true prisoner.  An 
                    innocent man, reviled and unforgiven.



      Victoria stands on her terrace, staring down at the light from 
      Emily s beach house, the cool ocean breeze whipping around her.
