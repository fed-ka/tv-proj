We look over the modest skyline of downtown Kansas City.

CUT TO:


Todd is riding in an auto-rickshaw taxi with RAJIIV, the 
assistant manager.  They both have mango-lassis, but 
  traffic. go and stop the of because them drink can t
Todd is going over how he wants the office to run.

TODD
...It s also really important how 
we deal with setbacks.  This is 
the way I see it: all obstacles 
are opportunities in disguise.

RAJIIV
Then you have come to the right 
place.  This is the land of 
opportunities.6.

Rajiiv gestures out to the overwhelming chaos that is the 
Indian street.  Todd, not sure if Rajiiv is being ironic, 
glances outside.  The taxi abruptly stops and BEGGARS 
approach.  Todd turns and sees a SADHU (an old man 
wearing only a loin cloth) just outside the window, 
extending his hand to Todd.

TODD
(turning away)
Okay, thanks for that visual.
(then)
You know, I d give him money if he 
promised to buy a robe.

RAJIIV
Actually, he is a Sadhu.

TODD
A what?

RAJIIV
A Sadhu, a self-professed holy 
man.  They give up all material 
possessions and wander the earth 
living on the handouts of 
strangers.  Do you have Sadhus in 
America?

TODD
Yeah.  We call them homeless.

The taxi lurches forward again.

RAJIIV
Oh, before we arrive, I took the 
liberty of having name tags made.

 CALL AMERICA  MID labeled tags name two out takes Rajiiv
CENTER.   Printed below is their name and title.  

TODD
Look at that.   TODD DONOVAN: 
MANAGER.   Thank you, Rajiiv.  
Thank you very much.

RAJIIV
My pleasure, sir.

Todd notices that Rajiiv s tag reads  RAJIIV GIDWANI: 
MANAGER. 

TODD
Yours says manager too.7.

RAJIIV
(laughing)
You are most perceptive.  I can 
see that I will not be pulling the 
wool over your eyes, unless you 
are very cold and ask me to.

TODD
Why does yours say manager too?

RAJIIV
I am simply planning ahead.  You 
see, after you return to America, 
I will become the manager of the 
call center.  I thought to myself, 
why print a name-tag which says 
 Assistant Manager  when it is 
only a matter of time before you 
triumph here and make a glorious 
homecoming.

TODD
You got it all planned out, huh?

RAJIIV
Indeed, I do.  When I become 
manager, my salary will increase 
enough so that I will be able to 
move out of my parents  house and 
finally marry Vimi.

TODD
Wait.  You still live with your 
parents?

RAJIIV
This is not America.  We do not 
all have deluxe apartments in the 
sky.

TODD
No way.  You get  The Jeffersons  
over here? 
(half singing)
 WELL WE RE MOVING ON UP, TO THE 
SKY.  TO A DELUXE APARTMENT...
(with less commitment 
 look Rajiiv s to due
of confusion)
...in the sky-aye-aye.   Never 
mind.

RAJIIV
Things are different here.  
Children live with their parents 
until they marry.  
(MORE)8.

RAJIIV (CONT'D)
And I cannot marry Vimi until I am 
a manager.  Her family is most 
prestigious.

TODD
Let me get this straight; you 
can t move out of your parents  
house or get married until I get 
promoted back to America?

RAJIIV
It seems our fates are tied, sir.  
Your triumphs are my triumphs.  
Your victories are my victories.
(then)
We need a victory!

Rajiiv meant this to be inspirational, but it came off as 
desperation.  Rajiiv and Todd look away and try to sip 
their lassi drinks.  The taxi abruptly comes to a stop 
again and beggars approach.  Todd turns to see a Sadhu 
just outside the window holding out his hand.

TODD
Is that the same guy?

RAJIIV
Sir, it would be offensive to 
imply that all Indians looked 
alike simply because we-- 
(realizing)
Oh no, that s the same guy.  He s 
fast.

CUT TO:


A large commissary is filled with CALL CENTER EMPLOYEES 
sitting at several tables.  Todd, with a tray, is making 
his way down the food line.  Following him on the other 
side of the counter is an Indian LUNCH-MAN.  As Todd eyes 
a particular food, the Lunch-Man dips in his ladle.  When 
Todd changes his mind and moves on, the Lunch-Man removes 
the ladle and moves on as well.

TODD
(mumbling to himself)
Don t know what that is.
(then)
Don t know what that is.
(then)
A little scared of that.
(up to the Lunch-Man)
Soupy.  Everything s soupy.
 Lunch-Man s the (off
blank expression)
Okay.  You know what?  I m gonna 
be in India a while.  I don t know 
what s what but I gotta learn 
somehow, right?  So, just give me 
some of...that.

Todd points at a tray of soupy food and the Lunch-Man 
starts to ladle it onto Todd s plate.

LUNCH-MAN
(in Hindi)
Mirchi ka salan.15.

TODD
Oh yeah, of course.  My Mom used 
to make the best mirchi ka sa-
lamalama-dingdong.

Todd chuckles.  The Lunch-man just stares back at him.  
Todd steps away to find a seat.  As he walks among the 
tables, Todd faces the high school cafeteria dilemma of 
where to sit.  He comes upon a table of his employees.  
(They are chatting in English except for Midori, who 
studies the catalogue as she eats.)  There is an empty 
seat among them.  Their conversation stops and they look 
at Todd, neither inviting him nor shunning him, just 
 spots Todd  them. join to going he s whether wondering
 big, one for except empty that s nearby table another
sweaty American, CHARLIE DAVIES.

CHARLIE
You American?

TODD
Yeah.

CHARLIE

Then saddle up.

TODD
Oh, thanks.  Thanks a lot.

CHARLIE
Charlie Davies.  I run the call 
center for Orvis.

TODD
Todd Donovan.  I m running the 
call center for Mid America 
Novelty.  Just started today.

CHARLIE

disapproving)
Yeah, that s what I figured.

TODD
What?

Charlie looks at Todd s food and shakes his head.

TODD (CONT D)
What?16.

CHARLIE
You got the pepper thing.

TODD
So?

CHARLIE
Do you hate your own ass?  

TODD
Really?  Is it that spicy?

CHARLIE
If you eat that, you will be 
crapping yourself for five days.  
Not two days.  Not three days.  
Not four days and some...
(sound effects of 
small farts)
talking... I m
(holding up his hand, 
extending five 
fingers)
Five full days.

TODD
Okay.

CHARLIE
That s a hate crime against your 
pooper.

TODD
Got it.

Todd pushes his plate away.  Charlie offers him half of 
his sandwich.

CHARLIE
Here, take half.

TODD
Peanut butter and jelly?

CHARLIE
Jiffy peanut butter and Smucker s  
grape jelly.  And check this out:
(re: his food)
Cheetos, Dill pickles, a Hostess 
cupcake, and my back-up sandwich, 
Honey-Glazed ham and good old 
American cheese.  As far as I m 
concerned, you re not a world 
power until you have a cheese 
named after your country.17.

TODD
So, the superpowers are us, the 
Swiss, and...?

CHARLIE
I m not into politics, okay?

TODD
Okay.  Where did you buy all this 
stuff?

CHARLIE
I have it shipped from home.  If 
I m gonna be sentenced to this 
sweat-box of a country, I ll be 
damned if I m eating their Mickey-
Mouse food.

They eat for a beat.  Todd glances over at his employees.

TODD
Hey, can I ask something about my 
workers?

CHARLIE
Shoot.

TODD
My budget isn t that big, but 
still, my guys don t exactly seem 
like the cream of the crop.

Charlie looks over Todd s employees.

CHARLIE
Yeah, they probably don t know 
squat about America.  Probably 
never been outside the city.  
Looks like you got the  B  team, 
my friend.

TODD
How can you tell?

CHARLIE
Because that s the  A  team over 
there.

Charlie indicates a group of sharply dressed Indians 
sitting down to lunch.

(CONT D) CHARLIE
Those guys work for Intell s call 
center.  They ve all been to 
America.  They ve even studied all 
our different accents.18.

TODD
No way.

An  A  team Indian crosses by to purchase a drink.

CHARLIE
Hey, you.

INDIAN TEAM  A 
(with his usual 
Indian accent)
Yes, what is it?

CHARLIE
Tell me something.  Do you know 
what grits are?

INDIAN TEAM  A 
(in a perfect 
southern accent)
Well, grits is just ground up 
corn.  I tell you what, my Momma 
used to make the best grits.

CHARLIE
Alright.

INDIAN TEAM  A 
(continuing in the 
southern accent)
I d be settin  on the porch with 
my hound dog  Freedom --

CHARLIE
Alright, enough.
(waving him off)
It s creepy, isn t it?  Like 
they re pod people or something.

TONYA, an athletic, statuesque blonde, enters.  Todd 
 commissary the down moves she as watch but help can t
line.  Charlie notices this and nods.

(CONT D) CHARLIE
Yeah, that s Tonya.  She runs the 
Quantas call center.  That s some 
grade  A  Aussie right there.

TODD
She s...

CHARLIE
I m with you on that, my friend.  
They got that accent and they re 
all so big and outdoorsy; God I 
love Australian women!19.

Tonya turns to find a place to sit.  She notices Todd 
staring at her and he turns away.

TODD
story? her what s So

CHARLIE
Don t waste your time, man.  I ve 
seen her here for eight months and 
she hasn t said two words to me.

Todd looks up, surprised to see that Tonya has approached 
demeanor. affable her by surprised more even He s  him.

TONYA
I m guessing you re a new bloke.

TODD
Yeah, first day actually.  Todd.

TONYA
I m Tonya.  Just thought I d say 
hi.  I m a bit of a yabber, so 
drop by Quantas if you want.  You 
need all the mates you can find 
out here in Woop woop.

TODD
Woop woop?

TONYA
Sorry, that s Aussie for out in 
the middle of nowhere.  I think 
you Yanks say out in the sticks.

TODD
I like woop woop better.  It s fun 
to say.  Woop woop.

TONYA
Right.  Cheers.

Tonya smiles and walks away to sit with her workers.  
Charlie has watched this exchange and is speechless and 
dying inside.  When Todd turns back from watching Tonya 
walk away, he notices Asha looking at him.  Evidently, 
she watched Todd and Tonya speaking.  But before Todd can 
get a read on Asha s expression, she looks away.

CUT TO:20.


MUSIC PLAYS as we look over a massive city which spreads 
as far as the eye can see.  The MUSIC FADES as we...

CUT TO:


The tables are filled with call center employees.  Todd 
is paying for his food when Tonya passes by.

TONYA
So you survived another day.

TODD
Yeah.  Looks like you re stuck 
with me for a while.

Tonya smiles and leaves to join her crew.  Todd turns 
with his tray and scans the tables for a place to sit.  
 He  again. himself by who s Charlie, with eyes meets He
also sees a table of his workers (without Rajiiv).  This 
time, however, they are pleased to see him and Asha waves 
for him to join them.  Todd grins.  He crosses by Charlie 
workers. his with sit to going he s indicate to nods and

TODD (CONT D)
Just for morale, you know.

CHARLIE
Go for it.

Todd crosses to sit with his workers but we stay behind.  
 be to happy chatting, Todd see we POV, Charlie s From
with his people.  MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY and it feels like 
the end of the episode.  Manmeet slides a plate of food 
towards Todd and Todd takes a bite.  The MUSIC ABRUPTLY 
STOPS.  Todd looks up to see Charlie staring at him, 
shaking his head.  Charlie holds up his hand just like he 
did in the previous commissary scene, extending all five 
fingers.  Todd gets his meaning and glances down to see 
he s been eating the mirchi ka salan.  SFX: AN UPSET 
STOMACH GROWLING.  MUSIC RESUMES OVER THE CREDITS, BUT 
OCCASIONALLY PAUSES FOR THE SOUND OF AN INCREASINGLY 
DISTRESSED STOMACH.
