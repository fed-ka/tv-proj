      EXT. HANCOCK PARK - BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - NIGHT11

      Establish Brazilian Consulate... two flags by the door: 
      American and Brazilian. CAMERA MOVES INSIDE --  Production 
      Note:  The Consulate has one security camera on the exterior - 
      in front of the building and another camera inside, on the 
      front door/foyer (CAMS 1 and 2).  All consulate security 
      cameras are small  bubble  cams. 

22INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - MAIN HALL/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT 

      Beautiful old world -- CAMERA MOVES UP A STAIRCASE and finds  
      Security Agent MITCH YUSON (30s, military, wears a suit), 
      making the rounds.  Ahead: a hallway secured by laser grids 
      and motion detectors.  Production Note:  There is a security 
      camera in this hall (CAM 3).

      Yuson inserts an ID card into a keypad and presses his 
      thumbprint against a biometric sensor.  A positive ID starts 
      a disarming process: BEEP.  5... 4... 3... 2... 1...   

      The laser grid disappears, the motion sensors shut down and 
      as Yuson enters the hallway, we see what the heavy security 
      is about: priceless artifacts from around the world - wall 
      paintings, exotic sculptures and encased jewels.  

      Yuson arrives at the end of the hallway, reactivates the 
      security system and walks off.  BEEP.  5...    

      TILT UP TO REVEAL --  

      Through the skylight above him, an ominous masked figure 
      stares down.  This is SILENT MASK. 

      OFF suction cups being attached to glass --           NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     2. 



      INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - MAIN HALL - MOMENTS LATERA3A3

      Silent Mask rappels down on a cord (wearing a sport back 
      pack)... racing the five seconds as he moves to the alarm 
      keypad and connects a wrist/PDA... He keys a code, blocking 
      the security initiation: Alarm Canceled.  

      A second figure - SILENT MASK 2 (SM2) slides down the cord.  
      He eyes a wall painting, salivating, but Silent Mask motions-  

                                  SILENT MASK
                    Not what we re here for.

      OFF Silent Mask resuming his hacking into the security 
      system...

      INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT33

      Mitch Yuson before a 40  LCD split into (6-9) screen panels 
      (black and white images). One monitor s image goes to static, 
      causing Yuson to zero in.  PRODUCTION NOTE: We see a rack of 
      shotguns behind Yuson. 

                                  MITCH YUSON
                    What the... 

      The next monitor does the same.  Every monitor goes to 
      static...

      Yuson quickly grabs a phone as-

      INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - NIGHT44

      Silent Mask s wrist/PDA blinks a message: Security Cameras 
      and Phones Disabled.  Silent Mask detaches the PDA from the 
      alarm keypad and moves down the hallway.  SM2 follows.  

      Silent Mask moves past the art and jewelry...

      INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUSA5A5

      ...down a staircase... doesn t see -- Production Note:  There 
      is a Consulate security camera (CAM 4) on this staircase.

                                  MITCH YUSON (O.S.)
                    Don t move!

      ON Mitch Yuson-

      Aiming a 12 gauge shotgun at Silent Mask!  Ready to shoot.

                    Hands in the air and face the wall!

      Silent Mask doesn t move.  Instead, he looks past the unaware 
      Mitch Yuson- 

      -at SM2 who moves up from behind.  Yuson senses it, starts to 
      turn (taking his aim away from Silent Mask)-

      -but SM2 hits him with a taser!  Yuson s shotgun BLASTS out, 
        obliterating a vase of flowers before he drops.  OFF the 
      Silent Mask Crew, no one in their way... 

55EXT./INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - DAY (45 MIN LATER) 

      A crime scene now:  LAPD and FOUR DS AGENTS (Diplomatic 
      Security).  DON and DAVID walk up, met by DS Special Agent 
      BROWNER DUNN (50s, old military, in a suit like Mitch Yuson).  
      Production Note:  As they walk and talk, we MOVE with them 
      from outside to inside of the Consulate.

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    Browner Dunn, Diplomatic Security.  
                    Thanks for responding.  

                                  DON
                    Looks like you have it covered.   

                                  DAVID
                    Rooftop entrance, hacked security 
                    system...  Seems like a hi-tech B&E.  

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    The Brazilian Consulate holds 2 
                    Andrades, a Portinaris and a diamond 
                      collection that rivals DeBeers.  None 
                    of it was touched.  

                                  DON
                    Maybe your guy scared the thieves 
                    away. Who was on duty?

      Browner Dunn lifts a blown up PHOTO of Mitch Yuson-

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    Yuson.  He was gone when we got here.

                    Been ninety minutes since he last 
                    checked in.

                                  DAVID
                    Any chance he was in on it? 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     4.

                    Not likely.  Guy s a boy scout. 

66INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

      Don, David and Browner Dunn watch recorded surveillance on a 
      monitor.  Like before, the footage goes to static.

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    They took out the main cameras...

                                  DAVID
                    Whoever they are, they have a blueprint on 
                    how to beat a biometric security system...

      NIKKI enters with a laptop...

                                  NIKKI
                    ...but hopefully not an attention to detail. 
                              (then)
                    I checked with the neighbors.  Their 
                    garage camera covers the hall window.

      Nikki plugs the laptop into a monitor, cues different 
      footage...  PRODUCTION NOTE:  We see footage on both the 
      laptop and the main monitor. 

      ON THE LAPTOP -  Distorted images through a window: the 
      standoff between Mitch Yuson (the Security Agent) and the 
      Silent Mask Crew.  Yuson s dropped by tasers and carried 
      (fireman s) off camera, disappearing down a side corridor... 
      (Note: The camera isn t trained on the window - it captures 
      the window while covering the neighbor s property) 

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    That s Yuson...

                                  NIKKI
                    ...But there s more.

      Nikki fast forwards and we see...

      ON THE LAPTOP - The Silent Mask Crew exits the side corridor, 
      walking in the opposite direction - NO SIGN of Mark Yuson...

                                  DON
                    So where d they leave him?          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     4A. 



      INT. BRAZILIAN CONSULATE - POOL ROOM HALLWAY - DAY77

      Browner Dunn in tow, Don, David and Nikki trace the path of 
      the Silent Mask Crew, looking for Yuson behind a door, under 
      a pool table... 

                                  DAVID
                    According to the footage, this is the 
                    only place they could have gone. 

      ...finding that the corridor has a dead end.

                                  DON
                    A dead end? 

                                  NIKKI
                    They couldn t have made Yuson 
                      disappear.

      CONTINUED:77

                                  DAVID
                    Is there something here they were 
                    after? 

      Nikki moves past a giant (floor to ceiling) painting.  Stops.

                                  NIKKI 
                    This painting is speaking to me.

                                  DON
                             (wry)
                    Really.

                                  NIKKI
                    No, listen...

      Everyone listens.  Faint taps are heard from behind the wall 
      painting, along with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF A HUMAN VOICE...

                                  DON
                    Is there a way to roll this thing back? 

      David and Nikki look for hidden levers.  Nikki flips light 
      switches.  David checks a line of books.  He discovers: 

      A mounted bust.  Slightly crooked.  He adjusts it.  The huge 
      painting rolls back to reveal...  

      A HIDDEN VAULT DOOR...  Browner Dunn s as stunned as anyone.   

                                  NIKKI
                            (to David) 
                    How d you...

                                  DAVID
                             (shrugs)
                    Worked for Batman.  

                                  DON
                    Can t be much air in that vault...

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    Looks like a Voice Recognition 
                    trigger lock.  

      ANGLE ON - The vault s sophisticated looking trigger lock (a 
      mic device joined with a digital sound wave display screen).

                                  DAVID
                    FASR.  Quantico s testing this.  Lock

                    these guys will stand in line for 
                    days for a pair of  kicks.

                    they re something special.

                    Thieves aren t complicated.  Someone 
                    hired them, or they re heading for

1414EXT. UNDEFEATED - DAY 

      David and Nikki exit a Charger.  As they approach (passing 
      other cars), we see and hear-

      Hip-hop BOOMING from the store sound system.  A diverse line 
      (30 people) of SNEAKERHEADS spills out of the front door: 

      Asian Hipsters, Blond Super Models, Middle Aged Businessmen, 
      Homies from Crenshaw.  Everyone admiring each other s kicks.    
      PRODUCTION NOTE:  The people in line should be festive, 
      excited.  Girls putting wristbands on guys.  People comparing 
      shoes, debating, etc...

                    Who knew shoes could bring the world

                    Just don t step on anyone s feet.

      A BEASTIE BOY WANNA-BE line organizer (17, hip hop skater) 
      with a clipboard steps in their way. 

                                    BEASTIE BOY
                    Whoa, whatsup?  If you re here for 
                    the Primers bracelets, get in line. 

      He points to the end of the line.  Nikki and David badge him.

                    Once the first pair got auctioned for 
                    crazy money, the demand for these 
                    must have gone through the roof.  

      Beastie Boy nods yes.  Checks Nikki out.

1515INT. UNDEFEATED - DISPLAY ROOM - DAY   

      Urban chic.  Three CUSTOMERS gaze at high-end sneakers on 
      wall mantles.  A plasma flat screen plays a promo piece about 
      the Primers-   

      ON PLASMA TV - Clips featuring Primers sneakers rotating in 
      air and looking cool with the logo.  Stock footage of 
      basketball players. 

      David and Nikki talk to LA-LA BUENDIA (20s, hot in designer 
      sneakers and sweats).  

                                  NIKKI
                    Nespola says no one was supposed to 
                    know the identity of the winning 
                    bidder.

                                  LA-LA BUENDIA
                    This was an auction for the First 
                    Pair of the Final Edition Primers.  
                    Word was gonna get out, regardless. 
                               (then)  
                    Plus, who cares?  Nespola s a jerk.

                                  DAVID
                    Any idea who stole his shoes?

                    Nespola froze his auction payment 
                    until the shoes are found.  That s no 
                      commission for me.  On a quarter 
                    million dollar sale, you do the

                    Thing about Nespola winning the 
                    auction, is that everyone else lost.

                                  NIKKI

                    Denver is lucky to have you.  It s a

                    You know what they say.  Urban nomads 
                    are the last adventurers.  Before I

1919EXT. FIFTH STREET - NIGHT 

      Skid Row.  Two black and whites.  Two Chargers.  A coroner s 
      van.  LAPD (2) and 2 DETECTIVES (using flashlights).  Yellow 
      tape.  David and Nikki approach.

                                  DAVID
                    Just saying, I don t even wear Buster

                                  DAVID
                    Probably not.

      They re met by DET. CATES (40s, large).  He greets Nikki.

                                  NIKKI
                    Hey, Cates...  This is David 
                    Sinclair.

                                  DET. CATES
                    Saw your name on the alerts for that 
                    Consulate heist.  You gotta check 
                    this out.

      Cates leads them past HOMELESS LOOKY-LOOS...

      ...into an alley strewn with trash and homeless camps 
      (heating stations for food, tents, etc.)...

      David looks to Nikki - where s this leading?

      ...arriving at a DEAD BODY UNDER A CORONER S SHEET. 

                                  DET. CATES (cont d)
                    Guy runs through here, gets this.

      Cates lifts the sheet to reveal...

      ...the face of a dead ALBANIAN MAN (50s).  One SHOT to the 
      temple.  David s baffled.

                                  DAVID
                    And, how does this connect to us?  

      Cates lifts the other end of the sheet to see...   

      THE ALBANIAN S FEET - The left foot is bare - no sock.  The 
      right foot is sporting a Final Edition Primers sneaker. 
      (Production Note: these shoes look exactly like the stolen 
      pair from Nespola s binder).

                                  DAVID
                    Okay...  But who gets jacked for one 
                    shoe?

      OFF David and Nikki over a dead Albanian with one sneaker,

2020EXT. FIFTH STREET - NIGHT  

      Now a crime scene.  The Primers Sneaker is sealed into an 
      evidence bag.  The Albanian s body is rolled by, into the 
      coroner s van... 

      LAPDx4 and FBI search bushes (using flashlights), sewer 
      grates and garbage dumpsters.  David and Nikki compare notes.  
      PRODUCTION NOTE: The Albanian s tatoos should read (without 
      the parenthesis translation): Kurre hap rugge ( Never Yield ) 
      and Gjak e armes ( Blood and Guns ).

                    He argued with our dead guy before 
                    chasing him down here - literally 
                    chased him out of his shoe...

                    Dead guy got dead.  First thing the 
                    shooter went for was his shoe.  A 
                    crowd of Looky-Loos scared him off 
                    before he could get it.

                    And he dropped his gun.  Forensics is

      ON HOMELESS LOOKY-LOOS pushing carts full of junk.

      Nikki s cell phone RINGS.  She picks up -

                    I made money.  But all good things

                    Then again, a rendezvous with two

                    Stories about biometric security.

      Stephanois looks like he just tasted something foul.

                    Which is why I embrace the peace and

                                  NIKKI
                    According to Interpol, you adjusted

      Jean Stephanois nods, annoyed by the reference.

                                  JEAN STEPHANOIS
                    Taking the life savings of soccer 
                    moms was a tad banal.

                    Is that why you switched it up again - 
                    lifting sneakers from Randall Nespola?

      Stephanois scoffs, insulted by the accusation.

                    Last night, I had dinner with my parole

                    I read about that.  The shoes washed 
                    up on shores from Oregon to Hawaii in 
                    a pattern depending on the brand and 
                    whether they were left or rights.

      Run down neighborhood.  Old storefronts.  An abandoned 
      warehouse with a Real Estate Sign (Banana Stand Realty).

      Abandoned space.  Dusty tarp, old boxes, broken glass and 
      squatter s remnants.  Nikki enters with a folder.  La-La 
      Buendia is with a BUSINESS LOAN OFFICER, who leaves as Nikki 
      approaches.

                    We need to know if either of these 
                    faces look familiar.

      PRODUCTION NOTE: We DO NOT see what the boxes contained.  We 
      simply see tossed boxes and discarded packing tissue.

                    Then start confessing.

                    Diddums stole a pair of Final Edition 
                    Primers from some rich guy.  We paid

                    So, why was Diddums at the warehouse

                    The Primers Zetroc had on his feet 
                    were knockoffs, too.  He came back

      Liz hauls ass past car parts and vehicles...

      ON DIDDUMS -- slides off the hood of a car -- as he sprints 
      off... increasing the distance between him and Liz --

      Diddums dashes down an alleyway... 

      A FIRE ESCAPE LADDER UP AHEAD is all that stands between him 
      and freedom...

      Diddums reaches the ladder... begins to climb -- when -- 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     46.

      CLOSE ON -- a hand, grabs him sneaker/ankle -- 

      And SLAMS HIM TO THE PAVEMENT.

      Diddums looks up at the looming figure of David...

                                  DAVID
                    Got my running shoes on today.

      Diddums knows better and gives up.

      Liz catches up as Diddums stands and David cuffs him.

                    Primers what?

      Diddums smiles defiantly.  David searches his clothes.  Finds 
      a cell phone - tosses it to Liz.  Finds a roll of bills...   

                                  DAVID
                    Lot of cash.

                    Found it under my pillow... 

      Liz checks the call log on his cell.

                                  LIZ
                    He erased his call history.

                    Don t bother looking at the SIM chip, 
                    either.  I torched that, too. 

                                  DAVID
                    Learn that from your uncle?

      David places his hands on the wall to cuff him, notices...

      ...there s a PHONE NUMBER scribbled in ink.  David looks to

      out for Diddums (and us) to hear: 

      THE MUSICAL JINGLE ON A VOICEMAIL - a bad hip hop song with 
      the hook  You gotta be a Bit O' Nutz In This World ...  

      Diddums is gonna be sick.

                    Why would Vic Moritz give you his

4242EXT. VIC MORITZ S MANSION - POOLHOUSE - DAY 

      Don and Nikki approach Vic Moritz (in robe and sneakers).  He 
      seems to have been waiting for them impatiently...

                    Well, there s gotta be something we 
                    can work out.  Some autographed CDs?

      INSIDE THE VAULT

      There are definitely no Primers - because there are no shoes:  
      EVERY PAIR IN MORITZ S COLLECTION IS GONE.

                    Normally I chase people in sneakers,

                    Diddums is in custody and we searched

                    Moritz could have hidden his

                    Techs say a torch was used to open 
                    the vault.  They also found a point 
                    of entry - a broken window in the

                    Maybe the thief knows how to fence

                                  LARRY
                    What we know - the market value of

                    might be interested in them.

                    giving us a third factor - the most 
                    likely buyer.  Everyone plays 
                      pinball...  

      ENTER AUDIENCE VISION

      We re inside of a pinball machine - flashy lights, springs 
      and levers.  A PLUNGER shoves the pinball onto the playfield.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     51.

      All flipper doors are open, so the ball can go anywhere...  

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    Think of the Primers as a pinball.  
                    The number of interested buyers is 
                    already limited.  The level of risk 
                    involved with purchasing the shoes 
                    tells us where the bumpers are. *

      The pinball rolls toward a flipper, but it closes, rerouting 
      the ball as it ricochets violently.  The flippers and bumpers 
      morph into obstacles - police, thieves, etc.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    And with the Primers, extremely high *
                    priced, high profiled and high risk 
                      considering they re stolen property...

      Eventually, all flippers close, forcing the pinball to roll 
      back home, settling beside the plunger.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    ...the number of possible avenues - 
                    of possible buyers - considering all 
                    factors - becomes extremely limited.

                    In fact, the buyer with the least 
                    amount of risk and greatest ability 
                    to purchase is also the person we 
                    might least expect.

                    You re right.  But the Primers are 
                    coming with us, which means they ll 
                    be in evidence...

                                  DON

                    while they re there.  Some of the 
                    stories I ve heard about evidence...

      Nespola looks like a broken man.  Finally, he relents, sets 
      down his pool stick...

                    You gonna make your auction payment?

      Nespola realizes he has little choice...

                    No scuffs on the shoes, please?  Make 
                    sure whoever handles them in evidence 
                    knows what they re doing.  Keep them

      Don, Nikki and Nespola walk out -- joining David -- who is 
      watching...

      NESPOLA'S 12 YEAR OLD SON

      Running, jumping and bouncing a basketball...

      ...wearing the prized First Pair Final Edition Primers.  The 
      kid sees his dad and runs over...  

                                  NESPOLA S SON
                    Dad, I saw you hide these, but 
                    they re so cool!  Best birthday ever! 

      Though he s only been wearing the shoes for a few minutes, 
      there are creases in the leather...  A scuff on the toe...  

      Nespola looks like he might hang himself.  His son sees his 
      expression.

                                  NESPOLA S SON (cont'd)
                    ...These are for me, right?

                    The fun he s having is worth more 
                    than they are.

      Nespola watches his son play - a smile of pure joy on his 
      face.  Might be a hint of a smile on Nespola s face too... 

      OFF Don, David and Nikki...

      Tables, fabrics and manufacturing tools.  A company is taking 
      shape.  Nikki is impressed as she approaches.  La-La plays with 
      KIDS as they help her straighten up the place (sweep, dust,

                    came up with  Nike  until they had 
                    their first shoe.

      Nikki hands La-La a cashier s check.  

                                  NIKKI
                    Nespola s auction payment.
