          Bruce just shut off the radio.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't need to listen to that
                          knucklehead.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This guy's been riding me since I
                        got arrested.  I want to hear
                        what he says.

          Johnny punches the radio back on.

                                        JERICHO
                                (reading)
                        "According to Penobscot County
                        Sheriff Walt Bannerman, Smith's
                        visions allowed him to locate the
                        vehicle in time for paramedics to
                        revive both her and her father."
                                (derisive)
                        Sheriff Bannerman can't seem to
                        solve a case without calling in
                        his human Ouija board Johnny Smith. 
                        Pretty soon when you dial 911
                        around here, you're going to get
                        the "Psychic Friends Network."

                                        BRUCE
                        That's cold...

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        In fact, why don't we just pin a
                        badge on Johnny Smith and cut out
                        the middle man since he's already
                        doing the Sheriff's job -- maybe
                        in more ways than one.  Anybody
                        seen that hottie wife of Sheriff
                          Bannerman's? 

          Johnny slams on the brakes and grinds to a halt on the
            shoulder.

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        You couldn't miss her, standing
                        by her man on those Bannerman for
                        Sheriff signs.

                        Apparently she used to be engaged
                        to Johnny Smith but she dumped
                        him for the Sheriff during Johnny's
                          infamous coma.  Now they're all
                        "friends".  What's up with that?

          Bruce punches off the radio, he can see that Johnny is
          starting to lose it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't listen to that stuff man,
                        it'll make you crazy.

          Without a word, Johnny puts the car in gear and guns it
          back onto the road, hanging a U-turn.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, no... what are you doing?



          Johnny steps off the elevator in a tight lipped fury,
          Bruce trailing worriedly.  They find Station Manager
          MITCHELL NOZAWA, a mild looking Japanese American,
            reviewing messages with a RECEPTIONIST.

          Beyond them in the background, seen through the glass of
          the tiny broadcast booth, with his back to us as he
            continues to bark at the world, is Jericho.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to speak to whoever is in
                        charge here.

                                        NOZAWA
                                  (recognizing him)
                          Mitchell Nozawa, station manager.

          Johnny sees Jericho, goes straight for him...


          CLOSER ON THE BROADCAST BOOTH

          As Jericho goes to a commercial, still seen from behind.

          JOHNNY

          bangs on the glass.  Jericho turns, revealing the face
          behind the voice.  He reacts to Johnny.

                                        JERICHO
                        Johnny Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't give a damn what you say
                        about me, but my friends are off
                        limits.

                                        JERICHO
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Smith
                        has decided to come down to the
                        station personally to lodge a
                        complaint.

          Jericho has stepped out of the booth, mic in hand, yanking
          the cable along behind him.  Bruce intervenes.

                                        BRUCE
                        C'mon Johnny you don't need this.

                                        NOZAWA
                        Jack, please, go back inside.

          Johnny and Jericho ignore the others.  Jericho nods toward
          the "ON THE AIR" light.

                                        JERICHO
                        C'mon John, you got a problem,
                        let's get it out on the air, know
                        what I mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look I'm not doing this.  Just
                        have some respect and lay off my
                          friends, okay?

                                        JERICHO

                          carnival act who passes himself
                        off as a real psychic?  "Real
                          Psychic?"  There's an oxymoron
                        for you.  C'mon Johnny, let's see
                        just how good you are.  Make a
                          prediction.

                        for our listeners.

          Jericho waves the mic in Johnny's face.  Johnny bats the
          mic away, triggering:


1515A VISION - FALLING POV

            A montage of images; disjointed, mysterious, all sharing
          the same horrific momentum:

  15A15A- A RED ORB FALLING SILENTLY THROUGH A NIGHT SKYLINE,

  15B15B- A FIST CONNECTING WITH JERICHO'S JAW,

  15C15C- A POV RUSHING TOWARD AN OPEN WINDOW (NIGHT),

  15D15D- POWERFUL, TATTOOED ARMS, SHOVING JERICHO, SNAPPING HIS
          HEAD BACK.

  15E15E- A GLINT OF A WOMAN'S REFLECTION ON THE GLASS OF A
          WINDOW.

  15F15F- A POV SOARING OUT THE WINDOW INTO THE NIGHT - REVEALING
          THE GROUND TEN STORIES BELOW, BEFORE SPINNING INTO A
          BLUR.  (NOTE:  AND WITH THIS BLUR, OR A SIMILAR DEVICE,
          WE ARE TRANSITIONING INTO A DIFFERENT VISION OF A
            DIFFERENT FALL, THOUGH THIS IS SOMETHING A VIEWER SHOULD
          REALIZE ONLY IN RETROSPECT.)

  15G15G- THE BLUR STABILIZES AS WE CONTINUE TO FALL, AND NOW WE
          REVEAL WHO'S FALLING - IT'S JERICHO - AND WE FOLLOW HIM
          AS HE PLUMMETS TO EARTH, LANDING ON TOP OF A CAR, THE
          WINDOWS EXPLODING OUTWARD ON IMPACT.


  1616RESUME SCENE

          Ripping back out of his eye to reveal Johnny as he releases
          the mic, still reeling from the impact.  Jericho continues
          to press Johnny.

                                        JERICHO
                        C'mon Johnny, one prediction,
                        that's all I'm asking...

          Bruce is trying to pull Johnny away, but Johnny shakes
          him off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That big mouth of yours is going
                        to get you killed.

                        you're going to have to get in

          Johnny covers the mic with his hand, locks eyes with
          Jericho.

          FADE IN:


            A CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY KID heads into the offices as
          Johnny and Bruce exit, followed by an anxious Nozawa. 
          Johnny watches Jericho continue ranting in the b.g.

                                (re: vision)
                        Listen to me.  What happened in
                          there... that wasn't an act. 
                        He's going to insult the wrong
                        person and get killed.  If there's
                        any way you could get him to take
                        this seriously...

          Nozawa's dubious, not sure how seriously he takes Johnny.

                                        NOZAWA
                        I don't know.  Jack's got his own
                        mind... and these days it's not
                        too open to conflicting opinions.
                                (brightening)
                        Hey, ever considered doing a show
                        of your own?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're offering me a job?

                                        NOZAWA
                                (holds out a card)
                        We already have an on-air
                        therapist.  Why not a psychic? 
                        The hours are easy and I'm sure
                        we could make the numbers work in
                        your favor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look I'm really not interested...

                                        BRUCE
                                (snatching the card)
                        He may not be interested...

          Nozawa moves off as Johnny gives Bruce a look.  Then
          Jericho pops his head out of his booth.

                                        JERICHO
                        Hey guys, guess what, I'm a
                          psychic.

          And he underhands a FORTUNE COOKIE at Johnny, which he
          catches, sending him into --          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT ONE - 11/28/03 - PINK  10.



          The Chinese delivery boy smashes into a chalkboard that
          reads "Wednesday Dinner Specials."  Reveal Johnny watching
          as he turns to see what propelled the kid and sees a waiter
          and a chef wrestling with an angry man in a postal uniform
          (CHARLES), who has Jericho in a headlock.


  1919RESUME SCENE

          Johnny reacts to the vision, then cracks open the cookie.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reads)
                        "You will embark on an unwanted
                          journey."

          He turns over the fortune, sees the name of the restaurant --
          LUCKY DRAGON CHINESE SEAFOOD RESTAURANT -- and sighs...

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't make any dinner plans.

          The elevator has arrived.  Johnny and Bruce step in as
          Johnny's phone rings.  He answers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?  Yes.  Have you called his
                          parents?  I'll be right there.

          Off his worried expression as he shuts the phone.

                        You're not in any trouble, J.J. 
                        I just want to know why.

          J.J. remains stoic, embarrassed to have his mom cleaning
          him up.  The door opens, and J.J. looks up expectantly...
          then reacts with barely concealed disappointment and a
          hint of confusion when he sees Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, J.J., how you doin'?

                                        J.J.
                        Fine.

                                        SARAH
                        He got in a fight.  But he's not
                        saying why... to me anyway.

          Relieved that's all it is, Johnny peers at J.J.'s slightly
          bruised face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, you look better than I did
                        after my first fight.  Professional
                        tip:  Never try to block a punch
                        with your face.

          This gets a slight smile from J.J.... but nothing like
          the one he greets WALT with as he enters now.

                                        J.J.
                        Dad!

          Johnny stands; Walt is surprised and put off to see him
          here.  He crosses to his son.

                                        WALT
                        Hey big guy.  Heard you had an
                          accident.

                                        SARAH
                        Not an accident.  A fight.

                                        WALT
                          A fight?  Well, you don't look
                        too bad.  How's that nose?

                                        J.J.
                        You should see the other guy.

                                        WALT
                        That's my boy.

          J.J. smiles.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt... this is serious.

                                        WALT
                        Of course.  I'm just glad he's
                        okay.

          There's definite tension here, though both adults are
            conscious that J.J. is watching them closely, anxiously
            searching for any signs of reconciliation.  Walt turns to
          Johnny, wondering again why he's here.

                                        WALT
                        Hey, Johnny.  You get a vision or
                        were you just passing by?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They called me.

                                        SARAH
                        Can I speak to you outside?

                                        WALT
                        Sure.  Back in a sec, champ.

          J.J. watches them go, disappointed, barely noticing as
          Johnny sits beside him on the bench.  A longish beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So.  You want to talk about what
                          happened?
                                (J.J. shakes his head)
                        Okay, no problem.

          Another long beat.  Johnny starts nervously tapping his
          foot.  Then he realizes J.J. is unconsciously doing the
          exact same thing.  He stops, a little unnerved by the
          hint of "like-father-like-son" convergence.  A question
          occurs to J.J.

                                        J.J.
                        Why are you here?

          Caught off guard, Johnny doesn't answer for a beat.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess because I'm on the
                          emergency list.  They called me
                        when they couldn't get your Mom
                        or Dad on the phone right away.

                                        J.J.
                        Oh.  Right.

          This seems to satisfy him, to Johnny's relief.  And from
          this awkward scene, we go to another:

          busy hallway; they are forced to play opposite the words,
          putting on a happy face for the occasional teacher who
          passes by.

                        So who'd he get in the fight with?

                                        SARAH
                        Eddy Cirillo.

                          Cirillo?  If he's anything like
                        his dad, I'm sure he started it.

                                        SARAH
                        They say J.J. went after this
                        kid.  And it's not just the fight. 
                        His grades are slipping.  He won't
                        listen to a word I say.  Ever
                        since you left, he's been doing
                        everything he can to get into
                          trouble.

                        I'll talk to him.

                        What, like you just talked to him
                        now?  He needs more than that...
                        We need more than that.  I think
                        we should get some family
                          counseling.

                          stranger tell me what's wrong
                        with my family.  I know what's

          J.J. who notices first, then stops himself, not liking
          where his thoughts are taking him.  Just then, Sarah and
          Walt return.

                        I want to go with you, Dad.

          Walt hesitates.  Johnny stares at his shoes, not sure if
          this is none of his business or all his fault.

                                        WALT
                        I'll drive him home.

                        But J.J.... that doesn't mean I
                        can stay.

                        I know.

          Walt walks off with J.J., leaving Johnny and Sarah behind. 
          They exchange a look, but neither one knows what to say.

                                        SARAH
                        I have to go.

          Johnny just nods, and Sarah goes, leaving him alone.  He
          sighs, exhaling like he's been holding his breath for the
          last five minutes.



          Finding Johnny and Bruce burrowed into a back booth.

          He turns to look at a booth across the restaurant.  It's
          occupied by Jericho, wearing a WPOV JACKET and smoking
          while draining a tall Mai Tai, too lit-up to even notice
          their presence.  The Wednesday Specials BLACKBOARD is
          propped near him.  Bruce follows the look, reacts...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh man, when were you gonna tell

                        off a tall building.

          And he nods to the door, Bruce following his look to see...


          ANGLE - CHARLES THE ANGRY MAILMAN

            A waiter, chef and the delivery boy seen earlier are
          converging on the fracas.  Charles is throwing little
          rabbit punches at Jericho, who's hanging on to him, not

          CHARLES

          rearing back to deliver the big punch that Johnny now
          realizes he saw connecting with Jericho's jaw in the
          falling vision in the Teaser.  Only Bruce is moving in
          between them...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce, watch out--

          But the warning comes too late as the punch hits Bruce
          instead, knocking him on his ass.  The staff finally
          subdues the disgruntled postal worker as Johnny rushes to
          help Bruce up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry about that.  You okay?

                                        BRUCE
                                (rubbing his jaw)
                        Tell me you didn't see that coming.



          Lights go on to reveal an unmade pull-out bed, heaped
          dishes and take-out containers, and a jumble of packing
          boxes.  Bruce looks around the room.

                                        BRUCE
                          Apparently, being a radio D.J.
                        doesn't pay what it used to.

          They half steer, half carry Jericho inside and dump him
          on the bed.  Bruce rubs his jaw again; he's had enough.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let's call it a night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me a minute.

                                        BRUCE
                                (whatever)
                        I'll be in the car.

          Bruce exits as Johnny eyes Jericho who's still pretty out
          of it, mumbling to himself occasionally.  Johnny's clearly
          not going to be able to make much headway reasoning with
          him tonight.  Instead, he lifts Jericho's feet up on the
          bed, then looks around, curious about all the boxes.  He
          touches one, hears...

          A CACOPHONY OF ANGRY VOICES.  An 'auditory vision.'  He
          pulls his hand away and the voices stop.

          The box is taped shut.  So are the others.  Johnny glances
          at Jericho -- still out cold on the bed -- then tries
          touching a few more... and hears more of the same:  more
          voices, all angry, but too jumbled to make out many words,
          though we do hear Jericho's name.

          The circuit of boxes brings him to a desk close to the
          bed.  He sees an open drawer filled with letters.  No,
          not letters, cards -- BIRTHDAY CARDS.  They're sitting in
          a stack, looking like they've never been mailed.  But as
          Johnny reaches for one... the drawer SLAMS SHUT and Jericho
          GRABS HIS ARM, spinning Johnny to face him --          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT ONE - 11/27/03 - BLUE  19.


  2929FALLING VISION - REDUX

          The same disjointed, mysterious montage we saw before:  a
          red orb falling silently through a night skyline; POV
          rushing toward an open window; tattooed arms, shoving
          Jericho; the glint of the woman's reflection on the window
          glass; a POV soaring out the window into the night; the
          blurring fall ending with Jericho crashing into the parked
          car.

            (However, we've lost one image: the punch, which was thrown
          by the mailman in the fight that just happened.  As a
          result, those tattooed arms now seem to more clearly belong
          to someone who will push Jericho over the edge.)


  3030RESUME SCENE

          Jericho is sitting up in bed, drunkenly shouting at Johnny.

                                        JERICHO
                        I don't want you touching my stuff! 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to save your life.

                                        JERICHO
                        Just get out!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (at the door)
                        Mind telling me one thing?  What's
                        in all the boxes?

                                        JERICHO
                        You really wanna know?

          And he angrily rips one open, revealing another stack of
          letters and envelopes, many different postmarks.

                                        JERICHO
                        My hate mail.

          And he smiles an odd smile.

                                        JERICHO
                        'Night, John.

          Johnny closes the door behind him, and we linger on his
          disturbed, puzzled expression.

          CLOSE ON A STREAM OF COFFEE as it hits a mug.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        You still take yours black?

          And as we pull back and he turns, we reveal his guest: 
          Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah...
                                (rueful)
                        Guess some things don't change.

          Johnny brings her the mug, eyeing her thoughtfully.  She's
          come here for a reason, but she hasn't disclosed it yet.

                                        SARAH
                        Thanks.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (picking up his own
                                  half-full mug)
                        Everything okay?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  No.  I'm worried about
                        J.J. and I just needed someone to
                        talk to.  I can't seem to talk to
                        Walt about anything anymore without
                        it turning into a fight.

          They each sip their coffee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know Walt's crazy in love
                        with you.

                                        SARAH
                        Is he?  Lately it's been hard to
                        tell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's J.J. taking all this?

                        That's what I wanted to talk to
                        you about... He finally told me
                        why he got into that fight. 
                          Apparently, some kids were teasing
                        him about something they heard on
                        the radio...

          Johnny closes his eyes.  He was afraid of this.

                        ...some talk radio jerk was going
                        off about how Walt can't solve a
                        case without your help.

          Johnny opens his eyes, and now there's anger in them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't believe people let their
                        kids listen to that idiot.

                          Unfortunately, yes.  His name is
                        Jack Jericho.  He's been using me
                        for comic fodder since my arrest.

                                        SARAH
                        But you were cleared.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't matter.  I'm in the public
                        eye.  That makes me fair game. 
                          Unfortunately, he didn't stop
                        there.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He also insinuated things about
                        you and me.

                        About us?  What kind of things? 
                        Did he say anything about you and
                        J.J.?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but it's only a matter of
                        time.  The facts are out there --
                        dates, birthdays.  If anyone made
                        a point of doing the math...

                                        SARAH
                        J.J. can't find out this way. 
                        We've got to be the ones to tell
                        him.

                        I'll talk to this guy again, see

  3333OMITTED



          Jericho is scanning the street with his binoculars.  He's
          cued an appropriate b.g. song like "Born to be Wild."

                                        JERICHO
                        The very idea of a bunch of knuckle-
                          dragging bikers banding together
                        to pursue a higher calling is a
                        joke.  They're too low down on
                        the evolutionary scale...

          His girlfriend's apparently playing the broadcast on the
          boombox and he looks mightily pissed.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        In fact, calling Tiny here a
                          Neanderthal is an insult to
                          Neanderthals.  Remember that monkey
                        with the bone in "2001"?  No,
                        that's still too kind.  Basically,
                        this guy must've crawled up on
                        land on Saturday, traded his
                          flippers for arms on Sunday, and
                        got 'em tattooed on Monday.

          And as Tiny looks right up at us, eyes spelling murder...



          Johnny exits the elevator and approaches the front desk,
          where the Engineer is flirting with the receptionist. 
          Even though we hear Jericho on the air, the broadcast
          booth is empty, a pre-recorded commercial running.  Johnny
          nods to the empty booth (See Addendum A).*

                        the view.  It's nice up there.

          The receptionist nods in agreement, but Johnny's already
          running back to the elevator.



          A muscular black MALE INTERN is studying the X-Ray while
          Jericho sits on an examining table, a hospital ID BRACELET
          on his wrist.  Johnny watches, standing.

                        wake up with psychic powers?
                                (grabs intern's arm,
                                  Johnny-style)
                        I see a malpractice suit in your
                        future.

          The Intern jerks his arm away, then eyes Johnny gravely.

                                        INTERN
                        Tell your friend it's especially
                          important to avoid injuries that
                        could aggravate his condition.

                                        JERICHO
                        Yeah?  What kind of in--hey!

          As Johnny jerks him to his feet.  To the Intern:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you, and he's not my friend.

          As he hustles him away from the Intern's icy stare...

                                        JERICHO
                        Where are we going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just about the last place I want
                        to take you.



          Dimly lit.  Locks turn, then Johnny leads Jericho inside.

                                        JERICHO
                          I didn't ask you to play baby-
                        sitter.

    44CONTINUED:44

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't worry.  Eight hours from
                        now, you're on your own.
                                (stops him)
                        Hold on.

          He works an ALARM PANEL until it beeps off.  Jericho notes
          the security cameras.

                                        JERICHO
                                (firing up a Camel)
                        What's a psychic need security
                        for anyway -- can't you just use
                        your third eye?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd rather you didn't smoke.

                                        JERICHO
                        'Course you'd rather.  But since
                        it doesn't look like you're gonna
                        throw me out, how about finding
                        me an ashtray?
                                (entering living room)
                        Whoa, hold the phone, big-screen
                        TV alert.  John, tell me you've
                        got satellite and high def and
                        I'll take back most of the bad
                        things I've said about you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Satellite, no H.D.

                                        JERICHO
                                (plopping on the couch)
                        You're a stiff and a phony.

          Johnny hands him an ashtray.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I brought you here for a reason. 
                        We've got to talk.

                                        JERICHO
                        Talk, huh?  As in really "talk,"
                        like on Oprah?  C'mon John, my
                          frigging head's pounding like one
                        of those giant Japanese drums. 
                        Save the male bonding stuff for
                        later.

          Johnny sits across from Jericho.

    44CONTINUED: (2)44

                                        JOHNNY
                        So why are you doing it?

                                        JERICHO
                        Doing what, John?

          He opens a vial of prescription painkillers, shakes out a
          few, then tosses them back with a jolt from his flask.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That for instance.

                                        JERICHO
                        What are you, my Mom?

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, "Jack."  Picking fights
                        with postal workers.  Antagonizing
                        biker gangs.  Obviously, you've
                        got some kind of death wish.

          Acting bored, Jericho turns on the TV, starts flipping
          channels -- and sidesteps the issue.

                                        JERICHO
                        I just tell it like it is, John. 
                        The cold hard truth.  And if they
                        had any sense, they'd thank me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Instead of sending hate mail?

                                        JERICHO
                          I worked hard for every one of
                        those letters.  And that's
                          something nobody can take from
                        me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But somebody can take your
                        life.  So tell me, is that the
                        plan?  Death by talk show?

                                        JERICHO
                        Oh right, your big scary vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen to me, I saw you--

          But Jericho cuts him off, flicking off the TV and standing.

                                        JERICHO
                        No, you listen to me.  You want
                        to play psychic head games?  Fine.

    44CONTINUED: (3)44

                                        JERICHO (CONT'D)
                        Let's see what my third eye tells
                        me about the famous Johnny Smith.
                                (pacing, rapid-fire)
                        I see a man with more security
                        cameras in his living room than
                        the Bellagio has in its high roller
                        pit... a man so paranoid about
                        people getting into his hermetic
                        little world that he spies on
                          himself.
                                (looking around)
                        I see a man living in a 10,000
                        square foot mansion, whose only
                          personal decorating touch is a 42-
                        inch plasma TV.  I see a lonely
                        screwed up guy who thinks he's
                        some kind of savior, butting into
                          everyone else's business because
                        it keeps him too busy to take a
                        good long look in the mirror.

          And we see Johnny react as each point hits home.  Much as
          he dislikes Jericho, the man's insight commands respect.

                                        JERICHO
                        And now you want to save me. 
                        Save me from... what?  Cigarettes
                        and booze?  Getting my ass kicked? 
                        Or maybe the thing you really
                        want to save me from is life,
                        that messy bit of business that
                          everyone else has to deal with. 
                        But not you, locked up in Xanadu
                        here, safe from feeling anything
                        that might even approximate a
                        human emotion while you--

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you fall.

          And somehow this simple statement stops Jericho cold.

                                        JERICHO
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you falling from a tall
                          building.  Ten stories, maybe
                        more.

          Jericho remains silent, clearly disturbed.  Johnny senses
          he's touched a nerve, but he's not sure why.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT TWO - 11/27/03 - BLUE  29.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong, Jack, fresh out of
                        rants?  Or are you thinking maybe,
                        just maybe, someone else is telling
                        the cold hard truth for a change? 

          In response, Jericho flips on the TV again.

                                        JERICHO
                          Actually, I was thinking you could
                        at least order some movie channels. 
                        Man cannot live on basic cable
                        alone.

          The doorbell rings as Johnny stares at him, stymied.


  4545ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR AS IT OPENS, REVEALING WALT

          His cruiser is in the driveway, light bar flashing.

          Walt driving, Johnny beside him, Jericho in the back.

                        I can't believe this.
                                (when they turn)
                        I can't believe I'm doing a ride-
                        along with Sheriff Bannerman...
                        I'm about to meet the lovely Sarah --
                        all my favorite characters from
                        "As the Psychic Turns."

                                (to Johnny; disgusted)
                        Tell me again why your friend's
                        here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a long story, but basically
                        he's got a concussion and I've
                        got to keep an eye on him.
                              (a glance at Jericho)
                        And he's not my friend.

                                        JERICHO
                        And I thought we were bonding.

                                        JOHNNY & WALT
                        Shut up!

          Jericho sits back, Johnny turns to Walt...

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what happened?

                                        WALT
                        Sarah thought he was upstairs
                        doing his homework, but when he
                        didn't come down for dinner...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did he take anything?

                                        WALT
                        His jacket.  But his bike's still
                        in the garage, so he couldn't
                        have gone too far.  Unless...
                        unless someone picked him up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not your fault, Walt.

                        It isn't?  I should've been there.

          Johnny doesn't know what to say.  Jericho's been listening,
          and now he breaks the silence, his tone no longer flippant.

                                        JERICHO
                        I ran away when I was nine.
                                (off their looks)
                        My parents had just told me they
                        were getting divorced.  They'd
                        been separated but I guess I
                        thought they'd get back together
                        again, like always.

          And now we shoot from the front, watching Walt's face and
          Johnny's as Jericho continues.

                                        JERICHO (Cont'd)
                        So that night I packed my Cub
                        Scout knapsack with extra
                        underwear, my catcher's mitt and
                        my pet turtle, and took off.  I
                        got as far as the Little League
                        field, then I realized not only
                        did I have no clue where I was
                        going, I didn't really want to
                        leave.  They were still my parents,
                        broken up or not.  So I went home.
                                (beat)
                        I'm sure your boy will be okay,
                          Sheriff.

          Walt nods, moved and grateful, as Johnny eyes Jericho
            thoughtfully, wondering at this uncharacteristic display
          of empathy.



            A distraught Sarah is letting them in as she updates Walt.

                                        SARAH
                        I've called all his friends'
                          families.  No one's seen or heard
                        from him.

                                        WALT
                        I've got my guys checking the
                        video parlors, the train station,
                          anywhere he might've gone.

          And right now they're just two worried parents, their
          differences put aside.  Sarah reacts to Jericho.

                        Sarah, this is Jack Jericho.

            Jericho's been hanging back.  He nods somewhat sheepishly.

                                        SARAH
                                  (whispering to Johnny)
                        Isn't he the one on the radio...
                        the one who...?

          And now it's Johnny's turn to nod sheepishly.

                                        SARAH
                        Why's he here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a long story.  Maybe I should
                        check upstairs, see if I can get
                        any hits off of anything.

                        I'll make another run around the
                        block.

          Sarah's phone rings.  She goes to answer.  As Johnny heads
          for the stairs, Jericho trailing...



          Johnny enters and begins touching various objects; nothing
          tells him what he needs to know.  Our focus, though, is
          on Jericho, who remains silent, thoughtful and troubled
          as he takes in the room, its childish furnishings, toys,
          etc.  We sense it's all affecting him.  He sees an open
          window, frowns...

                                        JERICHO
                        You shouldn't leave windows open.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If it's bothering you, close it.

          Jericho moves to do so, then notices something:  a smudge
          on the sill.

                                        JERICHO
                        Hey... Mister Psychic.

          Johnny comes over, notes the smudge, touches it... WHOOSH. 
          He reacts, surprised, then pokes his head out the window.          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT THREE - 11/20/03 - WHITE  33.



          As Johnny helps J.J. inside, Walt and Sarah are entering
          with Jericho following.

                                        SARAH
                        Honey!  You had us worried sick.

                        No kidding.  What were you doing
                        up there?

                        Nothing...

          And as J.J. pulls his father into the family hug...


          FINDING JERICHO

          hanging back by the door, reacting to this family reunion,
            uncharacteristically moved.  He looks over at...


          JOHNNY

          who's also standing apart from the scene, feeling shut
          out again, and yet wondering now whose fault that really
          is.  He turns to the door... and sees Jericho's gone. 
          He's immediately worried.



          As Johnny comes down the stairs, glances around.  He
          notices the front door is open, Jericho having disappeared
          into the night.  He steps onto the porch, looking for
          him, but finds only his discarded HOSPITAL I.D. TAG.  He
          picks it up, triggering:


  5252REPRISE FALLING VISION

          Faster.  Farther.  More horrific.  More real.  The woman's
          face is more distinct.  The red orb more mysterious. 
            Jericho's fall ending with even more impact!


  5353OFF JOHNNY

          As he comes out of it, profoundly worried now...



          Johnny is following Nozawa around as he tends to business. 
          A feel-good therapist D.J., DR. MONICA, is in the booth.

                                        NOZAWA
                        I'm not sure I understand, Mister
                        Smith.  Are you saying he's
                        dangerous?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only to himself.  I think he might
                          actually want someone to kill
                        him.  He's using his radio show
                        to fulfill a death wish.

                                        NOZAWA
                        After yesterday, that doesn't
                          surprise me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe if you could just take him
                        off the air, for a little while,
                        until he can get some help...

                                        NOZAWA
                          Actually, I can do better than
                        that.  I left him a message this
                          morning.  He's fired.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fired?

          This is more than Johnny wanted, and he immediately worries
          what the effect on Jericho will be.

                        Isn't there anyone he's close to
                        who could help him?  A family

                        I'd say you're the closest thing
                        to a friend he's got right now,
                        and if you see him, tell him he
                        can pick up his junk, along with
                        his last check.

          He indicates a couple of TAPED PACKING BOXES near the
          booth.  Johnny moves closer, sees an AWARD PLAQUE that's
          sitting on top of one of them.  It says, "1994 COMMUNICATOR
          OF THE YEAR."  As he picks it up...



          Young and pretty, a WEDDING RING visible as she adjusts
            Jericho's formal bow tie.  He also looks younger and
          happier; he's smoking a CIGAR.  She teases him playfully:

                                        WOMAN
                        You're not going to insult them

                        That's the spirit.

          And the vision ends on her smile, but in an odd way:  a 
          glint of another woman's REFLECTION -- or is it the same
          woman? -- briefly shimmering over, only this face is
            contorted in horror, hands half covering a mouth frozen
          in a silent scream...

          need to hear the words to know that J.J. has just been
          told Johnny is his father.  He looks from Sarah, to Walt,
          to Johnny, a look of betrayal growing across his face as
          he shakes his head "no".  Sarah tries to wrap him in a
          motherly hug, but he pulls away and runs out, confused
          and devastated.  Walt looks to Johnny and Sarah, then
          goes after him.  Sarah squeezes Johnny's arm supportively,
          then follows, leaving him alone, his own expression as
          pained as his son's.  It went about as badly as it could.

                                        NOZAWA
                        Doctor Monica's been trying to
                        talk sense to him. 



          Without much success it seems, as they enter to find her
          coming unglued.

                                        DOCTOR MONICA
                        Now, Jack, let's be honest...

                                        JERICHO (V.O.)
                        Sure, Doc, and why don't you start
                        by telling your listeners how
                        your husband left you, your kids
                          disowned you, and that the reason
                        you keep talking about good sex
                        is to remind yourself what it
                        felt like -- back in junior high.

                                        DOCTOR MONICA
                                (losing it)
                        You can't talk to me that way you
                          sonofabitch!

                                        NOZAWA
                        Doc, this is Johnny Smith, the
                        man Jack's been--

                                        DOCTOR MONICA
                        He's all yours.  I don't have to
                        take this crap!

          She storms out in tears, the latest victim of Jericho's
          vitriol.  The three men look after her, then Johnny eyes
          the D.J. desk and its myriad controls uncertainly.  Bruce
          takes charge, sliding in behind the console.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't worry, I'll hook you up.
                                (for Nozawa's benefit)
                          I practically ran my college radio
                          station.

          A cop raps on the glass, needing to speak with Nozawa.

                                        NOZAWA
                        Good luck.

          He exits as Johnny sits in front of the microphone, then
          leans forward tentatively.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jack?

          And that single resonant word causes a FEEDBACK HUM that
          Bruce quickly brings under control as we --



          Jericho is still pacing on the ledge, Walt and his deputies
          keeping their distance, remaining in the rooftop doorway.

                        John!  Glad you could make the
                        party.  I was just about to blow
                        out the candles.

                        it!"  "You've got so much to live
                        for!"  "Think about your loved
                        ones!"  Please, John, don't demean
                          yourself.  I didn't ask you here
                        to "talk me down."

                                        JOHNNY
                        No?  Then why?

                                        JERICHO
                        To bear witness to the fulfillment
                        of your prophecy, of course! 
                        That's right, folks, we all owe
                        this hugely entertaining spectacle
                        to the one and only Man From
                        Cleaves Mills.
                                (to Johnny)
                        When you told me how you saw me
                        going out -- not with a bang or a
                        whimper but after achieving my
                        own personal terminal velocity --
                        I gotta admit, it struck a chord.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nobody wants you to do this, Jack.

                                        JERICHO
                        Let's just see about that, shall
                        we?  All right, campers, it's
                        time for another "Cold Hard Truth"
                        poll!  Do I stay or do I go? 
                        Suicide jump or suicide chump? 
                        Next ten callers decide.  Go ahead
                        and spin a record, Johnny, while
                        the folks at home make up their
                        minds.

          And indeed Bruce cues up a record (in an ideal world, The
          Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"), to Johnny's
          disbelief.

                        Buying us some time.  I've worked
                        enough suicide hotlines to know
                        he's not joking.  Our call board's
                        already filling up with unfriendly
                        voices.  We need a plan.

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        C'mon, John, I know those calls
                        are coming in.  Punch a button,
                        let's hear one.

          Johnny's feeling the pressure, knowing he can't talk
          Jericho down unless he understands clearly what got him
          up there.  Then his eyes fall on...


          THE PACKING BOXES MARKED "JERICHO"

          They trigger a desperate hope.


          JOHNNY

          grabs one of the boxes, then punches the first of a row
          of blinking call buttons.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Umm, okay, we have, um...

          Bruce holds up a piece of paper for him to read.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...Thelma in Bangor.  You're on
                        the air.

                                        TIPSY YOUNG WOMAN
                        Yeah, I've been listening to this
                        guy for a year and all he does is
                        trash people day in, day out.  I
                        think he should jump.

          As Johnny tears open the box...

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        Thank you Thelma from Bangor.

          CLOSE ANGLE - ONE OF THE BOXES

          Office supplies, old calendars and files, yellow pads,
          souvenirs, miscellaneous junk.  Johnny paws through it as
          he punches another button...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bill from Plymouth:  you're on

                                        GRUFF GUY
                          I called in from my body shop,
                        and Jericho made me sound like a
                          schmuck.  The guys all laughed
                        their heads off.  I hope he lands
                        on his head.

          Meanwhile, John rips open the second box, finding more of
          the same bric-a-brac.  Johnny's frustration is growing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess that's a vote for "jump." 
                        Who's next?

                                        EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hi, my name's Marie, and I abhor
                          violence of any kind -- but in
                        this case...

          Johnny angrily dumps the contents of the box on the floor. 
          He stands over the mess, at a loss, then something catches
          his eye: a flash of color in an unsealed envelope.  It's
            a child's birthday card.  As Johnny picks it up --



          Jericho, alone with a half-empty bottle of scotch.  He
          starts to write a note in the card, but can't get past
          the name "Aaron."  He gives up, tosses the card in his
          TOTE BAG to finish another time -- then he reaches over,
          and slams shut the drawer full of similar birthday cards
          we saw earlier.


  7676RESUME SCENE

          Johnny opens the card, still blank except for the name --
          a letter that was apparently never sent -- and suddenly
            something clicks in his head.  To Bruce:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Take over.

                        Take over?  Where are you going?

          But he's already out the door, card in his hand.  Bruce
          looks at all the flashing lights, then hits a button.

                                        BRUCE
                        "Cold Hard Truth," you're on the
                        air.



          He's watching a YOUNGER JERICHO, wearing a tux (it's still
          before the awards ceremony alluded to in the earlier hotel
          vision) and arguing with his agent on a hotel telephone. 
          A MAID is cleaning up in the b.g.

                                        YOUNGER JERICHO
                        Ari, if they want to go national,
                        fine, but the hell with this "let's
                              try-it-for-a-few-months" crap.

          And now a YOUNGER MRS. JERICHO walks by, holding a TODDLER
          BOY who's clutching a TOY (Teddy Bear, action figure,
          etc).  She deposits him on the floor, says to Jericho --

                                        YOUNGER MRS. JERICHO
                        Watch him for a moment, will you? 

          Younger Jericho nods absently, goes back to his phonecall.

                                        YOUNGER JERICHO
                        Look, either they commit to a
                          long-term deal or they can screw
                          themselves.

          Meanwhile, the maid reacts to a smelly old cigar sitting
          in an ashtray on a table by the windows.  She opens a
          window to let the odor out, then picks up the ashtray and
          exits... and now we see a RED BALL sitting on the same
          table, right by the window sill.

          VISION JOHNNY

          reacts to the ball, then turns to look at the boy, a
          terrible realization dawning.  Jericho, meanwhile,
            continues his phone diatribe...

                        Ari, I don't care whether you
                        like the deal, what matters is
                        whether I like it.

          And meanwhile, the boy, bored with his toy, has spied the
          ball, and clambers up on a couch to reach for it.  He 
            accidentally knocks it onto the window sill, starts to
          climb out further after it, perilously close to the edge...

                                        YOUNGER JERICHO
                        That's right, you work for me.  I
                        call the shots.

          And now he turns, finally seeing the danger.

                                        YOUNGER JERICHO
                        Aaron, no! 

          And he drops the phone as he rushes after his son, reaching
          out for him as we transition into excruciating SLOW MOTION,
          his fingertips almost brushing the boy's clothing.

          And then the boy is gone.  Jericho rushes to the window
          and looks down, a wave of vertigo gripping him and we
          realize that the fall in Johnny's vision was his son's, a
          fall that Jericho has experienced every day of his life
          like a waking nightmare.  He turns away, sees his wife's
            horrified REFLECTION in the adjacent window glass as she
          begins to scream, and we --

                        Oh my God, Jack.  I had no idea. 
                        It wasn't just you I saw fall --
                        it was your son, too.

          Jericho holds the phone away so he's not broadcasting.

                                        JERICHO
                        His name was Aaron.  He would've
                        been ten years old.  Just about
                        the same age as your son.

          Johnny reacts, surprised Jericho knows this.  Jericho
          sees his reaction and laughs.

                                        JERICHO
                        Oh, come on Johnny.  The second I
                        saw you and J.J. together you
                        think it wasn't obvious?  Does he
                        know?

          Johnny's lack of an answer speaks volumes.

                                        JERICHO
                        Well.  I guess we have more in
                        common than I thought.  Both of
                        us know what it means to lose a
                        son.  The only difference is -- I
                        can't get mine back.
                                (takes a beat to regain
                                his composure)
                        But you still can.  How's that
                        for some cold hard truth?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jack...

                                        JERICHO
                        Don't worry, Johnny.  Your secret
                        will die with me.
                                (beat)
                        Not a day goes by that I don't
                        relive that moment, imagine what
                        it must've felt like, how he
                        must've felt, during those last
                        few seconds of life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was an accident.  You couldn't
                        have known the maid opened the
                        window.

          And now Jericho backs away from him, suddenly angry.

                                        JERICHO
                        Do you think that changes anything? 
                        Do you think your knowing changes
                          anything?

          And indeed if Johnny thought this visionary epiphany would
          defuse Jericho's suicide plans, he's mistaken.  For as
          Jericho inches closer to the edge...

                        Thee.

          He backs still closer to the edge, the city spreading out
          on both sides of him, and laughs.  Walt, meanwhile, seeing
          that Jericho is about to jump, talks quietly to a deputy.

                        want him taking John with him.

          Johnny listens, then makes a decision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Put her through on my line.

          A beat, then he holds out the phone to Jericho.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's your ex-wife.  She wants to
                        talk to you.

            A glimmer of something passes over Jericho's face, but
          then he considers and his expression hardens again.

                                        JERICHO
                        Guess what John?  I'm through
                          talking.  Tell her I said goodbye.

          And he launches himself backwards over the edge!  Walt
          and the deputy rush forward, grabbing hold of Johnny,
          even as Johnny watches, horrified as --          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT FOUR - 11/27/03 - BLUE  53.

          JOHNNY watches as Jericho's feet shift... WALT tenses...
          and then finally Jericho steps back onto the roof.

          Walt and the deputies immediately rush in, guide him away. 
          Johnny steps down too, exhaling with relief.  He watches
          as Jericho sits on an old crate, the deputies forming a
          protective cordon around him, then starts talking on his
          cell.  Realizing that it's a conversation that deserves
          privacy, Johnny pulls out his own cell, speed dials.

                                (hangs up)
                        And this is Da Kid, signing off
                        for Jack Jericho.  Got something
                          different for your ears.  More
                        Truth, this time from the King of
                        Soul.

          And he plays something smooth, something appropriate,
          maybe not from Solomon Burke, but it's definitely got
          some soul in it.



          A HAND sweetens a cup of coffee with a packet of sugar.

                                        JERICHO
                        Ah Chad, they say hope springs
                          eternal.  They also say there's a
                        sucker born every minute.  So
                        what do you think that makes you?

          And it sounds like Jericho is being his old bad self,
          setting up poor Chad for the kill.

                                        CHAD (V.O.)
                                (nervous chuckle)
                        I don't know, man.

          A beat as Jericho takes a sip, savors it...

                        I guess there's always reason to
                        hope that things can be turned
                        around.  Case in point:  A sudden
                        surge in ratings, and a radio
                        show and its host are back on the
                        air.  Turning a life around is
                        harder.  For that we have to be
                        willing to face some hard truths
                        about ourselves... and take some
                        risks.  Step onto a ledge, or off
                        of one, as the case may be.

          And as he plays a song, source becomes soundtrack over --



          Walt, Sarah, Johnny and J.J. gathered in the living room.

          It's the prelude to the scene we witnessed in Johnny's
          vision.  Johnny and Walt stand together, looking
            uncomfortable, while Sarah sits across from J.J.

                        you... Don't worry, it's a good
                        thing.  Something we should have
                        told you a long time ago -- but
                        we wanted to wait until you were
                        old enough to understand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...She means until we were old
                          enough...

          Walt gives Johnny a look.  J.J. finds himself with three
          adults smiling at him.  This only makes him more worried.

                                        J.J.
                                (still worried)
                        ...yeah... okay....

                                        SARAH
                        You know J.J., you're so lucky to
                        have such a wonderful Dad, who
                        loves you more than anything in
                        the world.  We both do, and that's
                        never going to change.

          Walt watches, a bundle of mixed emotions.  Johnny squeezes
          his shoulder.

                                        SARAH
                                (on the verge of tears)
                        ...But you're even luckier than
                        you know.  Some kids don't have
                        any dad to love them, but you...
                              (a beat)
                        ...You have two dads.  And both
                        of them love you very much.

          We see this soak in on J.J.'s face.  He looks to Walt,
            searching his face for an answer to the questions swirling
          in his head, then, as the penny drops, he looks to Johnny.

                                        J.J.
                        What do you mean, two dads?

                                        J.J.
                          ...That's not true... Dad?

          Walt's expression tells J.J. what he doesn't want to hear.

                                        J.J.
                        No.  I don't believe you...

                                        JOHNNY
                        J.J. --

          But J.J. is overwhelmed.  He pulls away from Sarah and,
          like in Johnny's earlier vision, pushes past Walt and
          runs to his room, slamming the door.  Walt looks to Johnny
          and Sarah, then goes after J.J., leaving Sarah and Johnny
          alone.  Johnny looks devastated.  Sarah squeezes his arm.

                                        SARAH
                          I should...

          Johnny nods, understanding the Bannerman family needs to
          be together now.  Sarah follows Walt and J.J. into the
          bedroom, leaving Johnny alone, fulfilling his vision. 
          Sad and drained, Johnny picks up his cane and turns to
          go, but before he reaches the door, Walt pokes his head
          out of the bedroom door.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny wait.  J.J. has something
                        he wants to ask you.

          Walt ushers a tentative J.J. out the bedroom door.  J.J.
          sticks close to Walt, wiping his eyes as he gets up his
          nerve.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it J.J.?

                                        J.J.
                        What am I supposed to call you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.  Just Johnny.

          Johnny reaches out to put a hand on J.J.'s

            shoulder, and his touch seems to comfort J.J., releasing
          a flood of pent up emotion in both of them, and as Walt
          and Sarah watch through tears, the touch develops into a
          hug that's been a long time coming.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
