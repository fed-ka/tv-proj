    A research scientist, EDWARD PIERSON, late fifties, takes his eye
  away from the viewfinder, runs a hand through his wooly
    intellectual hair, and then jots some notes in a ledger. He sits
  in a field chair, a blanket draped over his lap. Beside him, on a
  small fold-up table, is a thermos of coffee and a package of
    Malomars, his private sin, which he now indulges. A van is parked
    adjacent, the two rear doors swung open to reveal an array of
    electronic and photographic equipment inside.

  finds Vincent returning from a foraging run. He carries a large
    canvas sack over his shoulder and moves with caution and skill
    through the shadows.

  bent forward from the waist to look through the infrared camera.

5 HIS POV - THROUGH INFRARED CAMERA (MATTE) 5

  Along an area of dense foliage. Something large and hulking is
    moving there. CAMERA FOLLOWS the movement, catching various
    glimpses of Vincent s figure through holes in the brush. Then,
    suddenly -- momentously -- a flash of Vincent s tremendous head
  and shoulders... gone as quickly as it appears.                                                                                  2.

6 RESUME PIERSON6

    as he reacts, pulling away from the viewfinder to scan the area
    with his naked eye. Nothing. His hand reaches out for the focus.

7 HIS POV - THROUGH INFRARED CAMERA 7

    ZOOMING in on a section of empty space between branches.
    Vincent s shoulder and torso enter the frame. CAMERA ADJUSTS, and
    for a full second, Vincent s face is captured, staring straight
    at us...

8 RESUME PIERSON8

    who can t believe what he s just seen. He stands quickly and
    hurries in the direction of the sighting. At the top of a small
    rise, he looks down at the drainage duct. But Vincent has already
      disappeared.

                                                                  CUT TO:

                  If you ask me, we should be
                    celebrating at Trader Vic s over
                    duck l orange  stead of having
                  the great debate over whatever
                    this is...

    CAMERA FINDS CATHY AND EDIE sitting at a small table.

                                        CATHY
                    Edie, it s more complicated than
                    that.

                                        EDIE
                  Is it?

                                        CATHY
                    I just don t want to make the
                    wrong choice. Leaving my father s
                    firm for the D.A. was easy because
                    I knew it was right. I felt it.
                  But this time...

    She breaks off, shakes her head, frustrated.

                                        EDIE
                    Have you made a list yet?

                                        CATHY
                    A list?

                                        EDIE
                    Yeah. You know, take the issue
                  and write out the pros and cons.
                    It s a little trick my therapist
                    taught me.

                                        CATHY
                    Does it work?

                                        EDIE
                  For seventy-five dollars an hour,
                  it better work.

    Cathy laughs -- and Edie is glad to have lightened the moment.
    Then:

                                        EDIE
                  Now, since we both know it s the
                    right career move, we should
                    consider the emotional  
                      slash-romantic side of things.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

                                        EDIE
                    Let s face it, Cathy. For
                    eight-million people, New York
                  is one lonely place. So who
                    knows? Maybe a new city d be good
                  for you. Give you the chance to
                    meet somebody.

    Cathy s eyes react to the truth of this, to the omnipresent,
    invisible influence of Vincent.

                                        CATHY
                            (absently)
                    Maybe...

                            (sensing Cathy s
                              ambivalence)
                  Why don t you sit on it for a
                    couple of days. It ll come to
                    you.

                                        CATHY
                    Moreno needs an answer by
                    tomorrow.

                                        EDIE
                     Least they re letting you sleep
                  on it.

                                    CATHY
                  The last thing I ll be doing
                    tonight is sleeping.

                                        EDIE
                              (compassionate)
                    You re really on the fence, huh?

    Cathy nods. Then:

                                        EDIE
                  If you want, I know this great

                    I don t think so, Edie.

    Now Cathy regards Edie for a tender moment. Then:

                  If I do decide to go, I am really
                    going to miss you.

    Cathy opens her arms, embraces Edie.

                                        EDIE
                    I know it. Who else re you gonna
                  get to do all your work?

    The two women laugh, acknowledging the friendship that has grown
    between them, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:

14 PROJECTED SLIDE-SHOT OF VINCENT   14

    in Central Park, half-turned -- from Pierson s evening of
      observation.

                    Next please.


    Cathy stands at the iron gate, trying to find some solace in the
    stillness and quiet of the underground. She peers down the
    tunnel. Nothing. Finally, she turns to leave and sees Vincent
    against a far wall, deep in shadow.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  11.

                    Vincent... I thought you weren t
                    coming.

                                        VINCENT
                    I almost didn t...

                    Vincent...

                                        VINCENT
                    Please. Come no closer.

    She stops and is haloed in a shaft of light. A long beat.

                                        VINCENT
                    You re like an angel... standing
                    there...

    Cathy senses an enormous reticence in Vincent, as if it s too
    painful for him even to look at her.

                                        CATHY
                    I needed to see you.
                                        (beat)
                    I have a decision to make... and
                    I want your help...

    Vincent is silent. Cathy struggles to say what she has come to
    say.

                                        CATHY
                    I've been offered another job,
                    Vincent. With more
                    responsibility. Doing what I was
                    trained to do... helping people
                    more than I m able to now.

    Vincent remains perfectly still.

                                        CATHY
                  But it would mean leaving New
                    York.

    Long beat. Finally;

                  No one can help you decide what

                                        CATHY
                  You can help.

                    unhappy, Catherine. A part of
                  you I can t reach...

                                        CATHY
                    What should I do?

                                        VINCENT
                    I don t have the answer...

    Vincent motions to leave. Now Cathy intercepts him, holding his
    arm.

                                        CATHY
                    Please, stay!

    Vincent halts, but he won t look at her.

                                        CATHY
                    Vincent...

    He raises his head, and their eyes lock -- complete
      understanding.

                                        CATHY
                                      (intense)
                    I care about you... but you re
                    right: part of me is unhappy, and
                    I don t know why... and that s
                    frightening to me.

    Cathy releases Vincent s arm, flushed by her own intensity.

                                        VINCENT
                    Then you have no choice...

                                        CATHY
                  But I do, Vincent. That s why
                  I m here.

    Vincent shakes his head sadly.

                                        VINCENT
                  No, Catherine. You didn t come
                    this far to turn back. I know that...
                            (beat, bowing his head;
                              disappearing into
                            shadow)
                    And I understand...

    Cathy is about to call to Vincent as he disappears down the
    tunnel, into the shadows, but she stops herself.                                                                                  13.

ANGLE   VINCENT

    who has rounded a corner and now fully reacts to the impact of
    Cathy s news. He s devastated, punched in the heart, and slumps
    against the wall.

                                                                  CUT TO:


    Cathy looks out over the sleeping city, as the wind blows,
      pressing her nightgown against her body. The CAMERA MOVES IN as
    she wipes a tear from her face, and we see now that she s been
    crying. Hold. Then, we:

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

18 A WALL CLOCK  18

    reads 7:48, and we are:


    who has just stepped from the drainage duct, into the mist and
    fog. He makes his way through the park for a few hundred yards,
    keeping to the shadows -- when be is suddenly illuminated by a
    flood of bright light. A staccato sibilant SOUND. Vincent s
      shoulder jerks back. He s been hit by a tranquilizer dart. He
    looks up, horrified, and:

22 VINCENT S POV22

    the blinding light of a mini-van -- modified on either side by a
    pair of mounted hand-operated search lights, both of which are
    now trained on Vincent. The silhouette of a MAN holding a gun is
    barely discernible on the driver s side.                                                                                  19.
23 VINCENT23

    pulls the dart from his arm, and takes off through the park like
    a deer.

24 CLOSER ANGLE24

    to reveal that the silhouette is Gould s. Pierson sits behind
    the wheel, visible in b.g. through the windshield. Gould reloads
    his rifle with practiced speed, then takes off after Vincent,
    as:


      Vincent staggers toward the duct, but turns at the sound of an
      ENGINE kicking alive. Bright light cuts through the fog,
        illuminating Vincent, who raises his arms to shield himself.

35 HIS POV35

      the lights blur, then move across his field of vision, until
      they block the entrance to the duct.                                                                                  21.

35 RESUME SCENE35A

      As Vincent stumbles toward the entrance, Pierson emerges from
      the van. He hefts the pistol. It s a little awkward in his
      hand, but Vincent is twenty yards away, and nearing. Pierson
      steadies the pistol and squeezes the trigger, hitting Vincent
      in the chest. Vincent stops, then moves forward, as Pierson
        quickly and nervously reloads a second cartridge. Vincent is
      now only ten yards from him, as Pierson squeezes off another
      shot, which flies into Vincent s abdomen. Vincent doubles over,
      then falls headlong onto the ground before Pierson, into an
        unconscious heap. Illuminated by the van s lights, Pierson
      stands silently over his quarry, greatly awed, even humbled, by
      its magnificence. Gould steps up, his face smudged with dirt
      and blood.

                                        PIERSON
                                      (quietly)
                                  Get the light.

      A moment before Gould peels his eyes from Vincent and moves to
      the van.

      as the distant lights illuminating the scene go off.

35C REVERSE ANGLE35C

      a lighted third story window which frames an old woman peering
      out, holding something up to her face. CAMERA MOVES

      telescope. And as she lowers the telescope, we:

    as the concrete flies by beneath Bennie s wheels.

  navigates past a cab taking a fare, then sharply cuts a corner,
    gliding to a stop before Cathy s apartment building.


    The sun is setting as a tug boat chugs languidly down the river.
    CAMERA FINDS Cathy walking slowly along the strand, passed by
    joggers and young mothers pushing perambulators.

    CLOSER ANGLE - CATHY

    tired-looking and emotionally spent, she sits on a bench and
    stares vacantly out over the river. Then:

                                    CATHY -
                              (whispering urgently
                            to herself)
                    Vincent... please be well.

      Overcome by her helplessness, she breaks down and buries her face
    in her hands, as we:

    jumping on the rolling graph, and:


      Cathy stands, staring out over the jeweled city, her back to
      Vincent. The wind flutters her nightgown, and her hair. Vincent
      approaches her slowly. He reaches out and touches her shoulder.
      She turns, revealing the face of an old woman. Catherine
      Chandler, half a century older. She regards Vincent with a sad
      longing in her eyes, as we:

                                                                                        CUT TO:

                      Change your mind?


    Cathy walks the area, her eyes peeled for evidence of blood,
    for... anything. She turns at the dead-end and starts back toward
    the street. Her eyes scan the wall. She kicks some grocery boxes
    out of her way, and something clatters along the ground. She
    bends down and picks up one of the tranquilizer cartridges.
    Studies it. She sees another and stoops down for that one also.
    She straightens, rolling the two cartridges in her hand,
    thinking. Then she looks up at the old woman s window.

    CATHY S POV - ANNA

    a tiny figure in her third story window, once again at her
    telescope. Cathy herself has now become another event in the old
    woman s visual history.
