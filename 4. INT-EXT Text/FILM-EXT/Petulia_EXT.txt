All we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back
of a small boy, pinning him to the ground and people
shocked, not knowing what to do.
ARCHIE'S VOICE
Well, stay then.
L PETULIA'S IMAGE ENDS AND WE ARE BACK IN THE GRAND BALLROOM
PETULIA
Archie, why do you play this dumb game?
This crappy pretense at resisting the
beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm
even talking to you. How many kids do
you have besides fat Mike?
ARCHIE
Six.
PETULIA
G'night.
ARCHIE
Actually, only one besides Mike.
PETULIA
Meet you outside.
A motel sign: "Dream Motel."' A concrete oval, spiral-
ling up four floors. You drive to your room and everything
is geared to get you to bed electronically. But you must
have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab.
Archie is paying the cabbie.
PETULIA
(to cabbie)
You mustn't take it personal.
(she indicates the "No Cabs" sign)
Lucky we don't have luggage.
ARCHIE
Does this trouble you?
PETULIA
A little.
ARCHIE
I suggested my place.
PETULIA

I'd always imagined a tourist cabin, with
paper thin walls, the sounds of a man from
Tennessee in the cabin next door, sobbing
endlessly, "M4ude, Maude, Maude 8 8"'

Archie sees a car moving through the processes of
E registration. Grabbing Petulia's hand, he starts to
what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the
bottom of the ramp. They arrive at the booth and
Archie steps on the. place marked 'Stand Here.' A
T.V. screen lights up.
MAN ON TV
Evenin'. Where's your auto?
Archie nods for Petulia to see the T.V. camera which
is scanning them.
PETU LIA
Lost in a hailstorm this side of Pocatello,
Idaho. Those hailstones really came down,
didn't they, Zeke?
MAN ON TV
No auto?
ARCHIE
No auto.
MAN ON TV
It's a problem.
0
ARCHIE
Only if we make it one.
PETULIA
Do you have any slides or swings for children?
MAN ON TV
No, ma'am. You got kids?
PETULIA
No, no. I was told to be suspicious of
motels which cater to the family trade.
MAN ON TV
This isn't that sort of place. No auto.
WELL
There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which
normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is
an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with
a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los
Angeles). As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar
bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the T.V. set.

PETULIA
You've got a very nice T,V, face.
MAN ON TV
Thank you, ma' amp,
PETULIA
You have to use pancake make-up, things
like that?
MAN ON TV
(a slight giggle)
No, just be natural.
Archie has finished registering and takes the keys.
MAN ON TV
We've got an elevator but its just for going
out for the paper and the like. I mean when
you don't want to take the car. You'll have
to use the ramp because of the key. It lets
you know when you get to your room.
0
Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on
T.V. mentioned. Archie is already there waiting for it
to arrive. Petulia starts toward him angrily.
PETULIA
Where do you have to rush? If we were making
love you would be exploring my navel about now.
Time would be the last thing on your mind.
An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with
the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of
his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie
enter,
Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door. He hustles
Petulia inside the cab.
ARCHIE
If he gets you there in time, you can still
pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.
PETULIA
(very quietly)
Archie, I'm going to marry you.
The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him
through the rear window. Archie allows himself the
drollest of smiles.
ARCHIE
It's the Pepsi generation
0 He walks into the night alone.

E 12 Continued
A jalopy full of dizzy dames with "LOVE" painted in
huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him
down. Archie continues in the night.
Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge.
The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises
behind it. Petulia is going up the open lift which
climbs the cliff. It is a very different Petulia.
She hurts.
We see some of the hall, a yawning milkman, etc., but
mostly Petulia and the tuba.
A brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins,
etc. in the midst of which is the white tuba.
PETULIA'S VOICE
Archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't
go off?
Archie has just parked his car and is going toward the
entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop
bench, the tuba beside her. She is dozing.
ARCHIE
(SOFTLY)
Hey, you.
She opens her eyes, smiles.
PETULIA
I'm drunk.
ARCHIE
It's the stuff Barney gave you.
PETULIA
I'm drunk.
ARCHIE
I'll drive you home.
PETULIA
Thank you, I'll take the bus.

ARCHIE
Don't be silly.
PETULIA
Don't pry, Archie.
ARCHIE
How'm I prying?
PETULIA
I'll go home by bus.
ARCHIE
If I were prying, I would ask you how you
broke your rib. Right?
PE TULIA
You fall on a tuba and you break your
rib. Right.
ARCHIE
Wrong. The rib was broken hours before
your fall.
L' During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily
to board it but she can't go through the entrance with
the tuba.

BUS DRIVER
Anytime you're ready, Lady.
ARCHIE
I'll keep it for you.
PETULIA
It has to be returned. "Friends of
the Evergreen,"
Archie looks blank.
PETULIA
It's a lodge. In Chinatown. On Grant.
Ask for Mr. Howard.
The bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything
charming.
ARCHIE
(shouting above horn)
Petulia, take a cab!
PETULIA
(shouting above horn)

Don't pry, Archie:
She groggily enters the bus, leaving the tuba in Archie's
arms.
EVERGREEN" DAY.
The sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal
organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of man,
but the door is securely padlocked for the night.
Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling
stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins
stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose
in the process. He is a far from happy man.
IN A SLUM HOUSE DAY
Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with
milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters from
another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He
has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and
is hairy, sweaty and fat.
Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which
the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes
past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his
head under the tap.
0
PETULIA
(she speaks slowly because he
doesn't understand English)
I came by to make sure there was enough
milk and things.
He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia
to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a
possible relationship between Petulia and this man.
In the next room a screen door opens and closes.
Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see
Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.
0 It's a busy Saturday and everything is lovely. A

LARGE GUARD with a bull horn is keeping people moving
on the Japanese bridge. Many soldiers on pass, a few
hippies, but mostly just tourists.
LARGE GUARD
(with bull horn)
Now you folks keep moving along that
bridge. You keep moving along and give
other folks a chance. There's lots of
pretty things to do. You keep moving
right along. You won't want to forget
our Niponese souvenir pagoda where every
item is the real McCoy. That's right.
Keep moving, that's the ticket.
Sergeant, you've been standing there
some time now.
During this, MAY and Archie talk.
'.s 32 and pretty. Its a nice day but Archie is
not happy. Polo, Warren, maybe Petulia mostly it's
kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and May have
been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to
her feet, doing everything just right, even this.
0 She puts away her portable martini kit.
ARCHIE
Nobody in the world can sit on the
grass and not wrinkle.
She looks.
ARCHIE
No, perfect. Not even a blade of
grass. Why don't I marry you, May?
MAY
Why don't you, Ar^hie?
They walk along holding hands. Archie should feel
better than he does.
ARCHIE
Tell me about Bobby Kennedy.
She looks at him, smiling.
ARCHIE
(SHRUGGING)
Picasso? Pickles?
She smiles tolerantly as they walk along.

ARCHIE
Choose a subject. Ice cubes. Any
damn thing. Take either side. Talk
for thirty seconds against ice cubes.
MAY
(EASILY)
Why the hostility, Archie?
ARCHIE
That dress shop of yours. "Boutique."
I've never seen one of those ... your
rubber mannequins .. I've never once
seen the pipe sticking out of their
bottoms. Not once, not one damn time.
That bothers me, May.
May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or
amused. Shets a little of both.
ARCHIE
I'm not hostile, it's frustration.
In all that perfection, how could a
clumsy clot like me possibly be
fitted in? I mean, without spoiling
the whole effect.
They have now reached the area of the stunted trees.
Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are
improvising on the stage and shouting.
MAY
Don't worry about it. You'll be
going back to Polo.
ARCHIE
No, she's found a fellah.
MAY
Oh.
She watches the kids for a moment.
MAY
I'd just about given up on you,
ARCHIE
What I should do is marry you.
For May this has been said once too often. She is now

thoroughly annoyed.

33 CONTINUED)
KAY
Archie, if it would please you, I'll
submit a list of my faults, some of
which might shake you up a bit.
ARCHIE
It would be a fake list.
MAY
Probably, It wouldn't be a fake
list. Actually, I wear arch supports,
my depilatory causes a nasty little
rash, and I've lost 10% of my hearing
in less than a year .. Okay?
ARCHIE
OKAY;
They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and hurry toward
the parking lot for Archie's car.
Petulia waits on the steps. When she is not being observed,
when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems
utterly forlorn. This is such a moment. But then she sees
Archie and May and instantly she is "with it."
ARCHIE
Well of all people.
PETULIA
All that crap about the humanitarian-
ism of the medical profession.
She darts alongside the building and begins frantically
calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an
"aloha" hat,
May looks at Archie questioningly.
ARCHIE
Don't ask.
Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May
on the steps.
PETULIA
(ACCUSINGLY)
Archie, this is Mr. Howard.

I was looking at the foundation.
Once in a while you find one from
before the earthquake. It's a thrill,
believe you me.

Petulia resents any sense of cordiality at this
particular time.
PETULIA
Mr. Howard is the'watchman for

PETULIA
No wonder people are becoming cynical
about doctors.
ARCHIE
I tried to return it. The place
was locked.
MR. HOWARD
No harm done,
PETULIA
 I didn't expect this of you,

ARCHIE)
The "Friends of the Evergreen" are
very proud of their brass band.
MR. HOWARD

PETULIA
Stay out of this, Mr. Howard.
She sees May watching all this with wry amusement.
PETULIA
I'm Petulia Danner. I'm sorry about
this.

At this time of night hardly a car remains. Archie's car
is quite by itself.

ARC HIE
Shall I drop you off?
(she doesn't answer)
It's too late for the bus.
She gets in.
38 INT . CAR
ARCHIE
Petulia, you've got to stop following
me around like this.
Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring
him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never
seen before.
ARCHIE
Where to? I could use a steak sandwich.
There's a jazz joint that stays open
all night.
He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him,
 awkwardly, aggressively.
ARCHIE
(SURPRISED)
Hey, come on m why this sudden
Petulia is relentless and voracious. Her hands and mouth
are everywhere on Archie. A car is a lousy bedroom but
it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be
stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces
her to stop.
ARCHIE
No.
PETULIA
Yes.
ARC HIE
Not here.
Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling
basket of groceries. There is no one else on the street.
In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-
lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there,
but making no sound. Petulia quizzically looks up at the
silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the
car. Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at
him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting
0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.
46
He has barely gone ten steps when he is stopped by a
whistle. He turns. Her head is popped out the door (or
window). Anything to hold him, anything.
PETULIA
If somebody calls and wants medical advice on
something really obscure, is it okay if I
wing it on my own?
He makes an amused "you nuts" gesture and leaves, but
not before Petulia says:
PETULIA
Phone.
He is gone.
 A cruise boat that takes tourists across the bay is ready
to go.
0 47 CONTINUED
Mike and Steven, Archie's sons, are anxiously waiting for
their father to join them. Archie is in a phone booth
next to the ramp that leads to the boat. The boys are
yelling to Dad to come ono
ARCHIE
(into phone)
Hi,
(to boys)
Shut up, you guys,
PETULIA'S VOICE
Hi. What's all the noise?
ARCHIE
Mike.
PETULIA
Fat Mike?
ARCHIE
He's not all that fat.
During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-

tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have
brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver.
Petulia and David in their convertible. David has passed
out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
time trying to move the car out of the parking space.
Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to
sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees
Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like
0 Oliver?) ,
50
Thousands of cars are waiting to get through. Hot, noisy,
dusty, unbearable. Kids storm every car, hustling their
captured audience. Among them is Oliver. Have the others
been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the
heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.
(NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie
and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal
and they know it and are amused by its banality.)
PETULIA: I was dozing.
ARCHIE: That's good.
PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.
ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.
PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had
eggs or waffles.
ARCHIE: I'm fine.
PETULIA: Me too.
PAUSE
PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple juice.
ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk.
Breakfast is a very important meal.
PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that.
ARCHIE: Well, goodbye.
0 PETULIA: Archie?
ARCHIE: Yes?
PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.
Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons
toward the boat. He is very pleased with his absolutely
nothing phone conversation.
Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.
The boat is passing Alcatraz Island. Archie and the boys
are standing at the rail,
ARCHIE
They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible.
Same scene, different Sunday. Warren and the boys are
standing at the rail.
WARREN
They used to think that escape from that
prison was impossible.

We resume with Archie and the boys.
SI

MIKE
Yes, Dad. Warren told us that last week.
ARCHIE
Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere
else. I didn't know you had been.
STEVIE
(the youngest)
We thought maybe you had never been, Dad.
ARCHIE
No - well, thanks, actually I haven't
been before, Stevie.
MIKE
In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore.
ARCHIE
Who doesn't?
MIKE
Mom thinks he's getting a little old for
being called Stevie, in fact.

ARCHIE
I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all
calling you Stevie two weeks ago -- I was.
STEVIE
Before that.
MIKE
Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you
can get out of anything if you want to bad
enough.
ARCHIE
That's what Warren said, eh?
MIKE
Yes, Dad.
53 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BOAT
The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the
boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept.
Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep
a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,
it is difficult.
 MIKE :
(to another kid)
Doctors can do things like that. Call
their patients from wherever they are.
Archie finishes the call and returns to them, smiling.
52
53 CONTINUED
ARCHIE
How about clams on the wharf when we get back?
MIKE
Clams make Steve vomit.
ARCHIE
Oh.
MIKE
You forgot that.
ARCHIE
No, it just slipped my mind.
Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are
somewhere else.
During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is
so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,
Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,
passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over
the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful
face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery
red from the sun.
Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,
dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,
dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is
just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently
hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown
out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.
But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than
he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is
it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it
that "useless" that goads her?
53
55 CONTINUED
Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two
kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.
The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by
the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the
convertible on through.
Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.
Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and
zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first
moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's
tough little face.
During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-
phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.
ARCHIE: Hi, there.
PETULIA: Hello.
ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.
PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,
ARCHIE: I will, I will.
PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.
ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.
PETULIA: Like what?
ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different
things on the menu.
PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french
fries or baked beans.
ARCHIE: Okay.
PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.
ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.
PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?
ARCHIE: Yes.
PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.
ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.
PETULIA: If they grill it,
ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.
PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.
ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
PETULIA: It's such a problem.
ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.
PETULIA: Phone.
The sign says all the dreadful penalty of being caught
in the fort. Archie takes the boys in.
ARCHIE
Warren take you here?
MIKE
No.
ARCHIE
He would see the sign, eh? See
ARCHIE
Alright?
The boys look at him uncertainly.
ARCHIE
(CONTINUING)
Its ten to two. Can you imagine that?
The time really went
The boys know that means he wants to take them home.

He's going to cry I guess -- he does that.
Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on
0
a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
oxygen mask over her mouth.
We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
seem like a nightmare.
The dog's owner goes berserk.
DOG'S OWNER
Don't you hit Lennie!
Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
spoken together.
1ST TENANT

2ND TENANT
It could be a gas leak.

0 3RD TENANT
She's dead.
4TH TENANT
Those rescue cops never give up.
5TH TENANT
Yes'. but they're all racists.
Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
Jungle by helicopters.
Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
the steps. Everything is chaos.
The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
which way - all in the name of saving her life.
7TH TENANT

(a rich old queen in
purple Bermuda shorts)
I had trouble like that with my piano. Two
hundred dollars to bring it through the window.
And its never been the same.
A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.
This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.
The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the
hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a
break on their way north.
Among the cars many are filled with bull fight
afficianados.
It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of
exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,
recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects
of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.
Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who
0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say
"Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a
cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.
59
63 CONTINUED
David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange
juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but
saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to
make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at
Petulia, all through the bubbles.
PETULIA
Say hello to "Petulia"s Folly."
David says nothing.
DAVID
Oh?
PET ULIA
(with careful wit)
If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd,
feast your eyes on this little goodie.
DAVID
Whats the problem?
PETULIA
(to Oliver)
Why can't you speak English?

Why the hell don't they teach them English?
This little hustler picked me up in Tijuana --
DAVID

What's your name?
PETULIA
I've got a name for him!
Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is
getting uneasy.
O LIVER

ally.
DAVID
(to Petulia)
Get in. It's still a long drive. We'll
never get home.
PETULIA
Okay. He can wait inside. The cashier's a
sweet old dear. I'll have him keep an eye on
the ckeeky little bugger!
0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense,
wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't.
DAVID
You promised "Oliver" "San Francisco."
PETULIA
I did not.
DAVID
Like hell you didn't'.
David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the
wheel. He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver.
Petulia hesitates.
DAVID
I dig, bitch, I dig!
She's stunned. His hand reaches out and brutally jerks
her into the car.
DAVID
I dig.
CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia's frightened face. Now suddenly
0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in
her throat; and she's unconscious.
62
Petulia begins sobbing, and trying to tug the boy
toward the lift.
DAVID
Hands off!
The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David
tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins
to cry.

It won't fit any place.
Petulia somehow gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the
button. which starts it moving upward.
DAVID
(calling up)
I don't want any hard feelings' It
was nothing personals Hey, we'll look
you up sometime; When we're down that
way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta;
We'll have a ball; "Oliver?"
During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver,
Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he
has David's watch in his fist.
OL I VER
He give me!
Petulia stares out toward the sea. Davis is still screaming
atl.them, and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor
of morning coming to San Francisco.

73 INT, HOSPITAL'S UNDERGROUND GARAGE DAY
Archie is maneuvering his car out of his parking space when
he sees the nun of the Intense Care Unit cross to another
car driven by another nuns There are many cars with many
nuns zooming around,
ARCHIE
How's your patient?
NUN
Oh, Mrs. Danner.
ARCHIE
Mrs. Danner. How's Mrs. Danner?
NUN
She woke up awhile ago.
ARCHIE
She woke up?
NUN
Should .I have called you`d
0
Archie starts out of the car.
71
73 CONTINUED
?N
She's asleep now. I'm, to buy her blue
Cornflowers and a hairbrush. Sister
Teresa phoned the police. Prayers help,
Dr. Bollena She asked for Mr. Danner.
I hope there's no orthopedic problem.
But really she's not all that bad, this nun, mostly she
believes that the sanctity of marriage happens to be true.
She is not unmoved by the look of exhaustion on Archie's
face.
NUN
Blue Cornflowers.
They exchange a smile.
NUN
I'm'also to go all the way across town
and deliver a message to the Mendoza
family, I'm to tell them everything
is okay. And give them this.
ARCHIE
Let me.

He takes the envelope on which the address has been written.
This is the house in which Oliver is boarding. Now, as
Archie drives up, there is no sign of anybody. Archie
crosses to the door, puzzled. He knocks on the door but
there is no answer. He goes around to the back. There's
an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no
sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally
the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican
we have seen earlier. He has been awakened from sleep and
is annoyed.
ARCHIE
Mr. Mendoza?
Mendoza yawns sleepily.
ARCHIE
I'm Dr. Bollen. Do you know Mrs.
Danner? Petulia Danner?
MENDOZA

No hablo ingles. Lo siento.
72
74. Continued
ARCHIE
Petulia Danner. She gave me this
address,
The Mexican shakes his head in complete indifference, is
already thinking about going back to sleep, and starts
closing the door,
ARCHIE
She was beaten. Almost to death. Are
you Mr. Mendoza?
MEXICAN
"Mendoza," si,
ARCHIE
(giving envelope)
This is for you,
MEXICAN
Gracia.
He starts to open the envelope. It contains a twenty dollar
bill,
ARCHIE
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Mendoza, with no idea what Archie is saying, starts closing
the door and pocketing the money.
ARCHIE
HEYP
He pounds on the door. The door opens. The Mexican says in
SPANISH:
MEXICAN
(in Spanish)
I work all night. Go away.
He closes the door. Archie pounds on the door again.
He hurts his hand. He sucks on the slight wound. He kicks
at the door. He crosses around to the front of the house,
A negro and a white teenager are passing.
ARCHIE
Do either of you fellows speak Spanish?
a NEGRO TEENAGER
I speak a lot of Polish, if it would be
any help, sir.
73
 74 Continued
ARCHIE
I've got to talk with this man in here.
A woman was almost beaten to death.
TEENAGER
Here?
ARCHIE
Not here.
TEENAGER
You said here,
NEGRO
Almost, but not quite to death, sir?
ARCHIE
Yes.
TEENAGER
Here but not quite here?
ARCHIE
Listen, just find a cop, huh;
 NEGRO TEENAGER
He'd better speak Polish, sir. I'm on
a fantastic Polish kick.
The two chase each other down the street yelling "Da:" and
"Paderewskii" and even "Yawohl;", etc,
Archie looks at the house and then at his car and then at his
bruised hand. He's furious A police car passes'. Archie
looks, but somehow can't bring himself to hail it. He
wonders why he let the police car pass. He goes back to his
car,
75 INTO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT DAY
Archie moves swiftly to the screened cubicle that held
Petulia. He goes inside. He stops short. An old man lies
in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from
swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness. His
false teeth lie on the table beside him. Archie is plunged
deeper into the sense of the unreal.
The end of Sc. 72 is very quickly replayed.
During Sc. 79E and 80 we continue to hear Mr. Danner:. Its
a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of
mo'rnin'g. Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at
what has been done to him. A few other early travelers are
about.- As the bus comes into sight, Oliver, grasping his last
chance of freedom, suddenly darts away. IN A SERIES OF
FLASHES we see Oliver; hit by a car; the look of agony on
Petuliaa's face; the reaction of the spectators; and finally
the ultimate image: the boy pinned under the wheel.
MR.. DANNER'S VOICE
(during preceding scene)
David and I went at it hot and heavy.
About the value of psychiatry. I mean
sensible psychiatry. None of that "Sex-
is-the-reason-for-everything" junk. It
E won't ever replace a visit to the wood-
shed and a good whack across the backside,
but its late in the old ball game for that.
82
81 JN 7-1 o PETULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
 The nun reappears.
NUN
I'm sorry Sir, but it's time for the
lady's medication.
MR. DANNER
Does anyone ever report how filthy
this room is?
He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds
imaginary objects on the floor.
MR, DANNER
Look at this'. Look at this! I
personally raised fifty thousand
dollars for this Hospital during
the last campaign. You didn't
know that did you; Well ask Mr,
Pearl'. I mean if you knew what
he looked like'. Filthy'.
He gets up to go, The nun leaves, Mr. Danner brushes
imaginary dust from his knees. He's perspiring, dis-
hevelled, and still hasnt said what he came to say.
He waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice
40
without even looking at him:
PETULIA
Tell David, it's alright. He can
come out of the cupboard.
The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a
jolly voice.
MR. DANNER
Chin up'.
81A ROLLER DERBY
This time we are with the T.V. CAMERAMAN, and we are
looking through his scanner. We see all the excited
people, but among them sit Archie and Polo, as cold as
death. Suddenly, on the scanner, we see Polo rise and
begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her,
Archie makes no move to stop them.
Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the
cliff. At the front of the house we see David and two
colored men at work on the wharf. At the wharf is the
yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins
ringing the bell.
Archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the
cliff. He can't get away fast enough. He climbs into
the lift and pushes the button. The lift begins moving,
but too slowly for him. He hops off the lift and begins
scrambling up the side of the cliff.
Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff
as he staggers toward her. Since everything is taking
place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is.
PETULIA
(CONTINUING)
Where else could I go? A lonely hotel
room? I don't have a penny of my own.
Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left
alone. I thought I'd try it for a few
days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's
fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame,
it's you, Archie.
ARCHIE
(GASPING)
Me?I.o
In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving
majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia
to safety.
PETULIA'S VOICE
(CONTINUING)
9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance?
As though you really meant it.
ARCHIE'S VOICE
I didn't know what to do. I was going
from one moment to the next.
PETULIA'S VOICE
Spectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds
familiar, Archie.
Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.
PETULIA'S VOICE:
No, it's not your fault.
87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY
Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because
she has something very serious to say to Archie. She
is with him on the rocks below the bridge.
PETULIA
I went back to the house because I owed it
to David. I have a brown thumb when it
comes to men. I put them on the Cross and
call them Jesus. And there they hang. I
don't know why I do it. Not because of any
high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you
only knew...
89
87E Continued
She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David
standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white
blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must
sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment
in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.
PETULIA
Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot
three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did
that. I'd ruin you, Archie.
Archie has neared the top of the cliff. His pants are
ripped, his hands are scraped, he is gasping in anguish.

PETULIA'S VOICE
I'd ruin you. In five weeks, I'd be
running around with a black eye.
By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is
a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist
maniacally.
89 EXT0 MUIR WOODS DAY
During the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is
trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice
sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It
is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are
being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the
background Archie's two children are playing with
Warren's child.
WARREN
It's never too soon to think of the
boys' education.
Warren winks at him knowingly.
ARCHIE
Have you thought of doing something
about that?
90
89 CONTINUED
WARREN
What ?
ARCHIE
; ; ^ ^ ,, That twi Lch v v d.
WARREN
What twitch? I don't have a twitch.
ARCHIE
You do. Come and see me. Don't touch
it, it'll give you a phobia. I'll fix
it for free.
WARREN
Thanks, I will. You know, I like you
more t han I ever thought I would.
ARCHIE
Warren, you're a beautiful human being.
They turn to watch the boys at play.
Nearby, the guide is explaining something to the Indians.
INDIAN CHILD
What happens next?
GUIDE
Spring.
Archie smiles hoeefully.
90 INTO A MARVELOUS RESTAURANT NIGHT
Beyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of
San Francisco. Archie and May are having champagne
cocktails. They clink glasses and look at each other
through candlelight. Archie spills some of his cock-
tail but May doesn't spill a drop. Archie smiles
hopefully.
91 INTO DISCOTHEQUE NIGHT
Archie dances with many girls, some hippies, some chic,
all terribly young and unsmiling. Archie smiles
hopefully.
For the first EQ ENCE BEGAN Archie is
not smiling. He _L z ri g at Petulia. Archie and his
boys are riding on ou side of a cable car. The car
has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going
the other way. in the other car is Petulia by herself.
Petulia waves f.rst. Archie waves back. Petulia has
shopping parcels.
AR C HIE
You look better.
PETULIA
Feel marvelous. Michael and Stevie?
Archie nods,
ARCHIE
We?-re going to see the penguins.
Everything okay with your
PETULIA
Oh yes, fine.
The cars start down their separate ways.
Archiets car is parked on the cliff.
The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned.
Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand.
The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia.
Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is.
He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats.
Theoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South
America. Mostly, we SEE the yacht.

97A Continued
Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better
now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her,
a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
mostly of music.
David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries.
He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow
uneasy.
DAVID
Hi.
PETULIA
Did you get mama on the plane all right?
DAVID
Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor
mamats stomach problems are far from over.
He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks
about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one
of the windows that looks down into the cabin.

David rushes to Petulia. Of course the orange did no damage
whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them. He
flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange,
DAVID
Papa went with her at the last minute.
Petulia REACTS, shocked.
DAVID
(CONTINUING)
She was so pale and seared. They aren't
even pressurized. The plane. You suck
on a tube and hope it's oxygen.
S
During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into
segments, which he now tries to feed her.
DAVID
Open.
PETULIA
How could he have gone? Just like that?
DAVID
Where mama is concerned, papa is a very
loving man. Open.
Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems
about to leave the yacht.
DAVID
Please don't.
PETULIA
He Dromised;
DAVID
Honey. It'll be okay, Cross my heart.
0 PETULTA
He promised.

0 97C Continued
A middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their
luxurious yacht which is anchored close by. They are
trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio,
W OMAN
Hello there you gorgeous people.
Everyone's invited for Margueritas
and cha-cha-cha.
PETULIA
(DAZEDLY)
Mr. and Mrs. Danner are gone,
WOMAN
(a`s corny as this)
Oooh la la; Lucky you;
The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know
what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly,
Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David
surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.
Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
David is humming along with the music.
PETULIA
We didn't have to come back this early..
DAVID
You're still not one hundred per cent
well.
They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside.
Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and
in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps
into the cabin.
97E INTO CABIN
DAVID
Icy hands.

DAVID
So they say,
Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing,
DAVID
(CONTINUING)
I didn't tell papa to leave.
She doesn't answer.
DAVID
(CONTINUING)
He only had the clothes on his back.
She doesn't answer.
DAVID
(CONTINUING)
I didn't.want him to leave.
PETULIA
All right, David.
 DAVID
"All right, David," through chattering
teeth.
Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk.
DAVID
Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a
coward. T won't ever again. I'd
stick my hand into a garbage disposal.
I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up,
Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David
abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare
pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia.
She sits up in panic.
DAVID
Hang on to it. If I come for you let
me have a flare. Between the eyes.
I'll melt in ten seconds.
Petulia is touched.

They are enjoying the nonsense. Then on "Men of Science':
0 97F DAVID'S IMAGE:
His finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is
the nameplate "DR, A. BOLEN." The door finally opens and
Petulia is standing there in Archie's hooded sweatshirt.
Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie's apartment.
She knows he has come here to kill her,
97G The image ends. David is abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia
is carried away by memory.
PETULIA
The first time I saw you, you were being
charming to- somebody who didn't buy a
boat after all, You were wearing a light
blue turtleneck sweater. Your sunglasses
wre'pushed up into your hair. You had
sandals, but'-no socks. Trying. to sell a
forty foot yacht without socks. I had
never seen anything so perfect. "He's
not real. He's one of those plastic
gadgets Americans do so well. Ah, but
I want one."

Then Petulia sees Archie beside her bed. He is wearing
his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the place.
PETULIA
They can't keep any secrets around here.
ARCHIE
When did you get back?
PETULIA
A year ago. You didn't forget me,
ARCH IE
How could I? All those laughs.
He dabs a Kleenex on her sweat-beaded face.
ARCHIE
So, Things go better with Mr. and Mrs. Danner,
PETULIA
Obviously,
They look at each other tenderly.

PETULIA
Why did you let me get away?
ARCHIE
Bad timing. Dumb Archie.
PETULIA
Girls like me are very rare, Archie
Archie cannot endure this,
ARCHIE
(SUDDENLY)
I could.call an ambulance. Take you to a
private hospital in Oakland. If we didn't
make it in time, so what, I don't know
