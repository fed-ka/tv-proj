A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
turn the handle.
Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
nose, runs up to her, bawling.
CHANDRA
Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
LETTY
(to Chandra)
Goodness, this is a bad one.
Tip
your head back.
She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
staining it for all eternity.
Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
LETTY
Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch
it.
A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra
sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a
limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.
Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor
her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball
game.
4.
LETTY
No cherry drops, Jenny.
(into the phone)
Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul
Lascher.
(beat)
Could you tell him it's Letty?
(beat)
He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell
him that they went for my math
idea. Thanks.
Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball
and moves in to break them up.
LETTY
(to boys)
Not so rough, guys.
(into phone)
Mom? Hi. You'll never guess
what...I've got the best news.
(beat)
No, about work. How about dinner?
Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches
Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She
blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.
LETTY
(to Jenny)
You're in trouble, young lady.
(into the phone)
I know, Mom. But it's the only
place I can call from.
(beat)
Can you tell Ruth about dinner?
(beat)
Paul's fine, just fine.
The class bell BUZZES.
LETTY
Got to go, Mom.
The monsters call.
RUTH
She says she won't even come if Dad
brings Monica.
LETTY
Mom won't miss your wedding.
She'll come around. I promise she
will.
Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where
Bobby waves the turtle over his head.
RUTH
How?
LETTY
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.
(beat)
A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics
and they'll be ours.
RUTH
Maybe if we had them both to dinner
or something.
Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are
lobbing the turtle back and forth.
LETTY
Maybe.
RUTH
You always throw the best dinner
parties, Letty.
12.
Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth.
LETTY
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where
you're going.
RUTH
Please, Letty.
LETTY
Mom and Dad? At dinner together?
Are you crazy?
Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs.
Letty pats
her shoulder.
LETTY
Maybe, though. Maybe it would
work. I could throw you an
engagement party maybe.
RUTH
Really?
Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth.
She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction.
LETTY
(nodding toward Gail)
You know what, Ruthie? I better get
back to my class, OK?
RUTH
And the party?
LETTY
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Ruth grabs Letty in another hug.
RUTH
Thank you so much.
Letty stands outside the waiting room door.
She tucks her
blouse into her jeans and enters.
Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace
overlooking the garden. Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and
stares out at the scenery.
PAUL
It's prettier here than I thought
it would be.
LETTY
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
PAUL
Are you all right?
LETTY
That's a big question.
PAUL
I hope it wasn't something I did.
LETTY
Something you did?
PAUL
That put you in here.
LETTY
Of course not, no.
(beat)
Is that why you're here?
PAUL
I think we need to talk about some
things.
LETTY
Yes, I suppose so.
PAUL
This has been really difficult,
this whole thing.
(MORE)
49.
PAUL(cont'd)
These past few weeks, it's made me
really go back and examine our
whole relationship.
(beat)
I mean, we've been going out for
four years, and it hasn't always
been so easy.
LETTY
No.
PAUL
Especially this last year.
LETTY
(softly)
Especially now.
PAUL
So, I've been thinking a lot...
LETTY
I have too, Paul.
PAUL
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and
I think it's about time...
LETTY
I know. We can't just keep going
through the motions.
PAUL
Exactly. It's time to make
decisions.
LETTY
You don't have to say anything
else. I've known for a while that
this was coming.
PAUL
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
Paul takes Letty's hand in his.
PAUL
Will you marry me?
Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on
Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized.
50.
PAUL
I had to smuggle it in here. I
guess you're not really supposed to
have jewelry.
LETTY
(by rote)
Or be up past ten or fraternize
with other patients.
PAUL
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis
cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with
emeralds around it, but this was
simpler, more classic in its lines.
(beat)
L
Letty?
LETTY
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
PAUL
You can take it back and we can
have one custom made if you want.
LETTY
No, you've done a perfect job.
PAUL
So, what do you say, Let?
Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time.
LETTY
Do you think, really, that it's OK
to get engaged when I'm in here?
PAUL
Sure. We'll save the formal
announcement for when you're out. I
already told your mother. I hope
you don't mind.
LETTY
No, no.
PAUL
So will you?
LETTY
(working up a smile)
Of course. Yes. I will.
I do.
51.
Paul and Letty kiss, then hug.
It's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw
her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her.
MICHAEL
You missed out on some great
broccoli florets at dinner.
LETTY
I wasn't hungry.
MICHAEL
John even managed to lob a load of
mashed potatoes into Mrs.
Hallstrom's milk.
LETTY
(smiling)
Finally. I was getting tired of
watching him try every night.
MICHAEL
Was it bad news--the visit from
Peter?
LETTY
Paul.
MICHAEL
He looked pretty serious.
LETTY
He asked me to marry him.
MICHAEL
Very romantic setting.
LETTY
It was romantic.
He's very
romantic.
MICHAEL
So are you engaged, or what?
Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael
bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he
does so.
Letty pulls away. The ring is gone.
52.
LETTY
What have you done with the ring?
MICHAEL
It's magic.
Letty stands up.
LETTY
This isn't funny.
Paul would kill
me.
Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty.
MICHAEL
Guess which hand.
LETTY
Enough with the abracadabra.
MICHAEL
Guess.
LETTY
T
he left one.
Michael opens his hand.
It's empty.
Michael addresses an
imaginary audience.
MICHAEL
(to audience)
The fair maiden guesses
incorrectly. Should we give her
one more try?
(to Letty)
The audience says one more try.
What guess you now?
LETTY
The right one.
Michael opens his right hand. A plastic, Cracker-jack ring
rests in it.
LETTY
Come on, Michael.
Michael grabs Letty's hand and slides the ring onto her
finger.
MICHAEL
With this ring, I thee...
53.
Letty pulls her hand away.
LETTY
Really, this isn't funny.
MICHAEL
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Letty holds out her hand.
MICHAEL
For a price.
LETTY
Good God.
MICHAEL
A small price.
LETTY
I won't do your portion of kitchen
cleanup.
MICHAEL
No.
LETTY
And I'm not covering for you when
you sneak out to call Dominos.
MICHAEL
I want a kiss.
Letty stares at him.
She laughs.
LETTY
Get serious.
Michael moves close to her.
MICHAEL
I'm serious.
Letty looks into his eyes.
LETTY
(softly)
Everything's a joke with you.
Michael and Letty kiss, long and deep. Letty pulls back.
She gazes at Michael. She steps closer to him.
They kiss again, longer and deeper.
54.
They separate. Letty looks ready for another kiss.
Michael
caresses her cheek.
He walks back toward the hospital door. He stops, comes back
to Letty. He hands her the diamond ring.
MICHAEL
Here.
He walks inside.
Letty watches him go.
Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned
hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a
cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor
hospital that looms large in the background.
Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the
University of South Carolina Cocks.
LETTY
I can't believe you finally gave me
the shirt.
RUTH
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you
get out of here.
LETTY
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
RUTH
I can hardly wait 'til you're free.
Planning the wedding without you
has been a disaster.
LETTY
You're slowing.
RUTH
(picking up the pace)
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes
over whether we should go with ecru
invitations or brilliant white.
Letty checks her stop watch.
RUTH
What do you think?
LETTY
Ecru.
RUTH
And then the gold scroll or the
black Romanesque print?
Letty completely stops and faces Ruth.
LETTY
Do we have to talk wedding details?
57.
RUTH
Oh, no, of course not.
LETTY
I mean, you can always send me
fabric samples to look at or
pictures of dresses. But, it's
been so long since we've seen each
other.
RUTH
Of course. You're right. Besides,
we should be talking about your
engagement.
They start walking again.
LETTY
Tell me more about Beast beating up
that other cat.
RUTH
Bloody furry mess, like I said.
(beat)
Aren't you so excited about Paul?
(
beat)
Letty?
Ruth stops this time.
RUTH
What's going on with you, Letty?
LETTY
Ruthie, do you ever wonder if
you'll meet someone else...someone
besides Jake?
Power walking's forgotten.
Ruth and Letty start to amble.
RUTH
What's his name, Letty?
LETTY
I didn't say...
RUTH
Don't even try.
What's his name?
Michael pays the DOMINO'S PIZZA MAN and tries to walk past
the guard, JIM, who blocks his path.
JIM
I'm afraid I can't let you take
that in without the proper invoice.
MICHAEL
It's a pizza.
JIM
All the same, rules are rules.
61.
MICHAEL
You don't understand. This is a
very important, very special,
morale-boosting pizza.
JIM
What I understand is how low morale
gets when you're posted at a guard
station all night, Val.
Reluctantly, Michael opens the pizza box, and Jim helps
himself to two slices. Michael starts to shut the box. Jim
reaches in for a third slice.
CUT TO:
Letty lies in the middle of a copse of trees, reading Emily
Dickinson. Michael walks up and hands her a dandelion.
MICHAEL
A daisy for the lady.
LETTY
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
MICHAEL
A rose is a rose.
67.
Letty kisses him on the cheek.
LETTY
Thanks.
Where've you been all day?
MICHAEL
Back-to-back sessions with the
shrink.
LETTY
Sounds important.
MICHAEL
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
LETTY
Really?
Me too.
MICHAEL
I had to sneak by the guards to get
here. They say you're highly
unstable, have a depressive
personality, and may hold back my
own recovery.
LETTY
Wow.
I'm bad news.
MICHAEL
What's my rap?
LETTY
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by
hallucinations and paranoid
delusions.
MICHAEL
Fuck.
That's all true.
Letty laughs.
MICHAEL
Really, though. My thoughts go
haywire sometimes.
LETTY
What are the delusions like?
MICHAEL
I think people are after me, crap
like that.
(beat)
(MORE)
68.
MICHAEL(cont'd)
When I was 18, my mom came home and
found me sitting naked on the
kitchen table. I thought I was God.
He waits for Letty to register the information.
MICHAEL
Shocking, huh?
LETTY
Sure. But I took out a whole
grocery store.
MICHAEL
I wish I could have seen that.
LETTY
I'm starting to think that
everyone's crazy to some extent.
MICHAEL
M
y Grandma Rosa says that some
trees get planted in rich top soil,
and they grow right up to the sun,
tall and straight. Other trees,
they start as seeds in the crevices
between rocks so they have to twist
and bend to reach the light.
(beat)
But even though they end up
crooked, they're still trees, just
like the straight ones.
Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the
leaves overhead.
MICHAEL
(with a start)
Why in the world did you let me
start talking in metaphors? That's
no way for us to break up.
LETTY
Break up?
They wish.
Michael and Letty hug.
The place buzzes with festivity. A "WELCOME FAMILIES" sign
hangs from a patio beam. A table is laden with cookies and
lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls.
Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael
plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA.
Nurse Gates walks up to Letty.
NURSE GATES
Your mother's in the rec room,
Letty.
72.
Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and
grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride.
82.
Paul walks out the door and down the steps past Michael, who
runs up them two at a time.
84.
MICHAEL
How's it hanging, Paul?
Paul turns to watch Michael as Michael swings open the door
and sails into the institute.
Crowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully
at a shopping cart that is stuck to another.
A MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and
yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael,
grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store.
M
ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his
step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store...
88.
Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself
that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of
useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and
about 20 decorative pillows.
Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens.
MRS. MAYER
Must you walk so quickly?
LETTY
It's good exercise, Mom.
MRS. MAYER
I've got 26 years on you. If we
could just slow down, we could talk
so much easier.
Letty slackens her pace.
MRS. MAYER
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving
next week. If you want me to pick
you up, I will.
LETTY
I've already made arrangements.
MRS. MAYER
Ruthie mentioned that Michael might
be coming for you.
Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother.
LETTY
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but
you're not allowed to mention
Michael.
MRS. MAYER
Not even if it's something
positive?
LETTY
Nyet.
That's the condition.
Mother and daughter keep walking in silence.
MRS. MAYER
Have you spoken to Paul at all?
89.
LETTY
One more and you're out.
MRS. MAYER
Honestly, Letty.
LETTY
A deal's a deal.
The two walk on in silence.
Silence.
More silence.
MRS. MAYER
Have you heard the figure on how
much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay
in taxes this year?
Letty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother,
then hugs her.
L
LETTY
I knew you had it in you.
In the background, the Spanish-style mission blends into the
hillside. Letty and Michael sit on a bluff, holding hands.
They look out at the ocean, where the sun heads toward the
waves in a fiery red glow.
91.
Michael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with
bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers.
He passes two ladies who gossip outside the store.
LADY ONE
I can't believe he did that.
LADY TWO
What a weirdo.
Michael stops abruptly.
He turns back and looks at the
women. They LAUGH.
Michael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from
the women. He turns back and walks up to them.
MICHAEL
Don't ever talk about me again, you
hear me?
The women pull back in fright.
Letty and Michael jog.
MICHAEL
Aunt Lily is the one who married
your father's cousin?
LETTY
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is
the one who looks like a hooker.
106.
MICHAEL
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who
likes magic?
LETTY
You don't have to know all this by
Saturday. It took me years.
Letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with Michael.
She smokes a cigarette, and stares out at the ocean.
Letty remains on the bluff, crying. A priest, passing in the
background looks over at her, and continues on his way.
In the darkness, Letty lies on her back. She stares up at
the moon and stars, bright against the night sky.
Letty walks along a pathway with Paul.
PAUL
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
LETTY
I'm just glad there aren't any hard
feelings.
PAUL
Oh, none. None. I completely
understand what was going on.
LETTY
Oh.
PAUL
How's work going?
Are you back at
school?
LETTY
I start on Monday.
PAUL
So things are back on track?
LETTY
Getting back.
PAUL
I heard about your friend.
LETTY
What?
115.
PAUL
I heard your friend was back in the
hospital.
LETTY
Michael.
Yes.
PAUL
I just wondered, well, if this
meant there was a chance for us.
Because I think about you a lot,
and I still feel...
LETTY
Our relationship meant a lot to me,
too, Paul. But it's over.
(beat)
And Michael being in the hospital
doesn't really change things.
PAUL
I think I've heard this speech
before.
LETTY
I'm really sorry.
Letty reaches up to hug him.
He quickly disengages himself.
P
AUL
I've got a deposition that I really
need to get cracking on, so if you
don't mind...
LETTY
Sure, I understand.
Paul starts down the path.
LETTY
Wait. Wait.
Letty runs up to Paul.
LETTY
I need to give you this.
Letty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and
continues walking as she stares after him.
116.
Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow
her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families
conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION.
Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug.
John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register.
NURSE GATES
He's in Jamie's old room.
Letty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's
door. She KNOCKS.
MICHAEL (OS)
Come in.
Letty walks out the door, down the steps and along the front
walkway -- until, finally, the hospital recedes in the
distance.
