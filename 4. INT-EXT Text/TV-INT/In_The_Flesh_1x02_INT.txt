      KIEREN, bleary eyed, bad night s sleep in him, crosses to the 
      mirror and looks at himself: pin prick eyes, cover up mousse 
      smudged, patches of pale cold flesh underneath.

      He starts applying cover up liberally and puts in his 
        IrisAlwayscontacts. He picks up an untouched mug of tea, 
      opens his window and pours it out. He looks over to the 
      Burton house opposite where he sees KEN BURTON staring 
      blankly out the window. Catatonic with grief.

      STEVE is grilling bacon. It sizzles. SUE is sitting at the 
      table drinking juice. KIEREN walks in holding the empty mug.

      Steve puts up his hands:  my mistake . He starts serving out 
      bacon on plates.

                                    KIEREN
                    Crazy night. 

      Steve and Sue stop and look at Kieren. A moment of silence. 
      Are they going to broach the subject of MAGGIEgetting shot?  

                                    STEVE
                    Yes. Yes it was. (Beat) According 
                    to reports gale force winds reached 
                      speeds of a 160 miles per hour. 

      Kieren s got his answer: MAGGIEisn t going to be discussed.

                    Lots of trees down. The train

                    The underpass. We told them, all of 
                    us on the board, we told them last 
                    year that the drainage system was 
                    out of date and needed to be 
                      refitted but they didn t listen, 
                      completely in denial. Then three 
                      inches of rain fall and they re 
                      absolutely buggered.

                    So he s not coming to the ceremony?

      Kieren looks up to see his sister JEM coming downstairs 
      dressed in FULL HVFUNIFORM. Kieren notices she s got her 
      pistol in her belt.  

                                  SUE
                    I m going with you. 

      Jem goes to the cupboard, takes out some caramel shortbreads, 
      her staple comfort food.

                      What s the ceremony? 

      Jem looks at her parents. Their expressions urge her to stick 
      to the plan.

      Jem looks at her mum, dad and half-dead brother, takes out

                    Is fucked. 

      ..And with that she exits upstairs. Kieren looks after her. 
      He wants to say thank you for warning him about Bill, he 
      wants to say sorry for...He just wants to talk to his little 
      sister. Perhaps a one on one is in order?

      METALCORE music blares. JEM is chomping on the shortbreads 
      while playing A SHOOT EM UP VIDEO GAME on her game console 
      (she s using a laser gun controller). The game is about 
      blasting away zombies. Knock on the door. 

      The music and the video game sound effects are so loud Jem 
      doesn t even hear the knocking. Finally the door opens and 
      KIEREN tentatively enters. Jem s got some trained instincts 
      on her. She senses a presence. She turns around. Sees Kieren. 
      Snaps: 

                                  JEM
                    What you want?

      Even though he wasn t expecting a smile and a cheery hello, 
      Kieren is still knocked back by his sister s hostility. He 
      gently soldiers on with what he wanted to say:

                                    KIEREN

                    about Bill and the  -

      Jem snaps up to her feet. If Kieren thought she was hostile 
      before, he ain t seen nothing yet:

                                  JEM
                      I didn t do it for you. I did it 
                    for mum and dad. They re stupid 
                      enough they d have defended you if 
                    Bill had burst in without warning. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Well, either way, I just wanted to 
                    say thanks. 

                                  JEM
                    Not accepted. 

      Kieren stands there. Not sure what to do. Jem looks at him.

      Kieren puts his hands up (just like his Dad did in the scene 
      previous): he doesn t want a fight. Jem goes back to the 
      video game. Kieren goes to exit. Hears the sounds of the 
      violent anti-zombie game. Stops. Suddenly gets pissed off. 
      Pissed off at Jem for treating him so harshly, pissed off at 
      his parents  denial, just pissed off in general.

      STEVE enters to find SUE looking out the window at the place 
      where Maggiewas executed. Steve sees she has the cordless

      Sue relents. He has a point. But she s not happy about it.

      Bill can t hear anymore of this. He goes up the stairs.

      BILL crosses to Rick s room. Puts out his cigarette.

      Takes a deep breath. Then enters. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 7.





      It s exactly the same way the day Rick left for basic 
      training. A very teenage lad s room: macho achievements on 
      display (school football shirt with MACY on the back, 
      trophies for various sporting actives, poster of United and 
      glamour models on the walls).  

      Bill pads around the room. He stops by one of the trophies, a 
      karate statue. 

      He picks it up. Runs his hand over the inscription. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      E / I. ARMOURED TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY 47C7C

      An ARMOURED TRUCK, with tinted windows, races down the road. 
      In the front is the DRIVER (34) and, in the back, opposite an 
      ARMED MILITARY ESCORT (25), is RICK MACY (20). 

      We don t see Rick face-on, just the back of his head. His leg 
      is in a METAL BRACE. Rick (face unseen) looks out the truck s 
      tinted window and sees some graffiti:  SEND ZOMBIE DEMONS 
      BACK 2 HELL . He looks over at the Military Escort. At his 
      weapon: Is he here to protect them from me, or me from them? 

      The Military Escort feels Rick s eyes on him. Looks in his 
      direction and gives Rick such a dirty look it sends Rick back 
      to the tinted window and bare landscape outside. Rick spots a 
      motorway sign informing him he is now entering THE NORTH. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN is sitting on his bed, looking at the photographs on 
      his wall of Rick. He stands up and reaches under the BED. He 
      pulls out a SHOEBOX. Still kneeling he carefully places it on 
      the bed and opens it. He slowly takes out a card with a print 
      of a Vincent Van Goghself-portrait on it. 

      He opens it. We read the inscription inside:

      Dear Ren, Know this guy is your fav. You re gonnago far. And 
      I ll be there right next to you, telling dumb jokes and 
        embarrassing you. This shitewith me Dad. I ll sort it. Swear 
      I will. Rick x  

      It s a compulsion. It hurts to look at it, but in a weird way 
      the hurt comforts him. Proves to him that...what? He has a 
      soul? A knock at the door. STEVE enters.

                      Doesn t seem right, you up here all 
                    on yer todd. 

      What Steve really means is he doesn t want Kieren to be alone 
      because the last time he was... well he killed himself. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                    Fancy watching something? 

                                    KIEREN
                    Not sure. 

                                    STEVE
                    I ve got five new Blu-raysjust 
                    come in the post. 

      Kieren doesn't want to watch a bloody blu-ray. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                      They re not gonna watch themselves. 

      Kieren looks at his Dad. He s not taking no for an answer. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      All the curtains are drawn. It s gloomy. KIEREN and STEVE sit 
      next to each other watching an old silent movie on the wide 
      screen TV (NB: we don t see the movie, we just hear the 
      tinkly piano music) The film s jolly sound track is very much 
      at odds with the charged depressing atmosphere in the room.   

      While watching the film, Steve has the Neurotriptyline
      injector in his hand, plus a dose of Neurotriptyline. He is 
      consulting the patient information leaflet Shirley gave him 
      and Sue. A worried Kieren is watching this. Steve sees him 
      watching, tries to divert Kieren s attention.

                                    STEVE
                          (re: film, while preparing 
                            injector)
                    I ve watched this one a thousand 
                      times. Don t mind though. I like 
                      watching films over and over. No 
                      surprises. You know what yergonna
                    get second time around. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Suppose so.

                                    STEVE
                    We can watch this again straight 
                    after if yer dlike? 

      Kieren s attention is on Steve preparing the injector. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                          (re: injector)
                    Now, would yermind turning around 
                    for me, Kier?

      Kieren does, but a bit reluctantly. Steve finds the blue 
      catheter on the back of Kieren s neck.

                                    KIEREN
                    Dad, are you sure you know what 
                      you re doing?

                                    STEVE
                            (showing Kieren the 
                              leaflet)
                    Don t you worry, I ve read these 
                      instructions back to front.
                          (to Kieren, but also to 
                              himself)
                    Just like taking off a plaster; 
                      quicker yerdo it, less painful it 
                    is.

                                    KIEREN
                    Don t think that s the right-

                                    STEVE
                    Here we go!

      Steve jams the injector into Kieren s neck and pulls the 
      trigger.

      Kieren begins to convulse uncontrollably. Steve drops the 
      injector and holds onto his son. While he holds him there s a  
      KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Steve s head whips around. His face pure 
      panic.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      More knocking. STEVE is guiding a still very groggy KIEREN 
      out the lounge. He opens the door to the BROOM CUPBOARD under 
      the stairs. Kieren, though still pretty out of it because of 
      the injection, clocks what his Dad s doing. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 10.

                    No Dad... don t... I m not good in

                    Won t be for long. Promise.

      More knocking. Steve doesn t have time to be sensitive. He 
      reaches into the cupboard, finds a torch, hands it to Kieren 
      while gently pushing him into the claustrophobic space. He 
      slams the door closed and goes to the front door, opens it a 
      crack: it s not an HVF death squad, it s an ESTATE AGENT with 
        a prospective COUPLE. 

                                    ESTATE AGENT
                      Hello, MrWalker.

      Steve looks at him blankly. The AGENT reminds him.

                                      ESTATE AGENT (CONT D)
                    The 11 o clock viewing.

      Steve nods his head. The agent and couple enter. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN sits. Torch on. Trying to fight off the effects of the 
        Neurotriptyline. He can hear his Dad s muffled voice and 
      multiple footsteps.

                      whatever takes yerfancy really...

      KIEREN listens, still affected by the injection. But also now 
      growing in awareness about where he actually is. He wasn t 
      messing when he said he didn t do well in confined spaces, 
      he s been claustrophobic for years. Kieren looks around him 
      and feels hemmed in, the dark shadows look quite distorted. 
      And everything definitely feels distorted. 

      Kieren s breathing quickens.  The torchlight begins to 
      flicker. Kieren tries to fix it. But it just flickers more. 
      On the last flicker the torchlight illuminates:

      LISA LANCASTER. IN THE CUPBOARD. RIGHT BESIDE HIM. STARING AT 
      HIM.

      Kieren lets out a cry and drops his torch.

      KIEREN watches out the window as his Dad s car drives off. 
      When it s out of sight, Kieren quickly crosses to his 
      wardrobe and opens it. A number of outfits are hung up. 

      Kieren takes out a few and looks at them: Most are 
        alternative PUNK ROCK OUTFITS from his outcast mid teen 
      years. These clothes are meant to make you stand out and 
      that s the last thing he wants to wear right now. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN enters his mum and dad s room, opens a closet, and 
      looks through it. Doesn t find what he s looking for. He 
      looks around and there - in a pile of dirty laundry - it is: 
        A TRACKSUIT TOP WITH A HOODIE. Kieren picks it up. Why would 
      he want some stinking tracksuit top? 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Through a clean patch in the grubby window we see KIEREN 
      turning around and continuing to walk quickly down the street 
      towards the woods. We notice he gives the house a wide berth 
      but he can t help looking up, then quickly averting his gaze.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      NO SCENE 25



      Behind the front door, JANET and BILL both look terrified. A 
      few moments with the two of them, just their breathing. Then 
      a noise of a vehicle. Sounds of the crowd, excited chatter. 
      Bill and Janet look at each other - he s arrived.

      Janet nods. She needed that hug. She goes to break the 
      embrace. But Bill is holding on too tight. Looks like she 
      wasn t the only one in need of a cuddle.  

                                    JANET

      Bill takes a deep breath. Breaks the embrace. Looks at 
      himself in the hallway mirror. Puts his  game face  on.

      The doors slam open and KIEREN and AMY appear riding along in 
      the first cart. 

      A bored TOWNIE COUPLE are on the ride as well as well. Crappy 
       scares  start to jump out at them. Amy overplays it, 
      screaming and jumping out of her seat.

      GARY and DEAN sit opposite VICAR ODDIE and a note-taking 
      PHILIP. Vicar Oddie has a face like thunder. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    You want a wage for patrolling the

                    What about your sense of community 
                      spirit?

                                    GARY

                    Just, you know, it takes up a big 
                    chunk of the evening. Don t it, 
                    Gaz? 

      Gary nods. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE

                    Hey, Vicar. We re not saying we re

                    man short and me and Dazare gonna

                      reckon we should be compensated for 
                    that. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    What makes you believe Bill won t 
                    be doing his patrols? 

      Gary and Dean exchange a look: Oddie is way behind the curve. 

                                    GARY
                    He's got his family back. Gonna

                    The patrols are not faffingaround. 

                                    GARY
                      Whatever you say, Vicar. But if yer
                    want us out there, yergonnahave 
                    to show us some appreciation. 

                                    DEAN
                    Just want to be appreciated, Vicar. 
                      That s all. 

      Vicar Oddie stares at them. They re not going to budge. He 
      sighs. Turns to Philip.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 29.

                                    PHILIP
                      Budget s tight, but it s feasible. 

      Vicar Oddie turns back to Gary and Dean. He s lost. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      You ll get your money. 

      Gary and Dean try not to look too pleased. They stand.  

                                    GARY
                    Thank you, Vicar.

                      Tavery much. 

      Vicar Oddie gives him a sharp look. 

                                    DEAN (CONT D)
                      Vicar, Sir. (Under his breath)
                      Whatever. 

      Gary and Dean are exiting. Before they can:

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      There llbe a patrol tonight. 

      Gary and Dean stop and silently curse. They were both hoping 
      to get lathered tonight at the pub. They play a quick silent 
      game of rock, paper, scissors. Dean loses (he always loses 
      these games). Curses. Gary laughs. 

                                    DEAN
                    Why do I always lose? 

                                    GARY
                     Cos you always go fer paper yer
                    soft tart. 

      Gary and Dean exit arguing. Oddie goes over to the painting 
      of the horsemen. He s agitated. It s all slipping away. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    Has Bill been in touch. 

                                    PHILIP
                    I got through to Janet. They re 
                    going to The Legion tonight. 

      It dawns on VICAR ODDIE what that means.

      RICK sits on his bed in the middle of his pristine room. He s 
      dressed to go out in some of his old clothes: Ben Sherman 
      branded shirt, jeans, leather shoes, hair gelled. He is 
      staring at the big Utdteam poster on the wall. Thoughts 
      churning inside of him. Thoughts of Kieren. Rap on the door 
      and BILL enters holding two cans of lager. Rick snaps up, his 
      posture rigid. He literally comes to attention for his dad. 

                                    BILL
                    Not doing well. 

      Rick looks at his Dad alarmed. Has his poker face betrayed 
      him? Does Bill know how upset he is about Kieren?

                      Should. Got a right to be proud. 

      Bill opens his can and puts it up for toast. This is Rick s 
      cue to do the same. He does.

                    Aye. 

      Bill exits. 

      Rick stands there for a moment. Then grasps his stomach. The 
      liquid is burning his insides. He looks at the full can of 
      lager in his hand, waiting to be drunk. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN gets in the house. Breathes a sigh of relief -  God, 
      that was close.  He crosses the lounge. Sees out of the 
      window that STEVE, SUE and JEM are outside the front door, 
      having a clandestine pow-wow.

      After a few moments of heated words (mainly between Jem and 
      Steve), Jem walks towards the house, followed by her parents. 

      Kieren quickly goes from the window and...whatshould he do? 
      Appear normal! He sits down. Tries to act like he s been in 
      this position for ages. 

      The door goes. 

      Kieren realizes he s still holding Lisa s missing poster in 
      his hand. Shit! He stuffs it in his Dad s hoodiepocket just 
      as his sister enters. 

      Jem stops, looks at him, is she going to tell him? No she 
      silently passes. 

      Sue enters after her.  

                                  SUE
                          (trying her best to act

                    Hiya. 

      Sue nods, doesn t want to get into a big long explanation 
      about where they ve just been (Rick s welcoming home 
      ceremony).  

                                  SUE
                    Got some, uh, stuff to do. 

      Sue exits after Jem.  Steve enters.

                    Oh, hello there.

                    Got me hoodieon. 

      On Kieren realises-  Oh shit, I forgot to take it off 

      Kieren s hand goes to the pocket. If he gives it back now his 
      Dad will find the missing poster.  

                                    KIEREN
                          (goes to unzip hoodie,

                    No, no. You keep it on. It s chilly 
                    in here.  

      Kieren pull s the zipper up.

                          (lying, he doesn t even

                    Yeah, it is a bit.

      Steve smiles at Kieren and exits to go  put on the boiler  
      (Steve, like Sue, really doesn t want to hang about lest he 
      lets slip about Rick) 

      Kieren, now alone, lets out a sigh of relief -  God, now that
      was close .

      PHILIP is placing one fold out chair in a grotty corridor

      Velvet rope. This is for RICK. No one really knows what to do 
      with him. PHILIP s in a bit of a fluster, after his 
        conversation with VICAR ODDIE, this is his plan.

      The bell above the door rings. The pub tenses up as:

      It s RICK flanked by BILL and JANET. We notice Rick is 
      wearing his medals. Just like his dad wanted him to. 

      The regulars stare at Rick -  Bloody hell, here he is, in the 
      flesh . 

      PHILIP begins to tentatively approach RICK, intending to show 
      him to his  seat . He s cut short by:

                                    BILL
                      Right, 
                          (puts a hand on Rick s 
                            shoulder. A show of 
                              solidarity)
                    Who s buyin drinks fer Desert 
                      Eagle?

      The regulars look at each other -  Well, if Bill s alright 
      with Rick being in here, better fall in line . They begin to 
      offer to get drinks for Rick:  Pint of bitter, fer lad  
       Lager fer Rick   Whiskey chaser, Fer the war hero . PHILIP 
      slinks away as PEARL starts pulling multiple pints. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)

                      Grand. 

      The pints are pulled. A silence. All eyes on Rick. He picks 
      up a pint.

      SUE and STEVE around the table with KIEREN, who is pretending 
      to eat his food again. JEM isn t at the table, instead she  
      keeps her distance, standing by the door, playing with her 
      food and staring daggers at her brother.

      KIEREN opens the door to a smiling AMY. No cover up on. No

                     Cos that would have been giving

      Amy s words about giving in stir something up in Jem 
      (secretly she believes she  gave in  when she didn t do her 
       duty  in the supermarket). It s the boiling point for her 
      and before she explodes, she jumps down from the breakfast 
      bar and exits the house without a word.

                    No thanks, Mrs. Walker. My insides 
                    are pretty decrepid. I eat solids 
                    and it goes straight through. Tried 
                      eating a Mars bar couple of days 
                    ago. Had to throw away my knickers 
                    andmy skirt.

      Sue and Steve take this in. Kieren gets up. Keen to stop Amy 
      talking any more to his parents.

                    What did you croak of anyway? 

      Kieren is silent. Unconsciously rubs his covered wrists. Amy 
      looks at him. Then starts taking off her top.

                      wasn t the pain. It was the promise 
                    of a cure. Went to ten different 
                      specialists who all told me I would 
                    go into remission if I followed 
                    their trademarked treatments (and 
                    if my Nan paid up in advance). 
                      Showed them. I was dead before the 
                      cheques cleared. (BEAT) The last 
                      thought I remember thinking was 
                    that it was so unfair. I d been 
                      benched before I even got to play

                      Relief? (slowlydawning on her) How 
                    did you croak?

      Kieren takes a deep breath. He unbuttons his shirt cuffs and 
      pulls them up exposing, for the first time, TWO DIAGONAL 
      SCARS ON HIS WRISTS. Amy looks at them. Then at Kieren. 
      What s she going to do?

      What she does is put her arms around him and folds him into 
      an empathic embrace. It's such a pure caring gesture that

                    that everything fell apart.

      The door bursts open. JEM stands there, resolute. Kieren and 
      Amy are taken aback. Jem wastes no time:

      One person that looks like he d attack is BILL. But he isn t

                                    PHILIP
                          (still staring at her)
                    I - uh - I, uh, I m going to have 
                    to ask you to, uh, accompany me. 

                                  AMY
                      Where?

                                    KIEREN
                    Hi Phil. 

      Philip doesn t even acknowledge Kieren. He s all about Amy, 
      this amazing, beautifulpartially deceased creature. He s 
      absolutely awed by her.

                                    PHILIP
                      (Pointing off, still has his eyes 
                    fixed on Amy)
                    Over there.

                                  AMY
                    Who says we have to? 

                                    PHILIP
                    I m, I m Philip. I m an official of 
                    the Parish Council.

                                  AMY
                          (not impressed at all)
                    Big wows.

                                    KIEREN
                    Hey. That s good, Phil. I remember 
                      politics was always something you 
                      wanted to get into, wasn t it?  

      Philip, who s attention has been laser-sighted on Amy, 
      finally notices Kieren standing there. The spell s broken a 
      bit. 

                                    PHILIP
                    Yeah. It s, you know, a lot of 
                      pressure, a lot of work. You have 
                    these ideas about what it s going 
                    to be like and then...

                                  AMY
                    And then you re asking people to go 
                    into a segregated area. 

                                    PHILIP
                    It s not up to me. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 57.

      Amy opens her mouth to protest. Kieren beats her to it. He 
      collects his and Amy s drinks, nods for Philip to lead the 
      way, glad to get away from all the stares and whispers. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      PHILIP guides KIEREN and AMY towards the chair designated for 
      Rick and hastily pulls over another seat. 

                                  AMY
                            (sarcastic)
                    Wow, it s the VIP lounge. 

                                    PHILIP
                    (as he places the second chair)
                    Enjoy your night. 

      Philip gives Amy a sly once over, is about to leave when...

      Rick exits the mens s toilets wiping his mouth. He sees 
      Kieren. Freezes. Turns to ice. He does. If you were to go up 
      to him now and push him he d topple over and smash into a 
      million little pieces. Kieren goes up to the edge of the PDS
      sufferer area. Rick snaps back into reality. Notices out of 
      the corner of his eye Philip looking at him. 

                                    RICK
                      Alright, mate?  

      Rick sticks out his hand. It trembles ever so slightly. 
      Kieren looks at Rick. At his outstretched hand. He s stunned 
      by Rick s response. He was expecting... what? Fireworks? A 
      passionate embrace? Maybe not, not here, but certainly he 
      wasn't expecting an  alright mate  and a bloody handshake. He 
      takes Ricks hand none the less. 

                                    KIEREN
                    It s good to see you, Rick. 

                                    RICK
                    Yeah. Good to see you too, Ren. 

      Rick s eyes dart over to Philip. He takes his hand back. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    I m sitting out there. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Right. Well I can t go out there.

                    Why not?

      Kieren looks at Rick. Really? You really don t know why? 

                                    KIEREN
                      Rules.

                      Philip. 

      Rick turns to Philip. 

                                    RICK
                      Lippy, what yerdoin puttin Ren

      PHILIP backs off. Rick lifts rope for Kieren. Kieren looks at 
      Amy. 

                                    KIEREN
                      And...myfriend?

                                    RICK
                    Sure. If she must. 

      Kieren and Amy exit out the PDSsufferers  area. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN and AMY sit at RICK S table. RICK drinks and chats 
      with Kieren. GARY eyeballs Amy. 

      From the bar, BILL and JANET stare at Kieren, wary. Is the 
      past repeating itself? 

                                    RICK

                      I forgot about that. 

                                    RICK

      From across the room Philip, who is in the middle of giving 
      Amy a crafty going over, averts his gaze, pretends to be

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                    Had the whole fuckingworld at yer

                    You d got into Art School. You were 
                    out of here. Flying high.

                    It didn t matter much without you.

                    We had already said goodbye.

                    That wasn t a good bye.

                      That s what you did, Rick. That s

                    us alive.

                                    RICK

                    that why yernever told yerDad 
                    about us?

      Rick looks at him, about to say something, but he s cut off 
      by the crackle of the WalkieTalkie in the glove box. 

                                    BILL (O.S.)

                    Yeah he is.

      And with that, Rick exits the truck.

      RABID MALE ZOMBIE and RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE are shuffling 
      as fast as they can away from:

      RICK and KIEREN.  Hot on their tail.

      From another part of the clearing we see GARY and Bill join 
      the chase.

      RABID MALE ZOMBIE holding the RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE s hand 
      are shuffling towards the mine cave entrance tailed by BILL, 
      GARY, RICK and KIEREN. 

      For the zombies escape is possible if they can just enter the 
      cave and it looks like they might achieve their goal. They re 
      at the cave s mouth when:

      THE RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE IS ZAPPED BY A TASER. 

      She goes down.

      She s been zapped by DEAN who has been waiting for them at 
      the cave mouth.

      In his stupid delight, he forgets about the RABID MALE 
      ZOMBIE, who has just bitten him for zapping his daughter. 

      The posse get to them and before the Male Zombie has a chance 
      to inflect any more damage to Dean, he s taseredby GARY. 

      Dean is in a panic.  He rolls around.

                    I ve been bit! I ve been bit!

      Dean looks at Kieren. Then looks at his wrist watch. Dean 
      checks himself. No, he s not  turned  into a rotter. AWKWARD.

      Rick shakes his head. Cocks his rifle. KIEREN instinctively 
      puts his hand out to stop him. Kieren rubs his face. Cover up 
      comes off. He takes out one contact lens and looks at Rick 
      with the same eyes as the Male Zombie and the Little Girl 
      Zombie: Pin pricks.  

      RICK raises his gun again to the ZOMBIES. KIEREN stands

      Bill sighs. Rick has failed him. Goes towards the rabids. He 
      aims his rifle. Pulls the trigger. The rifle jams. Bill 
      curses. Checks the gun. Tries again. Rifle is jammed again. 
      Bill throws the rifle to the ground.

                                    DEAN
                      Pair s worth two hundred each. Plus 
                    five hundred bonus if we bring em
                    in intact. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Nine hundred. That s a lot of 
                      money. Could you use that sort of 
                      money, Dean?

                                    DEAN
                    Too right I could. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Gary? 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 73.

      Gary looks around. He doesn t like agreeing with this Rotter
      but it s got a point.  

                                    GARY
                    Could use the cash, aye. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Let s put it to a vote, yeah?  

                                    DEAN
                    I m up fer that, aye. 

      Dean and Gary nod. Rick slightly nods. Bill stands seething. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Okay? (takesa deep breath) All 
                    those in favour of handing them in 
                      unharmed (for Gary and Dean s 
                      benefit) So we can collect the nine 
                      hundred pound reward money, raise 
                    your hand. 

      Kieren raises his hand. Dean raises his hand. Dean looks to 
      Gary. Come on mate don t jack me out of this. After a moment 
      Gary raises his hand. It s decided. The father and daughter 
      live. Gary and Dean go back to preparing the zombies for 
      transport. 

      ANGLE ON: Bill. Throwing knives at Kieren with his eyes - 
       Might have won this round, yerrotten bastard. But just you 
        fuckingwait.   

      Bill gives Kieren one last look of utter hate...Then turns 
      and storms off. Rick looks at Kieren. Then runs after his 
      Dad. 

                                    BILL
                    He s pure poison and I won t stand 
                    fer it again.

      Kieren looks at the Male Zombie and The Little Girl Zombie - 
      the bond between them. Then he looks after Rick and Bill and 
      the bond between them. 

      We end on Kieren. Left alone in the woods.

                                                                            CUT TO:
