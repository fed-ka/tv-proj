      The DEAD BODY OF A MAN, somewhat the worse for wear, sits 
      perched in the low branches of a pinon tree.  Below it, 
      Lisbon, Rigsby, Van Pelt and Cho stand, looking up 
        thoughtfully with a pair of HIGHWAY PATROLMEN, and TWO 
      FORENSICS TECHS with stepladders.

                                  FORENSICS TECH
                    Looks like a gunshot to the temple. 
                    There s no ID.  

      The Tech hands over a small brass coin and a Mexican finger 
      cuff, bagged.  

                                  FORENSICS TECH (CONT D)
                    This is all we found on him --

      He hands them to Rigsby.  

      INSERT -- diamond pattern is cut into the center of the coin, 
      and there is worn and faded lettering incised around the 
      edge. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    A straw tube, and I don t know, 
                      a religious medal?

                    Or a good luck charm, maybe.

                    Didn t work too well, if it was.

      Jane wandering about, looks over.

                    There was a big storm here in the 
                    last week, wasn t there?

                                  CHO
                    Yup.  Lot of rain.  Four inches of 
                    snow in the mountains.  

      Cho looks around.  

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                          (the lightbulb goes off)
                    Wait, we re in an arroyo, aren t 
                    we?

                                  VAN PELT
                    You re right.  When the river 
                    rises, this spot must be 
                      underwater.

      Cho points at the body.

                                  CHO
                    So he was carried down here from 
                    somewhere upriver and got caught in 
                    the tree.  

                                  LISBON
                    Okay, where does the arcade come 
                    from?

      He plucks the coin and the straw tube out of Rigsby s hand 
      and holds it up.

                                  JANE
                    This is a token for playing arcade 
                    video games.  And this is a 
                    Peruvian finger cuff, they give 
                    them out as cheap prizes in 
                    arcades.  Our man is too old to be 
                    hanging out in video arcades, 
                    unless he s into kids, but I don t 
                    think he looks the type, so I bet 
                    he works in one.  Either way, find 
                    the arcade, find information.

                                  RIGSBY
                    What s the next big town upriver?

                    Sierra Vista.

      Jane tosses the coin to Lisbon.

                                  JANE

      Jane looks to the others and gestures as to say, there, she s 
      proven my point.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A Santa Clarita like town of brand new sub-developments. 
      Serried ranks of sunbaked streets in an arid high desert 
      landscape.  The town s center of gravity is the highway and 
      commercial malls that cluster there.  


      Just off the highway -- Video Games!  Mini Golf!  Pizza!   
      The kind of place you take eleven-year-olds for birthdays, 
      and where high school students hang out.  The CBI team gets 
      out of their car.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    This is the only arcade in town. 

                                  CHO
                    And only a couple of miles from the 
                    river. 

      Jane breathes in deeply, savoring the air as if in an Alpine 
      glade.

                                  JANE
                    Gasoline, cheese and mesquite. 
                      Wonderful.  This is the place.

                                  LISBON
                    We ll see.

      Jane heads to the entrance.  The others follow. 


      A nice-looking neighborhood, everybody takes care of their 
      front yards, but you know that four years ago none of it was 
      here, and you get the feeling that there s not a lot of old-
      fashioned neighborliness that goes on.  

      Lisbon, Van Pelt and Cho get out of the car.  Van Pelt points 
      at a HOUSE down the street, reads notes from her 
        phone/blackberry.

                                  VAN PELT
                    County tax records list the owners 
                    as Edwin and Jenny Didrikson, moved 
                    here two years ago from Texas.  No 
                    kids, no criminal records, nothing 
                    much of anything as far as the data 
                    goes. Only odd thing, they paid for 
                    the house in cash, no mortgage.     

      They get out, start toward the house.  


      Van Pelt and Lisbon are KNOCKING on the FRONT DOOR.  
      Cho comes from around the back.  

                                  CHO
                    Back s locked as well.  Feels like 
                      a deadbolt.

                      Somebody s watching us from 
                    upstairs.

      In a SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW, the curtain falls back into place.

                          (yelling up at the house)
                    Jenny Didrikson!  This is the CBI.  
                    Police.  Let us in!

      Waits.  No response.  Cho and Van Pelt look to Lisbon.  What 
      now?  Lisbon considers their options.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    We can t wait on a warrant. 
                    But we ve got good reason to 
                    believe someone in the house is in 
                    immediate jeopardy.  Let s go in.

      Cho and Van Pelt agree.  

      Cho kicks open the front door.  Lisbon, Cho and Van Pelt head 
      into the house, guns drawn.            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     15.



      Jane and Lisbon talk with Exley and Knox as they walk away 
      from the house.

                                  EXLEY
                    Until two years ago, Ed Didrikson 
                    was Eddie Russo.  Ran numbers in 
                    Philly, for the Battaglia family. 
                    Some loan sharking and collections.  
                    He got caught with ten kilos of 
                    coke and the Feds flipped him. 
                    He testified against Santino 
                    Battaglia and his family.  
                    Battaglia didn t go down, but two 
                    of his sons went away for life. 
                    Russo and wife came here under our 
                      supervision in the witness 
                      relocation program. 

                                  LISBON
                    So what happened d you think?  What 
                    went wrong here?

                                  EXLEY
                          (shrugs)
                    It s the old story I guess.   
                    He couldn t resist contacting 
                    someone back home, from his old 
                    life.  That someone sold him out to 
                      Battaglia.  Happens a lot to our 
                    clients.

                                  KNOX
                    We tell them again and again. 
                    Your old life is dead.  Gone. 
                    Forget it.  But they don t listen. 

                                  JANE
                    Aren t you people witness 
                      protection?  Doesn t that mean you 
                    protect people?

                                  EXLEY
                    We re not bodyguards, Agent.  
                    We only physically met with Russo 
                    once a week.  We had our scheduled  
                    meeting with him the day before he 
                    went missing.

                                  LISBON
                    And Jenny alerted you to his 
                    absence, but you did nothing.

                    What should we have done?  Alerted 
                    the media?  Like I said, this was 
                    not the first time Eddie jumped the 
                    fence.  This was not our fault.

                                  JANE
                    Did you know Eddie was dealing 
                    drugs?

      Exley and Know exchange a rapid glance.

                    Kid at the arcade where Eddie 
                    worked.  They say he was fronting

                                  LISBON
                    Let s be clear on this.  You guys 
                    didn t know of any criminal 
                      activities the victim might have 
                    been engaged in?

                                  KNOX
                    He was a made man, a mafioso.    
                    He s not going to turn around and 
                    join the church choir.  There s an 
                      adjustment period.

                                  LISBON
                    So you did know?

                                  EXLEY
                    No, we didn t.  Nor do we now.  
                    This is starting to feel like an 
                      interrogation.  Not appreciated.  
                    We have reports to write.  Nice

                    name of Tiny, bring him in. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Do we know who he rides with?

                                  JANE
                    Kid said something about his being 
                    with the X s.

                                  CHO
                    Cool.  That s the X s.  I know a 
                    guy in San Berdoo has a C.I. with 
                    them.  We ll find Tiny, no 
                    problemo.




      Two OLDER GENTLEMEN are at the men s tee, getting ready to 
      tee-off.  One is big and fat (we will learn that this is 
      SANTINO  SONNY  BATTAGLIA), the other small and withered and 
      skinny (another MOBSTER, and Sonny s golf partner).  Both of 
      them look a little incongruous in their overly dapper golf 
      attire.  Behind them, are two LARGE BODYGUARDS with bulges in 
      their jackets, indicating that they are armed. 

      Jane heads toward Battaglia et al.  Battaglia sets up a tee 
      shot, swings viciously and shanks it.

                                  JANE
                    Excuse me, Sonny Battaglia?  

      Sonny Battaglia fixes him with cold eyes.  

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Keep walking, Jack.

      The Bodyguards move in with unhurried speed. 

                                  JANE 
                    My name s Jane.  Patrick Jane.     
                    I need a moment of your time if I 
                    may. 

      The bodyguards crowd Jane.  

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    For what?

      Jane smiles in his relaxed, relaxing way.

                                  JANE 
                    To speak about Eddie Russo.

      Sonny Battaglia stares for a beat, looks around for 
      spectators.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Are you a cop?

                                  JANE
                    No.  Not really. 

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Good.  You alone?

                                  JANE
                    Ye-es.

      Battaglia glances at one of the bodyguards.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     29.

      One of the bodyguards pulls out a gun and points it at Jane. 
      Off Jane s alarm, we --

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Battaglia and his cronies watch with amusement as the 
      bodyguard puts his gun to Jane s head.  Jane smiles gamely 
      through his fear, holds up three fingers.

                                  JANE
                    There s three reasons I m not 
                    scared.  Well, okay, I am scared.  
                    Three reasons I m not terrified.  

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Please, tell.

                                  JANE
                    One, you didn t get to be your age, 
                    rich, and unimprisoned by shooting 
                    people willy nilly on golf courses. 

                                  BATTAGLIA
                          (enjoying himself)
                    True.  Up to now.  But you know 
                    what consistency is?

                                  JANE
                    The hobgoblin of little minds.  

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    That s right.  Emerson.  
                    Reason number two?

                                  JANE
                    I can significantly improve your 
                    golf game.

      Battaglia smiles ruefully.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Yeah, you and a hundred other 
                    gavones.  Number three.

                                  JANE
                    I know where to find Eddie Russo.

      Battaglia studies Jane for a beat, shrewd suspicion in his 
      eyes.   He looks to his golfing partner, who shrugs, then to 
      his bodyguard with the gun.  He shakes his head, meaning, put 
      the gun away.  The bodyguard obeys.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    So how you going to improve my 
                    game?  

                                  JANE
                    Very simple.  Easy.  You want to 
                    think of hitting the ball as an 
                    event rather than a process.  As an 
                    assault rather than an act of 
                    creation.  You need more flow.  

      Beat.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                          (lightly)
                    Flow.  I changed my mind.  Shoot 
                    him.

                                  JANE
                    What s your favorite song?  

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    You re the smartass, you tell me.

      Jane appraises him carefully...

                                  JANE
                    Hmmm... It s one of three things. 
                    Sinatra, Elvis or Italian opera.

      Battaglia acknowledges Jane s right.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Caruso.  Santa Lucia. 

                                  JANE
                    Perfect.  Now, hand me one of those 
                    sticks and we ll get started...

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Sticks?

                                  JANE
                    Whatever you call them.  Not a fat 
                    one, the other kind.

      Suspicious that he s being played with, Battaglia hands Jane 
      a driver.  


      Half singing, half humming Santa Lucia, Battaglia squares up 
      to the ball, and as he hits the high note, swings smoothly in 
      rhythm with his singing and smacks the ball arrow-straight 
      down the fairway.  Battaglia rounds off the song with a whoop 
      of triumphant laughter.  His opponent looks sourly at Jane.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     34.

                    showed up.


      Jane, Battaglia and the other Mobster walking down the 
      fairway.  Battaglia throws his arm around Jane 
        affectionately.   

                                  BATTAGLIA
                          (to his partner)
                    All the hours I spend on this 
                    course, all the thousands I ve 
                    wasted on tapes and videos and 
                    coaching?  And blondie does it with 
                    singing.  How you like that?

                                  JANE
                    Just bringing out the talent that 
                    was already inside you.

      Battaglia catches the light mockery in Jane s tone.

                                  BATTAGLIA 
                    Yeah.  
                          (beat, edge of menace)
                    So now tell me, my strange new 
                    friend.  Where is Eddie Russo?

      Jane looks closely at Battaglia as he waits for a reply. 

                                  JANE
                    You don t know? 

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Know what?

                                  JANE
                    Eddie Russo is dead.

                                  JANE

      Battaglia claps his hands happily.

                                  BATTAGLIA 
                    Today is a good day.  Listen, if

                    What s your number?

      number.

                    What are you doing?  Don t give him

      didn t get the best of the exchange.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (to phone)
                    Boss, we ll be needing to speak to 
                    Marshal Knox about a few things...


        A SACRAMENTO PD CRUISER glides slowly down a rainslick urban 
      gulch.  It s headlights find a GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN parked 
      tight against a wall.  There s a woman in the driver s seat. 
      Motionless. 


      One POLICE OFFICER approaches while his partner stands back. 
      Shining his flashlight inside the car -- he sees Marshal 
      Christy Knox slumped in her seat, still alive and breathing, 
      but only barely.

                    the five hundred block of 
                      Lexington.  Re: attempt suicide. 

      On the seat next to her are scattered pills, and a post-it 
      note, on which is written,  I M SORRY. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Sonny Battaglia stands next to a WATER HAZARD, cellphone to 
      his ear.  In the pond, one of the bodyguards wades about, 
      looking for Battaglia s lost ball...

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    No, lady.  Wrong number.

      He points with his five iron.

                                  BATTAGLIA (CONT D)
                    Over there, try.


      Battaglia stands on the green, phone to his ear, irritated. 

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    No.

      He snaps the phone shut.  


      Jane, Rigsby and Van Pelt get out of a CBI VEHICLE stopped  *
      several houses down from the Didrikson house.  Rigsby s in 
      shiny athletic wear.  Jane has a brown paper grocery bag.

                                  JANE
                    Okay, here we go...

                                  RIGSBY
                          (dubious)
                    Oh-kay.  But I d feel better if 
                    Lisbon knew about this.

                                  JANE
                    Such a mama s boy.

      As he and Van Pelt walk toward the house, leaving Rigsby by  *
      the vehicle, Jane turns to Van Pelt.   *






                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     47A.
      CONTINUED:4242

                                  JANE (CONT D) *
                    You understand what to do, yes?   *
                    You stay a few minutes, so she  *
                    doesn t get suspicious, then leave  *
                    when Rigsby phones you.   *

                                  VAN PELT *
                    What s my reason for leaving? *

      Jane shrugs as he punches in a number on his phone.   *

                                  JANE *
                    Doesn t matter.  Something about  *
                    work.  Be vague. *

      Van Pelt looks dubious. *

                                  VAN PELT *
                    Rigsby s right, you know.  The boss  *
                    told us to go see Gina Russo.  She  *
                    told you to stay out of trouble.   *

      Jane waves her quiet, speaks into his phone. *

                                  JANE *
                    Hi, Sonny, it s me, Patrick Jane.

      INTERCUT AS NEEDED WITH:            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     48.



      Battaglia on the phone.  Half expecting another wrong 
      number... 

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Oh, yeah, you.  Okay.  You got a 
                    name for me?

                                  JANE
                    No, not yet.  Soon maybe.  But 
                    never mind that.  Mary wants to 
                    know, did anybody leave any 
                    messages for her?

      Battaglia turns beet red.

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    What are you crazy?  You little 
                    jerk, I m going to tear your 
                    freakin  --

      Jane cuts the connection, highly amused, and walks up to the 
      front door of the Didrikson house.  Beside him, Van Pelt  *
      shakes her head and sighs. *


      Battaglia on the phone...

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    Listen you piece of dirt!  You 
                    dogturd!  You re dead, you hear me!


      Battaglia on the phone...

                                  BATTAGLIA
                    I will tear your head off and eat 
                    your spine!  I will chew on your 
                    eyeballs!  Nobody screws around 
                    with me and lives.  You get me?  
                    Nobody!
