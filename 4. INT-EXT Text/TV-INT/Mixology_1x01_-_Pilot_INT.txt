      MIX is a high-end lounge in the meatpacking district. Exposed 
      brick, hip art, sensual electronica, $15 cocktails, beautiful 
      people. Think Soho House. The CAMERA slowly catches up with

      A NERVOUS MAN

      wading through the chic crowd. This is TOM, 20 s, dorky shirt 
      but handsome enough. Perspiring, he makes his way towards 

      A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  

      sitting alone at the bar, dressed in white. This is MAYA, 
      20 s. Tom reaches Maya, downs his beer, and asks the question 
      men have been asking women at bars since time immemorial: 

                                  TOM
                    Can I buy you a drink?

      Maya turns and frowns at Tom, unimpressed... He shrinks: 

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    P-Please?

      TITLE OVER BLACK:

                                  TOM & MAYA

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      A WOMAN in a tiny red dress blows into Mix. MEN subtly, and 
      not-so-subtly, gawk at her. This is JESSICA, 30 s. She looks 
      around and spots her kid sister, JANEY, 22, waving from the 
      bar. Jessica crosses, kisses her cheek:

                                    JESSICA
                    Sorry I m late. Mom took the wrong 
                    train in and the kids took forever 
                    going down-- 

      Jessica sips Janey s drink, then calls over to the BARTENDER:

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    I ll have whatever my sister is 
                    having!

      The tatted BARTENDER nods without looking up, mixing away.                                                                                     2.


                                  JANEY
                    And how are the kids?

      Jessica adjusts her bra, aggressive, taking in the scene.

                                    JESSICA
                    Who cares -- I m out, I got my 
                    slutty red dress on, I m rocking my  
                    new birthday clutch, all I want to 
                    do is get drunk, have sex with a 
                    complete stranger, and be home in 
                    time to watch Game of Thrones.
                          (off her sister s LAUGH)
                    The kids are great. Here:

      Jessica opens a photo on her phone and gives it to Janey. 

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Austin s first soccer game... 

      Janey flips through the pictures of her nephew, COOING...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    He s terrible. It s hilarious.

                                  JANEY
                    Whoa! Who s this?

      Janey holds up a photo of a cute, alt GUY smiling, shy.

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh. That s Dave. Or Don. Dan? 
                          (off Janey s look)
                    I met him on Blendr. He s 6 1 , 175 
                    pounds and an  internet 
                      entrepreneur  -- so nothing shady 
                    there, right? Also, he s less than 
                    a mile away and should be here 
                    within the hour. Check out the next 
                    picture.

      Janey slides to the next picture and, judging from her 
      reaction, it s a COCK SHOT. Naive little Janey SHRIEKS:

                                  JANEY
                    Oh my God!

                                    JESSICA
                    I know. I m really not sure how I m 
                    gonna wrangle that thing.                                                                                   3.


                                  JANEY
                    It s very veiny...
                          (studying it closely)
                    So you re just gonna...?

      Jessica takes her phone back, feeling her judgement.

                                    JESSICA
                    Yes, Janey, I m going to make some 
                    bad decisions tonight. Don t tell 
                    Mom.

                                  JANEY
                    That s not what I meant--

                                    JESSICA
                    Look, as soon as they invent an 
                    iPhone app that locates all the 
                    cool nice guys with stable jobs 
                    within a five mile radius, I will 
                    be the first to use it. Until then, 
                    I ve got Blendr. And Dan. With his 
                    14 inch wonderdong.   

      Jessica looks away, pissed. Janey sips her cocktail. Then:

                        JANEYJESSICA
      Can I see it again--?I know you kind of can t look 
                                                  away, right?

      Jessica pulls out her phone again. As the sisters huddle over 
      it for another look, CAMERA drifts across the bar to find

      TOM  

      The nervous guy from the teaser sits in a plush booth with 
      his two best friends, BRUCE, 20 s, ugly, loud, way-too-honest 
      Long Islander, and CAL, 20 s, gorgeous, sweet, but no genius. 
      Tom scans the room, intimidated by all the BEAUTIFUL WOMEN:

                                  TOM
                    I am so not ready for this...

                                  CAL
                    Relax, man, you ve been out of the 
                    Game for what, a decade? It s way 
                    different now. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Yeah, girls have changed. They 
                    drink like dudes, they dress like 
                    prostitutes, and they will sleep 
                    with anything. Even I get laid, and 
                    look at me. I m disgusting.                                                                                  4.


                                  CAL
                    It s true. Girls are the new guys.

                                  BRUCE
                    Sex & The City changed everything.

                                  CAL
                    Totally. They re all Miranda s.

                                  BRUCE
                    Dude no, Miranda was the workaholic 
                    one, Samantha was the slutty one. 

                                  CAL
                    I think Dorothy was the workaholic 
                    one. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Dorothy? There was no Dorothy--!

      As his friends BICKER, Tom starts sliding out of the booth...

                                  TOM
                    Look, I m just gonna get a cab--

                                  CAL
                    No. You need to do this, Tommy.

                                  BRUCE
                          (scanning various WOMEN)
                    Yeah, let s just find you a nice 
                      girl...like a nice, drunk, not 
                      traditionally beautiful girl with 
                    maybe one or two facial 
                      deformities... like a girl with a 
                    cleft lip who s looking to make a 
                      connection, you know what I mean?

      JUST THEN A HOT WAITRESS BLOWS PAST

      This is KASEY, 20 s, bubbly, sexy, lovably shallow partygirl. 
      CAMERA follows her as she crosses behind the long, sleek bar 
      and nervously approaches

      THE BARTENDER

      who s mixing cocktails at breakneck speed. This is DOMINIC, 
      44, the dark, mysterious head mixologist at Mix. He rocks 
      sleeve tats, a wallet chain, and a fedora, all successfully.

                                  KACEY
                    Hey. Look, I need to say something 
                    and I don t want you to freak out 
                    and make a big scene, okay?                                                                                  5.


      Dominic nods and keeps mixing, his hands in constant motion.

                                  KACEY (CONT D)
                    All right, here goes...we re over.

                                    DOMINIC
                          (mixing, emotionless)
                    Okay.

                                  KACEY
                    It s not you. It s just, I m a 
                    super positive person and you re 
                    like this black cloud of negativity 
                    that rains poison on everything and 
                    murders it, you know what I mean? 
                    Plus I m looking for something more 
                    long term and you re really old so 
                    how would that even work? Would you 
                    wheel our kids around on your 
                    electric scooter? 

                                    DOMINIC
                    Right, no, that s a great point--

                                  KACEY
                    I hope we can still be friends?

                                    DOMINIC
                    That d be...great.

      She EXHALES, relieved, and hugs him way too tightly.

                                  KACEY
                    Oh my God this went so well. Have 
                    an awesome shift!

      She smiles and bounces off. Dominic watches her, confused, 
      then goes back to mixing as CAMERA drifts over to

      TOM, BRUCE AND CAL IN THEIR BOOTH

      Tom sulks as Bruce and Cal eagerly scan the female clientele:

                                  CAL
                    ...okay, what about Purple Dress?

      Bruce spots a HOT LATINA IN A PURPLE DRESS, and sighs:

                                  BRUCE
                    A Latin chick? Are you trying to 
                    get Tom killed? He can t even 
                    handle Chipotle.                                                                                  6.


                                  CAL
                    Okay okay, what about White Top?

      CAMERA finds MAYA, sitting at the bar, beautifully lit...

                                  CAL (CONT D)
                    She looks like a nice girl from a 
                    prominent family in Connecticut 
                    that has horses, you know what I 
                    mean? What do you think, Tommy? 

      Tom begrudgingly looks over at Maya...and stops, smitten. 

                                  TOM
                    Oh come on, that s like...I mean... 
                    she s way out of my league...

                                  CAL
                    Look at me: no one is out of your 
                    league! You re Tommy Svensen, the 
                    Viking of Victorville! You rape and 
                    pillage and you take what s yours!

                                  BRUCE
                      I mean...don t actually...rape her.

                                  TOM
                    You really think I can do this?

                                  CAL
                    What s the worst thing that can 
                    happen? She says no? Then you re 
                    right back to where you are now.

                                  BRUCE
                    Yeah, go on, get your beak wet... 
                          (guiding Tom out of booth)
                    Just don t try to be funny because 
                    you re not funny, and don t talk 
                    about Laura because then you ll 
                    cry, okay? 

      Tom nods and heads off, nervous... Then Bruce SMACKS Cal:

                                   BRUCE (CONT D)
                    She s totally out of his league!

                                  CAL
                    No she s not! She s like a 6!

                                  BRUCE
                    To you she s a 6! To Tommy she s a 
                    12! You are literally sending him 
                    to his death--!                                                                                      7.


      When Tom looks back at them, they flash him big thumbs up: 

                BRUCE (CONT D)CAL
      YOU GOT THIS, BRO! YOU THE MAN, TOMMY!

      THE CAMERA FOLLOWS TOM THROUGH THE CHIC CROWD

      and we catch up with the TEASER... Tom reaches Maya, and:  

                                  TOM
                    Can I buy you a drink?

      Maya turns and frowns at Tom, unimpressed... He shrinks: 

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    P-Please?

                                  MAYA
                    Do I know you?

                                  TOM
                    No! No. I m Tom.

      FREEZE on Tom smiling, doofy, hopeful... Then we

      FLASHBACK TO:


      BABY TOM has just been born. He CRIES. A nurse places him in 
      a crib labelled  SVENSEN, THOMAS.  Tom s MOM looks overjoyed. 
      His swingin  80s DAD, hot perm, tracksuit, looks freaked out--


      15 YEAR OLD TOM brings his mom a tray of pop-tarts and Sunny 
      D for breakfast in her dark, shrouded bedroom. Lying alone in 
      bed, she just rolls over, ignoring him. He looks heartbroken--


      COLLEGE BRUCE and COLLEGE TOM keep trying to tap a keg, and 
      keep spraying beer all over themselves, laughing. Then Bruce 
      sees LAURA and introduces her to a soaking-wet Tom. She 
      smiles, shakes his hand...and easily taps the keg. Tom 
      watches her, amazed, already in love with her--                                                                                   8.



      COLLEGE TOM brings LAURA a tray of crappy breakfast in her 
      dorm room. Unlike his mom, however, she s sincerely grateful. 
      Tom smiles, hope returning to his life--


      24 YEAR OLD TOM and LAURA sit opposite her PARENTS in a hip 
      Manhattan eatery. Then LAURA holds up her hand, revealing her 
      ENGAGEMENT RING. She and her MOM erupt, overjoyed. Her DAD 
      claps Tom on the arm, warm, loving, the father he never had--


      Laura stands by the door with a Starbucks, emotionless.

                                  LAURA
                    It s over.

      Tom, busy shampooing their DOG in a large plastic tub, looks 
      up, totally blind-sided: 

                                  TOM
                    Wh...? What do you mean?

                                  LAURA
                    I m just not feeling it anymore.

                                  TOM
                    What?! 

                                  LAURA
                    I m so sorry, Tom.

                                  TOM
                      Wait...are you serious?

      She nods, unable to look him in the eye...

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                      But...why?  

                                  LAURA
                    I don t know, I just woke up this 
                    morning and I looked over at you 
                    and everything about you repulsed 
                    me. 

                                  TOM
                    What?! Like repulsed...how?                                                                                  9.


                                  LAURA
                    Like physically. Like looking at 
                    your face made me want to barf. 

                                  TOM
                    Well, maybe it was something you 
                    ate?

                                  LAURA
                    No. It was you. It was your face. 

                                  TOM
                    This is insane! We re supposed to 
                    be getting married next month!

                                  LAURA
                    I know. I feel terrible.

      She SUCKS LOUDLY on the straw of her iced coffee.

                                  TOM
                    Really? Because the straw kind of 
                      undermines everything you just said-

                                  LAURA
                    I m sorry, Tom. I just can t take 
                    it anymore. 

                                  TOM
                    Can t take what anymore? What did I 
                    do wrong?!

      But she s already exited out the open front door. Tom slumps 
      to the floor next to the dog, devastated. A beat. Then the 
      dog hops out of the tub, shakes off, and trots out after her.


      Tom lies on Cal s hardwood floor in an old hoodie, staring at 
      the ceiling, decimated. Empty beer cans litter Cal s plush 
      bachelor pad. Cal lies on a couch while Bruce paces, pissed: 

                                  BRUCE
                    I never liked her. Not in college. 
                    Not after college. Not ever.

                                  TOM
                    Bruce. You introduced us.

                                  BRUCE
                    Yeah, I thought she was a whore, I 
                    didn t think you were gonna marry 
                    her.                                                                                  10.


                                  TOM
                      Look...don t talk like that. I 
                    still, you know...I still love her. 
                    I just wish I knew what I did wrong-

      A tear escapes from Tom s eye and he quickly wipes it away. 
      Cal and Bruce notice, and get super-uncomfortable:

                                  BRUCE
                    Dude, get him a Kleenex!

                                  CAL
                    I don t have Kleenex, dude! Guys 
                    don t have Kleenex!

                                  BRUCE
                    I have Kleenex! 

                                  CAL
                    You do? 

                                  BRUCE
                    Yes! I ve got Kleenex all over my 
                      apartment!   

                                  CAL
                    Why do you have so much Kleenex--?!

                                  TOM
                    I gotta call her again.

                        BRUCECAL
      What?No.

                                  BRUCE
                    Look, Tommy...we get that this is 
                    dredging up a lot of stuff about 
                    your dad, but sometimes people just 
                    leave without saying why, okay...? 

      Tom nods, emotional, trying to hold it together...

                                  CAL
                    Actually, I had no idea this was 
                    relevant to your father abandoning 
                    you as a child. I didn t put those 
                    pieces together til just now--

                                  BRUCE
                    Look at me, Tommy: you just need to 
                    go home, lock away any weapons you 
                    might own, download a whole bunch 
                    of weird Japanese porno, and drink 
                    alone for like 3 to 5 weeks. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                  11.

                                  BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Eventually you ll stop thinking 
                    about Laura and you ll start 
                    banging a lot of questionable women 
                    and hating them afterwards. But 
                    then you ll find someone great, 
                    like a really cool, sweet girl. And 
                    you ll screw that up too because 
                    you ll be way too into her and 
                    she ll freak out. That story 
                    probably ends with a lot of angry 
                    texts and a restraining order. But 
                    then you ll find someone really 
                    cool, and you won t come on too 
                    strong, you ll play it just right, 
                    and she ll think you re funny and 
                    cool and... well... That s the best 
                    feeling in the world, right?    

      Bruce and Cal smile at Tom, concerned, reassuring, loving...

                                  CAL
                    You ll find someone else, Tommy. 
                    Someone hotter.   

      END FLASHBACK.

      BACK IN THE BAR -- TOM STILL STANDS IN FRONT OF MAYA

      smiling, doofy and hopeful. She glances at her watch, shrugs:

                                  MAYA
                    Sure, I got a few minutes. Sit.  

                                  TOM
                          (way too excited)
                    Really?!

                                  MAYA
                    Oh no. 

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                  12.


                                  ACT TWO


      Dominic stands in the bright back office, writing on a large 
        wall-mounted CALENDAR... Then Kacey blows in, furious:

                                  KACEY
                    There you are! So um, how come when 
                    I dumped you like three minutes ago 
                    you were just like  okay?    

                                    DOMINIC
                      What...did you want me to say?

                                  KACEY
                    I wanted you to be pissed! We ve 
                    been hooking up for six weeks! 
                    Couldn t you have at least 
                    pretended to be hurt?!

                                    DOMINIC
                    I was hurt. I was just...in shock.

                                  KACEY
                          (warming, touched)
                    Really?

                                    DOMINIC
                    No. You just told me to pretend--

                                  KACEY
                    Oh my God you re killing me right 
                    now.

                                  DOMINIC
                    Look, honey, I kind of hook up with 
                    all the waitresses around here? 
                    That s sort of...why guys become 
                      bartenders? I m really sorry if I 
                    hurt you, but honestly, I m not 
                    even sure what your name is.   

                                  KACEY
                          (GASPING, horrified)
                    Well it doesn t matter now because 
                    I m never talking to you again! 

      She storms out. Dominic SIGHS, wow... Then she returns:

                                  KACEY (CONT D)
                    Also, I need Wednesday off -- Josh 
                    said he d close for me.                                                                                  13.


      Dominic nods, okay, and writes  JOSH CLOSE  on the schedule. 

                                  KACEY (CONT D)
                    Thanks. (beat) I m still angry.

      She hesitates, then awkwardly exits again.

      BACK AT THE BAR   

      Jessica and Janey downs shots and high five: WOO!

                                    JESSICA
                    So how s it going with the new guy?

                                  JANEY
                    Ricky Z? Great! Yeah, he s seven 
                    days sober now so that s awesome. 
                      Unfortunately he can t get a job 
                    because of the mail fraud thing, 
                    and technically he s still married 
                    so, you know, we re taking it slow. 

      Jessica just buries her head in her hands. Janey s defensive:

                                  JANEY (CONT D)
                    Well at least he doesn t post 
                    pictures of his penis online!

                                    JESSICA
                    Okay, first of all, Ricky Z 
                      definitely posts pictures of his 
                    penis online. Secondly: you re so 
                    great. You can do better than him.  

                                  JANEY
                    You don t understand. We have an 
                    amazing connection--

                                    JESSICA
                    No you don t. You don t have an 
                    amazing connection. Listen to me, 
                    Janey, you had your first real 
                    boyfriend what, two years ago? That 
                    means you are a two year old at 
                    dating, okay? You re toddling 
                    around, knocking over furniture, 
                    babbling nonsense words and crying 
                    for no reason. You know nothing. 
                    You understand nothing. You are a 
                    constant threat to yourself. And 
                    you need to leave this moron as 
                    soon as humanly possible.                                                                                  14.


                                  JANEY
                          (bristles, hurt)
                    Oh my god, you re just jealous 
                    because I m young and I have some-
                    one and you re old and you don t.

      Jessica recoils, whoa, stung, as CAMERA drifts over to

      TOM AND MAYA 

      Picking up where we left off, Tom eagerly drags a barstool 
      over and sits next to Maya with a loud SCRRRAPE-CLANG-THUD!

                                  MAYA
                          (watching him, troubled)
                    I m Maya, by the way...

                                  TOM
                    Maya? What a pretty name. Is 
                          that...(searching)...Mayan?

      Maya LAUGHS in spite of herself. Tom s confidence grows... 

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    So Maya, where are you from?

      FREEZE FRAME on Maya, looking at Tom, bemused. Then we 

      FLASHBACK TO:


      Both feet up on the dashboard, Maya s MOM SCREAMS as Maya s 
      old school DAD stoically delivers BABY MAYA in the cab of 
      their rusty pick-up truck. Frowning, he pours Bud Light all 
      over NEWBORN MAYA to clean her off--


      The TALL MAN shouts at COLLEGE AGE MAYA as she dribbles down 
      Cornell s beautiful basketball court -- he s her COACH. Maya 
      plays street-tough, leveling her preppy OPPONENTS--


      COLLEGE MAYA and her coach have sex on a bench in the 
      Training Room. It s angry, hot. The COACH aggressively yanks 
      Maya s ponytail back and she CLIMAXES, loving it rough--


      YOUNG LAWYER MAYA, sexy in an expensive business suit, blows 
      through the halls of her sports law firm until she s stopped 
      by an older PARTNER, who s chatting with NFL great TIKI 
      BARBER. The partner introduces Maya to Tiki. Instant sparks--


      In a Giants tee shirt and panties, Maya drinks coffee and 
      reads her iPad while Tiki folds laundry on his kitchen table. 

                                  TIKI
                    Did you call the guy?

                                  MAYA
                    About the--? Yeah.

                                  TIKI
                    Cool. Thanks.

      Then Tiki pulls out a pair of MEN S BOXER BRIEFS from the 
      laundry basket. Looks confused:

                                  TIKI (CONT D)
                    Whose are these?

                                  MAYA
                          (looking up -- uh-oh)
                    Huh?

                                  TIKI
                    Whose boxer briefs are these?

                                  MAYA
                    I don t know, yours? 
                          (quickly back to reading)
                    Did you see the Jets traded 
                    Sanchez? About time, right--?                                                                                  16.


                                  TIKI
                    I don t wear boxer briefs, I wear 
                    Hanes Comfortflex, you know that. 
                    Whose boxer briefs are these Maya.

    She hesitates...which tells Tiki everything he needs to know.

                                  TIKI (CONT D)
                    Oh my God, who is it?

                                  MAYA
                    Oh come on, I m sure you ve had 
                    some fun since we started dating.

      Tiki shakes his head, nope. Maya frowns:

                                  MAYA (CONT D)
                    Really? No one? 

                                  TIKI
                    That s a stereotype about athletes.

                                  MAYA
                    Right, well, I didn t know I was 
                    dating the one famous athlete in 
                    the world who doesn t sleep around.

      Tiki turns and takes in the skyline of Manhattan, hurt...

                                  MAYA (CONT D)
                    Oh come on, Tiki, don t cry. 

    But he does. NFL All-star Tiki Barber is crying.

                                  TIKI
                    Who is he.

      Maya squirms, trying to think fast. Tiki turns:

                                  TIKI (CONT D)
                    Tell me it s not Rond .

      Busted. 

                                  TIKI (CONT D)
                    Maya?

                                  MAYA
                    You were out of town--!

                                  TIKI
                    Maya he s my twin brother!                                                                                  17.


                                  MAYA
                    I know! He looks just like you! 
                    That s barely cheating! 

      Tiki angrily wipes the tears from his eyes, hurt.

                                  TIKI
                    You know, you think you re this 
                    like tough, independent woman, but 
                      really...you re just mean. 

      Maya looks stung... Tiki crosses to his bedroom, stops:

                                  TIKI (CONT D)
                    And you wanna know something else? 
                    I m gonna be fine -- Tiki always 
                    lands on his feet. But you? You re 
                    gonna spend the rest of your life 
                    alone because you re broken and you 
                    don t know to be nice to people. So 
                    suck on that, you big mean bitch.

      He SLAMS the door as he exits. Maya stands there, stunned.


      Maya crushes the incline press machine as her friend from 
      work, LIV, glasses, lazy, stands nearby, eating a LunaBar.

                                  LIV
                    He called you  a big mean bitch?  
                    That s awesome.

                                  MAYA
                    Why is that awesome?

                                  LIV
                    Because you re a big mean bitch. 
                    That s like your thing.

                                  MAYA
                    What? I m not a bitch! I m just a 
                    strong modern woman who--!

      A PUDGY GUY wearing head-to-toe Under Armour butts in:

                                  PUDGY GUY
                    You almost done with this machine?

                                  MAYA
                    No dude I m not almost done.

      The guy recoils, whoa, as Liv calmly bites into her Luna bar:                                                                                  18.


                                  LIV
                    Actually, I m cool with leaving. 

                                  MAYA
                    Liv, you gotta do more than just 
                    eat at the gym if you want to lose 
                    10 pounds before your wedding.

                                  LIV
                    I know but everyone in here looks 
                    like Christian Bale and it s 
                    freaking me out. Look, there s like 
                    three Christian Bale s right there--

      There are in fact three AMERICAN PSYCHO BANKER TYPES 
      sprinting in unison on the treadmills nearby. Maya pumps away  
      harder on her machine, unable to let go of the bitch thing:

                                  MAYA
                    Here s the deal: I m a nice person 
                    when I want to be. It s just--

                                  LIV
                    What s the last nice thing you did?

      Maya angrily thinks...and thinks... Finally Liv just LAUGHS.

                                  MAYA
                    Okay if you re so damn nice what s 
                    the last nice thing you did?!

                                  LIV
                    Well, I gave Jim a handy in the 
                    shower this morning even though I 
                    really didn t want to and also I 
                    gave a dollar to a homeless man 
                    because he looked like my dad--

                                  MAYA
                    Fine. You re amazing. I m just 
                    saying I m capable of being nice--

                                  PUDGY GUY
                    You done with that machine yet?

                                  MAYA
                    You ll get the goddamn machine when 
                    I m done with it, okay Under 
                    Armour?! I promise you ll still be 
                    really fat then!

      The guy hurries off, hurt. Liv blanches. Maya winces, shit...

      END FLASHBACK.                                                                                  19.


      BACK IN THE BAR -- TOM AND MAYA CONTINUE CHATTING

      And we pick up where we left off...

                                  MAYA
                    Me? I m from Pittsburgh.

                                  TOM
                    Nice! Go Phillies!

                                  MAYA
                    Pirates.

                                  TOM
                    Pirates. Right. Sorry. I m not 
                    really into sports.

                                  MAYA
                    Oh. I m a sports attorney and a 
                      three-time All-American.

      She looks away, increasingly losing interest... Tom sweats:

                                  TOM
                    Wow! Great... Pittsburgh though, 
                    right? What a beautiful city.

                                  MAYA
                    Actually it s a cesspool of sadness 
                    and broken dreams. I thank God 
                    every day that I got out.

                                  TOM
                    HAHAHA! Is your family still there?

                                  MAYA
                    Probably.

                                  TOM
                    Nice! Families are...nice...
                          (long, painful SILENCE)
                    I m from Rhode Island.

                                  MAYA
                    That s unbelievable, dude.

      She has officially lost interest. Tom stammers, hopeless:

                                  TOM
                    Look, I m sorry I suck at this. My 
                    fiancee of 8 years just dumped me, 
                    so you re basically the first girl 
                    I ve talked to since 2005.                                                                                  20.


                                  MAYA
                    Well. That would explain the shirt. 

      Tom touches his shirt, hurt, as CAMERA drifts over to 

      JANEY AND JESSICA

      sitting nearby, still fighting, highly emotional... 

                                  JANEY
                    ...no, that s not what I m saying! 
                    I m saying stop treating me like a 
                    child! I m 22 years old! 

                                  JESSICA
                    Oh my god that s so young -- tell 
                    me you re using birth control. 
                    There should be a padlock on your 
                    vagina right now. Remember Aunt 
                    Kimmy? She got pregnant just from 
                    sitting on the bus.

                                  JANEY
                    That s not even possible--

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh crap -- he s here.

      Janey turns to see

      THE MAN FROM JESSICA S PHONE ENTERING THE BAR

      He s attractive in a cool, geek chic kind of way. Scarf, 
      sweater, skinny jeans. Janey is instantly attracted:

                                  JANEY
                    Wow, he s cute.

                                    JESSICA
                          (adjusting her dress)
                    Oh my god, he s better looking in 
                    person, that never happens...

                                  JANEY
                          (trying to see his crotch)
                    Where does he hide that thing?

                                    JESSICA
                    Stop! He s coming! How do I look?

      Janey turns back to her sister as she nervously primps.                                                                                  21.


                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Do I look like a single mom who s 
                    trying too hard...? Do I look old?

      Janey looks at her domineering big sister, and for the first 
      time sees her vulnerability, her insecurity. Janey softens:

                                  JANEY
                    No. You look beautiful. 

      Jessica smiles and takes her sister s hand, grateful.

                                    JESSICA
                    Laugh.

                                  JANEY
                    What?

                                    JESSICA
                          (through clenched smile)
                    Laugh bitch.

      Janey lets out a HUGE FAKE LAUGH just as the guy pulls up.

                                  DAN OR DON 
                    Excuse me are you Jessica?

                                    JESSICA
                          (smiling coy, looking up)
                    Well, that depends who s ask--

      Then he grabs her clutch and THROWS UP INTO IT. 

      The sisters jump back, SHRIEKING! All the PATRONS around them 
      recoil. The guy SPITS the last chunks into the clutch, wipes 
      his mouth, and...awkwardly places it back atop the bar. Beat. 

                                  DAN OR DON
                    My bad. 

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                  22.


                                  ACT THREE


      Dominic mixes drinks as BUSBOYS clean up Dan or Don s mess 
      inches away. Next to Dominic, Kacey angrily guns water into 
      glasses, not talking to him. Then he slides her a cocktail. 

                                    DOMINIC
                    I call it...The Kacey Finklebaum.

      She keeps gunning water, ignoring him... 

                                    DOMINIC (CONT D)
                    It s bubbly and sweet and just a 
                    little bitter at the finish.

      Finally she takes a sip. It s great. She lowers the glass.

                                  KACEY
                    Tastes like piss.

      She coldly collects her tray and heads off. Once she s gone, 
      however, she smiles slightly to herself... Then she passes

      TOM AND MAYA 

      sitting at the end of bar. Maya looks miserable, trying to 
      drain any alcohol out of her empty glass while Tom overshares 
      about his ex-fianc e, on the verge of tears:

                                  TOM
                    ...the worst part is she didn t 
                    give me any explanation, you know? 

                                  MAYA
                    Where the hell is our waitress?

                                  TOM
                    If I did something wrong I d get 
                    it, but I treated her so well. I 
                    took her to wine country and I 
                    brought her breakfast in bed and I 
                    did her laundry every Tuesday...
                          (he starts quietly CRYING)
                    She was very specific about how she 
                    liked her different kinds of under-
                    wear dried but I remembered all the 
                    rules. I remembered all the rules.

      BACK AT BRUCE AND CAL S BOOTH

      The guys watch on, horrified:                                                                                  23.


                                  BRUCE
                    He s crying.

                                  CAL
                    He s crying everywhere.

                                  BRUCE
                    We have to extract him.   

                                  CAL
                    Yeah. (beat) Go extract him. 

                                  BRUCE
                    I m not extracting him! You extract 
                    him!

                                  CAL
                    What are you, scared?!

                                  BRUCE
                    Yes! 

                                  CAL
                    I am too.

                                  BRUCE
                    She s not from Connecticut.

                                  CAL
                    Not even a little. 

      BACK AT THE BAR  

      Tom dries his eyes with cocktail napkins. Maya just smarts...

                                  MAYA
                    Okay I can t take anymore. You want 
                    to know why your fianc e left you? 

                                  TOM
                    Yes! More than anything!  

                                  MAYA
                    She left you because you re a 
                      snivelling little bitch. 

                                  TOM
                    What?! No! I m...I m just nice.

                                  MAYA
                    No. I ve been listening to you for 
                    what seems like an eternity and 
                    you re actually not that nice. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                  24.

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                    You re just a coward who s scared 
                    of people not liking you. There s a 
                    big difference.

      Tom stammers, speechless: she s nailed him dead to rights.

                                  MAYA (CONT D)
                    Look at me, Tom. Every girl wants a 
                    nice guy, but we also want a man 
                    who s not afraid to say  you are 
                    out of your goddamn mind if you 
                    think I m gonna fold your underwear 
                    six different ways. I am a man. 
                    Respect my essence.  

                                  TOM
                      I literally have no idea what 
                    you re talking about--

                                  MAYA
                    Stand your ground, articulate what 
                    you want, and accept the 
                      consequences, Tom. That s what real 
                    men do every single day. 

      BACK AT BRUCE AND CAL S BOOTH

      The guys watch Maya berate Tom...

                                  BRUCE
                    We brought him out too soon.

                                  CAL
                    He wasn t ready for this.

                                  BRUCE
                    He s never going to recover.

                                  CAL
                    No. Never. 

      BACK AT THE BAR  

      Maya continues lecturing Tom; he just sits there, petrified.

                                  MAYA
                    And another thing: men don t cry.
                          (before Tom can protest)
                    No. Girls like it when Tom Brady 
                    cries because he s a man who 
                    handles his business on and off the 
                    field so when he cries it shows us 
                    an exciting new dimension of his 
                      personality. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                  25.

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                    But when a spineless bed-wetter 
                    like you cries it only confirms to 
                    us how weak men have become and 
                    that saddens us.

      Tom just looks at her, blown away...  Finally:

                                  TOM
                    Okay: can I just say something?

                                  MAYA
                    What.

                                  TOM
                    This has been so helpful.

                                  MAYA
                          (surprised)
                    Oh. Well. Good.

                                  TOM
                    I ve been killing myself trying to 
                    figure out why Laura left me, and 
                    my friends have been like:  she s 
                    crazy, she s banging other dudes,  
                    but you, a total stranger, actually 
                    told me the truth. It s not her. 
                    It s me. I m a little bitch...
                          (amazed)
                    This is fantastic.

                                  MAYA
                    Is it...?

                                  TOM
                    Yes! I finally have an answer! I 
                    can stop reading her texts and 
                    stalking her on Facebook and I can 
                    stop listening to Adele all the 
                    time and I can just...move on.

      Beat. Then Tom hugs Maya, emotional. She stiffens, alarmed.

      BACK AT BRUCE AND CAL S BOOTH

    The guys watch on through their fingers, horrified:

                                  CAL
                    Oh my God he s attacking her.

                                  BRUCE 
                    We should just pay our bill and 
                    quietly leave.                                                                                  26.


      BACK AT THE BAR  

      Tom releases Maya -- he looks liberated, overjoyed.

                                  TOM
                    I mean obviously I have to work on 
                    being less of a little bitch.

                                  MAYA
                    Right. Obviously.

                                  TOM
                    Of course, it s also possible I m 
                    not as bad as you think, and maybe 
                    you re just, like, really mean...

      There s that word again. Maya frowns, troubled.

                                  MAYA
                    Yeah, I ve been getting that a lot 
                      lately...Am I really that much more 
                    of a bitch than everyone else--?

                                  TOM
                    Yes.

                                  MAYA
                    Really? Because I feel like--

                                  TOM
                    No. There s definitely something 
                    very wrong with you. 

      Maya starts to object, then stops. She nods, a bit emotional, 
      finally hearing this...

                                  MAYA
                    Okay... Maybe...Maybe you re right.

                                  TOM
                    It s cool, we both have stuff to 
                    work on. But we ll be okay... I 
                    mean, I won t be, but you will.  

      She smiles at him, comforted... He smiles back, warm... It s 
      a sweet moment between two complete strangers... Then:  

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    So, like, can I get your number?
                          (off her GROAN)
                    What? You just said to stand up, 
                      articulate my whatever, and be a 
                    man! So here I am: give me your 
                    number, woman!                                                                                  27.


      Maya LAUGHS and looks at Tom, hopeless in his dumb shirt...

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                      Please...? Come on. Just be nice.

                                  MAYA
                    Fine. Give me a pen.

      Tom, shocked, frantically pats his pockets and looks around, 
      but there s no pen in sight-- until DOMINIC s hand appears 
      out of nowhere, holding up a PEN. Tom takes it, grateful--

                                  TOM
                    Thanks! Thank you!

      Tom quickly passes the pen to Maya... 

      BACK AT BRUCE AND CAL S BOOTH

      The guys sit there, dumbstruck, not believing their eyes...

                                  BRUCE
                    Is he getting her number?

                                  CAL
                    No. There s no way. No.

      BACK AT THE BAR  

      Maya writes her phone number on a cocktail napkin while Tom 
      grins, vibrating, unable to believe his luck.

                                  MAYA
                    You realize that this has been the 
                    worst pick-up ever. Like across all 
                    of human history. The worst.

                                  TOM
                    Yes! But it ll be a hilarious story 
                    to tell our children some day!

      She hands him the napkin with her number on it.

                                  MAYA
                    I hate children.

                                  TOM
                    So do I! With all the joy and the 
                      innocence? Who needs it--?

                                  MAYA
                    Please just go.                                                                                  28.


                                  TOM
                    I m gonna call the hell out of you.

                                  MAYA
                    Don t do that.

                                  TOM
                    Really, though. Thank you. This has 
                    been a real shot in the arm--

                                  MAYA
                    Walk away Tom.

                                  TOM
                          (backing away)
                    Yup! Love your bag by the way--

      Tom turns, and, as he heads back to his boys, he raises his 
      arms in the air like a prizefighter who s just won the belt!

      CAL AND BRUCE ERUPT

      They slap ten with each other! When Tom reaches them, they 
      hug him and jump on his back! Tom high-fives STRANGERS! Then

      LIV HURRIES INTO THE BAR PAST THEM

      Looking alt-cute in a patterned dress, Liv spots Maya at the 
      bar and makes for her. They kiss on the cheek as Liv sits.

                                  MAYA
                    Thank God you re here. I was just 
                    hit on by the weirdest dude ever. 

                                  LIV
                    Oh God, I m sorry.

                                  MAYA
                    Yeah, and get this: he cried.

                                  LIV
                    Another one? Is crying like the new 
                    hipster thing? 

                                  MAYA
                    I don t know. I called him a little 
                    bitch and he asked for my number.

    Liv LAUGHS as she scans the menu... Then she looks up:

                                  LIV
                    Wait -- you didn t actually give 
                    him your number, did you?                                                                                  29.


                                  MAYA
                    No! No. 
                          (beat)
                    I gave him yours.

                                  LIV
                    What?! Maya, I m engaged! I can t 
                    have some dork crying on my 
                    voicemail every night!

                                  MAYA
                    I was trying to be nice!

                                  LIV
                    You wanna be nice? Buy me a drink. 
                    Pay my rent. Don t give out my 
                    phone number to weirdos!
                          (LAUGHING with her...)
                    Did it make you feel good at least?

                                  MAYA
                    Yeah, actually. It really did...

      Maya looks down, just a little proud of herself...


      Jessica holds up her SOAKING-WET CLUTCH to the hand-drier, 
      pissed. Then Janey gently hugs her from behind, consoling.

                                  JANEY
                    I m sorry that guy yakked on your 
                    birthday clutch.

                                    JESSICA
                    Thanks... I m sorry I still treat 
                    you like a little girl. I just made 
                    so many mistakes with drunk, idiot 
                    losers and I really don t want you 
                    turning out like me, you know...?

                                  JANEY
                          (quietly, pulling her close)
                    I would love to turn out like you.

      Jessica smiles, touched...

                                    JESSICA
                    Okay don t make me cry I just did 
                    my eyes.

      Janey just holds her sister as she continues drying...                                                                                  30.



      Bruce and Cal toast their glasses to a beaming Tom.

                                  BRUCE
                    To Tommy: one month ago you were 
                    crying like a girl on Cal s floor, 
                    but tonight you picked yourself up 
                    by your penis and you played like a 
                    champion. And that s the measure of 
                    a man. I m real proud of you, bud. 

      They CLINK glasses and drink. 

                                  CAL
                    What a beautiful toast. That was 
                    like Ralph Waldo Iverson.

                                  BRUCE
                    Ralph Waldo Iverson? Does he write 
                    poems for the Philadelphia 76ers? 
                    You are literally worthless... 

      As Bruce and Cal start bickering again, we SLOWLY PUSH IN on

      TOM 

      smiling at the napkin is his hand. Proud. Happy. Reborn.  
      And, as Adele s  Set Fire to the Rain  rises, we pick up 
      QUICK SHOTS of the rest of our cast...

      DAN OR DON  

      leans against the exterior of the bar, drunkenly texting...

      JESSICA AND JANEY  

      are in the BATHROOM, holding the clutch up to the hand-drier 
      and dancing like idiots, happy sisters once again...

      DOMINIC AND KASEY  

      are in the BACK OFFICE, fucking like mad. She SLAMS him 
      against a cabinet, sending papers and glassware flying...

      LIV AND MAYA

      chat at their table. Maya, half-listening, glances over at 
      Tom, laughing with Cal and Bruce. She smiles, warmed by her 
      good deed. The night is off to a good start...

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  31.


                                  TAG


      Janey weaves through the bar with a glass of water. Various 
      men smile at her: a CLEAN CUT GUY in a suit, a FRIENDLY DUDE 
      in plaid. She blows past all these NICE GUYS, however, and...
