CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
aside.
COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:
a city in
moonlight!
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
No people
anywhere.
The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.
ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
something.
Finds it.
An insect.
COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.
As he clumsily inserts it
into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
There's something across the street in the dark.
Something alive.
COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!
Startled by the
light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.
STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.
DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN
As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
building.
COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
COLE'S POV:
spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.
Over it is
written, "WE DID IT!"
COLE looks up.
COLE'S POV:
high up on a building across the street, a LION
patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.
TTTLES END
CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY
A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
prisoners, crawls through a busy street.
The Police Department
logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.
TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY
DRIZZLING RAIN.
And SCREAMS.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?
SOLDIERS
in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
fifteen yards away.
Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
in FRENCH.
COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.
SERGEANT
(FRENCH, subtitled)
Where's your mask?!
And your clothes...
and your weapon, you idiot?!
COLE
What?
What??
COLE looks around desperately.
A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
stretchered past them in the narrow trench.
Machine guns chatter
close at hand.
AAK AAK AAK.
A grenade EXPLODES.
Reacting to the
foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...
SERGEANT
(FRENCH, subtitled)
Captain!
A Kraut!
We got a Kraut!
COLE
I don't understand.
Where am I?
The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.
CAPTAIN
(GERMAN, subtitled)
How'd you get here, soldier?
What's
your rank?
Where are your clothes?
COLE
I...don't understand.
CAPTAIN
(frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)
German!
Speak German!
What are you
doing here?
VOICE (o.s.)
(pleading in English)
I gotta find 'em.
I gotta find 'em.
Please, you gotta help me!
COLE turns, sees...
It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
the "underground" time.
He's being carried past COLE now on a
stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.
COLE
JOSE!
JOSE
Cole!
Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.
SUDDENLY,
SHOTS RING OUT.
COLE goes down.
Hit in the leg!
SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.
Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.
COLE is reaching for the mask when...
A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.
COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT
Stunningly quiet.
We are on a placid campus looking at the
dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.
MOVING IN we FOCUS ON
a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".
WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew
Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...
DR. KATHRYN RAILLY
MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
MAY 17
PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
A full moon.
COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
"Congratulations" to RAILLY.
She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
cars left in the lot.
The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...
Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
MAN'S VOICE
Get in!
Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
front seat.
MAN'S VOICE
I've got a gun.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
scrambles in behind her.
ACURA/PARKING LOT
The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.
FREEWAY - NIGHT
The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.
FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT
"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.
The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."
ACURA/FREEWAY
COLE'S POV:
the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...
IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
"-- cause since I met you, baby.
All I need is you..."
ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.
MOTEL - MORNING
The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS
MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.
MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING
COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.
SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY
An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he
rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.
EVANGELIST
"And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses and
dragons in their pleasant palaces:
and
her time is near to come, and her days
shall not be prolonged."
ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
COLE, beside her, staring out the window.
ACURA/SKID ROW
On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.
Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.
COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
insignias.
We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.
COLE
The Twelve Monkeys!!!
They're here.
(looks around)
Somewhere.
Come on!
He pulls her along the sidewalk.
No question, he's insane.
At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.
Then, still
keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...
COLE
Look, I'm warning you.
You do anything,
I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
RAILLY
I'm not going to "do" anything, I
promise.
But you need help, James.
None of this is what you think it is.
ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
He's found
another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!
But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.
RASPY VOICE (o.s)
You can't hide from them, Bob.
COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.
LOUIE
No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
(conspiratorially)
They hear everything.
They got that
tracking device on you.
They can find
you anywhere.
Anytime.
Ha Ha!
RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.
LOUIE
(touches his back jaw)
In the tooth, Bob!
Right?
(sudden triumphant grin)
But I fooled 'em, old buddy!
He opens his mouth wide.
NO TEETH'
COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.
COLE
They're keeping an eye on me.
RAILLY
Who's keeping an eye on you?
COLE
The man...with the voice.
I recognized
him.
He's from the present.
He...
COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...
there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS
And further on, another red stencil!
VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.
COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
RAILLY
James, no -- we shouldn't be here!
COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.
SECOND AVE - DAY
The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
points urgently at COLE.
EVANGELIST
You!
You!
You're one of us, aren't you?
But COLE has stopped and is staring at...
A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.
The sign
over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.
FREEWAY - AFTERNOON
In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with
bumper stickers and painted slogans.
"I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"...
"FREE THE ANIMALS"..."WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?"
RAILLY (v.o.)
You can't just barge in on a famous
scientist.
They'll have security guards,
gates, alarm systems.
It's insane, James.
FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)
The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
highway.
COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.
As
the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.
An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
intones over the RADIO...
RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
This just in:
police are widening
their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
prominent psychiatrist and author.
Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
been abducted by escaped mental patient,
James Cole. The two are believed to be
traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.
RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.
She feels so badly for
him.
She wants to help him.
She says, tenderly...
RAILLY
This can't go on, James.
You're not
well.
You're burning with fever.
COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
COLE
We need gas.
RAILLY
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
COLE
I said I was too young to drive.
I
didn't say I was stupid.
RAILLY
What's the matter with your leg?
COLE
I got shot.
Look -- there's a gas
station up ahead.
RAILLY
Shot!
Who shot you?
COLE
It was some kind of...war.
Never mind,
you wouldn't believe me.
Turn off here.
CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)
The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.
We HEAR the CAR
RADIO but not the engine.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
engineers continue their desperate
attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
ant in which nine year old...
COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.
He's staring up
at the sun and the sky.
RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.
RAILLY
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.
Lucky for you it was near the surface.
RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
COLE
I love seeing the sun.
A beat.
COLE tries to stand up.
RAILLY
Wait -- let me help you.
RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.
A beat.
They're very close.
They don't move.
RAILLY looks like she can
barely breathe.
COLE
(leans closer, shuts his eyes)
You smell so good.
RAILLY
(trying to concentrate)
You have to give yourself up, you know.
A beat.
The spell is broken.
He reaches for his pants, then
turns back to her, suddenly grim.
COLE
I have to do something now.
Something
I don't want to do.
I'm so sorry.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
He's
cold now, steeled.
COLE
I have a mission.
It's important.
RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.
MASON MANSION - NIGHT
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.
Encountering
another AGENT, he pauses.
FIRST AGENT
They find him?
SECOND AGENT
Who??
FIRST AGENT
That kid.
The one in the pipe.
SECOND AGENT
You believe this?
They're dropping a monkey
down there with a miniature infra-red camera
strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped in tinfoil.
FIRST AGENT
You're making that up!
ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.
SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
A monkey and a sandwich.
Wonder who
thought that one up.
FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
Prize!
Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.
He doesn't
see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.
MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked
luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.
AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU.
PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION
AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.
PARKED CARS/MANSION
AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.
LAWN/MANSION
AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.
SMASH.
The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
accelerates right at him!
AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.
MASON MANSION - NIGHT
Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.
AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
its rotors whipping around.
OUTERBRIDGE ROAD
The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.
HELICOPTER/WOODS
The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.
WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)
A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.
A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.
The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
Jaguar.
He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
POLICE OFFICER
He's not in here.
WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT
Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
beside the stream.
The car looks empty.
FORD
COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.
He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.
RAILLY
I could have died in there.
If something
had happened to you I would have died.
COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.
COLE
I...I...I'm really sorry.
Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.
RAILLY
What have you done?
Did you...kill someone?
COLE
(getting to his feet)
No!
I...don't think so.
I stole a car
and they chased me.
I hit a tree.
RAILLY
See -- you can drive after all!
COLE
Yeah, sort of, I guess.
I...I'm sorry
I locked you up.
I thought...I thought...
I think maybe I am crazy!
She looks at him.
Breakthrough?
Very calm now, the doctor.
RAILLY
What made you think that?
COLE
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
the virus.
And suddenly, I wasn't
sure.
We talked when I was in the
institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
The drugs and stuff.
(horrified)
You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
out the human race?
It was my idea?
RAILLY
Nobody is going to wipe out the human
race.
Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
else.
You've created something in your
mind, James -- a substitute reality.
In order to avoid something you don't
want to face.
COLE
I'm..."mentally divergent".
I would
love to believe that.
RAILLY
It can be dealt with, but only if you
want to.
I can help you.
COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.
COLE
I need help all right.
They're coming
after me.
RAILLY
First, it's important that you
surrender to them instead of them
catching you running.
Okay?
COLE
(brightening)
It would be great if I'm crazy.
If I'm
wrong about everything...the world will be
okay.
I'll never have to live underground.
RAILLY
Give me the gun.
COLE
The gun! ... I lost it
RAILLY
You're sure?
COLE
(showing her)
No gun!
(looking up)
Stars!
Air!
I can live here.
Breathe!
RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.
RAILLY
I'm going to attract their attention,
let them know where we are, okay?
RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.
RAILLY
(calling out)
They'll tell you to put your hands on top
of your head.
Do what they tell you.
You're
going to get better, James -- I know it!
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.
An insect!
He
reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.
The
HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.
ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.
ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.
COLE
I love this world!
ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
from the woods.
The police are almost here.
She gets out of the
car, starts around toward COLE.
RAILLY
Remember, I'm going to help you.
I'll
stay with you.
I won't let them...
She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!
COLE is gone.
Disappeared.
FAA STOREFRONT - DAY
LOUD BANGING!
The storefront window, completely covered with
posters, quivers violently.
Images of MONKEYS covered with
electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into
tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.
It's RAILLY.
RAILLY
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?
HELLO?
IS
SOMEONE IN THERE?
IF YOU'RE IN THERE,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
FAA STOREFRONT
From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,
seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.
RAILLY
I SAW YOU!
I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.
I
KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
RASPY VOICE (o.s)
Secret experiments!
RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.
LOUIE
That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!
RAILLY
You!
I know you!
But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.
LOUIE
Not just on them.
Do 'em on people,
too -- down at the shelters.
Feed 'em
chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.
RAILLY
Have you seen James Cole?
The man...?
LOUIE
They're watchin' you.
Takin' pictures.
RAILLY follows his look.
ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES
COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.
RAILLY
The police.
I know.
Listen, I need to
talk to James, but he has to be careful
how he contacts me.
He mustn't get
caught.
Do you understand me?
LOUIS
Uh, yeah, sure.
Uh...who's James?
RAILLY
He was with me, he spoke to you.
Several weeks ago.
He said you were
from the future...watching him.
LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!"
But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously
"tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.
RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.
FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE
ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,
amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.
He shakes his head wearily.
ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with
amazement, too.
They include...
an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...
a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...
an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...
the TEENAGED PUNKS...
a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,
reacting at the sight of RAILLY.
It's COLE!
He pushes toward her.
COLE
Kathryn!
RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.
RAILLY
James!
With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes
urgent charge of the situation.
RAILLY
James!
That's a policeman.
Pretend
you don't know me.
If he sees you...
COLE
(turning, looking)
No, I want to turn myself in.
Where is he?
(placing his hands on his head)
Don't worry -- it's all okay now.
I'm
not crazy any more!
I mean, I am
crazy, mentally divergent, actually,
but I know it now and I want you to
help me.
I want to get well...
ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
RAILLY
James -- put your hands down and listen
to me.
Things have changed!
ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:
she
tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
him along...but COLE isn't moving.
He's staring at the front of
the FAA Store with disbelief!
RAILLY
James, come on!
We have to get out of here!
COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:
ATTENTION!!!
POLICE ARE WATCHING!
IS THERE A VIRUS?
IS THIS THE
SOURCE?
THREE BILLION DIE?
It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!
COLE
I've seen that...before.
But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
RAILLY
James, trust me.
We're in terrible
trouble.
We have to run.
Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
ONLOOKERS.
She looks crazier than he does.
ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
colliding with a passing car.
BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.
SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY
An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.
The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
COP'S eyes searching everywhere.
Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.
HER POV:
the POLICE CAR passes from view.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,
RAILLY
James!
Come on.
A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
bits of lettuce in his hair.
COLE
I don't understand what we're doing.
RAILLY
(climbing out of the dumpster)
We're avoiding the police until I
can....talk to you.
COLE
(climbing out after her)
You mean, treat me?
Cure me?
Kathryn,
those words on the wall -- I've seen
them before...
I...I...dreamed them.
But she's not listening.
She's peeking out the alley entrance.
RAILLY'S POV:
across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.
GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
They come to the end of the metal stairway.
It's a long distance
to the ground.
COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.
She lets herself down to him.
Their eyes meet.
He holds her in
his arms for a moment.
Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
They start running down the alley.
BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
toney downtown shopping district.
Among them, RAILLY looks
furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.
She's hidden her
bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
handkerchief to his mouth.
As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
city, the tall downtown buildings.
His eyes go up.
COLE'S POV:
a building, towering toward the sky.
A building
with a ledge.
The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!
ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
entrance to a store.
RAILLY
Wait here.
I'm going to try that phone
number.
Let's hope it's nothing!
Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
looming frighteningly close.
A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
window.
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away
Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
toy in the display window.
Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.
COLE'S POV:
RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
the phone.
ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.
Confused, COLE stares
at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
RAILLY
James!
James!
It's okay.
We're
insane!
We're crazy!
COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.
RAILLY
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
COLE
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
RAILLY
(laughing)
No superiors!
No scientists.
No
people from the future.
It's just a
Carpet Cleaning Company.
They have
voice mail -- you leave a message
telling them when you want your carpet
cleaned.
COLE
You... you left them a message?
RAILLY
(impishly)
I couldn't resist.
I was so relieved.
Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
telling them...they better watch out
for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
realizes the truth!
He starts to recite...
COLE
"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
they're the ones who are going to do
it.
I can't do anything more.
The
police are watching me."
Now she's stunned.
She glances back and sees the phone booth
twenty yards away.
RAILLY
You... you couldn't have heard me.
COLE
They got your message, Kathryn.
They
played it for me.
It was a bad
recording...distorted.
I didn't
recognize your voice.
RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.
ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
into the CROWD.
RAILLY
Come on.
PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.
VAN/FREEWAY
The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.
GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.
URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.
Then, METAL ON METAL.
Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
with phony rocks.
Stalking back and forth.
Huge.
Upset.
CLANK.
CLANK.
METAL ON METAL.
GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
What are you doing to me?
Where are
we?
Jeffrey, please...
SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
For God's sake, put the tape back on
his mouth!
The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
Forget the tape.
The monkey's louder than
he is.
You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?
PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.
LION'S PEN/ZOO
The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.
From the darkness,
unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.
AVIARIES/ZOO
A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.
SUBURBS - DAWN
The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
reality.
Did we really see him at all?
CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
building, deserted in the early morning light.
High up, a MONKEY
his head around a girder.
Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.
SHOPPING MALL - DAWN
Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.
Nothing happens.
For a long moment.
Then, an AFRICAN BULL
ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.
PARKING LOT/AIRPORT
As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher
YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks
back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.
