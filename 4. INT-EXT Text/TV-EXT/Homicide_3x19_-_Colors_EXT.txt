      An average, ordinary middle-class neighborhood. Solid 
      homes. Well-kept lawns. Family-size cars. Completely out of 
      place, a regulation Baltimore City Police Department 
      Cavalier drives along.

                                  BOLANDER (O.C.)
                    Nothing is real.

                                  PEMBLETON (O.C.)
                    What do you mean, nothing is real?

                                  BOLANDER (O.C.)
                    There is no reality.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Really...

      The Cavalier pulls over to curb. FRANK PEMBLETON gets out 
      of driver's side as STANLEY BOLANDER emerges from the 
        passenger's. They head down the sidewalk.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Take the color green. You see green, I see 
                    green. We call it "green" because as a 
                    society we have agreed that this thing, 
                    this color, is green. We think we're having 
                    the shared experience of green, but how do 
                    we know? Maybe my green is actually greener 
                    than your green.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You mean, maybe my green is red?

                                  BOLANDER
                    Maybe. Take colorblind people, they carry 
                    with them a stigma --

                                  PEMBLETON
                      A stigmatism.                                  BOLANDER
                    Because they don't see what the rest of us 
                    see as green. But maybe, just maybe, their 
                      perception is correct. Maybe a colorblind 
                    person is actually seeing pure green, the 
                    real green.

      They pass through yellow plastic police lines. We become 
      aware that the calm of the neighborhood has been shattered 
      by a crime. An M.E. Van waits for its latest passenger. 
      UNIFORMS hold ONLOOKERS at bay. Other POLICE PERSONNEL move 
      in and out of a white, two story home.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Man, this is just my luck. I get a call. My 
                    partner's off tonight. So I look around the 
                    Squad Room. I see Munch. No. I see Howard. 
                    No. Felton. Lewis. No. No. I think 
                    Bolander. I'll take Bolander. He's the only 
                    one who won't drive me crazy.

                                  BOLANDER
                    I'm driving you crazy?

                                  PEMBLETON
                      Philosophizing. You're not know as the 
                      philosophical type, Stan.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You get shot in the head, it makes you 
                    think.

      They reach the front door of the house. The BODY of a 
      seventeen year old, olive-skinned man, Hikmet Gersel, lies 
      dead, shot through the chest. His face is covered with 
      white stage makeup. He wears a leather jacket. ALYSSA DYER, 
      Assistant Medical Examiner, takes notes. PEMBLETON turns to 
      Officer STEVEN PASKULY.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hey, Paskuly, what've we got?

                                    PASKULY
                    The deceased name is Hikmet Gersel, G-E-R-
                    S-E-L. 
                                  (MORE)                                    PASKULY (CONT'D)
                    Seventeen years old, exchange student from 
                    Turkey.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Do Turks wear white makeup? Is that some 
                    kind of religious thing? Or is he a mime?

                                    PASKULY
                    The owner of the house thought he was a 
                    burglar, shot him.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Where's the homeowner?

                                    PASKULY
                    Inside. I got him and his wife in separate 
                    rooms. Plus a friend of this kid here. The 
                    friend says they were going to a party and 
                    got the wrong address.

      PEMBLETON, BOLANDER and PASKULY enter house.


      Car stops. BAYLISS gets out.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    You have the right to an attorney. If you 
                    decide not to speak to an attorney at this 
                    time, no questions will be asked of you. Do 
                    you understand?                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Yes.

      BAYLISS crosses to the Jim Bayliss' home as the M.E. TEAM 
      puts BODY into van.


      Pick-up truck drives along.                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    Hikmet was really excited about going to 
                    the party.

      The pick-up stops in middle of street.


      GERSEL runs up to the house.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    I drove around the corner to park.

      Pick-up pulls away.


      SCHOLTZ exits pick-up, crosses to bushes.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    And I suddenly got sick.

      On SCHOLTZ, leaning over, puking,      TIME CUT TO:


      SCHOLTZ walks across street.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    I was crossing the street when I saw Hikmet 
                    standing at the front door of the house. 
                    And a guy in the doorway was holding a gun. 
                    They were both yelling loud. The guy aimed 
                    the gun at Hikmet's chest, Hikmet put his 
                    hand's up. Then the guy --

      ECU of SCHOLTZ's face. On the SOUND of the gun BLAST,

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The Car pulls into driveway. BAYLISS, JIM and SHANNON get 
      out. The driveway and lawn are a mess -- trampled through, 
      paper strewn. They walk to front door. JIM stops.

      JIM's POV: The chalk line around the body of Gersel; inside 
      the circle are the remains of his blood and guts.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                      I would've though you cops would clean up 
                    after yourselves.

                                    BAYLISS
                    That's not our job. I'll bet the inside of 
                    the house is a mess, too.

                                  JIM
                    Y'know, you could start a company, a 
                    cleaning company. After the cops leave the 
                    scene of a crime, they come in, clean up 
                      everything.

                                    BAYLISS
                    In Balto, you'd make a fortune.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'm going to check on the kids, send my 
                    folks home.

      SHANNON faces JIM, who's staring at the chalk line.

                                    SHANNON (CONT.)
                    You should go to bed.

      JIM nods, still staring. SHANNON kisses BAYLISS.

                                    SHANNON (CONT.)
                    Thank you.                                    BAYLISS
                    Hey...

      SHANNON goes into house. BAYLISS puts his palm on JIM's 
      shoulder. Beat. JIM turns to him. Without thinking, they 
      hug each other -- a spontaneous act of forgiveness, 
      comfort, support.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    Shannon's right, you should get some sleep.

                                  JIM
                    In a minute.

      JIM crosses to side of house, gets hose. He turns on 
      spigot. He crosses back to front door. He turns down the 
      nozzle, water spews forth. He starts hosing down the 
      sidewalk, washing away the chalk line, the blood, the guts.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                    Who'd've thought his guts would be the same 
                    color as ours...

      BAYLISS reacts. On the TWO of THEM watching the blood and 
      guts flow in a stream to the curb,

                                                                              CUT TO:
