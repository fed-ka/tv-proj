Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run
for Congress some day.
At first glance.
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution
style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field.
JAKE (V.O.)
And I think it's because of this
redhead...
BUTCH (O.S.)
Know who I am, Jake?
JAKE
The Anti-Christ?
BUTCH (O.S.)
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the
Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy
looking for some answers.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being
cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.
The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his
suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a
"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".
BUTCH (cont' d)
Things are probably going to end badly
for you, Jake.
JAKE
Gee... What makes you say that?
BUTCH
Your life flashing before your eyes?
JAKE
Just the last three weeks.

BUTCH
That's not a bad place to start.
CUT TO:
EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
Title: Three Weeks Ago...
The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as
LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles
out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead.
A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver.
JAKE
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.
I don't
know what happened.
LIONEL
Y-y-you fucking shot him!
That's what
happened!
JAKE
I had to! That motherfucker was about
to welch! You saw what he was doing,
right? You heard him!
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.
LIONEL
I can't be here! You understand?
I
can' t--
JAKE
Listen to me! It went to shit.
It
happens sometimes.
In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.
LIONEL
Oh Jesus!
JAKE
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.
We can still get through this but you
have to keep your head and trust me!
Jake takes a tentative step forward.
Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.
The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
LIONEL
What-- What do we do?
JAKE
Help me.
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.
CUT TO:
Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--
OFFICER (O.S.)
Everybody FREEZE!
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street.
CUT TO:
Butch shaking his head, still holding the gun.
BUTCH
Grifters...
JAKE
We can't all be model citizens such as
yourself.
BUTCH
It's all about the money, isn't it?
JAKE
Isn't it always?
CUT TO:
Jake walks down the crowded street, passing the bars and
restaurants of SoHo. His jacket's buttoned up to hide
the blood stains.
JAKE (V.O.)
It can make you think you're on top of
the world.
Jake passes a group of well-dressed, well manicured people
waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called "Wax."
Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at
the moment. An outsider.
An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps
into Jake.
LILY
(innocently)
Oops.
She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return. They
stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked
away by an OLDER MAN, dressed in an expensive suit.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
Jake's smile fades as he watches her saunter into the
bar, but not before she throws him another glance over
her shoulder. Jake continues on into...
CUT TO:
A basement bar in a crummy neighborhood. There's no sign,
but everything about it says, "Condemned."
JAKE (V.O.)
The Euclid was our place.
CUT TO:
17.
A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what
kind of gym it is.
A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and
Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back.
SOBOZINSKI
The King, huh? Nice going.
JAKE
I try.
ROTTOVICH
Don't dick around too long. And if he
stabs you or shoots you or causes any
other form of profuse bleeding, call a
cab because you are not getting back in
this car!
Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus
stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit.
HARLIN
We appreciate your punctuality.
Mr.
King is expecting you.
Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up
against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake
down.
HARLIN
Lupus!
LUPUS
What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin'
him down.
Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
HARLIN
It only takes a moment to be polite.
My apologies, Mr. Vig. If you wouldn't
mind?
Jake steps back and raises his arms.
JAKE
You the one that did it?
You the one
that got Al?
HARLIN
Mr. King prefers to farm out for that
kind of work.
(gesturing to the
door)
Please, after you.
Harlin gives the Officers Sobozinski and Rottovich a slight
nod of acknowledgment.
CUT TO:
Jake shakes his head slowly.
JAKE
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're
one to talk. You're the one who's got
me on my knees in a dark alley.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
BUTCH
And these cops? What do they get?
CUT TO:
Rottovich and Sobozinski walk quickly down the street.
Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands
buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder.
As he gets closer, we see that he's just a KID of about
ten or eleven.
Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid's hood.
SOBOZINSKI
You know who we are?
KID
The heat.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
Rottovich can't help smiling.
ROTTOVICH
That's right. We're the heat.
(yelling)
STICK `EM UP!
The Kid jumps back startled and throws his hands up.
The
cops share a laugh.
ROTTOVICH
Alright. Put your hands dawn.
What do you got in the bag?
KID
Something for my Pops.
ROTTOVICH
I see. Well, your Pops has been making
you carry around drugs for him. We're
going to have to take them.
The Kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack
over. Rottovich opens it and pulls out TWO BRICKS OF
HEROIN, wrapped in plastic. He nods to Sobozinski.
The Kid stays rooted right where he is, looking up at the
Detectives like a lost puppy.
KID
My Pops is going to be mad.
ROTTOVICH
Give the kid a twenty.
Sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills
for the kid who then sprints away.
SOBOZINSKI
What's the world coming to?
Everybody's on the friggin' take...
Rottovich and Sobozinski head off with the knapsack.
CUT TO:
Butch and Jake...
BUTCH
Keeping the Fix happy.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
JAKE
You never know when you can use a crooked
cop.
BUTCH
Keep going. I want to know how you got
Lionel Dolby.
JAKE
So you want to know how to play the Big
Con.
BUTCH
In this case, you might say I want to
know how not to play the Big Con.
Butch shoves the gun a little harder into Jake's head.
CUT TO:
Under the light of a streetlamp, the two continue to
talk.
JAKE (V.O.)
I tell you the "Tale"-- It's the story
of how we're going to make easy money.
No one gets hurt. And here's the guy
who's going to help. That's when you
meet the Insideman.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly
anxious. Introductions are made.
JAKE (V.O.)
The Insideman's the one with the know-
How, the scoop, the angle. But maybe
'you' re the suspicious type . So I
give you the "Convincer." We both put
up a little and we get a little back.
Just a taste.
Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to
Dolby.
JAKE (V.O.)
Just enough that when I tell you we can
make more off of it, you agree.
Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically.
He
hands the envelope back to Gordo.
JAKE (V.O. )
That`s when I put you on the "Send."
You put in -a little, you got a little.
Put in a lot... I "send" you out for
mare.
As much as you can get.
CUT TO:
Dolby tries to act casual as he walks away.
CUT TO:
Jake pushes Lily through the back door where she finds
Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting. Her once flirtatious
demeanor is replaced by something harder.
LILY
What is this? You guys cops or
something?
JAKE
We're not cops.
GORDO
You gotta be kidding me.
Her?
JAKE
Yes, her.
Where's my wallet?
LILY
Your what?
Jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor--
A few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring. Jake picks
up one of the wallets filled with cash.
LILY (cont'd)
That's not--
JAKE
(pocketing the wallet)
You interested in a little work?
Lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them
all suspiciously.
LILY
Sorry about your wallet, but if you
think I'm going to suck dick over thirty
seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a
bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.
(lighting the cigarette)
Jake.
34.
JAKE
Take a deep breath and count to ten.
It's not that kind of work. You're
Lily, right?
LILY
Says who?
JAKE
You're working Daffy's block. He was
going to break your kneecaps. Pick-
pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I
told him you were with us, so that's
two you owe me.
Lily takes a second to look the guys over. Miles gives
her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.
JAKE
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless
you figure on getting rich lifting
wallets while old guys feel you up.
LILY
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who
feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda
gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha
going?
Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin.
Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing.
She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half
inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She
whispers...
LILY (cont' d)
Keep the wallet. We're even. Take a
deep breath... Count to ten... And go
fuck yourself.
Lily pushes past Jake and heads out of the alley.
MILES
Is it just me or is there something
really hot about a girl telling you to
go fuck yourself?
Gordo gives Jake a nod of approval and Jake takes off
after Lily.
CUT TO:
35.
Lily down the street, Jake giving chase.
JAKE
Alright!
Hold up.
You win.
You got
the job.
LILY
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find
that bridge to jump off.
Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way.
JAKE
We had to see what your deal was.
I'm
just a little superstitious.
LILY
Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time.
What do you want me for anyway? You
don't even know me.
JAKE
I just have a good feeling about you.
Haven't you ever had someone say they
had a good feeling about you before?
Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm.
None.
LILY
No.
(beat)
What's my cut?
JAKE
You get an equal cut.
LILY
What do I have to do?
JAKE
Just play a part.
A little acting.
Lily steps back and hails a cab.
LILY
Make a wish.
She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store
window reading "11:11p".
LILY
Eleven-eleven. If you're superstitious,
make a wish.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
Lily hops into the Cab and tosses Jake's new wallet onto
the sidewalk.
LILY (cont'd)
That's twice.
The cab pulls away.
Jake looks up at the clock-- "11:12P".
CUT TO:
Butch smiles...
BUTCH
I can see why you liked her.
JAKE
That was it. We had our crew.
Now we
needed the Mark.
CUT TO:
A busy mid-day New York sidewalk.
Gillette heads towards
a waiting Town Car.
JAKE
Most of his money's clean. A lot of it
isn't. The best part is that we know
exactly where it is.
As Gillette and his crew disappear into the car, we PAN
up to see the front of the building which has a large
sign reading, "City Bank of Manhattan; A Gillette Family
Company."
CUT TO:
Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the
bank. Not even a car: Jake strides out of the Grand
Caymen's Bank and walks across the street to another
building with a sign reading "BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS."
CUT TO:
Jake exits the terminal. Outside, the street is empty,
not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a
cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk"
signal is given.
JAKE (V.O.)
Then we disappear.
As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying
luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP...
Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING
into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in
the crowd.
CUT TO:
Jake dials a number...
JAKE (V.O.)
I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down,
a dumb fucking idea.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
JAKE (V.O.)
But they bought it. Now I had to deliver
and I needed help.
JAKE (into phone)
Yeah, it's Jake. How'd that tip work
out?
CUT TO:
Butch takes out a cigarette.
BUTCH
But there were other factors.
JAKE
Factors that weren't clear to me until
now.
CUT TO:
A serious look comes across Jake's face-- Hate.
Butch
eases back with the gun for a second.
JAKE
He's just as crooked as the next guy.
You'd think he'd have more important
things to do with tax payer dollars.
BUTCH
Cue the fucking violins.
Come on...
It's getting cold.
CUT TO:
Butch lets out an easy laugh.
BUTCH
Nice.
JAKE
We got our stake. Now we need to find
our guy in Gillett's bank.
CUT TO:
A flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day.
Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of
the building. Miles reads off a piece of paper.
JAKE (V.O.)
What you're looking for in a mark is
someone who's weakness you can exploit.
MILES
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit,
MICHELLE STRIGO. They follow her down the street.
JAKE (V.O.)
Guy like me, with people like that...
I'll tell you what you're looking for
without even meeting you. It's like a
personal ad you wear over your head.
Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a
cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming
match with the man.
FREEZE FRAME ON MICHELLE--- A CGI SIGN appears over her
head "Single, volatile, confrontational woman seeks "man"
for economic security and house chores."
JAKE
No.
CUT TO:
52.
A flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day.
Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of
the building.
MILES
Jay Houlser.
VP International finance.
Miles points out a JAY HOUSLER, a young guy in suit.
They follow him...
CUT TO:
The same flood of people exit the bank... Jake, Lupus,
Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building.
MILES
Alice Tanner. Finance Director.
Miles points out ALICE TANNER, a mousy looking woman in a
bad skirt. She gets to the intersection and waits for
the light to change, even as hordes of others jaywalk the
way New Yorkers do.
FREEZE FRAME ON ALICE-- A CGI SIGN appears: "Single woman
looking for opportunity. Plays by the rules and willing
to claw her way up to middle management."
JAKE
No.
CUT TO:
53.
Again the flood of people.
Again Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles
and Gordo wait.
MILES
Grant Ashby.
VP of Corporate Loans.
Miles points out a GRANT ASHBY, a schlubish middle aged
balding guy walking down the street. They follow.
CUT TO:
Jake and Lily exit the store.
Jake hands Lily the
trademark colored box.
JAKE
Happy anniversary.
Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed. Jake
Looks up to see Mr. Lewis watching them as he tries to
hail a cab.
Jake's demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile.
JAKE
Smile. You just got a present from the
man of your dreams.
Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box.
JAKE
Now we gotta give him a strong finish.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into her eyes. She leans
in and they kiss-- A deep, slow kiss that makes people
have to walk around them.
Mr. Lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into
a cab.
Jake and Lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away.
Lily finally breaks the kiss--- Slowly.
LILY
He's gone.
JAKE
Uh-huh.
LILY
I gotta go get a haircut.
JAKE
Uh-huh.
Jake watches as Lily walks away. She looks back at Jake
once before disappearing around a corner.
CUT TO:
Butch takes out two cigarettes and lights both, sticking
one in Jake's mouth.
JAKE
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't
light three cigarettes with a match?
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
JAKE (cont' d)
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW' s,
if you took the time to light three
cigarettes with one match, some Nazi
would be able to figure out where you
were. Then, well... It was the last
cigarette you and your two buddies ever
had. So three on a match is bad luck.
BUTCH
You're a superstitious fucker.
JAKE
Luck's a funny thing.
Especially the
bad.
BUTCH
Like what?
JAKE
Having a gun pointed at you for one.
It's not like breaking a mirror bad
luck, but it's bad. Three on a match,
black cats... Believe it. Believe it
all.
CUT TO:
Butch cracks a big smile.
BUTCH
She had you tempting fate.
JAKE
My father used to play the same fucking
lotto numbers with these other guys in
the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday
for sixteen years. One day he gets
pissed off, tells them he's out and
plays his own numbers. They hit the
Lucky Seven for one point two million.
LILY steps out from behind Butch.
LILY
Guess he passed on that unlucky-
asshole gene.
Lily looks down at Jake and the gun pointed at his head.
There's not even a hint of sympathy.
LILY
You should have trusted me Jake.
CUT TO:
Jake takes a deep breath, Butch and Lily behind him.
BUTCH
Is that what it was, Jake?
Was it
love?
JAKE
You know when the first con was ever
played? It was when Adam fell for Eve
in the Garden of Eden.
Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment.
JAKE
Then she fucked him over with an apple.
(with a dry laugh)
Redheads...
Jake continues to LAUGH...
CUT TO:
80.
INT . - LILY'S APARTMENT--DAY
Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality
of this slum-pit studio apartment.
Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon
RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing
subway train. The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening
volume.
Jake's a little alarmed.
Lily, oblivious.
JAKE
(drowned out by the
rumble)
How do you deal with---
LILY
(yelling)
WHAT?
JAKE
(yelling back)
SAID, HOW DO--
(the subway passes)
Deal with that?
Lily shrugs indifferently.
LILY
Do you think we can do it?
Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some
of last night's magic.
JAKE
Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be
alright. You're not in the hole with
the King.
Lily rolls away from Jake.
Undaunted, Jake starts kissing
her back.
LILY
Who says you have to know the King to
be in a whole? I actually did have a
real job once. When I was in high
school, I worked as a candy striper.
JAKE
Sounds respectable.
LILY
Not the way I did it. I was loaded
half the time. I don't know how you
could change bedpans sober.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
LILY (CONT'D)
I used to hang out with this guy,
Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or
something.
JAKE
You want to talk about an old
boyfriend right now?
Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck.
LILY
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a
boyfriend at the time... What was his
name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty.
I was only fifteen. But he was a nice
guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We
used to get loaded on pills from the
nurses station and then listen to
Morrisey or some stupid shit like
that.
JAKE
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never
worked for me.
LILY
We were friends. I trusted him. I
should have known it was weird. But,
then again I was weird.
JAKE
You guys got busted.
This is a great
neck.
Jake still kissing...
LILY
No, we never got busted. We were done
with a shift one night, both a couple
of Percocets down and I was telling
Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we
were thinking about doing it, you know?
I was thinking about letting him be my
first because I loved him.
(pause)
What the hell was his name?
JAKE
Glenn talked you out of it.
LILY
Sort of. I was telling him about this
great love of my life who's name I don't
remember, and I could see... He was
getting pissed. I thought it was just
because he was worried about me, but...
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
LILY (cont'd)
He told me that I was stupid because
my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back.
He
climbs on top of her.
JAKE
He was looking out for you.
LILY
Then he grabbed me and threw me down
on the floor, that really cold
linoleum tiled hospital floor and
started ripping my uniform off.
(pause)
He said he was going to "fuck some
sense into me."
Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her.
LILY
Shit, what was that guy's name?
I really
liked him.
JAKE
Lily... Jesus Christ...
LILY
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a
couple of valiums and I went home. The
next day, I finished my shift and met
him around back, like we always did. I
stuck a number eight scalpel into his
chest. Three or four times.
Jake slides off Lily.
JAKE
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
LILY
I don't know. I packed up my shit and
ran away. To this... So unlike you, I
guess I do have something to prove, in
a repressed anger sort of way.
Jake considers for a second.
JAKE
No. You trusted him... You were just
getting square.
LILY
You know why I told you that, Jake?
(turning towards him)
Because I trust you too.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
Jake tries a reassuring smile even though he's not sure
it's something he should be smiling about.
The spoon starts to RATTLE again as another subway train
RUMBLES in the distance.
CUT TO:
Lily shakes her head in disbelief that Jake would tell
the story.
JAKE
Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can't
all share at a time like this...
Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily.
BUTCH
You got some issues, huh?
LILY
(with a hiss)
I can take care of myself.
Butch freezes as A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the BACKGROUND,
growing CLOSER then FADING again. He puts the gun back
to Jake's head.
BUTCH
Hurry up.
CUT TO:
Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and Lupus... As they move through
the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and Sobozinski appear
behind them.
ROTTOVICH
Hey Jake.
Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square
in the face.
Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an
alley.
JAKE
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
ROTTOVICH
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little
more curious about the Fed.
JAKE
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay
your taxes, that's your business.
Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach.
Miles and Gordo
lurch forward--
SOBOZINSKI
(pulling his gun)
Back up.
LUPUS
You want I should hold him down?
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
Gordo throws Lupus a look.
ROTTOVICH
Special Agent Gunther Moonan.
Ring a
bell?
JAKE
Gunther?
I think I'd remember a Gunther.
ROTTOVICH
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Sobozinski punches Jake again.
JAKE
Oh yeah.
Moonan.
I remember now.
Thanks.
ROTTOVICH
Well he's
in town and he sure as shit
remembers
you. What are we going to do
about this
Jake? We can't afford to
have a Fed
onto us.
JAKE
Wouldn't dream of it.
Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him
GASPING to the ground.
ROTTOVICH
I don't know what you're into with the
King Pin, but whatever it is we get a
piece, understand? We get a big piece.
If we find out you're keeping us out, I
may suddenly develope a conscious and
give you up to Moonan myself. Say
something stupid if we got a deal,
Jake.
JAKE
(gasping for breath)
Something stupid.
ROTTOVICH
Good boy.
SOBOZINSKI
And don't leave town!
(to Rottovich)
I always wanted to say that...
As the cops exit, Lily, Miles and Gordo rush to Jake.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
LILY
People don't like you much, do they?
Jake lets out a pained GROAN as they help him up.
CUT TO:
A BELL... A mechanical rabbit springs forward.
Greyhounds
bolt out of the gate.
JAKE (V.O.)
About four years ago, we were working
in Miami, turf fixing for some local
goon.
CUT TO:
88.
Moonan walks over to a car.
JAKE (V.O.)
He didn't really have anything on us,
but I figure, maybe this guy's good
for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner.
Moonan pulls a piece of paper off the windshield that
reads: "La Scala 2night."
CUT TO:
Miles pulls up in an old Cadillac, picking up Jake at the
entrance. They pick up Gordo and Big Al from a side door
and drive off as Moonan limps out of the restaurant, still
holding his crotch.
CUT TO:
Butch hovering over Jake...
BUTCH
So much for honor among thieves. You
would have cut loose your friends, your
girl...
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
JAKE
I was doing it for them.
BUTCH
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You -
Lost your nerve! You lost your
confidence! You weren't being noble.
You weren't trying to save anybody but
yourself! Admit it.
JAKE
It's not true.
BUTCH
Yes it is Jake! Yes it is! They were
right there for you. She was right
there for you! Look at her!
Jake doesn't move.
Butch grabs him by the hair and turns
him towards Lily.
BUTCH (cont'd)
She trusted you and you sold her out!
Be honest! Be a man! Tell her, Jake!
Tell her that you loved her but the
money meant more to you!
Butch kicks Jake in the gut.
BUTCH (cont'd)
Grifters... Gentleman's racket... My
ass. You're just any other lowlife
stammer-- Looking out for number one.
Jake shuts his eyes, maybe because Butch is right.
CUT TO:
INT . - JAKE'S APARTMENT-- NIGHT
Lupus and Jake sit at the table.
Lupus on the phone.
LUPUS
Hey, boss. It's me. The bank's in.
It's happening tomorrow... Jake?
Lupus turns to Jake and slaps him on the shoulder good
buddy-style.
LUPUS (cont' d)
He got a little shaky there for a minute,
but we got him back in the batter's
box.
CUT TO:
94.
BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
With a shrug, Jake continues...
JAKE
We were back on.
BUTCH
After you cut her loose.
JAKE
She walked.
Lily pushes Butch aside and moves closer to Jake.
LILY
I walked? Let me tell you a story,
asshole...
CUT TO:
Jake, Butch and Lily...
JAKE
Sorry.
I didn't know...
LILY
Your friend, Big Al?
It should have
been you.
BUTCH
Alrlght, alrlght.
What happened today?
JAKE
Today?
Started off great...
CUT TO:
Crystal blue water gently rolls onto virgin white sand.
A jet cuts a line across the cloudless sky...
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
JAKE (V.O.)
Ashby was going to call us with the
exact time of the transfer. The King
was waiting on us. Just to be safe...
CUT TO:
Gordo listens into a cell phone: Without saying a word,
he gets up, wheeling a nondescript BLACK SUITCASE.
Across the street sits the Grand Caymen's Bank in all
it's pastel and brass glory.
CUT TO:
Gordo walks across the street with the suitcase and pulls
a cell phone from his pocket.
GORDO
First and ten.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
Gordo hangs up without another word. He approaches a
building with the words "BANK OF THE CAYMENS" engraved
over the brass handled doors.
CUT TO:
The Security Guard holds open the door as Gordo exits,
suitcase in tow. Gordo takes his cell phone out as he
moves across the street.
GORDO
We got Twinkies.
Gordo pockets the phone and disappears into the crowd.
CUT TO:
A black Lincoln Town Car rolls through the parking lot.
Behind the wheel we see Harlin with the King Pin riding
in the back.
The Town Car passes...
MILES SITTING ON THE HOOD OF A CAR LOOKING AT THE
TERMINAL.
We follow the Town Car as it passes...
ROTTOVICH AND SOBOZINSKI STAKED OUT IN AN UNMARKED POLICE
CAR A FEW SPACES PAST MILES.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
The Town Car finally parks in the same row, each car,
separated only by a few spaces.
CUT TO:
Rottovich turns the walkie talkie off as he and Sobozinski
fall in behind Harlin.
ANGLE ON MILES-- Who steps out of his car, watching the
little parade go by with a look of confusion.
CUT TO:
Harlin gets to the King Pin's car and opens the back door.
As he crams the suitcase in, Rottovich and Sobozinski
come up behind him, guns drawn.
ROTTOVICH
Hey asshole.
They both grin like idiots.
CUT TO:
Miles on a cell phone...
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
MILES
Jake! I don't know what's going on!
The King Pin... He's here and he just
got pinched. I think with the
twinkies! It looks like half the
police department's down here!
In the BACKGROUND, a whirlwind of activity-- Red and blue
flashing lights, half of the police department, Federal
Agents in blue windbreakers... The King and Harlin slumped
over the hood of the car, cuffed.
CUT TO:
Jake runs his tongue across the front of his teeth.
BUTCH
You're welcome.
LILY
Can we please all stop being so
goddamnfucking-polite and get to the
point?
BUTCH
Right.
Where's the money, Jake?
Butch presses the gun against Jake's head.
Jake turns
and looks at Lily. They lock eyes.
JAKE
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee?
Because it is all about the money,
right?
LILY
You sold me out. You should have trusted
me like I trusted you. You fucked up.
You fucked up HUGE.
Butch taps Jake on the head with the gun.
BUTCH
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't
get shit, unless I get that money.
Where is it?
JAKE
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal
Government.
Butch buttons his coat.
BUTCH
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you
just let Lily here down again.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
BUTCH (cont'd)
What was it you said about playing the
big con?
JAKE
It's like putting on a play, where
everyone knows their part except for
the mark.
BUTCH
Like putting on a play... Guess some
people forgot their lines.
JAKE
Guess so.
BUTCH
So why don't you take a deep breath,
Jake, and I'll count to ten. One.
Two. Three...
As Butch continues to count, Jake slowly turns his head
and looks at Lily.
Butch, still counting, smiles at Lily's obvious contempt
then slides the gun along the back of Jake's head.
JAKE
I do trust you, Lily.
Butch turns back to Lily to see her reaching into her
bag...
BUTCH
Wha-
Butch spins and aims at her.
Lily pulls out a gun and... BLAM!!!
CUT TO:
Lily drops the gun and breaks down in tears
BUTCH
Jesus Christ! Tell me before you do
something like that!
Jake lies face down in a puddle, the collected pool of
water growing red with blood.
POLICE SIRENS WAIL in the distance, growing closer.
BUTCH
You should leave.
Butch disappears down the dark alley.
Lily stands for a moment and takes a final look at Jake's
body. She then turns and runs back into the bar.
JAKE (V.O.)
So I'm dead...
POLICE OFFICERS and FEDERAL AGENTS in windbreakers swarm
all over the parking lot.
The King and Harlin are bent over the hood of the car,
cuffed.
One Federal Agent pulls the black suitcase out of the
car.
JAKE (V . O . )
But maybe I can't blame Lily. Maybe I
just should have just trusted her to
play her part. Because playing the big
con is like putting on a play. A play
where everyone knows their part except
for the Mark...
CUT TO:
POLICE OFFICERS and FEDERAL AGENTS in windbreakers swarm
around the King Pin's car.
JAKE (V.O.)
Then you give them the "Blow-off".
You
get them off your back. Forever.
The King Pin and Harlin are bent over the hood handcuffed.
Rottovich and Sobozinski lie on the ground, face down,
their hands behind their heads.
ROTTOVICH
We're on the job! We're active in the
one-six.
Next to them, a Federal Agent opens the suitcase. Coffee
beans spill out on the asphalt, followed by the two bricks
of heroin.
The TWO INTERNAL AFFAIRS officers from before emerge from
the crowd.
IA OFFICER#1
Officers Rottovich and Sobozinski?
The second Internal Affairs officer holds up a
MICROCASSETTE.
SOBOZINSKI
Fuck me...
CUT TO:
RIPPING SOUNDS...
JAKE (V.O.)
But what do I care? I'm dead...
A THIN, WHITE VEST, splattered with blood and wired with
squibs falls to the ground.
POLICE SIRENS WAIL just around the corner.
CUT TO:
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
Jake emerges from .the back alley, his shirt ripped and
splattered with fake blood.
JAKE (V.O.)
No one's going to ask me:
A black car comes to a stop n front of him.
The tinted
glass slides down and Jake leans in.
JAKE
Drop something?
Inside we see Moonan and Lily riding in the back, Miles
and Gordo up front.
LILY
(innocently)
Oops.
She smiles that smile.
JAKE (V.O.)
Redheads...
Jake gets in and the car pulls away, followed seconds
later by two Police Cars SCREECHING to a stop in front of
the Euclid.
FADE TO BLACK:
THE END.
