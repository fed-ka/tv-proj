      Walt opens his front door and exits. Now we see where Walt 
      lives: no neighbors, no homes within sight, just A GORGEOUS 
      VIEW OF A COLD BLUE WYOMING SKY AND THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS ON 
      THE DISTANT HORIZON.

      He pulls on his worn leather coat with sheepskin collar. We 
      note the SHERIFF STAR pinned to the front left pocket. He 
      plunks his hat on his head, grabs his gun then jumps down 
      from his front door. A two foot jump that will one day be 
      unnecessary when Walt puts a front porch on his home.

      As Walt walks toward his  96 FORD BRONCO, we cut to:


      ELK sun themselves and pay no attention to the speeding FORD 
      BRONCO that cuts across the horizon in the b.g.

      TITLE FILLS THE FRAME: LONGMIRE


      The Bronco arrives. Walt s boot hits ground that s covered in 
      a couple inches of dry, fluffy snow.  VIC  (aka VICTORIA 
      MORETTI) gets out of her Sheriff s department Jeep. 30, 
      beautiful, with Southern Italian blood coursing through her 
      veins. A pleasant enough sight to coax an involuntary smile 
      out of anyone. Even Walt as he approaches.

                                  WALT
                    Sorry I kept you waiting, Vic.

                                  VIC
                    No, you re not.

                                  WALT
                      So...where are the Barnes boys?

      Vic points at a group of SUVs and pickups parked near a 
      trailhead. One of the pickups has a beat-up camper shell 
      attached to it. 

                                  VIC
                    I was sick of the old one hitting 
                    on me, so I sent them back to their 
                    truck.
                          (points to the hillside)
                    Body s waaaay up there. About 200 
                    yards.                                                                                      4.


      Walt squints. Vic hands him her binoculars. Walt takes them, 
      looks, and...sees...A WHITE FLUFFY LUMP on the ground.  Sheep 
      stand around nearby. RAVENS attempt to scavenge. 

                                  WALT
                    That s a sheep.

                                  VIC
                    I said we had a dead body. I never 
                    said what species.

      Walt shuts his eyes, fighting back a headache, or maybe just 
      irritation. He begins to walk toward the camper shell...

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    So...now you re here, and you ve 
                    got it under control, guess I ll go 
                    back home, enjoy my day off...?

      Walt turns and looks at her. 

                                  WALT
                    And miss all the fun?

      Off Vic, sighing. She s not getting off that easy.

                                                                          TIME CUT:

      BILLY BARNES (21 going on 45) and BOB BARNES (50 going on 70) 
      are drunk, but they re functioning alcoholics, so they re 
      able to communicate. To a degree.

                                  BOB BARNES
                    We camped out last night so we 
                    could get huntin  first thing this 
                    morning. But when we woke up, we 
                    saw all those damned ravens. We 
                    checked it out and saw that 
                    somebody shot a sheep.

                                  WALT
                    There aren t any footprints heading 
                    up there. How d you get close 
                    enough to know the sheep had been 
                    shot?

                                  BILLY
                    My scope.

      Billy proudly holds up A HUNTING RIFLE with a fancy SCOPE on 
      it. Walt takes the rifle and looks through the scope. 

      SCOPE POV: A dead sheep with ravens picking at it.                                                                                      5.


                                  BOB BARNES
                    Normally we d ignore a dead sheep, 
                    but I know how it looked...a couple 
                    of guys with a couple of drinks in 
                     em and a new night-vision rifle 
                    scope taking target practice. I 
                    swear that ain t what happened.

      Off Walt, wondering if he believes them...


      Walt and Vic crunch through the snow, up the snowy path 
      toward the dead sheep. Walt notes Vic s irritation. 

                                  WALT
                    What do you think it s like in Boca 
                    right now? Sunny. Breezy. 85 
                    degrees. Flip flop weather.

                                  VIC
                    This sucks. Look. I know I ve only 
                    been here 6 months, Walt, but I m 
                    not exactly a rookie.

                                  WALT
                    You ve made that clear. Just about 
                    every day for 6 months.

                                  VIC
                    I m just saying, I was working 
                    homicide in Philadelphia for 5 
                    years. I think I m past hazing. And 
                    a dead sheep is a waste of my 
                    talent and my time. 

                                  WALT
                    Last thing I want to do is waste 
                    your valuable time. So...
                          (re: the grazing sheep)
                    Why don t you start questioning all 
                    the witnesses.

      Walt continues up the hill, smiling to himself. 

      ANGLE ON: THE SHEEP CORPSE. Ravens scatter. Vic and Walt look 
      at it. Vic talks. Walt listens. 

                                  VIC 
                    One shot in the side. Dead center. 
                    Awfully precise...Then again, if I 
                    had a fancy military scope like 
                    drunk and drunker down there...
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      6.

                                  VIC  (CONT'D)
                          (pulls out a map)
                    Okay. So. Where the hell are we?

                                  WALT
                          (points)
                      Reservation s about a half mile 
                    north, and this is still part of 
                    the Lazy J Ranch. And these look 
                    like their sheep.

                                  VIC
                          (looks at the dead sheep)
                    What kind of messed up person 
                    shoots a sheep? I mean, they re not 
                    as cute and fluffy as they re made 
                    out to be, but still, they re nice 
                      enough...And it s not like there s 
                    any sport in it, right?...

      Walt is fixated on a nearby ridge -- staring at some ravens 
      circling in the air.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                      Walt...Hello? Whattaya doing?

                                  WALT
                      Thinking...I do that sometimes 
                    before I talk.

      He walks up toward the ridge. Vic moves to follow him. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    You know what they call a flock of 
                    ravens?

                                  VIC
                    Um, no.

                                  WALT
                    An  unkindness.  An  unkindness of 
                    ravens.  

                                  VIC
                    What the hell s wrong with  flock ?

      Walt points ahead to another collection of ravens that seem 
      to be fixated on something other than the dead sheep.

                                  WALT
                       Unkindness  is just a little more 
                    apropos.                                                                                      7.


      And as they come around a large clump of snow-covered 
      sagebrush, they see a very active unkindness: A BODY. HUMAN. 
      MALE. COVERED IN SNOW, SHEEP SHIT AND RAVENS.

      Walt shoos the ravens away, looks at the body. White snow 
      over a dead man s face. Creepy like a war photo. The dead 
      man s jacket is torn and chewed up a bit, his jeans too. And, 
      there, in his cold, dead right hand, a shotgun.

                                  VIC
                    That a 12 gauge, Mossburg? 
                          (Walt nods)
                    Hunting accident? 

                                  WALT
                    Nah. Look at his clothes. More 
                    Apres ski than avid hunter.

                                  VIC
                          (kneels)
                    Looks dry underneath. He must ve 
                    gone down before it started 
                    snowing. I ll check with the 
                    weather service. See when that was.

      Vic pushes the body over a bit to peek, sees: a TUFT OF 
      FEATHERS poking out the front of the down vest. 

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    Exit wound s obviously here. Which 
                    means he was shot in the back. 
                    Where do you think the shooter was?
                          (looks around)
                    I mean, he could ve been anywhere. 
                    High ground, low ground, behind a 
                    tree...

      Walt finally bends down, smells the barrel of the shotgun.

                                  WALT
                    Victim never shot back.

                                  VIC
                    Sometimes you are so full of shit. 
                    What are you? Cheyenne?

                                  WALT
                    If you smell oil, the gun s been 
                    cleaned. You smell gunpowder, it s 
                    been fired. I smell oil.

      Walt s gloved hand brushes snow off the man s face. He looks 
      at it, furrows his brow. Vic can see his wheels turning.                                                                                       8.


                                  VIC
                    What s wrong?

                                  WALT
                    When you been doing this as long as 
                    I have, you get to a point where 
                    you recognize about every face in 
                    Absaroka county.

                                  VIC
                    So who is it?

                                  WALT
                    That s the thing. I don t know.


      The back door of Walt s Bronco is open. Walt and Vic, out of 
      breath, struggle to slide a cumbersome black body bag in. On 
      top of it rests a plastic bag with the dead man s wallet. 

                                  VIC
                    You gonna make Branch lead on this?

      Walt picks up the plastic bag. Along with the wallet, there 
      are a couple of loose items: the victim s WYOMING DRIVER S 
      LICENSE, and a wallet-sized WEDDING PHOTO of the victim with 
      A WOMAN. Walt looks at the photo.

                                  WALT
                    Nah. As long as I came all the way 
                    out here, I may as well run this 
                    one for a bit. See where it goes. 

                                  VIC
                          (surprised)
                    Oh. Then I suppose you want me to 
                    stay here all alone to secure and 
                    process the crime scene that is 
                      completely covered in snow.

                                  WALT
                    You won t be alone. I ll send The 
                    Ferg out to give you a hand.

                                  VIC
                    It s my day off.

      Walt climbs into his Bronco and starts it up. Vic knocks on 
      the window. He rolls it down.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    I want a raise.                                                                                      9.


      He hands her his thermos. 

                                  WALT
                    How  bout some coffee. I made it 
                    fresh this morning.

      Vic takes it. Walt smiles, then drives away.


      Just enough of a main street to accommodate the small, spread 
      out population of Absaroka county. One  nice  hotel (The 
      Euskadi), one  decent  restaurant (the Busy Bee), a fire 
      station, a hardware store, a couple of souvenir and antique 
      stores for the tourists. Pickups, SUVs and Subarus zip back 
      and forth, stopped only by the occasional pedestrian or the 
      town s single stoplight.

      Walt s Bronco waits at this stoplight, then pulls up to an 
      empty diagonal space in front of The Rotary Club building.  

      A BANNER out front:  DURANT ROTARY CLUB PANCAKE DAY. 

      Walt shuts the engine off. Takes a deep breath. He doesn t 
      seem to want to get out of the Bronco. He glances up in the 
      rearview mirror. Tilts it a little. He can now see the body 
      bag in the back.

                                  WALT
                    Mr. Parkford, how about you go in 
                    there. And I just lie down here. 
                    You can do my job.
                          (waits, then)
                    No? You re a lucky man.

      Walt gets out and heads toward the front door of the club. 
      Just outside, leaning against a wall, a HANDSOME CHEYENNE MAN 
      (40s) eats from a plate of pancakes. 

                                  HANDSOME CHEYENNE
                    You better get in there, Sheriff. 
                    The natives are getting restless.

      The Handsome Cheyenne man nods and takes a bite of bacon.

                                  WALT
                    Why are you sitting out here?

                                  HANDSOME CHEYENNE
                    I like the pancakes. The company 
                    gives me a headache.

      Walt nods. He gets it. Then he opens the door to...                                                                                    10.



      Walt walks. Branch follows with a FOAM CONTAINER OF FOOD. 

                                  BRANCH
                    I thought the Barnes  were just 
                    pulling another drunken prank. If I 
                    knew it was a real hunting accident, 
                    I woulda gone out there.

                                  WALT
                    Well you can t serve the community 
                    if you don t talk to em. Besides. I 
                    said it looks like a hunting 
                    accident.

                                  BRANCH
                    You mean it might not be?

                    ...you could ve called me directly 
                    and told me what was up.

                                  WALT
                    I don t need a cellphone Branch. I 
                    need you to be part of the team. 
                    You can t just dip in and out of 
                    the job when it suits you.

                                  BRANCH
                    Okay then, let me help the team. 
                    Who got shot?

                                  WALT
                      A sheep...And some guy named 
                      Parkford...

      They reach the doors of an OLD BRICK BUILDING, THE ABSAROKA 
      COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION. Branch holds the door. A beat.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic s lead deputy on this now.

                                  BRANCH
                          (hiding his anger)
                    I got ya. Maybe I should go out 
                    there and apologize to her.

                                  WALT 
                          (takes the container)
                    Nah. One dead body is enough.


      Walt gets out of his vehicle. He stares at the small, modest 
      1980 s house. Steeling himself. Then...

                                  WALT
                    I am a clamorous harbinger of blood 
                    and death.

      On Walt, we pre-lap SFX: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.


      The Bronco tipped on its right side (the passenger side).  


      WIDE ON the Bronco. The driver s door opens up into the air, 
      like a submarine hatch. Then, wincing in pain, Walt hoists 
      himself up and out of the truck. He sits on the edge of the 
      truck, catches his breath and surveys the scene.


      STRESSED MOAN of a wench as a TOW TRUCK S hook & cable pulls 
      Walt s Bronco back on its four wheels with a loud CA-CLUNK...

      The Bronco has large scrapes and dents along one side. We pan 
      over and find the tow truck driver, DENVER (30), with Walt.

                                  DENVER
                    Glad you re okay, Sheriff...we d 
                    sure hate to lose you.

      Denver looks inside the Bronco: A BIT OF ASSORTED TRASH and 
      BEER CANS. Denver pretends not to notice the beer cans.

                                  DENVER (CONT D)
                    Your wrist okay? Um, I could drive 
                    you back to get some X-rays?                                                                                    20.


                                  WALT
                    I m fine, Denver. I ll drive myself 
                    home. 
                          (then, pats his truck)
                    Bullet s tough. But before you take 
                    off, can I borrow your cellphone. 

      Walt extends his injured right hand: gimme, please. Denver 
      does...Walt dials slow, and puts the phone to his ear...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      A CELL PHONE RINGS...We move fast from a chugging portable 
      generator -- long extension cords shoot out of it over the 
      snowy ground, we follow one orange cord to...Vic -- WHO IS 
      MELTING SNOW WITH A HAIRDRYER. She turns it off and...

                                  WALT
                    How s it going?

                                  VIC
                    Walt. What, you finally broke down 
                    and bought a cellphone?

                                  WALT
                    Borrowed one. My radio s on the 
                    fritz. Ruby said you called...

                                  VIC
                    I found a slug. Never seen one like 
                    it. It was about twenty yards from 
                    the body. Thirty from the sheep. 
                    Got The Ferg looking for the 
                    casing.

      We see The Ferg, way off in the distance, searching a snow 
      bank.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    I heard you did the notification.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah. Parkford s wife had no idea 
                    Grant was even in Durant. Thought 
                    he was in Laramie for the weekend. 

                                  VIC
                    Oooh. So then it s all about sex.                                                                                    21.


                                  WALT
                    Settle down, Vic. 

                                  VIC
                    When the husband lies about where 
                    he s going for the weekend, it s 
                    always about sex.

                                  WALT
                    Maybe. So...uh...Vic, did you know 
                    Branch was running for Sheriff? 

                                  VIC
                    What? Branch. Branch Connally. 
                    You re shitting me. I had no idea.

                                  WALT
                    Saw a sign out by the county line.

                                  VIC
                    That sneaky son of a bitch. What 
                    are you going to do?

                                  WALT
                    It s a free country...Anyway, I ll 
                    stop by and pick up that slug in 
                    the morning. See if Omar can help 
                    us identify the murder weapon...Now 
                    don t work too late.

      Walt hangs up. Thinks. Then, as dusk fades into night...

      SFX OF GUNFIRE: BANG!POP!POP!BANG!POP!BANG!POP!BANG!BOOM!


      Angle on: an OSAMA BIN LADEN TARGET as a bullet rips a hole 
      through his face. BANG!

      ANGLE ON: A STALL ON THE RANGE: A MAN stands reloading his 
      rifle, complete with scope. Fully decked out in expensive 
      OUTDOOR GEAR, this is OMAR (40s). He loves himself, his guns 
      and his country. In that order. 

      Omar looks through his YELLOW TINTED SHOOTING SHADES as Walt 
      approaches, walking stiffly, still hurting from his accident. 
      Walt returns waves from a few of the other members who fire 
      rifles and handguns at all kinds of targets.

                                  WALT
                          (re: Osama target)
                    You get the bastard, Omar?                                                                                    22.


                                  OMAR
                    Every single day.

      Walt notes all the various rifle cases, scopes, ammo clips, 
      all open on a flat bed trailer that s hooked up to the back 
      of an ATV. 

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                          (ribbing him)
                    Thought I d get started since I was 
                    on Walt time. What happened to your 
                    hand?

                                  WALT 
                    Hurt it like an idiot. So?

                                  OMAR
                    Your message said you found a big 
                    slug. I pulled out all the most 
                    popular large-caliber rifles...This 
                    about that thing in the paper? 
                    Hunting accident out at Pronghorn 
                    Ridge?

                                  WALT
                    No comment.

                                  OMAR
                    Ah. The Longmire yes. And if you re 
                    here instead of a deputy, you think 
                    it s a murder. 

      Then Walt hands Omar A VERY OLD SLUG. Omar s eyes light up, 
      like he s been handed a precious gemstone.

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                    When you said slug, you meant SLUG. 
                    That s a lot of lead. 45 to 70 
                    caliber at least. None of these 
                    rifles I ve been testing are made 
                    for that. 

                                  WALT
                    Any modern rifles you know of that 
                    would shoot this caliber?

                                  OMAR
                    No. Gotta be something old. In this 
                    part of the country, odds are that 
                    it s a Sharps. They called em horse 
                    killers. Take down a horse at 500 
                    yards. Swear to God. Make a cavalry 
                    man infantry with one pull of the 
                    trigger.

      Walt hands Omar a photo of the sheep s wound.

                                  WALT
                    Sharps could have done this?

                                  OMAR
                    You bet. Specially since it looks 
                    like you could drive a stagecoach 
                    through that hole. That gun has its 
                      drawbacks...heavy, makes a hell of 
                    a lot of smoke, and with a drop 
                    block, it takes about five seconds 
                    to reload, but it s so accurate and 
                    powerful you shouldn t need to 
                    reload.

                                  WALT
                      Appreciate the help, Omar.

      Walt starts to leave.

                                  OMAR
                    Hey Walt. The Sharps is a sniper s 
                    weapon. There s two types of people 
                    who like to kill from a distance: 
                    cowards and pros. In my experience, 
                    they re both dangerous.

                                  WALT
                    I ll be alright.

      Walt starts walking away.

                                  OMAR
                    And if you have any more questions, 
                    next time send that feisty little 
                    Italian deputy of yours.

      Walt turns back. Looks at Omar, who s smiling suggestively.

                                  WALT
                    Be careful what you wish for.


      Vic. Still melting snow with a hair dryer. We see that she 
      has melted a swath about five yards wide and a hundred yards 
      long. We look down the melted strip and see The Ferg, out in 
      the snow, yelling. Vic doesn t hear at first, so he yells 
      louder. She turns off her hair dryer.                                                                                    24.


                                  VIC
                    You find a casing Ferg?

                                  THE FERG
                    No. Pants!

      Vic approaches. The Ferg picks up a PAIR OF PANTS like a dead 
      animal; the BELT BUCKLE hangs down heavy, like the head of a 
      snake. Off Vic, perplexed.


      Walt is climbing into his beat-up Bullet when he sees 
      something. Leaving the door open, he gets out and walks 
      toward a fast food wrapper blowing in the wind. Walt reaches 
      for it, misses, then catches it with a stomp of his foot. He 
      puts it in the trash as Vic pulls up in her SUV. She climbs 
      out in a hurry, eager to tell Walt...

                                  VIC 
                    When we expanded the grid to look 
                    for the casing, I found something 
                    else. Pants. 

                                  WALT

                                  VIC
                    I want to be there when you do.
                          (Then, notices the damage)
                    What the hell happened to your 
                    truck? And your hand...You hurt 
                    your hand.

                                  WALT
                    You re right. You should consider a 
                    career in law enforcement.


      As Walt and Vic walk quietly toward the front door, it BURSTS 
      OPEN. Out comes a CHEYENNE OFFICER, MATHIAS, in uniform. 
      Another Cheyenne officer right behind. Neither are happy.

                                    MATHIAS
                          (pointing at Walt)
                    What did I tell you?!

      Walt tries to answer. But before he can, Mathias hauls off 
      and throws a PUNCH at Walt who chooses not to block it. BAM. 
      THE PUNCH LANDS. Walt takes the impact. Unfazed. Vic, not so 
      much. She shoves Mathias away.

                                  VIC
                    What the hell?!!

      A mini-scuffle between Vic and both Tribal Police Officers 
      ensues. Walt breaks it up. Pushes the Officers away with his 
      hurt hand. Pulls Vic back with the other.                                                                                     29.


                                  WALT
                    Okay, Vic, that s enough...he did 
                    say he d knock me out the next time 
                    he saw me. Though you didn t really 
                    keep your word did you, Mathias?

                                    MATHIAS
                    What do you want?

      Walt pulls out his list of names from Dave Estes.

                                  WALT 
                    I d like to talk to some people of 
                    interest who live on the Rez. 

                                    MATHIAS
                    You don t get it. You have no 
                    authority here. Those are the 
                    treaty rules. And I know how 
                    important treaties are to you 
                    whites, Sheriff Walter Longmire.

                                  WALT
                    I know that. But there s been a 
                      shooting... 

                                    MATHIAS
                    The victim Cheyenne?
                          (Walt shakes his head no)
                    Well, hunting accidents happen all 
                    the time on the high plains. 

                                  WALT
                    I know you re pissed at me, but 
                    this is serious. There s been a 
                    murder. I know the kind of rifle 
                    used. It s rare, but at least three 
                    folks on the Rez have one. So just 
                    this once if we could smoke the 
                    peace pipe, and you let me and Vic 
                    on the Rez...

                                    MATHIAS
                    Give me the list and we will look 
                    into it for you. Kinda like a joint 
                    task force. But I gotta tell you, 
                    we are short-handed around here. 
                    See...we lost our Police Chief.

      Walt stares at him. No one s gonna budge. Dead end.


      Henry Standing Bear s shitty pickup truck rumbles past the 
      tribal police station. Henry is alone in the cab. Officer 
      Mathias is out in front. He watches the truck pass. 


      A small, run down house, blankets hung in the window as 
      curtains.

      Henry s truck pulls in, and it is immediately ATTACKED by TWO 
      SCRAWNY DOGS. One of them leaps into the truck bed and clamps 
      its teeth on a blanket.                                                                                    34.


      At which point we hear a very human HOWL. Walt s hiding place 
      has been discovered. He leaps to his feet, holding onto his 
      already injured right hand in pain.

      Henry joins him and the two of them try frantically to keep 
      the mean, snarling dogs at bay...

      LYNN STILLWATER, a tired 40ish Cheyenne, emerges from the 
      house. She gives a sharp WHISTLE, and the dogs abandon Walt.

                                  LYNN
                    Henry, I thought you were coming 
                    alone.

                                  HENRY
                    He wants to help.

                                  LYNN
                    Does he?


      Walt rides shotgun. Henry drives.

                                  HENRY
                    You should have told her Grant 
                    Parkford was dead.

                                  WALT
                    Lynn s not legally related to him, 
                    so I m not obligated to tell her. 
                    Besides, she might be involved. Or 
                    her boyfriend. Charles Burnett.

                                  HENRY
                    What you did is dishonest.                                                                                    38.


                                  WALT
                    Sometimes to do my job you can t be 
                    as forthcoming as you d like to be. 
                    You have to see how people react. 
                    Be patient. And if that helps me 
                    figure out who killed Parkford and 
                    where Lilly is, so much the better. 
                          (beat)
                    We pretty much swept the hookers out 
                    of Absaroka last year. You heard 
                    anything new about prostitution in 
                    the county or on the Rez?

                                  HENRY
                    Not my thing. Never had to pay for it.

                                  WALT
                          (nods, then a long beat)
                    Have I lost a step?

                                  HENRY
                    What?

                                  WALT
                    I just had to ask you about the 
                    state of the sex trade in my own 
                    county.

                                  HENRY
                    You are an optimist. You do not 
                    like to think about the depravity 
                    of human kind. And also, yes. You 
                    have lost a step.

                                  WALT
                      I wouldn t say I m an optimist. Up 
                    until an hour ago, I thought Grant 
                    Parkford was some guy having an 
                    affair. Never occurred to me he was 
                    doing something...heroic.

                                  HENRY
                    Heroic?

                                  WALT
                    Trying to save his daughter from 
                      prostitution? Seems honorable.

                                  HENRY
                    You think 16 years of abandonment 
                    by her father might have something 
                    to do with her getting into 
                      prostitution in the first place?                                                                                    39.


      Henry s truck pulls into The Red Pony parking lot.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah, the guy screwed up, but isn t 
                    it better that he tried to make up 
                    for it?

                                  HENRY
                    Maybe. But just because a man 
                    decides to make up for all his 
                    mistakes in one day doesn t mean 
                    the rest of the world is going to 
                    be so quick to forgive him.

      Walt nods. Gets out of the truck. A waning moon shines down 
      as Walt walks across the parking lot towards his Bronco.


      Walt sleeps on a cot. Ruby approaches, then clangs a metal 
      water bottle along the bars.

                                  RUBY
                    Wake up. You have a visitor.


      Walt arrives to find that Vic has blocked a beat up truck 
      with her vehicle and won t let it out of its parking space. 

      The driver is the LARGE, TATTOOED, and currently very angry 
      CHARLES BURNETT (40). Burnett is out of the vehicle face to 
      face, with Vic. Or rather face to chest. Burnett is a good 
      head taller than Vic. 

                                    CHARLES
                    Move your damn car! I gotta get to 
                    work!

                                  VIC
                    For the umpteenth time, I m not 
                    movin  until you tell me where you 
                    were two nights ago.

                                  WALT
                    Deputy Moretti, what s going on?

                                  VIC
                    This idiot is Charles Burnett. One 
                    of the guys on Dave Estes s list of 
                    Sharps rifle owners...and he won t 
                    answer my questions--

                                    CHARLES
                    --Move your damn car!

                                  WALT
                    Okay okay, let s all calm down...

      But Charles Burnett is past that. He climbs into his truck.                                                                                    43.


                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Mr. Burnett sir, we just want to...

                                  VIC
                    Dude!

      Charles throws his truck in reverse and RAMS it backward into 
      Vic s vehicle. Walt closes his eyes. He opens them and sees--


      GARRETT DRIGGS (50), a well-heeled cattleman with a well-fed 
      gut stands beside Walt and Vic a few steps in front of ten 
      men lined up along a fence: A FEW MEXICAN-AMERICAN HANDS, 
      some MOUSTACHED OLD SCHOOL COWBOYS and Garrett s son, CALEB.

                                    GARRETT
                    I told the Sheriff you all would 
                      cooperate. So I expect you will. 

                                  WALT
                    We found something out at the 
                    Pronghorn Ridge trailhead. 

      Vic steps in. She holds up the jeans. 

                                  VIC
                    And we want to return them to their 
                    owner. Anyone recognize these?
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    46.

                                  VIC (CONT'D)
                          (silence)
                    Okay then. Everybody...take off 
                    your pants. 

      The men all grumble and ad lib protests.

                                  WALT 
                      I wouldn t ask you fellas to do 
                    this, but it involves a possible 
                    murder. So. Drop em.

      The guys start to take off their pants, then they try on the 
      Wranglers in a series of quick cuts: Too big. Way too small. 
      Too short. One FAT GUY starts to unbutton. Vic stops him. 

                                  VIC
                    No need. You have an honest face. 

      Finally she gets to Caleb. Cockily, and all the while smiling 
      at Vic, he puts them on. They fit perfectly.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    Hello Cinderella.

                                  CALEB
                    They re Wranglers, could belong to 
                    anybody in the state.

                                  WALT
                    Not wearing this belt.

      Walt holds up the belt buckle so the kid s dad can see it.

                                    GARRETT
                    Caleb, that s the buckle I gave you 
                    for your 21st birthday. What the 
                    hell is going on?!

      Off Caleb. Busted...


      Walt carries a LARGE BROWN BAG under his arm as he walks 
      along a row of RVs. He stops at one and knocks on the door. 
      It opens to reveal... Bob Barnes. Bob looks like shit. 

                                  WALT
                    Hey, Bob, a couple questions I 
                    forgot to ask you the other day. I 
                    don t like to forget anything. Can 
                    I come in? Billy around?

                                  BOB
                    He s at work...Walt, I don t know 
                    if this is really a good time--

      Walt reveals the SIX PACK OF RAINIER in the bag. Bob smiles.                                                                                    55.



      One tiny ribbon of highway. On the shoulder, the flashing 
      blue light of a Sheriff s vehicle. We go in closer and find..

      Walt inside, his eyes on a pair of approaching headlights 
      heading his way...They get there, and it s--

                                  HENRY
                    Wow. A road block. This seems like 
                    overkill. You could have just 
                    called to apologize.

                                  WALT
                    Hello Henry.                                                                                    57.


                                  HENRY
                    I have a name for you, plus three 
                    other matters.

                                  WALT
                    Is the name Avo?

                                  HENRY
                    The other Indian at the Red Pony.

                                  WALT
                          (nods)
                    Avo s the owner of the RV that 
                    these girls have been working out 
                    of. What re the three other things?

                                  HENRY
                    First, while I could not find Avo 
                    myself, we spoke through a cousin. 
                    Avo will meet you tomorrow morning. 
                    11 am. There is an old empty cabin 
                    about three miles off the highway 
                    near the south entrance of the Rez. 
                          (Walt nods)
                    Second: I do not think you should 
                    go. It sounds like a set-up. And 
                    there s already one dead white guy--

                                  WALT
                    --What s number three?

                                  HENRY
                    Since you will no doubt ignore me 
                    and go meet Avo anyway, I would 
                    like to propose an O.I.T.

                                  WALT
                    O.I.T.?

                                  HENRY
                    Old Indian Trick.

      Off Walt getting Henry s plan--


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    58.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Empty. Looks like no one s been here since 1874. A jeep pulls 
      up. The door opens. A boot hits the ground. Round toe, but we 
      WIDEN to reveal it s not Walt, but a young Cheyenne male. The 
      BUSBOY FROM THE RED PONY: AVO.

      Avo quickly moves toward the shed. Checks over his shoulder--


      ...and Walt dashes from the shed, counting as he runs. 

                                  WALT
                          (to himself)
                    1 2 3 4 5 -- 

      Walt hits the dirt feeling the sharp pain of all his 
        injuries...BANG! A shot flies overhead. Walt leaps back to 
      his feet and runs.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    1 2 3 4 5 --

      At the last second he hits the dirt and rolls. Disappearing 
      into a thick wooded patch. Several moments of stillness and 
      silence are then interrupted by...AN ENGINE ROAR. Walt s 
      Bronco LAUNCHES out of the woods, and up the hill straight 
      for the shooter. 

      BANG! The shooter fires -- puts a hole in the windshield. 

      Walt s POV as he rips up the hill in his beat up Bronco with 
      his beat up hand. In the distance the shooter runs, 
      disappears over the ridge. Walt punches it...

      ANGLE ON the shooter s boots. Almost to his own ESCALADE.

      BACK ON Walt. The Bronco slams to a stop at the high ground 
      where the shooter once stood...Walt sees the shooter 50 yards 
      down the hill, getting into the truck. He s getting away.                                                                                     61.


      Faster than we ve ever seen him move, Walt gets out of his 
      Bronco, leaves the door wide open and the door window down. 
      Hurt hand and all, Walt grabs his rifle off the rack. Sticks 
      the open-sight Winchester .30-.30 through the window and 
      rests the body of the gun on the sill to take the pressure 
      off his injured right wrist. Walt aims at the moving 
      Escalade...And fires. Left handed.

      Bang! The bullet finds the target. Blood sprays on the window 
      in the shooter s Escalade. It rolls eerily to a stop.


      Walt approaches the shooter s truck on foot. He looks in at a 
      man s body, slumped against the center armrest. The shooter 
      still tries to get his barrel pointed at Walt, but can t. He 
      fires in vain. Bang! Walt doesn t blink, just moves in closer 
      and closer, gun drawn, looks inside and this time he 
      recognizes the face--Dave Estes.

      Dave is in pain, the bullet went through his shoulder into 
      his ribs. Short of breath. Panic in his voice.

                                  DAVE
                    You weren t supposed to be here.

                                  WALT
                    Doing my job, Dave.

                                  DAVE
                          (coughs up some blood)
                    Walt, you gotta help me, Walt? 
                    Please help me? Call an ambulance. 

                                  WALT
                    After you tell me about Grant 
                    Parkford.

                                  DAVE
                    Who?

                                  WALT
                    I m a patient man.

                                  DAVE
                    ...I was just trying to make a 
                      living...And he was bad for 
                    business. I warned him. I did. I 
                    swear. Now call an ambulance!

                                  WALT
                    And Lilly, Grant s daughter. Tell 
                    me where Lilly is. If not, I bury 
                    you here.                                                                                    62.


                                  DAVE
                    Okay, okay...Montana...Talmer 
                    Ridge, off Route 43 --

      Walt turns, starts to walk away...

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?! Walt, you 
                    have to call an ambulance!

                                  WALT
                          (stops, turns to Dave)
                    I don t have a cellphone.

      And we watch Walt walk back toward Bullet, Dave SCREAMS for 
      help and mercy, we flash forward to...


      MONTANA HIGHWAY PATROL VEHICLES pull up to the RV. Vic and a 
      bunch of MONTANA TROOPERS pile out, guns drawn. The Big Guy 
      Helper from Dave Estes  shop is behind the wheel of the RV, 
      hands on his head.

      CUT BACK TO WALT, WALKING UP TO HIS BRONCO. THEN FORWARD TO:


      A deputy vehicle drives up to the entrance. Henry waits, 
      along with Mathias and Lynn Stillwater. Vic gets out of the 
      passenger side.  

      CUT BACK TO WALT, PICKING UP HIS RADIO. 

                                  WALT
                          (looking back to Dave)
                    Ruby? This is Unit One. I m gonna 
                    need an ambulance.

      Off Walt, staring back at Estes  truck...we FLASH FORWARD to:


      Walt gets out of the driver side, opens the back passenger 
      door, and helps Lilly out. Slowly, he leads her over to the 
      waiting group: Henry, Lynn, Mathias.                                                                                    63.


      Lilly looks at her Mom, in shame, and in shock. Lynn hugs her 
      daughter. It is an awkward reunion. Walt nods to Lynn and 
      then to Mathias. Mathias looks back. After a beat, he nods in 
      return. Not peace, to be sure, but a moment of detente. PRE-
      LAP SFX: THUMP! THUMP!


      Cut to: A HAMMER HITTING THE TOP OF A WOODEN STAKE. THUMP! 
      THUMP! Walt HAMMERS the wooden stake into the ground just off 
      the shoulder of the road. Walt s Bronco right behind him.

      An 18-WHEELER roars by Walt without slowing down. Walt 
      doesn t flinch. Just HAMMERS away. We now see that the stake 
      is connected to a horizontal stake, like a cross...Walt looks 
      at it for a moment. Then bends down, picks something up with 
      one hand, and pulls out a gun: A STAPLE GUN.

        CHINK-CHINK-CHINK. Walt staples A SIGN to the cross. It is a 
      dated typeface and a bit faded in color. But you can still 
      read the sign: HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. LONGMIRE FOR SHERIFF.

      Walt Looks across the road at the wind shaking Branch 
      Connally s sign. Off Walt s satisfied look--
