      We re ten stories above the street, perched on the edge of an 
      old office building.  A stone GARGOYLE gazes blindly at a 
      majestic mountain range of Gothic stone spires and sleek 
      glass towers under a darkening blue sky, bathed in the golden 
      light of the setting sun.  SELINA KYLE (14) - an elfin girl 
      dressed in street Goth style, the future CATWOMAN - appears 
      alongside the gargoyle and scans the streets below, a hunter 
      searching for prey. Without any hesitation, she launches 
      herself from the edge of the roof onto a fire escape one 
      floor below and - using drainpipes, window ledges, and light 
      fixtures - descends to street level with amazing nerve and 
      agility.   


      Imagine New York City s Times Square in the 1970s and then 
      turn the dial to eleven - squalid but sexy, dangerous but 
      glamorous. 

      Colorful GOTHAMITES and gawking TOURISTS watch TWO GANG 
      MEMBERS brawling violently in the middle of the road.      
      One gangster wears crude HOME MADE BODY ARMOR and wields a 
      machete, the other wears a garish ZOOT SUIT and is armed with 
      a hammer. 

      Nobody notices Selina slide from a store awning onto the 
      sidewalk. An out of town CONVENTIONEER (male, 30 s) is 
      watching the brawl. Selina brushes past him, and a split 
      second later he clutches at his pockets and spins round...  

                                    CONVENTIONEER
                    Hey! 

      Selina runs, wallet in hand, pursued by the Conventioneer.


      Selina leads the Conventioneer on a pell mell tour of the 
      glamorous, brutal, and intensely vivid city. Plunging canyons 
      and soaring spires; neon signs and HD screens selling sex 
      violence and money on streets teeming with raucous humanity. 
      It s colorful and loud, grotesque and beautiful. 

      (NB - Amid the visual clamor we see a giant billboard 
      announcing the Wayne Foundation s redevelopment of the Arkham 
      district, and the boards of a newspaper stand screaming 
       CRIME WAVE OF THE CENTURY! )          

      Selina grabs an apple and a carton of milk from a storefront, 
      and darts down an alley.  The Conventioneer runs right past.                                                                                        2.


      MOMENTS LATER.  Relaxing, Selina crouches behind a dumpster 
      halfway down the alley. She pours some of the milk into a 
      makeshift saucer, to share with the BIG CALICO ALLEY-CAT that 
      soon joins her. They exchange meowling greetings. Selina 
      munches on the apple, and examines the wallet she stole.  
      Pocketing the cash and credit cards, she slots the wallet 
      through the grating of an old air vent in the wall.  

      Hearing voices and laughter, Selina and the Cat climb swiftly 
      up from the street into hiding in the shadows of a first-
      story fire escape. 

      THOMAS, MARTHA, and BRUCE WAYNE walk down the alley. 

      The family is well-dressed in an old fashioned way. They re 
      laughing at something Thomas has just said.

                                  MARTHA
                    Oh come on, Tom, it wasn t that bad.

                                  THOMAS
                    Childish drivel.  Movies these 
                    days, I don t know.  

                                  MARTHA
                    Well I thought the acting was fine, 
                    and the music was lovely.  How 
                    about you, Bruce?  

                                  BRUCE
                    Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.  
                    It was kinda lame.

      Thomas smiles and ruffles his son s hair.

                                  THOMAS
                    There s no such word as kinda. 

                                  MARTHA
                          (lightly)
                    You two, so judgmental.  Just once 
                    I d like --

      She stops because a BIG TALL MASKED MAN with A GUN appears in 
      front of them.

                                  MASKED MAN
                    What s up, folks.  Gimme your money. 

      Thomas and Martha remain very calm.  Bruce is terrified.

                                  THOMAS
                    No problem.  

      Thomas hands the Masked Man his wallet.                                                                                        3.

                                  MASKED MAN
                    The necklace.

                                  MARTHA
                    Oh but --

                                  THOMAS
                    -- Give it to him, Martha.

      Martha unclasps the necklace and gives it to the Masked Man.  

      Then, without warning, the Masked Man SHOOTS Thomas and Martha 
      in the chest, one after the other.  They fall down. 

      The Masked Man looks at Bruce long and hard.  Bruce meets his 
      gaze.  The Masked Man puts the gun to the boy s forehead, and 
      considers shooting him, but then lowers the gun and walks 
      calmly away. 

      Frozen in horror, Bruce watches his mother and father trying 
      to speak, gasping for their last breaths in a spreading pool 
      of blood.  

                                  BRUCE
                    Mom?  Dad?

      ANGLE - ON A FIFTH STOREY FIRE ESCAPE, Selina Kyle, her 
      expression inscrutable, watches Bruce Wayne fall to his knees 
      and let out an UNEARTHLY WAIL...


      CU ON JAMES GORDON (26, tough but open and sincere; an old 
      school air of decency and honor and quiet authority).       
      He s walking down the middle of the street, hands raised in 
      placation. He wears a nice simple suit and tie, and holds up 
      a SILVER DETECTIVE S BADGE.  

      He approaches a HUGE ANGRY BIKER, holding a butcher s knife 
      to the throat of a terrified YOUNG WOMAN. A lover s quarrel 
      gone very wrong.  

                                  GORDON
                    Sir, I m Detective James Gordon, 
                    Gotham PD. Can we talk?  

      The Biker looks at Gordon wild-eyed, high. Gordon keeps 
      moving slowly but steadily toward the Man and his hostage. 

      ANGLE -- half a block away, HARVEY BULLOCK (40s, big, stylish 
      but slovenly, an old school hard ass and a loose living party 
      animal) runs huffing and puffing to the scene, gun drawn. 

      Gordon is close now.

                                  ANGRY BIKER
                    I ll kill her, I swear!                                                                                       4.

                                  GORDON
                    I can see you re very angry and I 
                    respect that.  But please listen to 
                    me.  Violence is not the answer -- 

      The Biker points the knife at Gordon, who grabs and twists it 
      from the Biker s grip, and elbows him in the face. They 
      exchange a flurry of vicious blows before Gordon puts the 
      Biker down on his hands and knees.  As Gordon takes out his 
      cuffs, Bullock comes running up and kicks the Biker as he 
      starts trying to get up, knocking him down again. Gordon 
      cuffs the prone man while Bullock puts his hands on his 
      knees, catching his breath.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Are you okay, ma am?

      The woman nods, speechless.


      A GCPD HOMICIDE SQUAD CAR pulls to the curb, Gordon and 
      Bullock inside.  GORDON S POV - The alley is taped off, and 
      bathed in the eerie glow of temporary lights set up by the 
      first responders. FOUR GCPD OFFICERS hold back a small crowd 
      of ONLOOKERS.  The two detectives get out of the car and head 
      down the alley, ducking under the tape.  

      Bullock nods to SERGEANT TANNENBAUM, (40 s, male, shlumpy) 
      standing guard over the bodies of the Waynes.  Sheets have 
      been placed over them.  The cop s tone is casual but 
      professional.  Gordon is galvanised and alert. Familiar with 
      war, murder scenes are not shocking but horribly fascinating.    

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    The legendary Harvey Bullock. No 
                    rest for the wicked eh? 

                                    BULLOCK
                      Tannenbaum, looking crisp. 
                    This is my new partner, James  
                    Gordon. What we got?

      Tannenbaum and Gordon exchange nods.

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    Just got here myself. Male and a 
                    female, gunshot wounds. Their kid 
                    saw the whole thing. Poor little 
                    bastard hasn t spoke a word yet.

      The Sergeant points out Bruce Wayne, sitting on a doorstep, 
      wrapped in a police department blanket, his face a mask of 
      tragedy.  A POLICEWOMAN stands near, feeling helpless.  
      Bruce and Gordon s eyes meet for a second and Gordon feels 
      his fathomless pain. As if drawn by a magnet, he goes to the 
      boy, sits down alongside. They sit in silence.

      Bullock goes to the bodies, lifts the sheet to look at the 
      faces.  He immediately recognizes the Waynes, and curses 
      under his breath.  He puts the sheet back over the bodies, 
      and takes Tannenbaum aside for a quiet word. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Listen T, you didn t see me, okay? 

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    I see you right in front of me.  
                    What s your problem?  Who are they?                                                                                       6.

                                    BULLOCK
                    That s Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                                  TANNENBAUM 
                          (alarmed)
                    Oh hell. For real?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah. I don t need that kind of 
                    hassle. Call Major Crimes.  They d 
                    love to have this.

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    But they re not here. You are here, 
                    and your partner s talking to the 
                    witness.  That makes it your case. 

      Bullock sighs, knowing Tannenbaum is right, and won t budge. 

      ON GORDON AND BRUCE. Still silent. Finally...

                                  GORDON
                    My name s James Gordon. I m a 
                      detective.  What s your name?
                          (no reply)
                    It s okay. You don t have to talk. 

      After a beat...

                                  BRUCE
                    Bruce. My name s Bruce Wayne.

                                  GORDON
                    Bruce. That s a good strong name. 
                    Can you tell me what happened? 

      Bruce can t speak. When he tries, he starts to cry instead.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    When I was a little younger than 
                    you a drunk driver ran into our 
                    car. Killed my dad. I was right 
                    next to him. 
                          (he has Bruce s attention)
                    I wasn t hurt badly, but it took a 
                    while to get me out of the wreck. 
                      A policeman held my hand. He knew 
                    how frightened I was and he told 
                    me, he promised me, however dark 
                    and scary the world might be at 
                    this moment, there will be light. 
                    And he was right. There will be 
                    light, Bruce. There will.  

      Bruce looks in Gordon s eyes, and sees strength and empathy.                                                                                      7.

                                  BRUCE
                    We, we just got out of the movies. 
                    We were walking through the alley 
                    to catch an uptown cab, and a man 
                    came out of the shadows.  He was 
                    tall and big, with a black mask and 
                    a hat and gloves and he had a gun. 
                      A revolver.  His shoes were shiny. 
                    He said give me your money and he 
                    took my dad s wallet and my mom s 
                    necklace, and then he shot them. 
                    For no reason.  And then he pointed 
                    the gun at me, but he didn t shoot. 
                    He walked away.
                          (beat)
                    I could have grabbed the gun.  But 
                    I didn t. I didn t do anything.    

                                  GORDON
                    You did the right thing. You re 
                    alive.  

                                  BRUCE
                    No.  I should have done something. 
                    I was too scared.

                                  GORDON
                    There was nothing you could do to 
                    stop what happened.  But there is 
                    something you can do now.  Now you 
                    can be strong.  Grief can make you 
                    strong.  Be strong and one day 
                    maybe you can stop this from 
                    happening to somebody else.  

      Bruce nods.  Gordon has no idea how deep his words sink in.    

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I promise you, Bruce, I ll do 
                    whatever it takes to find the man 
                    who did this. 

      A TITLE CARD SLAMS INTO FRAME -

                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                      8.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A late night crowd of glam Party-goers and Street People 
      watch Gordon and ALFRED PENNYWORTH, (40 s, cockney, ex-
      Marine. Very dry, very snide) escorts Bruce Wayne to a BIG 
      BLACK LIMO, idling at the curb.  Pennyworth helps the kid 
      into the backseat and closes the door.  

                                  GORDON
                    We ll be in touch soon.  We re 
                    going to catch this guy Mr. 
                      Pennyworth.

                                  ALFRED
                    Call me Alfred.  New boy are you?  

                                  GORDON
                    You could say.

      Alfred studies him sceptically.

                                  ALFRED
                    Good luck mate.

      Alfred gets behind the wheel of the Limo. Bruce and Gordon 
      exchange a last look through the window as the car pulls 
      away.  Bullock walks past Gordon with grumpy body language...

                                  BULLOCK
                    Forensics have got the scene. Let s 
                    go get coffee.

    He heads for a DINER down the block. Gordon follows 
      reluctantly.


      Gordon driving, Bullock alongside, still seething.          

                                  GORDON
                    Why all the friction with the Major 
                    Crimes Unit?  We re on the same 
                    side.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Exactly. We re rivals. 
                    And they re a buncha self righteous 
                    do gooding skell huggers. 
                      Badmouthing us all the time, we 
                    bend the law, we re cowboys, blah 
                    blah blah. 

                                  GORDON
                    Why do they say that?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Because they want a piece of our 
                    pie, of course. Like they re such 
                    freaking angels? Please.
                          (yells at another driver)
                    What are you blind!? Move!                                                                                     12.

      Off Gordon, not quite satisfied with that reply.


      A RAPID MONTAGE: Forty-eight hours pass as Gordon and Bullock 
      work the streets, alleys, and tenements of Gotham in all it s 
      seedy glory.  Walking, running, driving, knocking on doors, 
      questioning A GALLERY OF GOTHAM LOW-LIFE.  Everyone shakes 
      their head. Nope. Nope. Nope.     

      END MONTAGE:


      It s raining a little.  The club is a sumptuous high-end 
      joint.  Gordon and Bullock walk up to the front entrance.  

                                  GORDON
                    Why didn t we go to her first?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Eh, she s a last resort. Kinda 
                      rough-edged.                                                                                    17.


      Stone paving, blank brick walls.  Rain falling through 
      fluorescent light. 

      FISH MOONEY (40 s, scarey, volatile, charismatic) in a slinky 
      evening dress and jewels, wielding a well-used aluminum 
      little league baseball bat; talks gently to a whimpering, 
      badly beaten fat man -- RAOUL -- on his knees in front of 
      her.  

      One of Mooney s entourage, an odd-looking young man named 
      OSWALD COBBLEPOT (26, small, plump, and beaky. He will become 
      famous as The Penguin) holds an umbrella over Mooney to 
      shield her from the rain. He s clearly the lowest rank in 
      this assembly.  Second in command BUTCH GILZEAN (30 s) and 
      two THUGGISH HENCHMEN watch attentively.  All Mooney s 
      henchmen wear similar black suits and white shirts.   

      The Waiter comes out of the club and waits to be noticed.

                                  MOONEY 
                          (to Raoul)
                    Here s the thing, sugar bunny. 
                    I still care for you deeply. 
                    But I feel like you don t care for 
                    me anymore. 

      Raoul mumbles incoherently.

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    I can t hear you.

                                  RAOUL
                    I care fuh fuh for you.

                                  MOONEY
                    Then where s my goddamn money? 

      She smacks Raoul with the bat. Oswald is entranced by the 
      man s pain, and so is late following her with the umbrella. 
      Mooney SMACKS HIM in the back of the head. Oswald conceals a 
      nasty scowl. 

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    Hell-oh?                                                                                     18.

                                  OSWALD
                    Sorry.

                                  MOONEY
                    If my hair goes frizzy, you will 
                    be. What is it, sweety?

      This last, with a smile, to the Waiter...

                                  WAITER
                    Ma am, Detective Bullock s here to 
                    see you.

      Mooney likes Bullock.  She hands the bat to Gilzean.

                                  MOONEY
                    Keep him warm.

      Mooney heads indoors. Oswald covers her with the umbrella to 
      the door, but stays outside. Butch looks at the two bored 
      henchmen and then turns to Oswald...

                                    GILZEAN
                    Oswald, you want a turn? 

                                  OSWALD
                    May I?

      Gilzean tosses the bat to Oswald, who is thrilled.   

                                  OSWALD (CONT D)
                    Thank you Mister Gilzean. 

      Oswald gives Raoul a tentative smack. Smiles slyly.  Does it 
      again, harder.  He likes this.   


      Oswald is delightedly dancing around, cackling, umbrella open 
      in one hand, the little league bat in the other hand, beating 
      Raoul. He s watched by Gilzean and the two Henchmen, very 
      amused.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Atta boy. 

                                  HENCHMAN
                    Go penguin!

      Oswald stops abruptly and glares at the Henchman. 

                                  OSWALD
                    You know I don t like to be called 
                    that.

                                  HENCHMAN
                          (unimpressed)
                    Ooo. Scary.

      Oswald snarls, but pauses guiltily when Gordon appears.

                                  GORDON
                    Hi.  How s everyone doing? 

                                    GILZEAN
                    Who are you?

                                  GORDON
                    Detective James Gordon, GCPD.     

                                    GILZEAN 
                    Oh. Come with Harvey uh? Good to 
                    know ya, James.  I m Butch Gilzean. 

                                  GORDON
                    Drop the bat.

      Oswald drops the bat. 

                                    GILZEAN
                    Oswald and Raoul were just having 
                    fun, right guys? 

      In a heap on the floor, Raoul nods and tries to smile...

                                  OSWALD
                    All in fun.                                                                                    21.

                                  RAOUL
                    Th... thas  righ. No problem.  Fun.   

                                    GILZEAN
                    So, you re a new guy, huh?  How you 
                    liking Gotham?

                                  GORDON
                    Well enough. 

      Stymied, and a little embarassed, Gordon gives Gilzean a hard 
      look and walks back inside. 


      Bullock at the wheel, Gordon alongside.

                                  GORDON
                    How much leeway does Mooney get 
                    exactly?

                                    BULLOCK 
                          (testily)
                    How long is a piece of string?

                                  GORDON
                    The law isn t made of string.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You re damn right. The law is us.  

                                  GORDON
                    It s more than us. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    You see anybody else out here?                                                                                     22.

      Off Gordon, troubled.


      A street of tenement apartments. Gordon waits on the deserted 
      street corner. Bullock drives up, parks and gets out of his 
      car. A little unsteady. 

                                  GORDON
                    You okay?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Coupla drinks. I ll be fine.

                                  GORDON
                    Bullock, come on. If you re drunk 
                    you can t--

                                    BULLOCK
                    --Hey. You don t tell me what I can 
                    or can t do. We clear on that?   

                                  GORDON
                    Clear.

      Beat.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Fish Mooney heard from one of her 
                    fences -- a guy was trying to sell 
                    him an antique four strand pearl 
                    necklace with gold settings.   

                                  GORDON
                    Like Martha Wayne was wearing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Name of the guy is Mario Pepper... 


      Gordon chases Pepper across the iconic rooftops of Gotham.

      The big man is an athlete, and LEAPS with ease across a 
      YAWNING GAP between the buildings.  Gordon follows with less 
      ease and more bravery. 

      Gordon has his gun out, gets a clear line of sight on Pepper...

                                  GORDON
                    Stop or I ll shoot!

      But Pepper doesn t stop and Gordon doesn t shoot him. 
      He wants him alive. 

      BULLOCK comes up via the STAIRWELL onto the rooftops.  

      There s no way he can make the jump made by Pepper and 
      Gordon.  They get further ahead while he searches for another 
      way across the gap.

      Scrambling to stop himself from falling off a steeply pitched 
      roof, GORDON LOSES HIS GUN, and continues the chase unarmed.

      MEANWHILE -- Bullock lays the ladder across the gap and walks 
      carefully across. 

      Gordon loses sight of Pepper and comes to a wide gap that 
      Pepper could not possibly have jumped.  Just as he realizes 
      that Pepper must therefore be behind him,  Pepper comes 
      charging out of the shadows, intending to push Gordon off the 
      rooftop.  Gordon dodges just in time. The two men grapple on 
      the edge of a sheer drop.  The advantage swings back and 
      forth.  

      Bullock arrives on the scene to find Gordon hanging from a 
      parapet with Pepper clinging desperately to his legs. In a 
      few seconds, both men will fall to certain deaths.      

      Bullock saves Gordon s life by shooting Pepper.  Pepper lets 
      go of Gordon and falls a hundred feet to his death SCREAMING 
      all the way. Free of Pepper s weight, Gordon scrambles to 
      safety.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    29.

                                        ACT TWO


      SUNRISE over the majestic city of Gotham. 


    The street is swarming with COPS and FORENSICS TECHS.  

    On the sidewalk, a MEDIC treats a nasty GASH on Gordon s arm. 
      Bullock is close by, talking quietly to a uniformed POLICE 
      CAPTAIN.  There s an air of tension.


    The Spectacled Cop emerges from the tenement block.  Holds up 
    an evidence bag with the pearl necklace inside.

                                  SPECTACLED COP
                    We got him!

      Bullock and Gordon exchange a look of profound relief.  They 
      laugh.  Real partners for the first time.  


      CLOSE ON A STACK OF NEWSPAPERS hitting the floor of a 
      newsstand.  The screaming HEADLINE -- HERO COPS DROP WAYNE 
      KILLER!  Beneath the headline are Weegee-style PHOTOS of 
      Pepper s corpse and the two GCPD Detectives. Gordon looks 
      proud and happy. 

      THIS BEGINS A MONTAGE OF PRESS PHOTOS: 

      Heroes of the hour - Gordon and Bullock speaking at a press 
      conference. Shaking hands with Mayor James. Bullock pointing 
      out Pepper s death site.  Gordon smiling into the camera 
      alongside Barbara at a charity ball. The last image is a 
      PHOTO of Bruce Wayne. The caption states - WAYNE FUNERAL ON 
      SUNDAY.


      The newspaper is being read by Oswald Cobblepot, wearing a 
      baseball hat and dark glasses, and sitting on the bus stop 
      bench.  A plain clothes police Crown Vic pulls up. Oswald 
      looks around warily before climbing into the back--


      Crispus Allen of the MCU is behind the wheel, Renee Montoya 
      alongside.  Not expecting much from this meeting...

                                  OSWALD
                    What a great pleasure to see you 
                    again, Mr. Allen, mizz Montoya.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Whatcha got?

                                  OSWALD
                    As you know, I am a close associate 
                    of Fish Mooney.

                                    MONTOYA
                    No disrespect, aren t you more of a 
                    dogsbody?

                                  OSWALD
                    I beg to differ. Be that as it may.  
                    You may trust me when I tell you 
                    that Mario Pepper was framed by 
                    Fish Mooney and the cops.                                                                                     31.

                                  ALLEN
                    You got our attention. 

                                  OSWALD
                    I saw miss Mooney with Martha 
                    Wayne s pearl necklace. She was 
                      discussing how to get it into 
                    Pepper s home, inside a bag of 
                    drugs.  This was shortly after she 
                    met with Detectives Bullock and 
                    Gordon from the homicide squad. 

                                  ALLEN
                    She had the necklace huh?  Mooney 
                    works for Carmine Falcone. Are you 
                    saying Falcone had the Waynes 
                    killed? 

                                  OSWALD
                    That I cannot tell. I don t know 
                    how Mooney acquired the necklace.
                    I am conveying only what I can 
                    vouch for honestly.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Why snitch on your own boss?

                                  OSWALD
                    Public spirit, sir.  That poor 
                    orphan boy pricked my conscience.

                                  ALLEN
                    You want Fish pushed out huh?  
                    You think Butch Gilzean would make 
                    a better boss for you?  

      Oswald scowls. Allen is right. He hates it when ordinary 
      mortals guess his intentions.

                                  OSWALD
                    Miss Mooney has been rude and 
                      disrespectful to me, but that is 
                    beside the point. I am doing my 
                    civic duty.  Good day to you both. 

      Oswald gets out of the car and waddles away.

                                  ALLEN
                    Looks just exactly like a penguin 
                    doesn t he? 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes he does.

                                  ALLEN
                    But I think he s telling the truth.                                                                                    32.

      Off Oswald Cobblepot...


      Barbara and Montoya in a quiet spot. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m working for the Major Crimes 
                    Unit now. We were set up by Mayor 
                    James to combat organized crime and 
                      corruption. We re totally 
                      independent of the GCPD.

                                    BARBARA 
                    Where s this going?

                                    MONTOYA
                    Thomas and Martha Wayne were good 
                    people. They were the moral 
                      conscience of this city. And they 
                    weren t afraid to shake things up. 
                    Alot of powerful people smiled in 
                    their face but secretly hated them.  
                    Wanted them dead. So now they are 
                    dead.  Things will change in this 
                    city. And not for the better.                                                                                    33.

                                    BARBARA
                    Renee, Why are you telling me all 
                    this?

                                    MONTOYA
                    We think Mario Pepper was framed 
                    for the murder.  And we think the 
                    GCPD was in on it.   

      Barbara takes a beat, trying to stay calm.

                                    BARBARA
                    You mean James was in on it.  
                    My James. Is that why you re here?

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes.

                                    BARBARA
                    And what s your proof?

                                    MONTOYA
                    I can t tell you, but it s the 
                    truth.  James Gordon is not a good 
                    guy.  You deserve better. 

                                    BARBARA
                    James Gordon is the most honest man 
                    I ve ever met. It s one of the 
                    reasons I love him.  He s not even 
                    capable of doing that. Couldn t lie 
                    to save his life.

                                    MONTOYA
                    Are you sure you know what he s 
                    capable of?  

                                    BARBARA
                    Yes I am.

                                    MONTOYA 
                    Does he know you as well?

                                    BARBARA
                    Yes he does. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Not like I do.

                                    BARBARA
                    Don t go there. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I still love you, Barbara.  I can t 
                    stand to see you get hurt.                                                                                    34.

                                    BARBARA
                    Don t.

                                    MONTOYA
                    I can t help it.  I want you back. 

                                    BARBARA
                    It s over, Renee.  It s over. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    You left me because you wanted a 
                    normal life.  And now you re going 
                    to throw that life away on a 
                    crooked cop?  Really?  

                                    BARBARA
                    He s not crooked.  And I left you 
                    because you treated me badly. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes.  I did and I m ashamed and I m 
                    sorry. I ve changed.  No pills, no 
                    drinking. I m totally clean for 
                    eighteen months.

                                    BARBARA
                    That s great.  I m happy for you.  
                    Truly. But we re done, you and me.  
                    I m marrying James.  And what 
                    you re saying about him is 
                      manipulative and untrue.  So I 
                    wonder how much you ve really 
                    changed.    

      Barbara tries to leave, but Renee holds her. 

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Let me go.

      Renee checks herself, kisses Barbara gently and lets her go.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m sorry.

      PRELAP: A SOULFUL VOICE SINGS AMAZING GRACE.

      ON Barbara hurrying away, very upset. 


      SONG CONTINUES OVER NEWS CAMERA FOOTAGE -- a vast rolling 
      meadow of gravestones, the city skyline looming beyond.  
      Martha and Thomas are buried together. As the coffins are 
      lowered into their grave and a GOSPEL SINGER SINGS...        
      We pan across a tableau of Gotham Society seated by the 
      graveside.  POLITICIANS, TYCOONS, SOCIALITES and MAFIA 
      BOSSES. At one end of the front row is MAYOR AUBREY JAMES.                                                                                      35.

      In the center is Bruce Wayne, a pale wraith with burning 
      eyes. flanked by Alfred. At the other end sits CARMINE 
      FALCONE (60 s, leonine).

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    Thomas and Martha Wayne were buried 
                    today and a cross-section of Gotham 
                    society was there to pay their 
                    respects.  Everyone from Mayor 
                    Aubrey James to Carmine  The Roman  
                    Falcone, reputed patriarch of the 
                    notorious Falcone Crime family.

      Gordon, Barbara Kean, Bullock, and Captain Essen are seated 
      in the second row. Each wrapped in their own thoughts.


      LATER, AFTER THE BURIAL. A line of people wait to give 
      condolences to Bruce Wayne, who lights up a little when he 
      sees Gordon approach.  They shake hands. The boy has grown 
      wise and solemn way beyond his years. 

                                  BRUCE
                    You kept your promise. Thank you.

                                  GORDON 
                    No thanks necessary. 

                                  BRUCE
                    And you were right. There is some 
                    light. Not much, but enough.

                                  GORDON
                    I m glad. If you ever need my help 
                    in any way, please, call on me.  

                                  BRUCE
                    I will. Thank you.

      They hug each other briefly.

      Off Barbara, watching this -- her mind in turmoil...


      A clean modernist office block.  Montoya and Allen emerge 
      from the MCU, head for their car.  Gordon approaches, angry. 

                                  GORDON
                    Montoya!

                                    MONTOYA
                    You go on.  Let me handle this.

      He walks on.  Gordon gets on Montoya.

                                  GORDON
                    Why would you tell my fianc e a 
                    crock of lies?  What did I do to 
                    you that you would do that?                                                                                     37.

                                    MONTOYA
                    We re old friends, we got to 
                    talking, and it came out. It was 
                      unprofessional, and I apologize.   

                                  GORDON
                      Unprofessional?  It s criminal 
                    slander!  There was no frame. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    We have evidence says otherwise.

                                  GORDON
                    Which is what?

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m not giving it to you. GCPD are 
                    neck deep in this mess.

                                  GORDON
                    The GCPD wasn t involved in any 
                    frame up. I busted Pepper for 
                      christsakes. I would know, right? 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Maybe you re so young and dumb that 
                    they left you out of the loop. But 
                    I doubt it.  I think you re just a 
                    damn good liar. 

      Gordon s thrown. Could she be right?  Is he out of the loop? 

                                  GORDON
                    If you have evidence, why don t you 
                    press charges?

                                    MONTOYA
                    We might.

                                  GORDON
                    Why would anyone frame Pepper?  

                                    MONTOYA
                    I don t trust you. If you re for 
                    real, you ll have to find out the 
                    truth for yourself. 

      She walks away.  On Gordon, confounded...



                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    38.

                                      ACT THREE


      Gordon enters.                                                                                      40.


      Gilzean s car is moving fast in light traffic, Gilzean and 
      two HENCHMEN inside.  Banging NOISE from the trunk...

      The trunk lid bursts open.  Gordon pops up and throws himself 
      out of the moving car, rolling and bouncing along the road, 
      causing cars and trucks to brake and swerve and collide.  

                                    GILZEAN
                      Sonofabitch!  Pull over.

      The gangsters  car swerves to the side of the road and stops. 

      Gordon scrambles to his feet and runs through the traffic. 
      But Gilzean and his men catch up to him, beat him down and 
      drag him back to their car, watched by astonished drivers, 
      who gawp and take photos on their celphones rather than 
        intervening. Only one TRUCK DRIVER gets out of his cab to 
      help, but thinks better of it when a Henchman points his gun. 

                                    GILZEAN (CONT D)
                    I told you to lock it, didn t I? 

                                  HENCHMAN
                    My bad.  I thought I did.

      They throw Gordon back in the trunk and drive on, ignoring 
      the commotion around them.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Iron gates.  An old brick building beyond.  Bullock leans 
      against his car, waiting, humming tunelessly.  Nobody s 
      around.  Gilzean s car drives up, stops at the gates.


      Bullock faces Gilzean and the two HENCHMEN.

                                  BULLOCK
                    Hey, Butch. 

                                  GILZEAN 
                    Harvey.  Who told you we d be here?

                                  BULLOCK
                    Everybody knows this is where you 
                    take your problems. You wouldn t 
                    have my partner in your trunk there 
                    would you?

                                  GILZEAN
                    What if I do?

                                  BULLOCK
                    Let me talk to Fish.

      Gilzean considers...


      Gilzean on a cell phone.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Bullock met us at the plant. 
                    Wants to talk to you.

                                  MOONEY
                    Oh does he now?  Put him on.
                          (to Oswald)
                    Medicine.

      Oswald hurries off.  Mooney gestures to the Comedian...

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    One minute, kid.  You re doing good.

      AT THE GATES, Gilzean hands the phone to Bullock.

                    Ah don t be like that.
                    You got to let my boy go. 
                    I swear he won t be anymore 
                    trouble. I will vouch for him one 
                    hundred and ten percent.  How long 
                    have we been friends?

                    For a long time until today.  
                    I did a big favor for you and now 
                    it s gonna blow up in my face on 
                    account of your stupidity. That s 
                    not okay sugar.  Why the hell you 
                    got a partner that doesn t know 
                    what time it is?   

                                    BULLOCK
                    Lookit, the kid is not your problem 
                    here.  He was hipped to the frame 
                    by Major Crimes. They ll be coming 
                    after you.                                                                                      46.

      Oswald comes back with a leather handbag.  Mooney snatches it 
      from him and rummages inside -- It s a loose grab bag of 
        pharmaceuticals.  Oswald hurries to fetch a glass of water.  

                                  MOONEY
                    How did they get onto me? 

                                    BULLOCK
                    The usual way I guess. Somebody 
                    talked.

                                  MOONEY
                    Not one of my people.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Everybody says that.

      Mooney is looking right at Oswald, who is looking back at her 
      with a glass of water and a look of humble unction that now 
      looks very suspicious to Mooney. 

                                  MOONEY
                    True.  True.

                    So, Fish, let Gordon go uh? I kinda 
                    got to like the kid. And he s my 
                    partner for chrissakes.  You kill 
                    him, I got to come after you. 

                                  MOONEY
                    Is that right?

                    How m I going to look, you kill my 
                    partner and I don t make a move?

      Long beat.

                                  MOONEY
                    That s true.  You got to promise 
                    me, you ll keep him under control.

                    Okay then.  Put Butch on.

      Bullock hands the phone to Gilzean.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Yeah, boss.

                    That sonofabitch just threatened 
                    me.  Put him in with his partner.                                                                                    47.

                    Willdo, boss.

      Gilzean puts away his phone, and makes a subtle gesture to 
      one of the Henchmen. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    I m glad we could work this ou -- 

      The Henchman HITS BULLOCK OVER THE HEAD with the butt of his 
      gun.  BULLOCK FALLS. 

      We exit the SPLIT SCREEN.


      The dock overlooks the city. Falcone walks with Gordon, who 
      is confused by this abrupt change in fortune and this 
      notorious villain s friendly manner.

                                    FALCONE
                    You have good blood James.  
                    And I don t like to spill good 
                    blood. That s why I m giving you 
                    another chance. One day, you could 
                    be a big man in this city, like 
                    your father. He died when you were 
                    what, nine?   

                                  GORDON
                    Yes.

                                    FALCONE
                    It s a shame you didn t get the 
                    chance to know him better. He was a 
                    great man. The best DA this city 
                    ever had.  And a good friend.

                                  GORDON
                          (dubious)
                    A friend of yours?

      Falcone bristles at the implicit disrespect.

                                    FALCONE
                    A good friend. That s the only 
                    reason you re alive right now.  
                    Your father and I understood each 
                    other. There was respect.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    52.

                                    FALCONE (CONT'D)
                    And he loved this city like I love 
                    this city. 
                          (beat)
                    It s going to hell.  We got gangs, 
                    crazy people, drug dealers, rapists 
                    and robbers running the streets.  
                    It s getting worse and worse.  
                    I don t know why. Sometimes I think 
                    this place is cursed. But I won t 
                    let it fall apart without a fight.   

                                  GORDON
                    I don t understand. Didn t you have 
                    the Waynes killed?  How does that 
                    help Gotham?

      Falcone laughs. 

                                    FALCONE
                    What an idea. I didn t kill the 
                    Waynes. I loved the Waynes. 

                                  GORDON
                    Who killed them then? It wasn t 
                    Pepper, was it?

                                    FALCONE
                    I have no idea who killed them.  
                    It was a mugging. Random fate.  
                    You and Bullock might have found 
                    the culprit eventually, but 
                    probably not. Pepper was sacrificed 
                    so that the people of Gotham would 
                    see swift justice done.  So they 
                    can feel safe.  So they can sleep 
                    at night. 

                                  GORDON
                    And that matters to you.

                                    FALCONE
                    Of course. I m a businessman, not 
                    an anarchist. I love law and order 
                    just like you do. You can t have 
                    organized crime without law and 
                    order.  There d be chaos.  When 
                    things like the Wayne Murders 
                    happen, it feels like nobody is 
                    safe.  People get scared. They lose 
                    faith in the city. That s the last 
                    thing anybody wants.  Not me, not 
                    the Mayor, not the chief of police. 
                    Nobody.                                                                                     53.

                                  GORDON
                    You re seriously telling me they 
                    all were in on framing Pepper, 
                    they re all corrupt.

                                    FALCONE
                    They re all realistic, and co-
                      operative. That s how the city 
                    works. We cooperate. You think 
                    Bullock is some kind of a renegade? 
                    He was following orders.  It was 
                    agreed that someone needed to be 
                    caught before the funeral. 

                                  GORDON
                    But then how did Mooney come to 
                    have Martha Wayne s necklace? 

                                    FALCONE
                    A replica of course.

                                  GORDON
                    No, it was the real thing.  Lab 
                    said so.  Real south sea pearls and 
                    old gold.  A hundred thousand 
                    dollars worth.

                                    FALCONE
                    Of course it was the real thing. 
                    And it cost more like twice that. 

                                  GORDON
                    Why should I believe you?

                                    FALCONE
                    You have a hard head. I spared your 
                    life.  Why lie to you now?

                                  GORDON
                          (stiffly)
                    Thank you for deciding not to kill 
                    me Mr. Falcone.  Are we done?  Can 
                    I go now?

      Falcone smiles ruefully at the young man s stubborn courage.

                                    FALCONE
                    I haven t decided anything yet. 
                    I m giving you a chance to do the 
                    right thing. Don t be self-
                      righteous. Don t be arrogant. 
                    Listen to advice.

                                  GORDON
                    You want me to keep quiet about all 
                    of this.                                                                                    54.

                                    FALCONE
                    Now that the Waynes are gone, 
                    Gotham is on a knife edge. What do 
                    you suppose bringing down city hall 
                    and the police force will do?  Make 
                    things better?  Really? 

                                  GORDON
                    I will have told the truth.

                                    FALCONE
                    Your father was a very wise man. 
                    He gave me some good advice one 
                    time. I was angry over some 
                      disrespect that had been shown me. 
                    Carmine my friend he said, in that 
                    calm voice he had, this city is 
                    worth more than your personal 
                    honor. 

      Falcone pats Gordon s cheek.

                                    FALCONE (CONT D)
                          (good luck)
                    In bocca al lupo.

      He walks away... 


      Dawn. The sun is a sliver on the horizon.  Gordon limps out 
      of the plant.  Bullock is leaning against his car. 


      Bullock at the wheel, Gordon alongside. Both a little stunned.

                                  GORDON
                    Lookit, Jim...

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I m listening.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Okay. I wasn t honest with you. But 
                    you weren t ready for the truth.  

                                  GORDON
                    I think you didn t tell me because 
                    you were ashamed.  

      It s true, but Bullock would never admit that.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    I m not ashamed of anything.
                    This is how the world works.                                                                                     55.

      Bullock steers the car onto... 


      Deserted, sheltered from the road. Bullock stops the car, and 
      jumps out, angry. Gordon follows.

                                  GORDON
                    Why are you stopping here?

      Bullock opens the trunk of the car to reveal Oswald 
      Cobblepot, beaten, gagged, in his shirt and underpants, hands 
      tied behind his back, wide eyed, making desperate noises. 
      Gordon is shocked.

                                    BULLOCK
                    This is the fool that snitched to 
                    Montoya and Allen.  Falcone wants 
                    you to kill him. 

                                  GORDON
                    You re kidding me.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Take him to the end of the pier and 
                    shoot him in the head. Then 
                    everybody knows you re with the 
                    program. 

                                  GORDON
                    And if I don t? 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Then I m supposed to take out him 
                    and you both. Here s the thing 
                    Jimmy, you re an okay guy. I might 
                    not have the stomach to do that. 
                    But I will try, because if I don t, 
                    someone else ll get to you quick 
                    enough.  Someone ll get to both of 
                    us. Probably Barbara as well. Who 
                    knows what you told her. 

                                  GORDON
                    I told her nothing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You think Falcone will be cool with 
                    that?  
                          (beat)
                    Come on, you killed people before.

                                  GORDON
                    That was war.                                                                                    56.

                                    BULLOCK
                    So is this. We re at war with low 
                    life dirtbags like this guy. In a 
                    war, you have to do bad things to 
                    do good.  Do you want to do this 
                    bad thing, or do you want to die 
                    and maybe your girl dies as well. 
                    To me, that s not a tough call.  

      Gordon takes a long beat, nods, and gestures to Oswald.

                                  GORDON
                    Out.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Attaboy.

      Oswald cowers, doesn t move.  Gordon and Bullock manhandle 
      him out of the trunk and onto his feet. 

                                  GORDON
                    Walk.

      Gordon shoves Oswald into motion.  The two of them walk to the 
      end of the pier. Gordon has to drag Oswald along by his 
      collar.  Bullock watches from a distance.

      Gordon and Oswald get to the pier s edge.  BLACK WATER 
      chunked with ice speeds past twenty feet below. 

      Gordon unties the cord round Oswald s wrists. 

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Turn around.

      Oswald turns to face him, mewling and pleading through the 
      gag.  Gordon points the gun at his head.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Don t ever come back to Gotham.

      BLAM!  Gordon fires the gun inches from Oswald s head, at the 
      same time shoving him hard in the chest.  Oswald falls twenty 
      feet into the freezing black water of the Gotham River. 

      From BULLOCK S POV, the killing looks legit. 


      Oswald sinks to the bottom flailing, but then finds his 
      bearings, pulls the gag off, and swims away with good 
      technique. 


      Gordon and Bullock get into the car. A moment of heavy 
      silence. Bullock pats Gordon on the knee, then starts the 
      car, drives away.                                                                                    57.


      A sunny day. The Gothic spires of the Victorian mansion look 
      almost cheerful.  We move closer and find young Bruce Wayne on 
      the roof, standing a foot away from the edge of a parapet, 
      over a dizzying drop.  He s very scared, but he takes a deep 
      breath and steps right to the very edge of the parapet, 
        deliberately trying to conquer his fear.   

                                  BRUCE
                    One hundred, ninety nine, ninety 
                    eight, ninety seven...


      Walking up the driveway of the manor to the front door, 
      Gordon sees Bruce up on the parapet.  He doesn t want to 
      shout for fear of startling the boy. He runs to the front 
      door, rings the bell urgently.  After an agonising wait, the 
      door opens and Alfred is there.

                                  GORDON
                    He s on the roof. Bruce is up on 
                    the roof.

                                  ALFRED 
                          (just irritated)
                    Ah bollocks.  Not again. 

      He stalks out onto the forecourt until he can see Bruce.

                                  ALFRED (CONT D)
                    Oi! Master Bruce! Stop playing 
                    silly buggers! Get your bloody arse 
                    down off there! 

      The boy sees Gordon and smiles, raises a hand in greeting.  
      He steps back from the edge and disappears from view below.                                                                                     58.


      Gordon exits, takes a deep breath of fresh air.

      WE PULL BACK AND BACK until we find Selina Kyle, perched high 
      in A TREE beyond the manor walls, with a clear view of the 
      house. Inscrutable as ever, she watches Gordon walk away with 
        a determined stride - a man on a mission. The Gotham skyline 
      looms above them both, gleaming darkly.   

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        THE END
