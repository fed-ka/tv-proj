CAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion
lights up the screen.

featuring names and pictures of Bob and Phil.
CAMERA MOVES
to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then
suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage
of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production
number "BELLS".
The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police
car awaits, with cop at the wheel.
SHERIFF
Just a minute, Hank, couple of
customers coming up.
HANK
Okay, boss.
The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room.
MED CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM WINDOW
It opens.
The Sheriff watches it.
Out comes Phil's legs,
meaning to get out backwards.
The Sheriff applies both hands
and pushes back.
SHERIFF
Back you go, boys!
He pushes Phil in.
Nimbly, he raises himself in.
Hank has thrown the door open.
PHIL
Do you think we can make it?
HANK
This thing goes over a hundred an
hour!
Hold on!
He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming,
and tires grinding.
The train is already moving as the police car arrives.
The girls are on the observation platform.
The police car
screams to a stop.
The boys fly out, with bags, and just
make the train, the girls pulling them aboard.
JUDY
(Seriously)
You didn't steal the police car?
PHIL
No, no.
Friend of ours.
They go toward the lounge car.
The rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel, underscored
musically.
The bus comes to a stop and our principals get out, Phil
staying with the driver for the luggage.
The others enter
the inn.
Waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on, but is
puzzled.
The boys exchange a glance.
WAVERLY
(Finally)
I'm not clear about some of it.
Explain it again.
PHIL
(Not too good a job)
Well, sir.
We have this show, and
we laid off for the holidays.
You
see, business was bad.
WAVERLY
I know about business being bad.
Go on.
PHIL
Yes sir.
Well, so we figured as
long as we had the opportunity we'd
do a little rehearsing.
Right here.
WAVERLY
Why here?
(There is a hint here
of the General)
Phil looks to Bob for help as they
move toward the lobby.
The troupe is busy transporting the costumes, etc., from the
moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene
is played.
BOB
Well, sir, this nice empty room.
The minute we looked at it we said
it was ideal.
Didn't we?
PHIL
That's what we said.
Ideal.
BOB
And then we'll have an audience to
play to.
You see, sir, you need an
audience on which to try out your
new material.
WAVERLY
Where are you going to get the
audience?
PHIL
Oh, what guests there are in the
other hotels. They're pretty bored
here without snow, and a New York
show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.
WAVERLY
I would think so.
(He thinks)
How will they know you're here?
BOB
Oh, word gets around.
PHIL
Yes sir, and we also took the girls
twice around the town for a little
run.
They were stiff from the train.
In their practice clothes.
BOB
Makes the blood circulate,
WAVERLY
(Hers no dope)
Hmm.
Whose blood?
BOB AND PHIL
Yes sir.
WAVERLY
Apparently there must be a lot about
show business I don't understand.
PHIL
It'll come to you, sir.
BOB
It just takes time.
PHIL
We wouldn't be any good as generals.
WAVERLY
You weren't any good as privates!
PHIL
(Pointing to Bob)
He was an officer, sir.
WAVERLY
Only to confuse the enemy.
He turns away and goes to his quarters.
DISSOLVE TO:
Bob comes out of the Post Office and mounts a bicycle.
He cycles down the street, whistling A MAN CHASES A GIRL.
DISSOLVE TO:
SECTION OF VILLAGE - HORSESHOE PITCHING GROUNDS - MED. SHOT -
(DAY)
There is a group of elderly men, among them the hotel owners,
pitching horseshoes. Waverly is sitting on a bench, ruefully
looking at the sign.
FIRST HOTEL OWNER
(Starting a new game)
How about it, Waverly, want to play?
WAVERLY
(Looking at him a
moment)
I'm too young for that sort of thing.
First Owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing.
Bob rides into the scene and dismounts.
MED. SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY
Bob sits into the shot.
WAVERLY
Kind of warm for that kind of
exercise, isn't it?
BOB
(Trying to help)
It isn't very warm.
(He looks to the sky)
I think the weatherman's wrong about
his forecast.
Those look like snow
clouds to me.
WAVERLY
(Without looking up)
They're cumulus clouds, at an
elevation of seven thousand feet.
BOB
Yes, sir.
(Still trying)
Still, weather's a funny thing.
It could snow - overnight.
WAVERLY
(He thinks a moment)
I'll tell you something I haven't
told my family.
I'm going back in
the Army.
BOB
Really, sir? That's great news!
WAVERLY
Yes.
I miss the Army.
BOB
Where are you going to be sent, sir?
WAVERLY
Well, I'm not sure yet.
I've always
been a combat officer, but I got an
idea they're going to try and palm
off one of the training commands on
me.
They'd better not.
They just
better not.
(He's worked up now)
I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes
yet.
(He smiles)
Now nothing to the women folk about
this!
BOB
No, sir.
WAVERLY
Let's mosey over to the post office,
I'm expecting a letter any day.
BOB
(Remembering)
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
(He pulls the letter
out of his pocket)
That's what I came over to give you,
it slipped my mind.
The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back.
WAVERLY
(Solemn)
This is the one.
(He opens it,
He
squints.
He looks
to Bob)
My glasses are in my room.
I'd like
to read it by myself, but I'm a little
anxious.
(He smiles at his own
predicament)
Read it, son.
Slowly.
BOB
(Reading)
Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old -
(He stops)
WAVERLY
(Pleased)
Skip that word.
BOB
Yes, sir.
(Continuing)
It certainly was a surprise hearing
from you.
Your amusing letter was
appreciated more than you imagine.
Of course you've got plenty of time
to be amusing, sitting on that porch,
rocking away, while we put in a full
day's work.
You always were a lucky
stiff, and I envy you.
A few years
more, I was saying to Emmy the other
evening, and I'm going to be able to
take it easy like old Tom.
WAVERLY
(Just repeats)
Old Tom.
BOB
Oh, well, some people have all the
luck.
Everyone in the family is
fine here.
Carol had the mumps,
which is no joke at eleven years of
age -
WAVERLY
The rest of the letter is about the
family.
(Bob looks at him,
and then glances at
the rest to see if
it is so)
He's telling me they have nothing
for me, we're not fooling each other.
(He holds has hand
out)
Thank you.
(Bob gives him his
letter.
There is a
pause.
An attempt
at being light)
Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to
pitch horseshoes.
Now could it?
BOB
(Trapped, unhappy for
him)
No sir.
(His nerve up)
Begging your pardon, sir, there's a
lot to be said for leisure.
You're
not used to it, you've always been
active, but in time -
He stops, seeing Waverly's expression.
Waverly winks at
him.
WAVERLY
(Quietly)
Never kid a kidder.
Go on back to
the hotel.
BOB
Yes sir.
Waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all.
Bob watches this reflectively as we
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
A poster outside advertises the appearance of Betty Stewart.
MUSIC is heard emanating from the club.
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
As Bob and Betty turn around the corner, they see Phil and
Judy, locked in an embrace.
Bob has been in front, but he
steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers.
BETTY
Who is it?
General Waverly?
BOB
The lovers.
BETTY
(To Bob)
We can't just stand here.
We have
to get some sleep.
She walks into sight, Bob following.
Phil and Judy break,
embarrassed.
JUDY
We were rehearsing for the show
tomorrow night.
BETTY
Is it going to be that kind of a
show?
We'll be raided!
JUDY
What are you doing here?
What
happened at The Carousel?
BETTY
I'm helping out here tomorrow.
PHIL
Hi, Bob. Everything's under control.
(Fluster)
I mean with the show. We've got a
lot of new material.
You both are
going to have to do a lot of
rehearsing.
(Flustered again)
I mean the other kind of rehearsing -
I mean - rehearsing
Well, good night,
Judy.
And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still
flustered.
JUDY
Good night, Phil.
Good night, Bob.
BETTY
(To both)
Good night.
Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow,
thinking it is their own.
PHIL
Let's get out of here before the
gossip starts.
They all laugh.
The girls enter their bungalow and put on
the light.
The boys head toward their bungalow.
Phil enters
in a gay mood.
Bob stops at the door, turns around and looks
toward the window of the girls' bungalow.
DISSOLVE TO:
Bob stands on the porch, in robe and slippers, thoughtfully
puffing at his pipe. Betty comes into scene.
BETTY
What are you doing?
Sleep walking?
BOB
(Turning)
Couldn't sleep.
Betty comes up on the porch.
BETTY
Whatever you've got on your mind
isn't worth staying awake for.
BOB
Where have I heard that?
BETTY
Tell you how I handle a situation
like this, Doctor.
She starts to sing, COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.
At the conclusion,
she walks away, leaving him standing there.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
CLOSE SHOT - ARCHED SIGN IN FRONT OF INN - (NIGHT)
This sign announces the show opening.
People are streaming
into the inn.
A church bell is framed in the foreground, and, far in the
distance, we see the town and the Inn and the snow as we
