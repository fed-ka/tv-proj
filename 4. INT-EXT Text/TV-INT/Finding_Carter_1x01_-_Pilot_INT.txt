CARTER

TAYLOR
Yeah!  Can I steal that?

Taylor has put the yogurt on the scale to pay.  She immediately 
turns to ZUBIN, the manager working the cash register.

TAYLOR (CONT D)

ZUBIN
Four twenty five.

As Taylor pays:

CARTER
(to Zubin)
Excuse me -- who do I talk to about 
getting a job here?

ZUBIN
 That would be me, but right now, we re
fully staffed --

CARTER

-- Zubin ... I like that name.  Zubin, 
trust me, you want me to work here.  
 the opportunity of a lifetime.It s

ZUBIN

Carter seems like she s about to tell him, but stops herself.

CARTER
No.  I want it to be a surprise when I 
 show up for work tomorrow.  Two o clock
sound good?

ZUBIN
Uhhh --

CARTER
Great.  See you then.

Carter and Taylor take a seat by the window.

CARTER
Oh, we have to change that.

Carter pulls Taylor out of the store.30.



Kids grinding, drinking, smoking, puking -- it s a pretty fun 
party.  Carter is surrounded by a crowd, watching as she pours 
bourbon in a bar glass and ignites it with a fireplace wand.  

(THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS WILL BE CHANGED.)

CARTER
The trick is, you only want to drink 
the bourbon --

She tosses back the drink, fire and all.  

THE CROWD
Whooaaaaaa!

She slams the glass back down.

CARTER
-- not the fire.

 still a blaze going inside the glass.And indeed, there s

THE CROWD
WHATTTTTT!
(they burst into applause)

ANGLE ON: Taylor, off in a corner.  GABE (not bad, could use 
some cooler clothes) hands her a drink in a red solo cup.  

TAYLOR
What is it?

GABE
Not sure.  Something lethal.

TAYLOR

Gabe keeps looking over at Carter.

TAYLOR
This is fun.

GABE
What?31.


TAYLOR
Me sitting here while you stare at my 
sister.

GABE

for being intrigued.

TAYLOR
Being abducted has its rewards.

GABE
She tell you what it was like?

TAYLOR
She lived in a two-bedroom apartment in 
 like she York, Pennsylvania.  It wasn t
was sold into child slavery.

GABE
s back, right?  happy she You re

TAYLOR
t  happy.  I don Yeah, of course I m
know how happy she is, though.

GABE
She looks pretty happy.

TAYLOR
Gabe, as you can probably tell, because 
you cannot take your eyes off her, my 
sister was having a totally fun and 
awesome life where she got to drink and 
smoke and probably be a complete slut.  
While I was standing off in some 
corner, never doing anything that would 
remotely qualify as fun or awesome, 
because I lived in constant fear of the 
terrible thing that happened to my 
sister.  Except ... it didn t!

Taylor drains the drink in her red solo cup.

GABE
Whoa, slow down --

Taylor grabs two Jello shots off a tray, gulps them down. She 
lets her hair down and removes an unnecessary layer of clothing.   

GABE (CONT D)
Taylor!  What are you doing?32.


TAYLOR
Making up for lost time.

Off Taylor, heading for the heart of the party.

DISSOLVE TO:



-- Gabe behind the wheel, Carter beside him.

CARTER
Thanks for the ride.

GABE
 Yeah, of course, any time.  You re
pretty much the most fascinating person 
 ever met.I ve

CARTER
You need to get out more.

GABE
 sure you have a boyfriend.  At I m
least one.

CARTER
I had one once.  But that was some 
other life.

He looks at her, intensely drawn to her.

GABE
I really want to kiss you.

CARTER
I can tell.

They leans towards each other; the kiss is tentative, but is 
about to deepen, but they are unpleasantly interrupted by the 
sudden glare of a flashlight and a sharp rap on the window.

CARTER (CONT D)
Owwww.  What the hell --

GABE
 your mom.I think it s33.


CARTER

My mom?

Gabe opens the door to reveal Elizabeth, with David.

CARTER (CONT D)

David rouses Taylor, and steers her toward the house

out of his car)

Gabe smiles, and drives off.  After he goes, Carter turns and 
heads for the house.  Elizabeth stops her.

ELIZABETH

CARTER
My bad habits?  So, there are already

ELIZABETH
What I meant was --

CARTER
Just name one.  Or you can name one 
thing about me you do like.  Name 
anything you know about me at all.  

ELIZABETH
I want to know you, but you ve done 
everything you can to avoid me.

mother used to tell me every day she

Carter turns and walks off, towards the house, completely 
 face.  oblivious to the pain shooting across Elizabeth s35.

 juiced she works for him.  He sidles up to a customer, and he s
showing him a newspaper with Carter on the front page.  

ZUBIN

friends.

Carter smiles, pleased that Zubin is spreading the word.

DISSOLVE TO:



Within no time, Carter is a local celebrity.  The place is 
packed with people who want to meet her. David and Grant enter, 
watching Carter work the crowd, posing for selfies with fans:

CARTER
I want to be on all your Instagrams.  
Facebooks.  Tweet about me.

GRANT
(to David)
She s so cool, don t you think?

DAVID
She is.

Grant heads over to the yogurt bar, and David walks over to 
Carter, holding out his phone.

DAVID (CONT D)
What about me?  Can I get a picture?

CARTER
Hell, yeah.
(she snaps the picture)
Make that the cover of your next book.

Carter looks at him, they smile at each other.  A nice moment.  
David heads over to Grant.

ZUBIN

Don t forget to say where she works!

CARTER

 The one who kidnapped her.  She s

Off David and Grant, watching Carter posing for another fan.

has their own individual process and there is absolutely no 
intimacy, tenderness, or even a mild connection involved.

psycho bitch -- 
(with rising emotion)
-- who let me die inside ... because I

step I need.

David rushes to Elizabeth, holds her, as she breaks down.

DAVID
 s okay, you don t okay, it Lizzie, it s
have to be so strong all the time.

Off the two of them, making a long-lost connection.



ANGLE ON: Taylor and Gabe, sitting together like they do this 
all the time, which they do.  Only this time, Taylor is dressed 
much funkier, much more Carter-like, in ripped denim shorts and 
wife-beater under a plaid shirt.  Carter, at work, is visible in 
the background, working the cash register.

GABE
I like this new look.

TAYLOR
I felt like I needed to do some 
 sick of seeing myself renovating.  I m
as this ... tragic figure.

GABE
 go Change is good.  Long as you don t
overboard, which you kind of did the 
other night.

TAYLOR
Yeah, that was rough.  But I definitely 
want to go to more parties, you and me.  38.

Carter walks up.

unmistakable fondness.

Taylor recoils, watching the two of them make googly eyes at 
each other.  She is not thrilled.

TAYLOR

Carter and Gabe break eye contact.

CARTER
(joking)
Nothing now.  Thanks, buzzkill.

TAYLOR
You two like each other?

Gabe and Carter look at each other.

CARTER

TAYLOR
Great!  I m happy for you!  Guess I 
should have just stayed in my corner!

Taylor races out of the yogurt shop, colliding with a TOTAL 
HIPSTER in wire-rim flip-up sunglasses and a funky bowler.39.


CARTER
(to Gabe, re: Taylor)
What was that?

GABE
I have no idea.

At that moment, Zubin summons Carter back to work.  

ZUBIN
Breaks over.  Back to your post.

Carter returns to work behind the cash register.

CARTER
Can I help the next customer?

A customer puts a cup of yogurt on the scale.

CARTER (CONT D)
That is a very stylish cup of yogurt.  
 have to What did you do, layers?  I ma
try that myself.

The customer pays and moves off.

CARTER (CONT D)
Who s next?

CLOSE UP: on a cup of yogurt being placed on the scale.  It s 
filled to the top with gummi bears.

CARTER (CONT D)
Here we go, someone after --

 the TOTAL HIPSTER.  Carter looks at the customer.  It s

Carter freezes, unsure what to do.  Zubin glares at her.

ZUBIN

No, I got it.

Lori hands over a $10 bill.  Carter sees she s written on it: 

LOVE YOU MORE.

CARTER (CONT D)
(whispering)
Not possible.

Lori flips up the shade part of her glasses and locks eyes with 
Carter.

LORI
(also whispering)
Yes possible.

CARTER
Mom --

Then Carter sees, through the window, two pairs of cops 
approaching the yogurt shop, guns at their side.  

CARTER (CONT D)
(sharply, to Lori)
Back here.

Carter pulls Lori behind the cash register, and grabs a Yo Mama 
baseball cap and apron.

CARTER (CONT D)
Put these on.

As Lori does, Carter pulls a tray of free samples out of a 
freezer.

CARTER (CONT D)
Take the free samples, and walk out the 
front door.

LORI
Carter --

CARTER

LORI

CARTER
Go now.

ANGLE ON: the front door.  Elizabeth enters.  Kyle is by her 
side.  Both have their guns drawn.

CARTER (CONT D)
(to Lori, in an 
exasperated tone)

ear)
Now.

LORI

Lori walks toward the front door with the tray of free samples.  
Right past Elizabeth.  

ELIZABETH
(to Carter)
Where is she?

CARTER
Where is who?

ELIZABETH
Carter, this place is surrounded by 
cops.  I promise you, Lori Stevens is 
not getting away.  

ANGLE ON: what Carter sees through the window: Lori handing her 
tray of free samples to some grateful kids, and then walking 
quickly, purposefully, down the street, out of sight.

CARTER
Hard to believe you need this many 
 not exactly people to catch her.  She s
Lara Croft.  The woman can barely throw 
a Frisbee.  
(chokes up a bit)
Though it was fun to watch her try.

ANGLE ON: Gabe going over to Kyle.

GABE
(to Kyle)
 going on?Dad.  What s

KYLE

Carter sees Kyle.  And recognizes him.

CARTER
(to Kyle)

GABE

As Carter races out of the yogurt shop, away from Elizabeth,

FADE TO BLACK.
