Blinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK
bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall:
Abe Lincoln & Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's
OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization.
CLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey
who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous.
RICKEY
Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of
now, only the Board of Directors
and my family know.
Sukeforth and Parrott exchange a look.
SUKEFORTH
A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey.
And you always got one.
RICKEY
My wife says I'm too old, That my
health isn't up to it. My son says
that every one in baseball will be
against me. But I'm going to do it.
Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey.
SUKEFORTH
Do what, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY
I'm going to bring a Negro
ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
PARROTT
With all due respect, sir, have you
lost your mind? Imagine the abuse
you'll take from the newspapers
alone. Never mind how it'll play
on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey.
Rickey looks dismissively at Parrott, over to Sukeforth.

RICKEY
There's no law against it, Clyde.
SUKEFORTH
There's a code. Break a law and
get away with it, some people think
you're smart. Break an unwritten
law though, you'll be an outcast.

RICKEY
So be it. New York is full of
Negro baseball fans; every dollar
is green. I don't know who he is,
or where he is, but he's coming.
CUT TO:
Rickey and Sukeforth going through stacks of FILES on the
desk. A black ballplayer's picture is clipped to each. As
Rickey reviews one, Sukeforth tries to hand him another.
SUKEFORTH
Josh Gibson. Oh boy can he hit.
RICKEY
No.
SUKEFORTH
No?
Rickey won't take the file; the answer is no.
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 4.
SUKEFORTH
Alright. Roy Campanella.
Sukeforth holds it out; Rickey won't take it.
RICKEY
A heck of a player. But too sweet,
they'll eat him alive.
SUKEFORTH

Satchel Paige then.
Parrott enters carrying an armful of files.
RICKEY
Too old. We need a man with a
future not a past.
(holds up his own
FILE)
Here. Jack Roosevelt Robinson.
As Parrott sets them on the desk, they start to slide off,
spilling to the floor. Helpless to stem the tide, Parrott
looks down, surrounded by black faces...
RICKEY
(flips through file)
A four sport college man, out of
UCLA. That means he's played with
white boys.
(SCANS FILE)
Twenty-six years old, now with the
Kansas City Monarchs. Batting over
350 even as we speak. 350! And he
was a commissioned army officer!
SUKEFORTH
He was court-martialed. A trouble
maker. He argues with umpires. A
quick temper is his reputation.
Rickey is obviously keen on him.
PARROT
What was he court-martialed for?
RICKEY
For refusing to sit in the back of
a military bus.
(checks the file)
Ft. Hood, Texas. The driver asked
him to move back. The MPs had to
take him off.
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 5.
SUKEFORTH
Do you see?
RICKEY
I see he resents segregation. If
he were white, we'd call it spirit!
PARROT
If he were white, sir, we wouldn't
be looking for him.
Rickey ends the debate...
RICKEY
Robinson's a Methodist. I'm a
Methodist. God's a Methodist. We
can't go wrong. Find him. Bring him
here.
CUT TO:
A BLOODHOUND watches as a BUS pulls into a SERVICE STATION,
the tires RING the bell hose. A million miles easy on this
road rumbler. The BANNER reads: KC Monarchs.
Insert: Interstate 24, Missouri - August 24, 1945.
The DRIVER steps off. The fellas follow, getting off to
stretch their legs. Hot and tired. A WHITE ATTENDANT
saunters out. The driver steps over to meet him.
ATTENDANT
Fill her up?
DRIVER
Yes, sir.
The attendant starts unscrewing caps on two 50-GALLON TANKS.
ATTENDANT
Where you all headed?
DRIVER
Chicago.
As the attendant shoves down a pump, starts filling, Jack
steps off. He spots and heads for a restroom. White Men
Only lettered on the door. The attendant roused as he sees.
ATTENDANT
Hey! Where you going, boy!?
BLUE REV 4-07-12 6.
Everyone looking over as Jack stops.
JACK
I'm going to the toilet.
ATTENDANT
Shit, boy, c'mon. You know you
can't go in there.
Jack does a slow burn, then suddenly strides toward the
attendant. The air rife with tension.
JACK
Take that hose out of the tank.
ATTENDANT
Huh?
DRIVER
ROBINSON --
JACK
Take it out. We'll get our ninety-
nine gallons of gas someplace else.
The attendant blinks. He takes a look from Jack to up and
down the deserted highway. No business in sight.
ATTENDANT
Okay, use it. But don't stay in
there too long.
Jack heads back. The Driver, the players, a bit stunned.
CUT TO:
Jack splashes water on his face, rips a paper towels from the
dispenser, pats his face dry. He balls the wad up, squeezes
it in his fist before firing it into the trash. He considers
his reflection in the mirror. As he regards himself, we hear
the SERVICE BELL ring outside.
CUT TO:
Blinds closed. Jack sits across the desk from Rickey.
Sukeforth sits a little further back. Rickey is staring at
Jack. Bushy eyebrows flared, light gleams off his glasses.
INSERT: August 28, 1945. Brooklyn.
Jack doesn't know what to do, looks to Sukeforth. Finally...
RICKEY
Do you have a girl?
JACK
Excuse me?
RICKEY
A man needs a family relying on
him. It insures he'll behave
responsibly. Do you have a girl?
JACK
I think so.
RICKEY
You think so?
Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey.
WHITE 3-14-12 8.
JACK
I don't make much money. Between
the army and now baseball I've been
away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she
wants to finish school. Considering
all that, I say I think so.
RICKEY
Do you love her? Rachel?
(JACK CONFUSED)
Don't you know?
JACK
Yes, sir, very much.
RICKEY
Marry her.
What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at
Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.
RICKEY (CONT'D)
Baseball's a hard life; a man needs
a good woman by his side. You
don't want the only person waiting
for you at home to be a catcher.
Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on
the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.
JACK
Coach Sukeforth here said you were
starting a new Negro League. That
doesn't make sense to me.
MR. RICKEY
It doesn't, huh? Are you calling
us liars, Jack?
JACK
What's this about, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY
This is about baseball.
Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows
it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.
RICKEY (CONT'D)
I see you starting in the spring
with our affiliate in Montreal. If
you make it there, we'll try you
down here with the Dodgers. The
white Brooklyn Dodgers.
Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right.
BLUE REV 4-07-12 9.
RICKEY (CONT'D)
I'll pay you $600 a month and a
$3,500 bonus when you sign the
contract. Is that agreeable?
Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day
in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.
JACK
Yes, sir. That's fine.
RICKEY
There is one condition. I have a
pile of scouting reports. I know
you can hit behind the runner, that
you can read a pitch. The question
is can you control your temper?
JACK
My temper?
RICKEY
Yes your temper! Are you deaf?!
Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there,
fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there:
RICKEY (CONT'D)
He looks proud. Willful.
SUKEFORTH
He'll need to be.
Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.
RICKEY
I want to win! I want ballplayers
who can win! Are you one of them?!
JACK
Yes.
RICKEY
A black man in white baseball.
Imagine the reaction. The vitriol.
Rickey strides forward, gets in his face.
RICKEY (CONT'D)
The Dodgers check into a hotel. A
decent good hotel. You're worn out
from the road and some clerk won't
give you the pen to sign in.
(SOUTHERN DRAWL)
We got no room, boy, not even down
in the coal bin where you belong.

Didn't you see the sign on the
door? No animals allowed.
(LOOMING)
What are you going to do then?
Fight him? Ruin all my plans?
Answer me, you black sonofabitch!
JACK
(MASTERS HIMSELF)
Do you want a ballplayer who
doesn't have the guts to fight
back? Is that what you want?
RICKEY
I want one who has the guts not to
fight back! There are people who
will not like this. They will do
anything to get you to react. If
you echo a curse with a curse, they
will only hear yours. Follow a
blow with a blow and they will say
a Negro lost his temper; that the
Negro does not belong. Your enemy
will be out in force, but you can
not meet him on his own low ground.
We win with hitting, running and
fielding, nothing else. We win if
the world is convinced of two
things: that you are a fine
gentlemen and a great ballplayer.
Like our Savior, you must have the
guts to turn the other cheek.
Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.
RICKEY (CONT'D)
Can you do it?
Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.
JACK
Mr. Rickey, you give me a uniform,
you give me a number on my back,

saw?
SMITH
Rabbit Tavener.
RICKEY
Rabbit Tavener? And you call
yourself a sports writer?
WHITE 3-14-12 13.
SMITH
Yes, a sentimental one. I'm from
Detroit. He was the Tiger
shortstop when I was a boy. How
about you? Who's your best?
RICKEY
Pop Lloyd.
SMITH
Not Honus Wagner?
RICKEY
Wagner is number two. And Rabbit
Tavener would not break my top 25.
Where do you suppose Jackie
Robinson will end up on that list?
SMITH
He won't break it. He doesn't have
a shortstop's arm. Robinson
belongs on second base.
RICKEY
Alright then, where would he rate
at second?
SMITH
If he was playing now he'd be the
best second baseman in the majors.
RICKEY
High praise. He'll have to be the
best in the minor leagues first.
SMITH
What are you saying, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY
I'm saying it's going to be a very
interesting spring training. A lot
of players are coming back from the
war and with gas rationing over, we
can train down in Florida again.
SMITH
Daytona Beach?
(RICKEY NODS)
You're aware in the past six months
a black boy was lynched in Madison,
Florida and a black man down in
Live Oaks?

Mr. Smith, are you a Communist?
SMITH
I'm a Democrat. Why do you ask?
RICKEY
I have a business proposition.
What's your salary at the Courier?
SMITH
Fifty dollars a week.
RICKEY
I will pay you an additional fifty
dollars a week plus expenses if you
will attend spring training with
Jackie Robinson. You will watch
over him, help him to avoid the
harm that could come if he were to
do or say anything out of turn.
You will act as his chauffeur, you
will secure accommodations for him
wherever the team may be, help him
find restaurants, etc...

What's in it for me? Besides the
fifty dollars and a whole lot of
aggravation?
RICKEY
Unprecedented access for any
reportage you feel appropriate.

Jack steps up to bat. The JERSEY CITY GIANT PITCHER looks to
the Montreal RUNNER at first, glances over his shoulder at
the Montreal RUNNER at second, then focuses on home.

His hands resting on the top of his typewriter.
SMITH
Come on, Jackie. Come on, batter.
60 RACHEL 60
Emerging up the runway. The field opening up before her.
There's Jack standing down there. The sight of him settles
her. As she puts a hand gently over her belly...
61 THE PITCHER 61
Grimaces for something extra as he fires a high fastball --
Jack UNLOADS. All heads turn to watch it sail -- high into
the left field bleachers, banging hard off the scoreboard.
62 SMITH 62
Nearly drops his typewriter, pushes his hat back as he
watches Jack start his home run trot. Smith laughs. Joy.

And our own hearts beat just a bit
faster, and the thrill ran through

I present the general manager of

The start of applause. Rickey motions for it to stop.
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 48.
RICKEY
He may stay there or he may be
brought to Brooklyn. But if Jackie
does come up to the Dodgers, the
biggest threat to his success, the
one enemy most likely to ruin that
success, is the Negro people
themselves!
There is shocked silence in the room. Rickey notices a group
of KIDS watching from a raised running track, soldiers on:
RICKEY
I say it as cruelly as I can to
make you all realize the weight of
responsibility that is not only on
myself and the Dodgers, but on
Negroes everywhere. For on the day
Jackie enters the National League,
if he does, I have no doubt every
one of you will form parades and
welcoming committees. You'll
strut. You'll wear badges. You'll
hold Jackie Robinson days and
Jackie Robinson nights. You'll get
drunk, fight and be arrested.
This is too much. People are slackjawed. Rickey powers on.
RICKEY
You'll wine and dine him until he
is fat and futile. You'll
symbolize his importance into a
national comedy and yes, a tragedy!
So let me tell you this!
(pounds his fist)
If any group or segment of Negro
society uses the advancement of
Jackie Robinson in baseball as a
triumph of race over race, I will
regret the day I ever signed him to
a contract, and I will personally
see that baseball is never so
abused and misrepresented again!
Is he done? An embarrassed smattering of applause. Mostly
shock and stares. As Rickey stands there uncomfortably...

Rickey stands waiting; giving that speech has worn him out.
The door opens and Miller looks in on him.

brother home if he's not as good.
LORRAINE
(in his ear)
What are you going to do with me?
DUROCHER
We're playing for money, Mr.
Rickey. Winning's the only thing
that matters. Is he a nice guy?
RICKEY
If by nice you mean soft, no, not
particularly.
DUROCHER
Good. He can't afford to be. Nice
guys finish last.
LORRAINE
What about nice girls?
She starts to kiss him. It's hard to concentrate.

A team full of tough war veterans?
Immigrants' sons? Boys from
impoverished parts of the country?
DUROCHER
It - ain't - gonna - happen.
RICKEY
You really believe they won't
accept him? Once they see how he
plays, how he can help them win.
DUROCHER
I'm not saying they won't accept
him: I'm saying they won't ask for
him. I'm saying Robinson's good
medicine, but they're not gonna
like the taste. I'm saying bend

Durocher suddenly marches to Higbe, looks like he's going to
belt him. As Higbe gulps, Durocher turns to the team.
DUROCHER
I don't care if he's yellow or
black or has stripes like a zebra,
if Robinson can help us win, and
everything I've seen says he can,
then he's gonna play on this ball
club. Like it, lump it, make your
mind up to it because he's coming!

are coming right behind him. They
have talent and they wanna play!
He lets that sink a moment.
DUROCHER
Yes, sir, they're gonna come diving
and scratching. So I'd forget your
petition and worry about the field.

for the welfare of this venture. I
for one would deeply appreciate it.
I think we can all learn something.
WALKER
What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a
hardware store back home. It's
called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't
come because I have the lowest

called Dixie Walker's. Understand?
And I make as much money owning
that store as I do playing for you.

Is that what you're you afraid of?

Some guys quiet, some guys joking around. Everyone in some
version of getting out of their street clothes or into their

Jack enters. As he walks past -- some players nod hello.
Others look like Sphinxes. Walker turns and faces his

scans for a locker with his name on it, BABE HAMBURGER, the
clubhouse manager, steps over.

BABE
You're looking for your locker,
huh, kid? Follow me.
They walk over to a hook on the wall. A uniform hangs from
it. A FOLDING CHAIR below.
BABE (CONT'D)
I just got the word. Best I could
do. I'll get you straightened out
tomorrow though, huh?
Jack nods, unbuttoning his shirt... Stanky is suddenly there.
All pugnacity as he gives up 4 inches and 40 pounds to Jack.
STANKY
You're putting on that uniform, it
means you're on my team. But before
I play with you I want you to know
how I feel about it. I want you to
know I don't like it. I want you
to know I don't like you.
Jack regards him. Stanky doesn't flinch. Maybe he should.
JACK
That's fine. That's how I prefer
it. Right out in the open.

Walks toward the plate. More cheers. Mostly.

Jack struggles not to look back at the source of the jeer.
He settles in at the plate. JOHNNY SAIN on the mound waiting

The BRAVES CATCHER signals 1'. Here come the pitch. CRACK!
It's down the third base line.
The THIRD BASEMAN is going to need every ounce of his arm as
he fields it at the line, throw across his body to --

Baseball has returned to Brooklyn,

SHOTTON
Yeah, it's a shame about Leo.
RICKEY
Inevitable I suppose. I asked him

yes. How's the retirement?
SHOTTON
It's fine. The roses --
RICKEY
It's a helluva thing when a man has
good health and enough money and
absolutely nothing to do.
SHOTTON
I'm perfectly happy.
RICKEY
Is that so?
SHOTTON
When I took off that Cleveland
uniform two years ago, I promised
the Mrs. I'd never put on another
uniform again. Roses look great
and I sleep a whole lot better.
RICKEY
Roses and sleep are two wonderful
things, Burt. But sleep you can
get inside your casket and flowers
look good on top of it. You don't
look like a dead man to me.
SHOTTON
What's this about, Branch?
TAN REV 6-25-12 73A.
RICKEY
I need you to manage the Dodgers.
We're a ship without a captain;
there's a typhoon ahead.
SHOTTON
No, I'm sorry, but no.
RICKEY
Do you miss the game, Burt? Look
me in the eye and tell me you
don't.
Shotton considers Rickey a beat and then looks away.
SHOTTON
Baseball's the only life for an old
pepper pot like me, but I promised
my wife, Branch.
RICKEY
You promised her you wouldn't put
on another uniform. You didn't
promise her you wouldn't manage.
Wear a suit and tie; Connie Mack
still does.
(A BEAT)
You remember how to get to the Polo
Grounds, Burt?
SHOTTON
Branch, I --
RICKEY
You remember what the peanuts smell
like roasting, how the crack of the
bat sounds, the roar of the crowd?
SHOTTON
Sure...
Rickey tosses him a set of car keys.
RICKEY
My car's parked right out front.
Harold will show you where. Now

The Dodgers trade looks. Not exactly inspirational. As
Shotton heads out he pauses by Jack.

Shotton pats Jack on the shoulder, continues on his way.

off. In a lull, Jack cuts his steak, low to Rachel.
JACK
I'm not complaining, I just, I
don't know what they want.
RACHEL
(BEAMING)
They want to see if Jackie Robinson
is real. They want to see your
pride, your dignity. Because then
they'll see it in themselves.
He's stopped short. She blinks with mock coquettish modesty.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
And me? I'm just young and scared

He grins at her, almost gets a forkful in when LAWSON BOWMAN,

CHAPMAN
We treat him the same way we do

When I first told you about Jackie,
you were against it. Now all of a
sudden you're worrying about him.
How do you suppose that happened?
PARROTT
Well, any decent minded person --
RICKEY
Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word.
It means to suffer. I sympathize
with you means I suffer with you.
This Philadelphia manager has done
me a service.
PARROTT
A service?!
RICKEY
Is there an echo in here? Yes,
he's creating sympathy on Jackie's

Typical stuff.
Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt.

steps over to a filing cabinet.

What are those?
RICKEY
I'll tell you what they aren't,
they aren't letters from the Jackie

Reese trails off, won't say it out loud. Skips to another.

Get out of the game or be killed.
He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not
utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked.
REESE (CONT'D)
Does Jackie know?
RICKEY
Of course he knows. And the FBI.
They're taking a threat in
Cincinnati pretty seriously. So
excuse me if I'm not too shocked at
you being called a carpetbagger.
You should be proud of it!
REESE
We'd just like to play ball, Mr.

RICKEY
I understand. I bet Jackie just
wants to play ball. I bet he wishes
he wasn't leading the league in hit

Walker strokes a DOUBLE over Stanky's head as Stanky breaks
off second for third.
RED BARBER'S VOICE
...And Dixie Walker did the same
with a double in the eighth.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 105A.
Jack on his stomach as STITCHES are sewn into his leg.
REPORTERS in front of him.
REPORTER ONE
Did he spike you on purpose?
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 107A.
JACK
You saw the play. I had my foot
inside the bag. He was out by a
mile. But he kept coming.
REPORTER TWO
Slaughter said it was an accident.
JACK
What are you asking me for then?
REPORTER TWO
Are you calling Slaughter a liar?
CHERRY REV 6-11-12 108.
This guy's a real jerk. Rickey arrives, a BASEBALL in hand.
RICKEY
Get out. Let me talk to my first
baseman. Go. He's getting
stitched up for Pete's sake.
The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two
hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches.
RICKEY
Sticking up for yourself is what
you'd expect of any man. Some find
it galling to see it in a Negro.
JACK
I'm sorry, Mr. Rickey.
RICKEY
Sorry? Sorry for what?
JACK
I lost my cool out there. It
probably cost us the game.
RICKEY
I told you, Jackie, all the best
base runners get caught sometimes.
JACK
I wasn't thinking.
Rickey pulls up a chair sits across from him, leans in.
RICKEY
Do you know what I saw this
morning? I was passing a sandlot
and a little white boy was up to
bat. You know what he was doing?
JACK
Sitting on a fastball?
RICKEY
He was pretending he was you.
Wiping his hands on his pants,
swinging with his arms outstretched
like you do. A little white boy
pretending he was a black man.

CHERRY REV 6-11-12 109.
The two men, who have done so much, looking each other over.
JACK
Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY
We had victory over fascism in
Germany; it's time for victory over
racism at home.
JACK
Why are you doing this? Come on
now.
A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away.
RICKEY
I love this game. I love baseball.
I've given my life to it. Forty
odd years ago I was a player coach
at Ohio Wesleyan University. We
had a Negro catcher, best hitter on
the team. Charley Thomas.
Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands.
RICKEY
A fine young man. I saw him laid
low. Broken because of the color
of his skin and I didn't do enough
to help. I told myself I did, but
I didn't. The game I loved had
something unfair at the heart of
it. I ignored it. But a time came
when I could no longer do that.
(LOOKS UP)
You let me love baseball again.
Thank you.
Jack's eyes gentle on Rickey's.
JACK
You're welcome.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 110.
Rickey fighting back tears now, retreats to his more
confident self.
RICKEY
You're a force of nature, Jackie,
you've complicated everything but
yourself. You're changing the
world, and refusing to let it
change you. I for one am in awe.
Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they
consider each other. Finally, a promise...
JACK
I won't get picked off second base
again. Not this year.

It's early. Rachel watches from bed as Jack finishes
packing. She looks sad.
Jack looks into the cradle at Jackie Jr..
JACK
It's pop's last long road trip of
the year, little man.
RACHEL
Careful you don't wake him.
JACK
I know. I won't.
(LOOKS OVER)
You okay?
RACHEL
I don't like seeing you leave,
that's all.
He looks at her a beat, resumes packing...
JACK
I'll be home in a week.
RACHEL
Eleven days. That's a long time
without you.
He doesn't answer, packs away. Finally:
RACHEL
Try not to lunge at the plate.
JACK
Seriously?
RACHEL
That's why they're throwing the
fastballs inside.
He looks at her, a little shocked.
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 112.
RACHEL
Fight those inside fastballs off,
foul them back. Sooner or later
they won't be able to help but
throw a curve.
He steps to the bed, leans over her.
JACK
And what'll happen then?
She clucks a 'hit' sound, makes an 'ahhhhhh' crowd sound.
JACK
We win enough of these next games
and we'll bring home the pennant.
RACHEL
Pennant? Where are we going to put
a pennant? All these baby diapers
hanging everywhere.
Jack looks around the room, at the diapers hanging.
JACK
We got room right over there.
Between number one and number two.
She mock grimaces at his bad joke.
RACHEL
Win one if you have to, but bring
yourself home; that'll be plenty.
They kiss.
JACK
Rae, you're in my heart.
RACHEL
Promise me you'll come home. That
you'll always come home.
As he looks at all he loves in the world...
JACK
I promise.

BARBER'S VOICE
The Dodgers closing in on the
Pennant as they'll leave St. Louis
for Cincinnati and a three game
series with the Reds.
Jack sits in his grass stained pants after the game. Most of
the guys are in the shower. Branca, a towel around his
waist, is headed there himself. The sight of Jack stops him.
BRANCA
Can I ask you something, Jackie?
How come you never shower until
everyone else is done?
Jack just stares at him. Branca won't let it drop.
BRANCA
You shy or something?
JACK
I don't want to make anyone
uncomfortable.
BUFF REV 5-29-12 116.
BRANCA
We're a team. On a hot streak.
Half the wins on account of you.
You're the bravest guy I ever saw.
You're leading us and you're afraid
to take a shower?
A beat as Jack considers him. Stone-faced.
BRANCA
C'mon. Take a shower with me.
(A BEAT)
Hey, I don't mean it like that.
CUT TO:
197 SHOWERS 197
The Dodgers showering, guys chattering. Suddenly, there's
Branca and Jack at the shower entrance. All eyes look over.
Branca enters. Then Jack. A beat and everyone goes back to
getting clean. It's no big deal. Except...
Dixie Walker looks to the floor, shakes his head. Finally,
quietly, he leaves. Who's the loneliest man on the team now?

As the phone rings, Rickey grabs it. On edge.

199 INTERCUT WITH PARROTT 199
On a payphone in the CROSLEY FIELD CONCOURSE.
PARROTT
We did it, Boss! We did it! We
swept Cincinnati! That puts us
seven games up.
Joyous, Rickey grabs a sheet showing the NL standings.
RICKEY
And eliminates the Giants and
Boston.
He puts an X' through Boston and the Giants. The rest of
the NL are already crossed out. Only the Cardinals remain.
At the same time, Parrott X's the same out on his notebook.
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 117.
RICKEY
We'd have to lose nearly every game
for the Cardinals to catch us now.
One more win may do it. Who's
pitching tomorrow for the Pirates?
PARROTT
Ostermueller.

Rachel listening, smiling as CHEERS sound from outside the
apartment. We hear the sound of car horns on the street.

He runs toward first and we run with him. The smile starts
somewhere in his body. His heart most likely. By the time
it reaches his face, his joy has erupted. The weight of the
world starting to drop.
