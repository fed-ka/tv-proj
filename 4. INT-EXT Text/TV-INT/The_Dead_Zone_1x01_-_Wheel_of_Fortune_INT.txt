          A music room with a girls' choir singing the old chestnut,
          MISTER SANDMAN under the direction of Sarah who's also 26
          now... she plays an electronic keyboard as accompanist...

                          'Bum-bum-bum-bum... Mister Sandman,
                        bring me a dream... make him the
                        cutest that I've ever seen...'

          The girl closest to the window just sees what's going
          on...

                                        GIRL STUDENT#1
                        Omigod, Ms. Bracknell... you gotta
                        see this...

          Sarah moves to the window and looks out to see --


          LONG SHOT - THROUGH WINDOW - JOHNNY

          hanging from a branch of the tree swinging back and forth
          like a monkey as the other kids drop down...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is where we all started,
                        right up here in the trees.

          He makes the sound of an orangutan... Sarah watches with
            a controlled smile, her eyes seem to light up at the sight
          of him... the girls watch her watch him and grin... a
          couple of girls giggle and whisper to one another.



          As students move between classes, Johnny enters with the
            principal who isn't as upset as he'd like to pretend to
          be... he's an admirer of Johnny's...

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        It would just make me feel better
                        about paying the electric bill if
                        you used the classroom once in a
                          while...

          Johnny pauses just outside a door marked JANITORS, puts

          his arm around the principal's shoulder, making nice --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dave, they'll never look at a
                        tree the same way again.

          The principal throws Johnny a dubious but affectionate
          look and moves away... Johnny takes a beat to glance in
          both directions...


          HIS POV - THE STUDENTS

          are into their own things, paying no attention to him...


          RESUME JOHNNY

          as he casually backs up and opens the door... slips
            inside...



          Johnny's eyes aren't accustomed to the dark yet...  


            A WOMAN'S LIPS COME OUT OF THE DARK

          presses against his... he's surprised but responds...
          it's a lovely kiss...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I sure hope you're not Lars the
                          janitor.

                                        SARAH
                        Lars was just here.  He doesn't
                        kiss nearly as well as you do. 
                        Open your mouth.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                        Open your mouth.

          He opens his mouth and she drops in a slice of orange...
          as he tastes it, reacts with pleasure...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh... that's... what is that...
                          tangerine...?

                        Satsuma mandarin.  Your taste of
                        the day.  Everybody should
                        experience a new taste every day.

          And with the juice of the orange still filling his mouth,
          she moves to kiss him again and they share the sweet
          taste...

                        keep surprising me, Sarah.



          as they come out and pulling back to reveal that a dozen
          or so of their students are outside - waiting to razz
          them as they come out... they smile embarrassed...

          As the front door opens and Johnny enters to hear the
          voice of an evangelist (GENE PURDY, 55) preaching the
          gospel on television... Johnny frowns at the sound...

                        ...the great architects of society
                        have been righteous men motivated
                        by their faith in God to make
                        this a better world...



          Finding a strange sight - the man on the TV, speaking
          from a modest studio set, is being watched by the same
          man sitting on the couch, holding a remote control... the
          Reverend Purdy, dressed here in street clothes, is
          transfixed by his own performance...

                                        PURDY (TV)
                        Today's self-anointed architects,
                        the conglomerates and 
                          moneychangers who worship gold,
                        exploit our fine work even as
                        they tear down every holy
                        tradition, infiltrating our
                          governments, our universities,
                        the media.  Listen to what founding
                        father and our second President,
                        John Adams, wrote: "Our
                          Constitution was made only for a
                        moral and religious people.  It
                        is wholly inadequate to the
                        government of any other."  The
                          Declaration of Independence, the
                          Constitution, the Bill of Rights -
                        read any of them and you'll agree
                        there is no question that the
                        authors of our most cherished
                          documents built this nation upon
                        foundation of faith and a belief
                        in God's law.  They demanded that
                        people like you and me, people
                        who live our lives according to
                        the principles set forth in the
                        Bible, take an active role in the
                          political future of America.  We
                        are citizens of a great nation
                        and it is our responsibility to
                        stop the spread of godless
                        leadership that has corrupted
                        every aspect of this society.

          Johnny enters... reacts to the scene... Purdy looks up,
          embarrassed at being caught... but he's a man who never
          loses control and is extremely charming... he laughs at
          himself as he mutes the sound...

          Dark... finding a nurse, ELAINE MACGOWAN (30s), entering
          the room; she opens the drapes, letting sunlight in... 
          There are two beds, an unconscious old man in one, hooked
          up to an I-V...

                                        ELAINE
                                (to the old man)
                          Morning, Mister Cavis.  And how're
                        we doing today...   

          ...she checks to make sure it's dripping... and then to
          the other bed where we find Johnny lying still on his
          back, unshaven, no sign of any injuries he might have
            sustained in the accident.  A basin of water has already
          been placed on his bedstand.

                                        ELAINE
                        Are we ready for our sponge bath,
                        Mister Smith?

          She's obviously used to talking to comatose patients. 
          One odd sign: the old man has flowers and get well cards. 
          Johnny has none.  She sits gently on the bed beside the
          motionless patient, dips the sponge in the water and she
          touches his face with the sponge...

                                        ELAINE
                        After this, I'll give you a nice
                          shave...

            Suddenly, his eyes still closed, his arm comes up like a
          snake and grabs her hard by the wrist... she yelps with
          shock and knocks the basin of water clanging to the
          floor... his body shudders like an electric current is
          going through it... pulling away, she breaks out of his
          grip... and now his eyes open... he gasps for air...

          He looks around disoriented...

                        It's okay.  It's okay.  You were
                        in an accident...

          She runs out to the hallway, yells --

                                        ELAINE
                        Dr. Tran, room fourteen, stat!   

          Johnny holds up his hands and inspects them slowly...
          touches them to his face as she returns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... bandages?

                        Can't believe it...


          ANGLE ON THE DOOR

          ...the arrival of DR. TRAN CHI DUC, 31, Vietnamese, enters,
          reacts with surprise...

                                        ELAINE
                        Look who's here, Doctor...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        It's very good to meet you, Johnny. 
                        I'm Dr. Tran.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Am I... okay?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        You're in a long-term hospital
                        care facility.  You sustained
                        serious brain damage.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (evenly, fear humor)
                        As opposed to unserious brain
                        damage...?

          Tran picks up the medical chart at the foot of Johnny's
          bed...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (rising panic)
                        I... I can't stretch out my legs...
                        my... legs...

          As Johnny struggles, Dr. Tran moves closer to the bed to
          calm him...

                        With physical therapy, your legs
                        will be fine.  The muscles have
                        atrophied.

          He grabs the chart out of the doctor's hands... 


          THE CHART

          starting with his name... seeing and general overview of
          his condition that begins with the words: ADMITTED: JUNE
          6, 1995... moving down to the latest entry that indicates
          his condition is stable... dated SEPTEMBER 1, 2001.

                        You've been in a coma for six
                        years, Johnny.  We had very little
                        hope that you'd ever awaken, let
                        alone retain any sort of cognitive
                        abilities.

                                        DR. TRAN
                                (off the chart)
                        Your condition was complicated by
                        scar tissue from an earlier
                          injury... perhaps suffered in
                        childhood?  Do you recall...

          Johnny doesn't answer, overwhelmed.  Tran understands,
          backs off.

                                        DR. TRAN
                        Well, there'll be plenty of time
                        for questions later.  We need to
                        run tests as soon as possible. 
                        Elaine, why don't you clean him
                        up and we'll get started.

          She goes back to the bathroom to fill up her pan again. 
          He smiles.

          He exits and Elaine moves over...

                        Now, don't go feeling embarrassed. 
                        I've been washing you from head
                        to toe for years now...

          She pulls his bedclothes back and wets the towel and moves
          it to his neck...

                                        ELAINE

          Johnny doesn't answer... his eyes are still dazed... but
          as he feels her touch again...


          SCENE FREEZES ON HIS TOUCH FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND
          THEN CONTINUES

          as something happens to his eyes and his arm grabs her by
          the wrist again... repeating what he said earlier --

                        Wrong.  Something's wrong...

          His head turns to see --



          cries in the corner... there's smoke and fire... she's
          trapped...

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's still time.

                          kitchen.  Your babysitter's hurt. 
                        Call the fire department!  Call a
                          neighbor.  Hurry!

          Johnny collapses with exhaustion as Elaine, disturbed,
          runs out...



          Tran is moving down the corridor, his mind trying to
          unravel this mystery... a young attractive nurse, ALLISON
          CONNOVER (21), is coming out of Johnny's room as he's
          about to go in...

                                        ALLISON
                        The patient is asking about his
                        mother and fianc e...

                        His mother's dead; I'd rather not
                        tell him right away.  Check his
                          admission records for the fianc e's
                        name... we should try to find
                        her...

          She acknowledges and moves away...



          Johnny, still shaken by what happened, looks up from his
          bed as Dr. Tran enters... his eyes ask the question...  

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The little girl is safe.  The
                        next door neighbor looked out the
                        window when Elaine called... smoke
                        was coming out the window...

                        What... is happening to me... 

          Tran studies Johnny... a long beat... then because he is
          a man of science taught to be skeptical, he works to fill
          in a rational explanation...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The house is only a mile away...
                        perhaps you heard a fire engine
                        that had already been dispatched...

          Tran takes a beat... thoughtful... 

                                        DR. TRAN
                        Johnny, your brain is still trying
                        to cope with severe trauma...
                          there'll be consequences and this
                        may have been one - a startlingly
                        real hallucination.

                                        JOHNNY
                        An hallucination that just happened
                        to be true.

                        The mind is not really
                          precognitive.  It just plays tricks
                        on us occasionally to make us
                        think so.

          He moves beside Johnny's bed... pulls out a small doctor's
            flashlight...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        We know less about how the brain
                        works than any other organ in the
                        body.  What seems clear is that
                        your brain has found a new way to
                        work.  It's taking a detour around
                        the damage and tapping into a
                        region of the brain that humans
                        don't normally use to handle
                        sensory perception. 

          Tran moves closer and begins to examine Johnny's eyes...

          Tears stream down her cheeks... an explosion rocks the

          and he is carried away... the mother's arms reach out to

          this desperate scene from the doctor's childhood...

                        the fall of Saigon...

          Johnny is so exhausted he can barely speak; he releases

                        is happening to me...

          his patient... he's a bit shaken by the whole thing...

          unnatural.  She's been sitting there for awhile trying to
          get the courage to go inside.  She looks at the wedding
          band on her finger, thinks about it and then slowly slips
          it off and puts it in her handbag.  She takes a deep
          breath, turns...

                        life.  It's the least we can do
                        after everything Vera Smith did
                        for us.

                                        DR. TRAN
                        A week ago, I would have said
                        that was likely.  Today, I'm not
                        so sure.

          None of this is good news but Purdy covers well, showing
          only his concern for Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                        But if he's delusional...

                                        DR. TRAN
                        We don't know how serious it is
                        yet.  We may be able to treat his
                          condition through drugs or
                            psychotherapy...

          LONG SHOT - DOWN THE CORRIDOR

          Purdy looks down to see Allison and the technician move
          Johnny in his wheelchair across the corridor into an
          examination room... Johnny never looks this way...

                                        DR. TRAN (CONT'D)
                        ...as a matter of fact, we're
                        just about to run an experiment
                        with him...

                                        PURDY
                          Experiment?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        To see if we can observe how his
                        brain processes these delusions...

                                        PURDY
                        You mind if I watch?

          Tran is not comfortable with that idea...

                                        DR. TRAN
                          Actually, it might be better if...

                                        PURDY
                                  (interrupting, charming)
                        I am the boy's legal guardian
                        after all... and I guess it would
                        be accurate to say I'm paying for
                        this experiment. 

          During the above, Allison moves up the corridor to Tran.

                                        ALLISON
                        We're ready, Doctor.

                                        PURDY
                          Afterwards, maybe Johnny and I
                        can sit down, begin to make some
                        plans for his future...

          Tran has to make a quick decision and doesn't want to
          pick a fight with Purdy.

                                        TRAN
                          Allison, Reverend Purdy will be
                        joining you in the observation
                        room.  Will you show him the way?          THE DEAD ZONE - ACT THREE - REV. 03/05/02 - RESHOOTS  38.



          Allison escorts Purdy in... he reacts as he looks through
            a two-way mirror into the examination room where the
          technician is attaching sensors to Johnny, still seated
          in his wheelchair... revealing the small room that has
          several medical monitors that measure various brain waves,
          heart rate, and so forth...

                                        PURDY
                          Goodness, what are all those wires
                        for...

          Allison sits at a computer console that coordinates all
          of the readings...

                                        ALLISON
                        We're going to monitor his brain
                          activity.

          She begins to turn on switches...

                                        PURDY
                        After what the boy's been through,
                        it's amazing there's any activity
                        left to measure.  It's a bonafide
                        miracle right before our eyes. *

          Through the window, the technician leaves when Dr. Tran
          enters the examination room with an elderly Vietnamese
          man (UNCLE TRAN, 66)...  Allison initiates the sensors
          which begin to pulse and record data... Purdy pulls his
          chair up beside her, one of the "team"...



          Johnny looks up at the elderly Vietnamese man... Dr. Tran
          remains emotionally detached...

                                        DR. TRAN (CONT'D)
                        Johnny, I'd like you to meet my
                        uncle, my mother's brother. 
                        Yesterday, you told me she was
                        alive, do you remember?
                                (Johnny acknowledges)
                        My uncle was with her in Saigon
                        when she died.  

          The doctor looks to Uncle Tran who nods sadly and
            remembers... he speaks softly with stumbling English...

                                        UNCLE TRAN
                        Many were killed that day.  I saw
                        my sister die.

                                        UNCLE TRAN (CONT'D)
                        In front of my eyes.

          His eyes fill with tears.  Johnny is as confused as anyone
          else about all this... he studies the old man...

                                        DR. TRAN (O.S.)
                        What you saw was not real, Johnny.
                        Your brain is struggling to
                          distinguish real sensory input
                        from these fantasies or dream
                          images...

          During Tran's speech, Johnny looks at his hand and, knowing
          the frightening consequences of what he's about to do,
          reaches out and touches the old man's hand... as he does --


          SCENE FREEZES AND THEN CONTINUES

          Pushing to Johnny as he studies the older man... 

                                        DR. TRAN (O.S.)
                                  (continuing)
                        ...This is probably the result of
                          a reduced blood flow... 

          But his voice grows fainter and is over-lapped by the
          SOUND OF EXPLOSIONS... as we cut from a close-up of Uncle
          Tran looking curiously at the strange patient...



          cries out in fluent Vietnamese...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (Vietnamese)
                        ...please, I have to go back... I
                        can't leave her there...

          Uncle Tran reacts with shock... tries to get his hand
          back... but Johnny won't release it...


  4545ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW

          as Purdy watches Johnny holding Uncle Tran's hand,
          continuing to yell in the strange language... the monitors
          show radical spikes in the sensor readings...

                        JOHNNY
                  (Vietnamese)UNCLE TRAN
              ...it's my sister... it's(Vietnamese, to Dr)

              back...tell me he speaks

                                and finally murmers)
                        'All the kings' horses and all
                        the kings' men... couldn't put
                        Johnny together again...'

          He can't watch any more of this.  He rises to leave.

                                        PURDY
                        Tell Doctor Tran that I don't
                        think it's a good idea to visit
                        with him.

                          tired...

          And as they approach the main reception area... a woman,
          wearing sunglasses, is standing by the front desk
            uncomfortably asking the receptionist for directions...

          And it's important to note that although they are
          interacting in this scene, her dialogue is still being
            delivered from the hospital.  The consequence of this
          plays out like this on film: she will visually interact
          with the fantasy environment but audibly interact only
          with Johnny.

                        The laundry put so much starch in
                        the collar I swear I can't find
                        the darn button hole...

          ...and she routinely helps him button the top button...
          she sighs, swallows hard, continuing her conversation
          with Johnny...

                                        SARAH
                                (hoarse)
                        The doctors said you wouldn't
                        come out of it... that you'd just
                        slip away... I... I couldn't wait,
                        Johnny.  I feel so... terrible
                        about it, so guilty...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you love him, Sarah?

          She tries to control her tears, tries to decide how to
          tell him, whether to lie... she takes the tie and snaps
          it onto his collar... her husband looks at her with
            affection...

                          Whattaya say we do a little
                          snowboarding tonight... there's
                        six inches of new powder on the
                          mountain...  

          Sarah's crying now although her husband doesn't see it...

                                        SARAH
                        He's a wonderful man.  And a
                          wonderful father.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You did the right thing, Sarah...

          As she finishes the tie and he kisses her cheek...

                        His name is Walt Bannerman, he's
                        the sheriff of Penobscot County...

          Johnny turns away from the kiss... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we should talk about
                          something else...

          When he looks up, Bannerman has vanished.

          Johnny reacts and...



          Tran stares at a faded photograph of his mother in Vietnam,
          his mind wondering if any of this can really be true...
          move to his computer to find a web site with the banner,

          Johnny clearly making progress now...



          As Purdy dressed in his colorful preaching robe enters
          the packed chapel holding the Bible under one arm we pan
          up over the door where simple lettering identifies this
          as "The Vera Smith Chapel"...



          Johnny emerges from his room walking, with great
          difficulty, with two canes... Elaine and Bruce watch with
          admiration at the end of the hall... as he looks up with
          pride at them, he stumbles and falls... Bruce and Elaine
          rush to help him up but before they touch him, he waves
          them off...



          Sarah stares out the window, thinking about Johnny...
          slow push to her face... in the background, her son, I
          guess we'll call him Johnny Jr, comes home from school...
          she puts on a smile for him...



          Shooting through the window to see the moving trees (note:
          the hospital was several hours drive away from the
            neighborhood)... moving down to see Bruce behind the wheel,
          Johnny next to him...  Johnny stares at the window, taking
          in the familiar setting...

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm only saying...

                        not driving my car.

                        Got to get back on the horse,

                        Not my horse.  I don't like your

          Johnny smiles.
