Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.
BILBO
(Calling)
Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
1296...a very good year, almost as old as
I am. It was laid down by my father. What
say we open one, eh?
Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.
BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I was expecting you some time last week.
Not that it matters, you come and go as
you please, always have done, always
will.

CONTINUED:
BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
that might be a little risky...
Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
no...we're alright...I've just found some
sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
it's enough.
(comes into view)
I could do you some eggs if you like?
Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.
GANDALF
Just tea, thank you.
BILBO
Oh..right.
You don't mind if...?
GANDALF
No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
knock on the front door.
MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.
BILBO
I'm not home.
Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.
BILBO (CONT'D)
I've got to get away from these
confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
all day, never giving me a moment's
peace. I want to see mountains
again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
find somewhere quiet where I can finish
my book...Oh, Tea!
GANDALF
So, you mean to go through with your
plan, then?
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
BILBO
Yes, yes...it's all inhand.
All the
arrangements are made.
GANDALF
Frodo suspects something.
BILBO
'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
some block headed Bracegirdle from
Hardbottle!
GANDALF
You will tell him, won't you?
BILBO
Yes, yes.
GANDALF
He's very fond of you.
BILBO
I know. He'd probably come with me if I
asked him. I think, in his heart,
Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
woods and the fields... little rivers.
Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
window.
BILBO (CONT'D)
I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
Gandalf sadly...
BILBO (CONT'D)
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
to feel it in my heart.
CLOSE ON:
Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.
BILBO (CONT'D)
I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
butter scraped over too much bread. I
need a holiday...a very long holiday and
I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
I mean not to.
CUT TO:
14.
Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.
BILBO
Old Toby, the finest weed in
Southfarthing!
Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Ohhhh,
(smiles)
Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
night to remember!
CUT TO:
The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.
ANGLE ON:
Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.
GANDALF
I suppose you think that was terribly
clever?
BILBO
Come on, Gandalf!
Did you see their
faces?
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
There are many magic rings in the world,
Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
used lightly.
BILBO
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're
probably right as usual.
GANDALF
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
BILBO
I'm leaving everything to him.
GANDALF
What about this ring of yours?
Is that
staying too?
Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.
BILBO
Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
surprise.
BILBO (CONT'D)
No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?
GANDALF
I think you should leave the Ring behind,
Bilbo. Is that so hard?
BILBO
Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it. It's
mine. I found it. It came to me!
ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.
GANDALF
There's no need to get angry.
BILBO
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
mine. My own, my precious.
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
Precious? It's been called that before,
but not by you.
BILBO
So? What business is it of yours what I
do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
shape and manner have suddenly changed.
GANDALF
I think you've had that ring quite long
enough.
BILBO
You want it for yourself!
Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room
GANDALF
Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
softens.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
Gandalf and hugs him.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
All you long years we've been
friends...trust me as you once did. Let
it go!
BILBO
You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
to Frodo.
Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.
BILBO (CONT'D)
It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
time.
GANDALF
Bilbo?
BILBO
Hmmm?
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED: (2)
GANDALF
The ring is still in your pocket.
Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.
BILBO
Oh, yes.
CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.
CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
BILBO (V.O.)
It's mine, my own, my precious.
GANDALF
(to himself)
Riddles in the dark.
FRODO (O.S.)
Bilbo! Bilbo!
Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.
GANDALF
(to himself)
My precious...precious..
FRODO
(quietly)
He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
the living room.
FRODO (CONT'D)
He talked for so long about leaving...I
didn't think he'd really do it.
GANDALF
(mutters to himself)
...my own.
FRODO
Gandalf?
Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.
GANDALF
Bilbo's ring.
Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...
GANDALF (CONT'D)
He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
left you Bag End...
Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
...along with all his possessions.
Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.
He hands it to Frodo.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED: (2)
GANDALF (CONT'D)
The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
starts to gather his things.
FRODO
Where are you going?
GANDALF
I have some things I must see to.
FRODO
What things?
GANDALF
Questions.
Questions that need
answering.
FRODO
You've only just arrived!
I don't
understand...
Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.
GANDALF
Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
safe.
Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.
ANGLE ON: THE ENVELOPE
The camera pushes in...the hum of the ring comes up on the
soundtrack. The camera pushes through the white paper to the
ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of BLACK SPEECH
can be heard.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: GANDALF
making is way down into the lower depths of the Citidel.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: Pages flipping as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls
and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on
one old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading.
GANDALF
(reading)
The year 3434 of the Second Age...here
follows the account of Isildur, High King
of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of
power.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE ON: ISILDUR, TRIUMPHANT, REACHES FOR THE ONE RING, HIS
EYES FIXATED ON IT.
GANDALF
(reading)
It has come to me...the ring of power!

(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF (CONT'D)
It shall be an heirloom of my
Kingdom...all those who follow in my
bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for
I will risk no hurt to the
GANDALF (CONT'D)
ring...it is precious to me, though I buy
it with great pain...
CLOSE ON: ELVISH LETTERING MARKS ON THE FADED OLD DOCUMENT
IN GANDALF'S HAND.
GANDALF
(reading)
The marking upon the band begin to
fade...the writing which at first was as
clear as red flame, has all but
disappeared...a secret now that only fire
can tell...
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON
bids the last of the Patron's "Goodnight"...Sam meets her
eyes for a moment as he and Frodo leave the inn.
26.
ANGLE ON:
FRODO enters Bag End...he immediately Pauses, sensing that
something is amiss. All is quiet...Frodo peers uneasily into
the darkened living room. SUDDENLY! A large figure looms out
of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a
startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his
Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia
blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from
much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt.
GANDALF
(urgent whisper)
Is it secret? Is it safe?
CUT TO:
Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. Gandalf,
suspicious, Alert. Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope
and tosses it into the fireplace!
FRODO
(bewildered)
What are you doing?
Flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring,
as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the
fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.
GANDALF
Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite
cool.
Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
What can you see? Can you see anything?
FRODO
Nothing...there's nothing.
Wait...
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
CLOSE ON: The Gold Band of the ring as fiery letters begin to
appear...a tiny inscription glows red...as if burning from
within.
GANDALF
...these are markings.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF...STILL...TENSE
FRO DO
It's some form of Elvish...I can't read
it.
GANDALF
(ominous)
There are few who can...the language is
that of Mordor, which I will not utter
here.
Mordor?
FRODO
GANDALF
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: The ring lies on Frodo's simple kitchen table.
GANDALF
This is the one ring forged by the dark
lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt
Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of
Sauron himself.
CLOSE ON: FRODO...STUNNED
FRODO
(quiet realization)
Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.
GANDALF
For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
awoken. It has heard its master's call.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF (CONT'D)
AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER
of BLACK SPEECH
emanates from the Ring.
Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing
the other has heard it.
FRODO
But he was destroyed...Sauron was
destroyed.
ANGLE ON: THE RING
lies between them on the table.
GANDALF
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
endured. His life force is bound to the
ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
ring to cover all the lands in the second
darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
all his thought is bent on it. For the
ring yearns, above all else, to return to
the hand of its master: they are one, the
ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
the Ring.
FRODO
Alright!
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: FRODO
hurriedly entering the living room.
FRODO
(thinking fast)
We put it away, we keep it hidden! We
never speak of it again. No one know
it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts
uncomfortably.
FRODO (CONT'D)
Do they, Gandalf?
Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly...
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
There is one other who knew that Bilbo
had the Ring. I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum, but the enemy found
him first.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: A teasing Glimpse of Gollum being tortured by the
Orcs. The wretched creature screams in pain.
GANDALF (V.O.)
I don't know how long they tortured
him...but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words.
GOLLUM
(screaming)
S...Shire! Baggins!
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: FRODO'S HORRIFIED FACE!
FRODO
Shire!
Baggins!
That will lead them
here!
CUT TO:
FRODO thrusts the ring at Gandalf.
FRODO
Take it!
Take it!
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
No, Frodo...
FRODO
You must take it.
GANDALF
You cannot offer me this ring.
FRODO
I'm giving it to you!
GANDALF
Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take
it, not even to keep it safe.
CLOSE ON: THE RING IN FRODO'S HAND...
GANDALF
Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good...but through
me, it would wield a power too great and
terrible to imagine.
FRODO
But it cannot stay in the Shire!
GANDALF
No, no it can't.
CLOSE ON: THE RING IN FRODO'S CLENCHED HAND.
FRODO
What must I do?
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: FRODO
throwing clothes into a knapsack...Gandalf watches him,
making plans...
GANDALF
You must leave, and leave quickly. Get
out of the Shire.
FRODO
Where?
Where shall I go?
GANDALF
Make for the village of Bree.
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Bree?
What about you?
GANDALF
I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of
the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food
into his knapsack.
FRODO
And the ring will be safe there?
GANDALF
I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any
answers. I must see the Head of my
Order. He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.
CUT TO:
Frodo is preparing to leave.
GANDALF
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins
behind you...for that name is not safe
outside the Shire. GANDALF helps FRODO
into his coat.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Travel only by day and stay off the road.
FRODO
(thinking)
I can cut across country easily enough.
Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage.
GANDALF
My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
creatures. You can learn all that there
is to know about their ways in a month,
and yet, after a hundred years, they can
still surprise you.
SUDDENLY!
A SOUND from outside.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Get down!
GANDALF FREEZES... he moves quietly towards the window, eyes
wide with tension. He raises his staff above the window, and
slams it down on the intruder. THERE IS A YELP OF PAIN!
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room...SAM GAMGEE
sprawls across the floor! He looks up in terror as Gandalf
looms over him.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
(angry)
Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have
you been eavesdropping?
SAM
I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir!
Honest. I was just cutting the grass
under the window there, if you follow
me...
GANDALF
It's a little late for trimming the
hedges, don't you think?
SAM
I heard raised voices...
GANDALF
What did you hear?
Speak!
SAM
(panicked)
Nothing important...that is, I heard a
good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord.
And something about the end of the world,
but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't
hurt me! Don't turn me into anything
unnatural!
GANDALF
No?
FRODO SMILES
GANDALF
Perhaps not. I've thought of a better
use for you.
CUT TO:
Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to
the side of the cavernous central chamber.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
SARUMAN
Sauron has regained much of his former
strength. He cannot yet take physical
form...but his spirit has lost none of
its potency. Concealed within his
fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
and flesh. You know of what I speak,
Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed
in flame.
GANDALF
(softly)
The eye of Sauron.
SARUMAN
He is gathering all evil to him.
SARUMAN (CONT'D)
Very soon he will have summoned an army
great enough to launch an assault upon
Middle earth.
GANDALF
You know this? How?
SARUMAN
I have seen it.
Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...
GANDALF
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.
SARUMAN
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
GANDALF
They are not all accounted for, the lost
seeing-stones...we do not know who else
may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth
back over the Palantir.
FLASH IMAGE: A FIERY EYE!
Saruman sits upon his throne.
(CONTINUED)
37.

SARUMAN
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving...the
Nine have left Minas Morgul.
GANDALF
(shocked)
The nine!
SARUMAN
They crossed the river Isen in
Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
black.
GANDALF
(alarmed)
They have reached the Shire? Saruman
shrugs...
SARUMAN
They will find the ring...and kill the
one who carries it.
Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.
SARUMAN (CONT'D)
You did not seriously think a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.
SARUMAN (CONT'D)
Against the power of Mordor, there can be
no victory. We must join with him,
Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
would be wise, my friend.
GANDALF
(deadly)
Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
wise abandon reason for madness?
At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED: (2)
SARUMAN
I gave you the chance of aiding me
willingly, but you have elected the way
of pain.
Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.
CUT TO:
Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.
Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.
FRODO
Excuse me.
BUTTERBUR
Good evening, little masters. If you're
seeking accommodation, we've got some
nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
Mr...ah...
FRODO
Underhill...my name's Underbill.
BUTTERBUR
Underhill?
Hmmmm.
FRODO
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
frowns...
BUTTERBUR
(Puzzled)
Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
(recognition)
Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
relief...Butterbur shakes his head.
BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
shocked.
SAM
(worried whisper)
What do we do now?
Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Sam, he'll be here.
He'll come.
Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.
PIPPIN
What's that?
MERRY
This, my friend, is a pint.
PIPPIN
It comes in pints?
I'm getting one!
Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.
SAM
You've had a whole half already. Merry
watches Pippin go.
A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.
SAM (CONT'D)
(tense)
That fellow's done nothing but stare at
you since we've arrived.
Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...
FRODO
Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
he?
BUTTERBUR
He's one of them Rangers; they're
dangerous folk they are, wandering the
wilds. What his right name is, I never
heard, but round here he's known as
Strider.
FRODO
(to himself)
Strider.
BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.
47.
CLOSE ON: FRODO
Sweat runs down his brow.
The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.
"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:
PIPPIN
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
over there...
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN
sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.
Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.
PIPPIN
(loudly)
Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
once removed, on his mother's side and my
third cousin twice removed on his
father's side...if you follow me.
Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.
FRODO
Pippin!
PIPPIN
Steady on, Frodo!
Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...
CLOSE ON:
The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.
CUT TO:
Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:
ANGLE ON:
FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.
VOICE OF SAURON
There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!
CUT TO:
Frodo is roughly pushed against the wall.
The Brooding
stranger looms over him.
STRIDER
You draw far too much attention to
yourself...Mr. Underhill
CUT TO:
Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider.
FRODO
What do you want?
STRIDER
A little more caution from you...that is
no trinket you carry.
FRODO
I carry nothing.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
STRIDER
Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
that is a rare gift.
FRODO
Who are you?
STRIDER
Are you frightened?
FRODO
Yes.
STRIDER
Not nearly frightened enough. I know
what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
of a noise in the corridor. Strider
deftly draws his sword.
The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.
SAM
(angry)
Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!
STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.
STRIDER
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
but that alone won't save you...You can
no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.

LOW ANGLE: the front door FLIES OPEN. The FOUR RINGWRAITHS
rush into the PRANCING PONY with WICKED SWORDS DRAWN. CLOSE

in TERROR.
INSERT: MERRY SNORING SOFTLY ON HIS PILLOW.
INSERT: PIPPIN stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep.
WIDE ON: the door creaks open...THE FOUR RINGWRAITHS silently
slide into the Hobbit's room. The LOOM above each bed,
raising their SHINING SWORDS ABOVE THE SLEEPING HOBBITS.
QUICK INSERT: Sam's eyes open wide. In unison, the RINGWRAITS
STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy.
Strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room.
Wide on: the RINGWRAITHS step back from the slashed beds in
triumph. CLOSE ON: a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal
nothing but a shredded pillow. The RINGWRAITHS SHRIEK WITH
RAGE!! INSERTS: Sam sits up with a start! Close on: Another
shredded pillow is revealed! More Shrieks of rage. INSERT:
PIPPIN AND MERRY wake with a start.
CUT TO:
WIDE ON: Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on
Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window,
peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo
across the courtyard from the Hobbits room.
FRODO
Where are they?
STRIDER
They were once men. Strider glances
quickly at Frodo, then looks away...

CONTINUED:
STRIDER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
Power. Blinded by their greed they took
them without question, one by one falling
into darkness and now they are slaves to
his will.
Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.
STRIDER (CONT'D)
They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
living or dead. At all times they feel
the presence of the ring...drawn to the
power of the one..they will never stop
hunting you.
CUT TO:
Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the
massive eye.
SARUMAN
(whisper)
The power of Isengard is at your command,
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: BLACK SPEECH FILLS THE ROOM...ADMIST THE
HARSH, GUTTURAL WORDS THE VOICE OF SARUMAN EMERGES.
SARUMAN
Build me an army worth of Mordor.
Saruman is seated as his ORC OVERSEER approaches.
ORC OVERSEER
What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What
does the eye command?
SARUMAN
We have work to do.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: GANDALF...lying unconscious on a cold obsidian
floor. He wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing...rising
onto his knees...lifting his head... Gandalf stands as the
camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of
Orthanc. He is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded
on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. Another whispering
wail rends the air. Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and
peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being
ripped from the ground by the ORCS. Gandalf looks on in
Horror as ORCS hack into the trunk with axes.
ANGLE ON:
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
SARUMAN stands in Rain looking out into the dark night...the
ORC overseer sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating with
exertion.
ORC OVERSEER
The trees are strong, my Lord.
Their
roots go deep.
SARUMAN
Rip them all down.
CAMERA CIRCLES SUMMIT: MORE AND MORE TREES are hauled down
and killed...as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair.
DISSOLVE TO:
The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.
CUT TO:
DELIRIOUS IMAGES AND SOUNDS....
ARWEN (V.O.)
What grace is given me, let it pass to
him. Let him be spared. Save him.
IMAGE: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares...Frodo squeezes his
eyes shut, gasping.
FRODO
(frightened)
Where am I?
A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound.
GANDALF (O.S.)
You are in the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o'clock in the morning on October the
twenty-fourth, if you want to know.
Frodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open
Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved
timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the
Vista of Fir Trees.
FRODO
(weak relief)
Gandalf!
64.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED...
softly puffing on his pipe.
He smiles at Frodo.
GANDALF
Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
here, too. A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid. You have
some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...
FRODO
What happened, Gandalf?
Why didn't you
meet us?
GANDALF
I'm sorry Frodo.
Close on: Gandalf... troubled.
His eyes drift away.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
I was delayed.
CUT TO:
Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf.
FRODO
Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his
attention to Frodo.
GANDALF
Nothing, Frodo...
Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.
He is overjoyed to find Frodo
awake.
SAM
Frodo!
Frodo!
Bless you, you're awake!!
GANDALF
Sam has hardly left your side.
SAM
We were worried about you--weren't we,
Mr. Gandalf?
GANDALF
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE
HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's
bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.
ELROND
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with
awe.
CUT TO:
ELROND
Isildur...hurry...follow me! IMAGES:
ELROND leads Isildur into the steaming
volcano.
ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
place it could be destroyed.
FLASH INSERT: ELROND AND ISILDUR STAND BEFORE THE FIRES OF
MT. DOOM.
ELROND
Cast it into the fire...destroy it!
CLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING.
ISILDUR
No.
Isildur turns and walks away
ELROND
Isildur!!
Elrond turns to Gandalf.
ELROND
It should have ended that day, but evil
was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
There's no strength left in the world of
Men. They're scattered, divided,
leaderless.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
There is one who could unite them, one
who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.
ELROND
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
CUT TO:
Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.
BOROMIR
(quiet awe)
The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
picks up the sword and gently touches the
Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
appears on Boromir's finger...
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
Still sharp.
Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
But no more than a broken heirloom.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
replaces the Broken blade, but it
clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
away, leaving Strider sitting alone.
Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.
ARWEN
Why do you fear the past? You are
Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
are not bound to his fate.
STRIDER
The same blood flows in my veins...the
same weakness...
(CONTINUED)

ARWEN
Your time will come. You will face the
same evil...and you will defeat it.

sway yet...not over you and not over me.
CUT TO:
Elrond addresses the council...
ELROND
Strangers from distant lands ... friends
of old. You have been summoned here to
answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it. You will unite...or
you will fall. Each race is bound to this
fate...this one doom...
Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.
ELROND (CONT'D)
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.
Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.
BOROMIR
(shocked)
So it is true!
LEGOLAS
(disbelief)
Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
GIMLI
(grim)
The doom of man!
BOROMIR
It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
blood of our people are your lands kept
safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
enemy...let us use it against him!
STRIDER
You cannot wield it. None of us can.
The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
has no other master. Boromir turns and
looks at Strider, coolly.
BOROMIR
And what would a ranger know of this
matter?
Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...
LEGOLAS
This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
son of Arathorn. You owe him your
allegiance.
Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.
BOROMIR
(quiet disbelief)
Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?
LEGOLAS
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
ARAGORN
(Elvish: with subtitles)
Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..
BOROMIR
Gondor needs no king.
GANDALF
Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.
ELROND
You have only one choice..the ring must
be destroyed.
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED: (2)
The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.
GIMLI
Then...what are we waiting for?
Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.
ELROND
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
of Gloin, by any craft that we
ELROND (CONT'D)
here possess. The ring was made in the
fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
be unmade. It must be taken deep into
Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came. One of you
must do this.
Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice
BOROMIR
One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
black gates are guarded by more than just
Orcs. There is evil there that does not
sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
fire and ash and dust...the very air you
breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
ten thousand men could you do this. It
is folly.
LEGOLAS
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
said? The ring must be destroyed.
GIMLI
And I suppose you think you're the one to
do it?
BOROMIR
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?
Gimli leaps to his feet!
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED: (3)
GIMLI
I will be dead before I see the Ring in
the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT
erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
slow
motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.
GIMLI (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Never trust an Elf!
CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.
GANDALF
Do you not understand? While we
bicker
among ourselves, Sauron's power
grows!
No one will escape it. You will
all be
destroyed, your homes burnt and
your
families put to the sword!
CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.
FRODO
I will take it...I will take it...I will
take the Ring to Mordor.
Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.
FRODO (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
rises to his feet.
GANDALF
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.
ARAGORN
If, by my life or death, I can protect
you, I will.
(kneels before Frodo)
...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED: (4)
LEGOLAS
And you have my bow.
GIMLI
And my axe.
Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.
BOROMIR
You carry the fate of us all, little one.
Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.
BOROMIR (CONT'D)
If this is indeed the will of the
Council, then Gondor will see it done.
Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.
SAM
(unseen)
Here!
A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!
SAM (CONT'D)
Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.
ELROND
No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
separate you...even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.
Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!
MERRY
Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
send us home tied up in a sack to stop
us.
PIPPIN
Anyway...you need people of intelligence
on this sort of
mission...quest...thing...
MERRY
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
78.
ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP
ELROND
(thoughtfully)
Nine companions ... so be it.
(announcing)
You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"
PIPPIN
Great.
Where are we going?
CUT TO:
Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.
BILBO
My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!
Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.
FRODO
It's so light!
BILBO
Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are
close...and it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.
Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
as a feather, and as hard as dragon
scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
on.
CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.
BILBO (CONT'D)
(entranced)
Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
moves toward him.
BILBO (CONT'D)
I should very much like to hold it again,
one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
eyes locked on the ring.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.
BILBO (CONT'D)
Oh!
BILBO (CONT'D)
(sad)
I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
this burden. I'm sorry for everything.
Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.
CUT TO:
The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.
GIMLI
So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
This, my friend, is the home of my
cousin, Balin...and they call this a
Mine...
(snorting)
A mine!
A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights
the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf
Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old
battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with
arrows and axes.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
BOROMIR
(grimly)
This is no mine...it's a tomb!
GIMLI
(in horror)
Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
crude arrow out of a skeleton.
LEGOLAS
Goblins!
The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.
BOROMIR
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should
never have come here.
With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.
GANDALF
(ominous)
We now have but one choice...we must face
the long dark of Moria. Be on your
guard...there are older and fouler things
than the Orcs in the deep places of the
world.
CUT TO:
WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.
GANDALF
Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
the other side. Let us hope that our
presence will go unnoticed.
They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.
CUT TO:
The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.
GANDALF
I have no memory of this place.
LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.
CLOSE ON: FRODO
He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.
PIPPIN
Are we lost?
(CONTINUED)
89.

MERRY
No. I don't think we are.
Shhhh,
Gandalf's thinking.
PIPPIN
Merry!
MERRY
What?
PIPPIN
I'm hungry.
Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.
FRO DO
(whispers)
There's something down there.
GANDALF
(quietly)
It's Gollum.
FRODO
Gollum!
GANDALF
He's been following us for three days.
TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.
FRODO
(disbelieving)
He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?
GANDALF
Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
Ring has drawn him here...he will never
be rid of his need for it. He hates and
loves the ring, as he hates and loves
himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
the ring came to him, before it drove him
mad.
Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED: (2)
FRODO
(grim)
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
had the chance.
GANDALF
Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
hand. Many that live deserve death, and
some that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Do not be too eager to deal out death in
judgment...even the very wise cannot see
all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
has some part to play yet, for good or
ill, before this is over. The pity of
Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
FRODO
I wish the ring had never come to me...I
wish none of this had happened.
GANDALF
So do all who live to see such times, but
that is not for them to decide. All we
have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given to us. There is a note
of finality in Gandalf's voice.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
which case, you also were meant to have
it...and that is an encouraging thought,
(sudden brightness)
Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
scramble to their feet.
MERRY
(relieved)
He's remembered!
GANDALF
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose!
(laughs)
Ye s...
91.
The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...
GALADRIEL
Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
taps his staff...for a brief moment a
light
blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.
Great shadows
spring up and flee...
GANDALF
Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
sight of a vast roof, far above
their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.
SAM
Well, there's an eye opener and no
mistake!
Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...
GANDALF
Gimli!!
CUT TO:
Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...
GIMLI
No...no...oh, no!
Gimli sobs.
Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
feared.
Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...
LEGOLAS
(urgent whisper to Argorn)
We must move on, we cannot linger.
GANDALF
(reading)
"They have taken the Bridge and the
second hall: we have barred the
gates...but cannot hold them for
long...the ground shakes...drums in the
deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
are coming."
Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!
Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.
GANDALF
(angry)
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
time and rid us of your stupidity!
ANGLE ON:
PIPPIN, CHASTENED.
They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...
SAM
(worried)
Mr. Frodo!

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!
LEGOLAS
Orcs !
ARAGORN
(to the hobbits)
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.
Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.
BOROMIR
They have a cave troll!
Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.
GIMLI
(yelling)
Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
Moria who still draws breath!
BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.
SAM
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.
FRODO
Aragorn!
Aragorn!
(CONTINUED)
94.

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.
ARAGORN
(shocked yell)
Frodo!!
The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.
SAM
He's alive!
FRODO
I'm alright. I'm not hurt.
ARAGORN
You should be dead. That spear would've
skewered a wild boar!
GANDALF
I think there's more to this hobbit than
meets the eye.
Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.
The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."
GIMLI
Mithril! You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM
the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.
GANDALF
To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf
Chamber.
GANDALF
This way!
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.
BOROMIR
What is this new devilry?
A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...
GANDALF

A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
This foe is beyond any of you!
(urgent yell)
Run! Quickly!
CUT TO:
The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.
GANDALF
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is
near.
Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Do as I say; swords are no more use here.
THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.
GIMLI
Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
through the wall and spreads its vast
wings.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
GIMLI (CONT'D)
It swoops down past the Fellowship,
disappearing into a flaming pit!
CUT TO:
The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with
fissures that spit flame.
GANDALF
(yelling)
Over the bridge! Fly!
They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:
GANDALF (CONT'D)
You cannot pass!
FRODO
(alarmed yell)
Gandalf!
GANDALF
(yelling)
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.
GANDALF (CONT'D)
Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
at Gandalf with its Sword of
flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!
GANDALF (CONT'D)
(booming)
You shall not pass!! The Balrog places
one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and
Boromir race forward, swords drawn.
GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips
FRODO
(screaming)
Gandalf!
GANDALF
(fierce)
Fly, you fools!
CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries
out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.
FRODO
No!
ARAGORN
Gandalf!
They rush towards an archway.
CUT TO:
100.
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP
step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...
CELEBORN
Eight there are, yet nine there were set
out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
him.
Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.
GALADRIEL (V.O.)
(softly aloud)
...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
looks to Aragorn.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
The Quest stands upon the edge of a
knife. Stray but a little and it will
fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
remains while the company is true.
Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
now and rest for you are weary with
sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
turn to Frodo...her voice fades.
GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
Tonight you will sleep in peace.
(whispered v/o)
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON:
FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:
GALADRIEL as she is on the other
side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...one who has seen the eye.
CUT TO:
101.
Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.
SARUMAN (V.O.)
(smiles)
They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
ruined and terrible form of life. And
now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
Whom do you serve?
LURTZ
(gutteral rasp)
Saruman.
QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.
SARUMAN
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
are found. You do not know pain. You do
not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
Saruman turns to Lurtz.
SARUMAN (CONT'D)
(coldly)
One of the Halflings carries something of
great value...bring him to me...alive and
unspoiled...kill the others.
