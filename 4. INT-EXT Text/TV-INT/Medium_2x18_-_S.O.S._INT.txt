                  So...business or personal?

                                DINOVI
                Try to guess.

  He reads her take-no-prisoners demeanor...and sighs.

                OK.  What can I do for you, Madame Deputy 
                Mayor?

                                DINOVI
                I have questions...about Allison Dubois.

                              SCANLON
                What about her?

                                DINOVI
                Exactly.  What is it about Allison Dubois 
                that we re airlifting her to roof tops in 
                the middle of the night on the city dime?  
                That when our manpower is stretched to 
                the breaking point on a city-wide 
                dragnet, we re pulling off three officers 
                to guard her house around the clock? 

  Scanlon is momentarily thrown for a loop by DiNovi s 
    questioning, but quickly begins to dissemble...

                              SCANLON
                These things weren t done on a whim, 
                  Lynn...without reasons...

                                DINOVI
                If you re gonna give me the same run-
                around that I ve gotten from the District 
                Attorney let me save you a step.  I ve 
                heard it. I m not buying it. And I m NOT 
                leaving until I get some answers. 

  Scanlon shrugs, then heads for the door.

                              SCANLON
                Well feel free to wait right here.  I ve 
                got a serial killer to catch.

  DiNovi jumps up, and gets in right in Scanlon s face.

                                DINOVI
                Fine.  What if, from here on out, it s 
                the Mayor asking the questions? We ll see 
                who answers first. You, Devalos, or maybe 
                the people he gets to replace you both.

                              SCANLON

  Scanlon gives her a hard stare, but DiNovi doesn t back

                                DINOVI
                I know everything.  And if you think I 
                had a problem with the city keeping a 
                psychic on the payroll, just imagine how 
                  I reacted when he told me that our serial 
                killer is supposedly psychic too.

  ...and he points through the open door to...

  A SQUAD CAR

  ...some thirty feet behind him inside the parking 
    structure...several UNIFORM COPS stand guard, weapons at the 
  ready as others lift a handcuffed Sonny Wayne from the face-
  down arrest position, then get him on his feet and walk him 
  into the squad car...

  ON ALLISON

  ...trying hard to absorb the surreal sight in front of her... 

                              ALLISON
                But...
                      (she can t seem to voice 
                        anything else)
                I don t understand.

  Scanlon is nervously eyeing Allison s right hand...

                              SCANLON
                Before I say anything...why don t you 
                hand over that fire extinguisher?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      68.

    ...Allison hands it over as Scanlon struggles to piece 
    everything together for her...

                              SCANLON
                Now don t, please.  Don t get mad.  The 
                whole thing hinged on you not knowing.

                              ALLISON
                Lee, what are you talking about?

                              SCANLON
                It was all a set up, Allison.
                      (a self-congratulatory grin)
                Pretty good one too.

                              ALLISON
                What was a set up?

                              SCANLON
                  Everything.  DiNovi s phone call, the 
                broken elevator, the locked doors in the 
                  stairwell.  After all the threats, we 
                figured if you were in a tight spot, he d 
                come after you.
                      (gauging her reaction)
                So we led you here.  Jammed your phone. 
                Made sure you were good and scared.

                              ALLISON
                Good and scared?!?  I was jumping out of 
                my skin!!

                              SCANLON
                Allison, we had guys everywhere.  I had 
                sharp shooters on all the nearby roofs.  
                We had this whole place covered.  As soon 
                as he showed up, we nabbed him.  You were 
                safe.  I made sure of it.

                              ALLISON
                Safe?  You think dangling me like a 
                porkchop in front of a serial killer is 
                safe?

                              SCANLON
                It was the only way, Allison.  And it 
                worked.  It s over.
                      (off Allison)
                You can t argue with success.

    ...Allison wrestles with that, not sure whether to feel 
  relieved or hurt...but before she can speak...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      69.

  DINOVI

  ...walks toward them, speaking into her cellphone...

                                DINOVI
                Yes, sir, I saw it myself, he is 
                  definitely in custody...absolutely.
                      (clicking off, then, to 
                        Allison)
                It s great, isn t it?  I think we re 
                going to make the ten o clock news.

  ...and when Allison doesn t say anything...

                              SCANLON
                      (jumping in)
                That is great.

                                DINOVI
                      (to Allison)
                I want you to know you did a great job.
                      (as an afterthought)
                And I m glad you re safe.
                      (then)
                OK, I gotta run.  The stations will want 
                  interviews, and I need to make sure 
                  everything goes smoothly.
                      (but before she turns to go)
                Oh, Allison...that thing we talked about 
                on the phone?  Don t worry about it.
                      (with a flick of her hand)
                Like it never happened.

  ...and off she goes...

  ON ALLISON

    ...drained of all her energy, all her emotion, all the 
  feeling in her body...just completely spent...

                              SCANLON
                Your secret s safe.  I trust her.
                      (off Allison s silence)
                Allison?  Are you OK?

                              ALLISON
                I don t know.  Is that it?  Are there any 
                other secret plans that involve me?

                              SCANLON
                That s it.

                Good.  Then I m going home.

    ...Allison turns to go...then she pauses...looking up at the 
  stairs, then at Scanlon...still not knowing whether to thank 
  him or deck him...so she just shakes her head and turns 
    away...and off Scanlon feeling like he just ducked a 
  bullet...

                                                                              CUT TO:

    BRIDGETTE6969

    ...sitting in PJs in the living room as we go WIDER to reveal 
  that she is surrounded by a gaggle of EIGHT YEAR OLDS, all in 
  PJs as well...all of them watching the television as an 
  ANIMATED MOVIE comes to an end...

                                BRIDGETTE
                That was awesome...you guys want to watch 
                it again?

  ...but one of the eight-year-olds rears up on Bridgette, a 
    dissatisfied expression on her face...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #1
                What about the brownies, Bridgette?

    ...Bridgette stares at her friend, caught in the 
    headlights...

                                BRIDGETTE
                  Brownies?  I...didn t...

  ...and it s like a switch has been thrown, because all the 
  other eight-year-olds start turning on Bridgette...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #2
                  Yeah...you said there d be brownies...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #3
                Where are the brownies?

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #4
                We want brownies!

                Is everything OK?
                      (off Allison)
                Someone stuck somewhere?  Someone 
                injured?  Something going to crash into 
                some other thing?

    ...Allison starts to get up off the bed...

                  No...it s not that.
