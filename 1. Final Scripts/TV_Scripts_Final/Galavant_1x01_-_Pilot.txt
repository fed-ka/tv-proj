                                          8/2/13      A NOTE FOR THE READER:

      This script will read a little differently.

      While still a comedy, the world of this piece is a classic 
       fairy tale  one... filled with heroes and princesses and 
      villains and maybe even a dragon or two.  Think  The Princess 
      Bride  meets  Monty Python  meets classic Disney.  And 
      because of that familiar Disney construct... Alan Menken s 
      musical numbers will sprinkle in organically throughout.  
      They aren t written yet, obviously, but these  songs  will be 
      placed into the script, with the story points covered in 
      prose.

      Hopefully this prose can give the reader a sense of the 
      material that will be covered in the songs.  And if not, 
      hopefully having written the word  prose  three times in this 
      opening  note to the reader  will make this script seem more 
      highbrow than it actually is.

      We start with, you guessed it...

      A BACKSTORY SONG:  GALAVANT 

      Once upon a time, there was a hero named Galavant.

      ON GALAVANT (28):

      Basically the coolest guy ever.  Galavant s got a sword, and 
      a horse, and a Ewan McGregor-esque head of hair.

      A lyric might go something like:

      Galavant was gallant/Galavant was class/If you messed with 
      Galavant/He d surely beat your ass.

      ON MADALENA (25):

      A knockout.  She s got a killer dress, and a killer smile, 
      and she too has a Ewan McGregor-esque head of hair (if Ewan 
      McGregor grew it out for a while).

      Lyric:

      If there s one thing Gal d been missing/It d been a gal to 
      share his den/But then came Madalena/The Kingdom s only 
      perfect ten.

      ON GALAVANT AND MADALENA:

      As they fall madly in love.  They do all the things 15th 
      century youngsters do when they fall in love: frolic in 
      forests, dance at dances, kiss for abnormally long periods of 
      time.         2.


      It s clear they re going to get married and have really   
        good-looking babies together.

      ON KING RICHARD (40 s):

      He has a mustache which indicates that he is mean.  And as it 
      turns out, he is.

      Lyric:

      There was only one real problem/A king from a nearby 
      land/Took notice of Madalena/And asked her for her hand.

      You can imagine where this is going: the King is into 
      Madalena, she s not into him, so the King (and his main 
      henchman Gareth, 50 s, badass), kidnap Madalena.

      ON GALAVANT:

      Discovering Madalena, gone.  Devastated.  He picks up a 
      sword, determined to rescue her: wherever she may be.

      Lyric:

      So that s our basic set-up/One man would soon prove the 
      greater/And that s where we pick up our story/Two or three 
      weeks later.

      INT. CASTLE - TWO OR THREE WEEKS LATER

      MADALENA paces back and forth across the room.  She looks 
      miserable.  She s wearing an ORNATE WEDDING DRESS.

      She looks out the high castle window.

      DOWN BELOW

      It s quiet.  GUARDS chat and mill about, casual.

      BACK INSIDE

      Madalena SIGHS.  Just then...

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Is everything alright, my Princess?

      Madalena wheels around.  Before her stands:

      KING RICHARD ENMIAS (still mustached, still mean).

                                  MADALENA
                          (obedient)
                    Yes, my King.         3.


                                  KING RICHARD
                    I would think so.  In just moments we 
                    will marry and you will instantly 
                    become the richest and most powerful 
                    woman in the land.

                                  MADALENA
                    Yes, my King.  Very exciting.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    And then tonight, you will join me in 
                    my bed.

                                  MADALENA
                    Yes, my King.

      A beat.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    We re going to do it.

                                  MADALENA
                    Yes.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    We re not going to just sit in bed and 
                    open gifts and talk about how fun the 
                    wedding was, okay?  We re doing it.

                                  MADALENA
                    Of course, my King.

      He nods, feeling better.  Takes a little bow.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    My lady.

      He EXITS.  At the door he pulls his henchman GARETH aside.

      Gareth has a shaved head and one HUGE SCAR underlining each 
      eye.  He s Scottish.  He s scary as hell.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Have you found Galavant yet?

                                  GARETH
                    We re working on it.

      The King grabs Gareth by the neck, pushes him against the 
      wall.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Work harder.         4.


      They stay like this for a long beat.  Gareth glares.  The 
      King immediately realizes, lowers his hands.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                          (instantly emotional)
                    I m sorry, I just know Galavant s 
                    going to show up here and ruin my 
                    wedding day, Gareth.  I really think 
                    she likes him more.  Do you think she 
                    likes him more?

                                  GARETH
                    Yes.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Why?  Why do you think that?

                                  GARETH
                    Because you had to kidnap her to get 
                    her to marry you.

      The King notices other GUARDS snickering, steadies himself.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (strongly)
                    Just find Galavant.
                          (then, whispering)
                    Please.  I mean, it d be really great 
                    if you could find him. 

      The King storms out for show.

      RE-CUE OPENING SONG: GALAVANT!

      INT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

      Chased by a SMALL ARMY of the King s men, GALAVANT weaves his 
      ways through trees.  He rides a beautiful BLACK HORSE.

      Through the forest, he weaves.  Two GUARDS descend on him 
      from either side.  Without breaking his horse s stride, 
      Galavant KNOCKS OFF BOTH GUARDS from their horses.

      And not only can Galavant defeat half an army by himself... 
      he can SING while doing it!  He picks up the OPENING SONG...

      Lyric:

      I m a man of action/Don t need to rave and rant/True love 
      won t be denied here/Not from Galavant!

      He s so cool, TWO CHASING GUARDS pick up the chorus!         5.


                                  GUARDS
                          (singing)
                    Galavant!  He s Galavant!

                                  GALAVANT
                          (re: them singing)
                    Hey, thanks for that, guys.

                                  GUARD #1
                    You re welcome.  We re big fans.  
                    Plus, it s a really catchy son--

      BAM, BAM.  Galavant disposes both of them with his sword.  
      Takes off.  The music swells.

      EXT. CASTLE - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

      Galavant nears the castle.  He gets off his horse, grabs his 
      sword, begins marching toward the castle.

                                  GALAVANT
                          (top of lungs)
                      MADALENA!!!

      INT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

      Madalena jumps, picks up the SONG!

                                  MADALENA
                          (singing)
                      Galavant!?

      EXT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

      A man on a mission, Galavant marches toward the castle, 
      discarding guards one by one with minimal effort.  The uber-
      steady uber-hero.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Madalena!

      INT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

      Madalena runs to the window.

                                  MADALENA
                          (singing)
                    Galavant!

      Behind her, the door bursts open.  KING RICHARD and GARETH 
      RUSH INTO THE CHAMBER, looking concerned.

      DOWN BELOW         6.


      Galavant smiles.  He grabs a vine, hanging from the castle 
      and begins climbing.  Gravity is no match for this man.  With 
      great skill and fluidity, he crests the tower and ENTERS THE 
      WINDOW...

      INT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

      Galavant sees Madalena in full and lights up.

                                  GALAVANT
                    My lady.

                                  MADALENA
                    My man.

      He smiles.  But then the camera shifts around her, revealing:

      GARETH standing across the room, ready for a fight.  King 
      Richard hides behind Gareth s wide shoulders.

      Galavant and Gareth exchange greetings.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Gareth.

                                  GARETH
                    Galavant.

      Galavant turns to King Richard.  The King nods.  Gareth 
      gathers his sword to advance but then:

                                  GALAVANT
                    Alright, hold on.  Now, Gareth and I 
                    can surely fight all night to an even 
                    draw if that s what you want.  Hell, 
                    you can send all your men to help him 
                    if you so desire.  But I ll fend them 
                    all off.  Because here s the thing:

      Galavant lays down his sword.

                                  GALAVANT (CONT D)
                    I love her, Richard.  She is the first 
                    thing I think of in the morning, and 
                    the last thing I think of in the eve.  
                    And you can offer her great fame, and 
                    you can offer her great fortune, but 
                    only I can offer her great love.  And 
                    that is what she chooses.

                                  MADALENA (O.S.)
                      Actually...

      Galavant turns.  Madalena stands there, sheepish.         7.


                                  MADALENA (CONT D)
                    Gal... I m sorry.  I just... I don t 
                    know... I ve been thinking a lot about 
                    it since he kidnapped me and... I m 
                    gonna go with the fame and the 
                    fortune.  It just seems like an easier 
                    life, you know?  I m really sorry.  I 
                    hope we can be friends.

      And just like that, all the wind goes out of Galavant.  
      Literally.  Gareth punches him in the stomach, sending the 
      stunned Galavant to his knees.

      He can t even talk.  His whole world has suddenly turned on 
      its axis.

      King Richard s boots CLOMP against the floor as he 
      approaches.

      Gareth hands Richard his SWORD, butt side up.  Richard nods, 
      smiles.

                                  KING RICHARD
                      Goodnight, sweet Prince.

      He SLAMS the BUTT OF THE SWORD into Galavant s head.  But 
      Richard is a pussy and it doesn t knock Galavant out.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Dammit to hell!  Gareth, would you 
                    just do it please?

      Gareth shrugs, grabs the sword, and delivers the blow.

                                  GARETH
                    G night, Wanker.

      BAM!  Everything goes BLACK.

      CHYRON: FIVE YEARS LATER

      INT. GALAVANT S HOUSE - MORNING

      A 15th Century run-down bachelor pad.  Dishes everywhere.  
      The place hasn t been cleaned in years.

      And neither has Galavant.  He s unshaven, uncleaned, and he s 
      put on a lot of weight since we last saw him.

      It s morning.  He s drinking.  Heavily.

      The mighty has officially fallen.         8.


      A scrawny young man ENTERS.  This is Galavant s squire, SID 
      (23).  Think the kind of Jewish that non-Jews get a kick out 
      of.  Think Jay Baruchel.

                                  SID
                    Good morning, Sir.

      Sid opens the shades, lets some light in.  Galavant GROANS.  
      Sid takes the bottle of booze out of Galavant s hand.

                                  SID (CONT D)
                    I see we re getting an early start 
                    this morning.

      Sid puts away the bottle, starts tidying up.

                                  GALAVANT
                    What do you want, Sid?

      Sid turns, takes a deep breath, addresses Galavant formally.

                                  SID
                    Sir, when you hired me to be your 
                    squire, it was the most exciting thing 
                    to ever happen to me.  Best squireship 
                    in the land, my parents completely 
                    plotzed.  But ever since Madalen--

                                  GALAVANT
                          (sharply)
                    Don t say her name.

      Sid re-thinks.

                                  SID
                    Ever since... that happened... you ve 
                    not been yourself and...
                          (then)
                    You need a job, Sir.  You re 
                      completely broke.  You can t afford me 
                    anymore.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I ll write you a letter of reference.

                                  SID
                    You can t afford this place.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Never liked the layout.

                                  SID
                    You literally cannot afford another 
                    bottle of drink.         9.


      This gives Galavant pause.

                                  SID (CONT D)
                    There is someone here to see you.  
                    She s waiting outside and she brings 
                    with her an opportunity.  I would beg 
                    you to meet with her.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I m not going to--

                                  SID
                    And here she is!

      Sid opens the door.  In walks a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (27).  
      Unlike Magdalena, her beauty is more real, less practiced.  
      She s tough, athletic.  Think Jennifer Lawrence.  I m sure we 
      can get her.

                                  SID (CONT D)
                    May I present, the Princess Isabella 
                    Maria Lucia Elisabetta of Valencia--

                                  GALAVANT
                    That s a mouthful.  Speaking of which.

      He retrieves his bottle, pours a drink.  Isabella looks at 
      Sid, confused.  Sid smiles ( that crazy guy ).

                                  ISABELLA
                          (slight accent)
                    Squire, excuse us.

      Sid bows, nods at Galavant ( don t blow this ) and exits.

                                  GALAVANT
                    It s not a great time, Princess.

      Isabella looks around the shithole, confused.

                                  ISABELLA
                    You are Galavant?  Slayer of dragons, 
                    protector of innocent, defender of the 
                    less fortunate?

                                  GALAVANT
                      Galavant s fine.  The rest of it never 
                    fits on the business cards.

      She looks him over, confused.

                                  ISABELLA
                    Sir Galavant, I have traveled long and 
                    far to seek your favor.  
                                  (MORE)         10.

                                  ISABELLA (CONT'D)
                    Four months ago, my peaceful Kingdom 
                    of Valencia fell under attack from a 
                    rival land.  My people were taken 
                    captive, my entire family either 
                    killed or imprisoned--

                                  GALAVANT
                    Terrible, just terrible.  Well, you ve 
                    got a nice way about you, I m sure 
                    you ll land on your feet.  Nice 
                    meeting you, door s on the wall.

      She doesn t move.

                                  ISABELLA
                    My Kingdom is...
                            (correcting)
                    Was a peaceful nation, but it was also 
                    a wealthy one.  Before being captured, 
                    my father hid me in the cellar and 
                    handed me the priceless Jewel of 
                    Valencia.  He told me that if I found 
                    chance of escape, I should travel 
                    here, to find Galavant.  He said only 
                    Galavant could save us.

      She holds forth a BURLAP BAG.  Removes the stunning JEWEL OF 
      VALENCIA.

                                  ISABELLA (CONT D)
                    I hid in that cellar for months, as my 
                    family was slaughtered and imprisoned 
                    above me.  I now offer you this jewel, 
                    all my country has left to offer, if 
                    you will travel with me to Valencia 
                    and help me dispose of our invaders.

      She gets down on her knee.

                                  ISABELLA (CONT D)
                    I throw myself at your mercy, Sir 
                    Galavant.  Please: save my people.

      Galavant burps.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I m sorry, I got distracted... what 
                    did you say after I said  nice meeting 
                    you, door s on the wall? 

      She looks up, stunned.         11.


                                  ISABELLA
                    Who are you?  Because the man before 
                    me is certainly not the man of legend.  
                    The man they sing songs of.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Oh, I most certainly am.

      CUE SONG: (GALAVANT REPRISE).  This is a sadder take on the 
       Galavant  song that we opened with.

      The song is basically a duet: Isabella reminding Galavant of 
      his former glories, Galavant responding by explaining his 
      current state of affairs:

      Lyric:

      ISABELLA: Galavant slays dragons/Brings comfort to the 
      poor/Galavant would never/Show the needy to the door.

      GALAVANT: Galavant is broken/The saddest man around/He 
      carries with him heartache/And an extra twenty pounds.

      The song ends... Isabella storms out.

      EXT. GALAVANT S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Isabella storms past a hopeful Sid.  Sid s face drops when he 
      sees the look on her face.

                                  ISABELLA
                    That man is an animal!

                                  SID
                    Wait!  Princess Isabella Maria Lu...
                          (then)
                    Lucia?  Was it Lucia?  Something -ia 
                    of Valencia!
                          (then)
                    Princess!

      As she storms off, we focus in on the Princess of Valencia s 
      outraged, flushed face and we...

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

      The Princess of Valencia s face (dirtier, more worn) as TEXT 
      comes across the screen:

      CHYRON: CASTLE OF VALENCIA. 2 MONTHS EARLIER.         12.


      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE CELLAR - DAY

      Exactly as she described to Galavant: Isabella hides in a 
      barren cellar from her captors, listening to voices above.

      The voices are slightly muffled but still audible.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Orange.

                                  VOICE #2(O.S.)
                    Orange who?

      We PAN UP, through the floor, into...

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE GRAND HALL - DAY

      A really handsome JESTER (25), in full costume, does a  set  
      in front of our old bad guys: King Richard, the now  Queen  
      Madalena, Gareth, and assorted SOLDIERS and COURT MEMBERS.

                                  JESTER
                          (again, flat)
                    Orange.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (bored)
                    Orange who?

                                  JESTER
                    Orange you glad I didn t say banana 
                    again?

      Silence.  No one laughs.  Except...

                                  MADALENA
                          (clapping)
                      Wonderful!  Another wonderful routine, 
                    Jester!
                          (then)
                    Wasn t he wonderful, Husband?

                                  KING RICHARD
                    I m not seeing it, Baby.

                                  MADALENA
                          (annoyed)
                    Perhaps his humor flies over your head 
                    then.

                                  KING RICHARD
                     Orange you glad I didn t say banana 
                    again?  I think I followed the thread.         13.


      The King turns to Gareth.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    I don t know what she sees in him.

      Gareth watches as Madalena makes secretive goo-goo eyes at 
      the handsome Jester.  The Jester secretly blows her a kiss.

                                  GARETH
                    No idea, my King.

      Madalena stands.

                                  MADALENA
                    I will go compliment the Jester.  And 
                    while I do, Husband, perhaps you can 
                    make some progress convincing the King 
                    and Queen of Valencia to tell you 
                    where their jewel is hidden.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    I ve tried everyth--

                                  MADALENA
                    Yes, well, I did not travel across an 
                    ocean to invade a Kingdom, take it 
                    over, only to fail to obtain what we 
                    came here for.
                          (then, quietly)
                    Galavant would not have stood for 
                    this.

      The King s face drops.  He stands.  Looks his wife in the 
      eye.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    What did you just say?

      She matches his intensity.

                                  MADALENA
                    I said:
                          (then, in his face)
                    Galavant.  Would.  Not.  Have.  Stood.  
                    For.  This.

      She breaks her death stare.

                                  MADALENA (CONT D)
                    Find me the Jewel, would you, dear?

      She walks off, calling after the Jester.         14.


                                  MADALENA (CONT D)
                    Oh Jester, join me in my chamber, 
                    would you?  I d love to hear a little 
                    more about how you craft a joke.

      The King is left with Gareth.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (blind)
                    She really gets a kick out of that 
                    damned jester.  Maybe it is going over 
                    my head.

                                  GARETH
                          (knowing)
                    Oh, it s going over your head alright.

      King Richard slumps.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Oh Gareth!  I try so hard to please 
                    her.  I invade a Kingdom for a jewel, 
                    I respect her vow of chastity--

      Gareth rolls his eyes.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    And yet every day I have to hear it, 
                    over and over again: 
                          (imitating)
                     Galavant would not stand for this. 

      CUE SONG:  IT AIN T EASY BEING KING 

      The basic idea: no matter what King Richard does, the threat 
      of Madalena leaving him for Galavant is always on his mind.

      Lyric:

      I m a King by birthright/I control half of Japan/But all I do 
      is worry/She still loves another man.

      By the time the song ends, King Richard is in a state of 
      complete emotional distress.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    I never should have let Galavant go 
                    that day.  I felt bad for him.  She 
                    really blind-sided the poor bastard.  
                    But I have not slept solidly in five 
                    years.  And I will not sleep until I 
                    know he is dead.         15.


                                  GARETH
                    Rumor has it, he s become a drunkard.  
                    But he is still the greatest warrior 
                    in five Kingdoms, Sir.  Men follow him 
                    anywhere.  To attack Galavant on his 
                    own turf would lead to certain defeat.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (little boy)
                    I know!  Darn it!  So frustrating!

      The King stands.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Get me the King and Queen of Valencia.  
                    They are telling us where that jewel 
                    is.

      He storms off, stops.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                     Orange you glad I didn t say banana 
                    again?   It s not--

                                  GARETH
                    Not funny at all, Sir.

      The King nods, agreeing.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Let s go find her that stupid jewel.

                                                                              PAN DOWN:

      BACK THROUGH THE FLOOR to the hidden Isabella - who nervously 
      clutches the Jewel (in its burlap bag) to her chest.

                                                                    FLASH FORWARD TO:

      THE JEWEL.  Still in that burlap bag, now sitting on a table.  
      We are back to the present day in...

      INT. GALAVANT S HOMETOWN TAVERN - EVENING

      Isabella sits at a table in the corner of the tavern with the 
      bag.  She s sadly nursing a beer.

      She looks across the room, watching...

      GALAVANT.

      He s sitting at his usual spot at the bar, half-cocked.         16.


                                  GALAVANT
                    Tommy!  Another please.

      The BARTENDER approaches.

                                  TOMMY
                    Sorry, Gal.  Gonna have to cut you 
                    off.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Tommy, I m fine.  I m not riding, I 
                    walked.

                                  TOMMY
                    No, it s just...
                          (then)
                    They cut you off, Gal.  You haven t 
                    paid your tab in months.  Until you 
                    do... I m sorry.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Tommy!  Come on!  It s me!  Gal!  I--

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey, Gal.  C mon.  You re embarrassing 
                    yourself, man.
                          (then)
                    Get it together.

      Tommy walks off to another customer.

      ON GALAVANT:

      At a real low point.  He looks at his empty glass.  Catches 
      his puffy reflection.  What has he done to himself?

      And then... through the reflection in his glass he sees, 
      across the tavern...

      ISABELLA.  She quickly looks away when he catches her eye.

      Galavant SIGHS, stands, approaches her:

                                  GALAVANT
                    Can I buy you a drink?

                                  ISABELLA
                          (annoyed)
                    No.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Good, you can buy me one.         17.


      He pushes her chair over, roughly, and sits next to her.  
      Isabella instinctively backs away from him, repulsed.

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE CELLAR - AFTERNOON (TWO MONTHS EARLIER)

      The in-hiding Isabella presses forward against the cellar 
      ceiling, trying to hear exactly what s going on above.

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE - AFTERNOON

      Up above, King Richard and Gareth stand in front of The KING 
      AND QUEEN OF VALENCIA (Isabella s parents).

      You could not cast a more lovely KING AND QUEEN of VALENCIA.  
      Who are our most beloved older actors: Alan Arkin and Sally 
      Field?  Sure, picture them.  And don t forget: they re 
      Jennifer Lawrence s mother and father.

      The King and Queen look unkempt and exhausted.  King Richard 
      paces in front of them:

                                  KING RICHARD
                    I have tried to be kind to you, have I 
                    not?

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    You pillaged our peaceful Kingdom, 
                    killed half our army--

                                  KING RICHARD
                    BUT I HAVEN T KILLED YOU!  ISN T THAT 
                    RIGHT!?  I HAVEN T KILLED YO--

      His voice cracks.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Gareth, my throat s horribly scratchy, 
                    some tea please?

                                  GARETH
                    Some tea for the King!

      A SERVANT scurries off.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (to Queen and King)
                    I m not a yeller.

                                  QUEEN OF VALENCIA
                    We beg you to show mercy to our 
                    people, good King--         18.


                                  KING RICHARD
                    Yeah yeah yeah, we ve done this.
                          (then, quietly)
                    Look, here s the thing.  My wife 
                    REALLY wants that jewel of yours.  Now 
                    I know she can sometimes come off a 
                    little... what s the word?

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    Evil.

                                  QUEEN OF VALENCIA
                    Cruel.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    No, that s not it.  It s more...

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    Sadistic?

                                  QUEEN OF VALENCIA
                    Vicious?

                                  KING RICHARD
                    You really just have to get to know 
                    her.
                          (then)
                    Anyway, why don t we do this: you tell 
                    me where the Jewel is, we pack up 
                    shop, stop all the pillaging, killing, 
                    yada yada - everyone s happy.

      The King of Valencia stands.

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    The Jewel of Valencia is priceless.

                                  KING RICHARD
                          (bored)
                    I know, I know.

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    It is the symbol of Valencia.  It has 
                    belonged not to us, but to our people, 
                    for thousands of years.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Totally understand, totally empathize, 
                    can I have it?

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    Never.

      CUE SONG:  THE JEWEL OF VALENCIA          19.


      The King and Queen of Valencia sing a lovely duet explaining 
      the deep meaning of the Jewel of Valencia to them, while King 
      Richard (on the other side) sings about how much easier his 
      marriage would be if he could just have it.

      In the end, they refuse to tell King Richard where the Jewel 
      is.

      Lyric:

      KING AND QUEEN OF VALENCIA: The Jewel to us is priceless/Part 
      of our brotherhood/Should we just hand it over/It would not 
      look very good.

      KING RICHARD: I appreciate your passion/I don t want to make 
      this worse/I swear if it would satisfy her/I d just buy the 
      Queen a purse.

      The song ends.  King Richard SIGHS.  They King and Queen of 
      Valencia will not turn the Jewel over.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    It s about to get very ugly in here.  
                    This is so not how I wanted to do 
                    this.

      THE SERVANT approaches with tea.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Ooh, thank you.

      He takes a sip.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Mmmm.  Is there lemon in there?

                                    SERVANT
                    Yes my King.  Twist of lemon.

                                  KING RICHARD
                      Delightful.  Just delightful.

      King Richard turns to Gareth.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Kill the King, make her watch.

      Gareth unsheathes his sword, steps forward, and just then we 
      hear...

                                  ISABELLA (O.S.)
                    NO!         20.


      Gareth and the King FREEZE.  They turn toward the sound of 
      the voice.

      Gareth approaches a corner of the room where he discovers, on 
      the floor...

      A TRAP DOOR.

      Gareth and The King share a confused look.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. GALAVANT S HOMETOWN TAVERN (PRESENT DAY)

      Galavant drinks and eats greedily.  Isabella watches him in 
      horror.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Mmmm.  Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.  Haven t had 
                    lamb in ages.
                          (calling out)
                    Tommy!  Another round please.  Don t 
                    worry, it s all on Princess Something-
                    Or-Other.

      Galavant turns to her.

                                  GALAVANT (CONT D)
                    Thanks again for the drink.

                                  ISABELLA
                            (correcting)
                    Drinks.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Right.  Thanks again.

      He eats.  She watches.

                                  ISABELLA
                    May I ask you something?

                                  GALAVANT
                    You keep buying, I ll chit the chat 
                    out of you.

                                  ISABELLA
                    My father used to tell stories of you.  
                    Of your skill in battle.  Of your 
                    heroism.  Of your goodness.

                                  GALAVANT
                    It s your dime, Princess, but is there 
                      a question in there somewhere?         21.


                                  ISABELLA
                    What happened to you?

      Galavant looks up.  She s looking at him, earnestly.  She 
      really wants to know.

      And there s something about her face, the Jennifer Lawrence-
      ness of that face, that makes him drop the wisecracking 
      drunkard act for a minute.

                                  GALAVANT
                    My parents were people of massive 
                      appetites.  They loved everything.  
                    They loved food.  They loved...
                          (motioning at his drink)
                    drink.
                          (then)
                    Most of all, they loved each other.  
                      Ironically, they also hated each 
                    other.  They fought, violently, every 
                    day - didn t have time for much else, 
                    in fact.  And so, at eight years old, 
                    I swore off love.  Devoted myself to 
                    doing something better with my life 
                    than wasting it on  love.   So I read.  
                    I learned languages.  I trained.  All 
                    the time other young men spent chasing 
                    girls, I spent that time bettering 
                    myself.
                          (beat)
                    But I came from a family of  lovers,  
                    and you can t fight genetics.  So, 
                    when it inevitably happened to me, 
                    when I fell...

                                  ISABELLA
                    You fell hard.

      Galavant nods.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I fell hard.

                                  ISABELLA
                    And her?

                                  GALAVANT
                    She fell softer, as it turned out.

      Isabella smiles.  A moment of connection between them.  
      Galavant, uncomfortable with any sort of connection, returns 
      to his food.         22.


                                  GALAVANT (CONT D)
                    And you?  Is there a Mr. Princess Blah-
                    Blah-Blah out there?

                                  ISABELLA
                    There was going to be.
                          (beat)
                    He s gone.  They killed him.

      Galavant looks up.  Something triggers in him - an instinct 
      to help, maybe - but he fights it.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I wish I could help you, Princess.  
                    But I m out of the damsel in distress 
                    game at the moment.  Here s some 
                    advice: keep your jewel.  Start a new 
                    life for yourself.  You ll be okay.

                                  ISABELLA
                          (quietly)
                      I listened from below as he ordered my 
                    parents to their death.  And I 
                    screamed - I couldn t help myself - 
                    God help me, I screamed.  They gave 
                    chase and I ran.  And when I escaped, 
                      I promised myself I would never hide 
                    again.  I followed my father s order: 
                     Find Galavant.  Only Galavant can 
                    save us. 
                          (then)
                    And after coming all this way, after 
                    finding you, your advice is that I 
                    should just turn a blind eye, as King 
                    Richard destroys my Kingdom and 
                    everyone I ve ever loved?
                          (then)
                    What?

      Galavant is staring right at Isabella.  There s fury in his 
      suddenly clear eyes.

                                  GALAVANT
                    Did you say King Richard?

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE - AFTERNOON (TWO MONTHS EARLIER)

      KING RICHARD watches as Gareth pulls Isabella out from the 
      trap door by her hair.

                                  KING OF VALENCIA
                    Isabella!         23.


                                  ISABELLA
                    Father!

      Gareth snatches the BURLAP BAG from Isabella s hand, tosses 
      it to King Richard.  Isabella runs to her parents, hugs them.

      King Richard pulls out the JEWEL from the bag.  Beams.  And 
      just then...

      QUEEN MADALENA peeks in.

                                  MADALENA
                    Any luck on the Jewel, Richard?

      Richard starts to turn, excited to share the news...

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Actually, my dear...

                                  MADALENA
                    I know, I know.  You re working on it.  
                    Well, why don t you stop working on 
                    it, start acting like Galavant, and do 
                    something already.

      A body blow.  King Richard slowly retracts the Jewel, hiding 
      it from his wife.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Will do, my Queen.

      Gareth looks at King Richard, surprised.  MADALENA EXITS.

      King Richard turns back towards Isabella, starts thinking.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    She s a pretty young thing, isn t she 
                    Gareth?

                                  GARETH
                    Eh.  Little plump for my taste.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    But her face.  She s got a good face, 
                    no?

                                  GARETH
                      I suppose.  But if she s that plump 
                    after hiding in a cellar for four 
                    months, imagine how plump she was four 
                    months ago.         24.


                                  KING RICHARD
                    She s pretty, Gareth!  Just say she s 
                    pretty!

                                  GARETH
                    Fine, she s pretty.

      King Richard approaches her.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    You love your parents, don t you my 
                    Dear?

                                  ISABELLA
                    Leave them be!  Leave them be or so 
                    help me God, I ll kill you myself.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    And spunky.

                                  GARETH
                    Chunky if you ask me.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Gareth, stop it!  I m trying to do 
                    something here.  God!

      He returns to evil King mode.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    I never want to hear the name Galavant 
                    again.  If we can t beat him on his 
                    turf, we will bring him to ours.  I 
                    will kill him, in front of Madalena, 
                    and then deliver her precious jewel to 
                    her.  Then we ll see if she can t find 
                    the key to her damn chastity belt!

      He turns back to Isabella.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    If you want your parents to live, you 
                    will travel to find Galavant.  Tell 
                    him you want to hire him.

                                  GARETH
                    They say he is a recluse, My King.  A 
                    drunkard.  He will never come.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Yes, he will!

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:         25.


      INT. GALAVANT S HOMETOWN TAVERN (PRESENT DAY)

      King Richard s VOICE covers the action as Isabella talks to 
      Galavant:

                                  KING RICHARD (V.O.)
                    Tell him that I, King Richard, have 
                    taken over your Kingdom.  Offer to pay 
                    him, with the Jewel.

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE (TWO MONTHS EARLIER)

      King Richard continues scheming.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    And when that doesn t work, I want you 
                    to tell him this...

      He stops.

                                  KING RICHARD (CONT D)
                    I feel like you should write this 
                    down.

                                  ISABELLA
                    I will remember it.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    It s kind of long, I d really just be 
                    more comfortable if you wrote it down.

                                  ISABELLA
                    I will remember it.

                                  KING RICHARD
                    Fine.
                          (then)
                    You tell him that King Richard...

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. GALAVANT S HOMETOWN TAVERN (PRESENT DAY)

      Isabella continues:

                                  ISABELLA
                    ... is a cruel, vicious man.  Four 
                    months, I hid in that cellar.  He and 
                    his Queen slept right above me.         26.


      Galavant grimaces at the image.  Isabella notices.

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. VALENCIA CASTLE (TWO MONTHS EARLIER)

      The King continues...

                                  KING RICHARD
                    You tell him that every night, you 
                    would listen...

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. GALAVANT S HOMETOWN TAVERN (PRESENT DAY)

      Isabella continues...

                                  ISABELLA
                    ...as he screamed at his Queen.  The 
                    most vile things.  And each night he 
                    would storm out, and I would be left 
                    with only the sobs of that poor Queen.  
                    She cried the same thing every night:

      Galavant leans in.

                                  ISABELLA (CONT D)
                    I made the wrong choice.  I m so 
                    sorry, gals.  I m so sorry.
                          (then)
                    She must have left some maidens back 
                    home, never knew what she meant:  I m 
                    so sorry, gals. 

      Silence.  Galavant looks up slowly.  Dramatically.

                                  GALAVANT
                    I m so sorry, Gal.  She was saying 
                     I m so sorry, Gal. 

      Galavant stands.  Music SWELLS.  His eyes are clear.  Our 
      hero has returned.

                                  GALAVANT (CONT D)
                    We leave tomorrow at sunrise.  Pack 
                    lightly.  There s a long journey 
                    ahead.

      Galavant storms away.  We are left with Isabella, watching 
      him go.

      Mission accomplished, but the victory slightly hollow.         27.


      RE-CUE: OPENING SONG (GALAVANT)

      During this song, we recap the story (much as we started) 
      checking in on all our players:

      - Isabella, feeling guilty back at the tavern.  She steadies 
      herself by looking at a photograph of her parents, reminding 
      herself why she s doing this.

      - The King and Queen of Valencia.  Imprisoned.  Waiting.

      - Queen Madalena, fooling around with the handsome Jester.

      - King Richard, watching as Gareth practices swordplay 
      maneuvers.  He s readying himself for Galavant.

      - And of course, Galavant.  This morning, for a change, it s 
      he who actually wakes up his squire, Sid!  They begin loading 
      up horses (with Isabella) as they embark on a hero s quest...

      Lyric:

      And so our story s started/Our hero s on his way/Heading 
      toward the trap that/Young Isabella laid.

      A long way till they get there/It s slow going by wagon/But 
      rest easy knowing next week/He puts a beat down on a dragon.
