          The town car pulls up and parks.  Jason steps out, wearing
          an expensive suit and overcoat.  He walks to the house.



          The same grin on Johnny's face as he releases Jason's
          hand.  Jason can tell Johnny experienced something.  We
          can tell Johnny is hugely relieved.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a
                        winner.

          Jason doesn't understand at first, then his eyes widen.          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT ONE - 1/17/03 WHITE      10.



          Most of the windows are darkened, but multi-colored lights
          flash from some of the windows on the first floor.  We
          can hear the dull throb of bass from inside.  

          Three GIRLS in their twenties, dressed for a night out,
          move past us and toward the main entrance.  We move down
          to reveal signage: "CLEAVES MILLS HIGH SCHOOL."



          Johnny steps out into the hallway to get some fresh air. 
          Kate steps out a beat later.

                        High school friends approaching
                        middle age and serious health
                          problems throw a party on the
                        sacred spot where they once swore
                        to never grow old. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I fail to see the irony.

                                        KATE
                        Me too.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Though now I wish we swore to
                        never have serious health problems.

          Johnny nods to his cane.  Kate smiles.

                                        KATE
                        Well, a car accident's not
                          something you can really prevent...

          An awkward beat... how did they get on this subject? 
          Kate decides to change it.

                                        KATE
                        So, I want to thank you... for
                        Jason. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        KATE
                        He told me what you saw, Johnny.

          This seems to really upset Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wasn't supposed to tell
                          anybody.

                                        KATE
                        Well, he had to tell me.  I'm the
                        reason he came to see you.

          Johnny looks at Kate, surprised and curious.



          The Ambulance drives in reverse up to an ACCIDENT SCENE -
          a FIRE TRUCK and several POLICE CARS are here.  A flipped
          over SMALL CAR has been smashed by a FORD F-150 truck. 
          In fast motion, the MET's hop out of the ambulance, open
          the back doors and drag a gurney back over to the car. 

                                                                                FLASH TO:



          We watch the accident UN-HAPPEN in SLOW MOTION - The SMALL
          CAR flips back up, GLASS flies back into the driver's
          side window as the F-150 reverses away...

          And then the vision speeds up, the F-150 darts back out
          of the intersection (we see it ran a RED LIGHT), and the
          VISION FREEZES. 

          Pan around to see JOHNNY SMITH.

          As he steps out we come around to see what he's looking
          at: The DRIVER of the SMALL CAR, about to be hit, eyes
          wide with fear...    

          Kate.

                                                                                FLASH TO:



                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        That's an unusual request, Johnny.



          In an impressive VFX shot, The F-150 slams into the
          driver's side of Kate's compact in AGONIZING SLOW MOTION.

          SHARDS OF WINDOW GLASS radiate out toward us, almost
            beautiful in the way they spread out, twinkling.  ONE
          SHARD flips super-close, filling the frame, twisting past
          us and we PAN with it to REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH, watching
          the (now-offscreen) crash in horror, as the tiny glass
          shards fly through and around his form.

          SHIFT TO NORMAL SPEED, we hear the offscreen accident
          SCREECH to a bloody halt.  Johnny continues to stare for
          a beat, then summons his courage and walks over.

    36CONTINUED:36

          We PAN with him to reveal the final resting place of both
          cars. 

          Johnny circles the frozen wreck.  Bits of glass and debris
          still hang in the air.  The HEADLIGHTS from the F-150
          still blind him, the DRIVER's face buried in an airbag. 
          The front grill is buried in the compact's caved in body.

          JOHNNY'S POV - TRUCK LICENSE PLATE

          Only half of the plate is visible, twisted and jutting
          out from crushed metal.  "488///"

          Suddenly Johnny becomes very conscious of something in
          his periphery.  He knows what it is, and is reluctant to
          see it, but also feels compelled to at the same time.

          It's Kate.  Wedged in her car, head bowed, hair matted
          with blood.  Johnny is struck by the sight.  Suddenly
          Kate's bloody face snaps up, eyes filled with surprise.

                                        KATE

                        I told you, it was a partial plate. 
                        But it's a red, Ford F-150, that's
                        gotta be enough to start...

                        I don't know, the vision wasn't
                        very clear...

                                        WALT
                        Come on, I don't buy that.  Level

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.  Please.  If you can just
                        get me a name.

          Walt hesitates as he hears a trace of desperation in
          Johnny's voice.



          BAM!  The F-150 smashes into Kate's car, minutes later.



          Johnny walks to the parking lot, on his cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can save her, Gene.  I can save
                        Kate, the visions showed me how. 
                        All I have to do is not get into
                        a fight with her tonight.



          ON SHOES walking out of a house and slamming the door. 
          The shoes walk down to a RED FORD F-150.  The door opens
          and they step into the driver's seat.

                        what we call a swinger just short
                        of his third strike.

          The door slams and we see the license plate: 4886HL.



          Moving with the front of the F-150's grill.

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                        File says he started the heavy
                          drinking after losing his job at
                        some lumber company and moving
                        back in with his Mother.  Sounds
                        like a real winner.



          Johnny stands in the empty intersection.  Hanchin's Ford
          F-150 comes speeding up to the light, which clicks red
          above Johnny. 

          The F-150 runs the red light, roaring through the
            intersection without incident.

          Johnny seems satisfied, but then the camera begins to arc
          around him, and as it does the landscape around us begins
          to shift into...



          Johnny looks around.  Why is he here?  A pneumatic HISS
          attracts his attention.  Johnny turns to see a SCHOOL BUS
          dropping off a few KIDS.  The bus is still half full.  It
          starts up and Johnny whirls around to see the FORD F-150
          bearing down on the intersection.

          PUNCH IN TO SEE PATRICK HANCHIN, a few years older, some
          hair on his face and some grey in his hair, but still
          clearly drunk, muttering along to a classic rock song
          that's BLASTING from his speakers.

          Johnny, standing in front of the slow staring bus, throws
          his hands out in front of him, useless, as the...

          JOHNNY'S POV - F-150

          Drives straight into the CAMERA.          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT FOUR - 1/17/03 WHITE     48.

          of the word "MOORE."  We pull back to reveal a HEADSTONE
          with the full inscription: "KATE MOORE (1967-2003)"

          Johnny stands alone by her grave site.  Tons of flowers
          are still set around, remnants of the funeral and visits
          from other mourners. 

          Johnny looks up to see a figure approaching from afar. 
          It's Jason, wearing casual clothes.  Johnny doesn't move,
          looking down as Jason walks up.

          They stand in silence for a long beat.

                                        JASON
                          Sarah... told me you'd be here.

          Johnny nods.

                        She read to me, what you said at
                        the funeral.  Your eulogy...

          Johnny, unable to hold it in, cuts him off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I knew.

                                (beat)
                        I realized that after... you
                        must've seen this from the
                        beginning.  I try to imagine what
                        that must have felt like...

                        I tried to stop it.  I tried to
                        save her.  Believe me, Jason, I

                        Don't.  I know, Johnny.  I know

                        He talked to you?

          Johnny turns around, angry with Purdy's interference,
          even if it was on his behalf.

                                        JASON
                        Don't be mad, he did a good thing. 
                        He explained what happened, and I
                        needed that.  Because after the
                        doctor told me it was Kate who...
                          I wanted to die.

          Johnny turns to Jason, looks him in the eye.

                                        JASON
                        Then I thought, how selfish that
                        would be, and that's when I decided
                        that I'm gonna change.  I have to
                        change.  For Erin.  For Kate.

          All Johnny can do is nod.
